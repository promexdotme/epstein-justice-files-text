Subject: Inmate Epstein, J. 76318054 - Notify Psychology ASAP when he returns from court 
TEXT.htm 
I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk 
assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he retum from court and psychology is 
gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is 
suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in 
court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be 
proactive. 
"This writer consulted with Dr. 
, Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein 
has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense 
charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news 
regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein retums from court, R&D staff as well as 
Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after 
duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place 
inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment." 
Thank you, Dr.

FROM: The Office of the General Counsel, Federal Bureau of Prisons 
Supervisory CLC Attorney EMAIL: 
ADDRESS: 
New York 
NEW YORK NY 10007 RE: Obligation to Preserve Records and Electronically Stored 
Information in INMATE DEATH, LHN-CIV-2019-00204 
The BOP and its employees are required to preserve any potentially relevant 
information pertaining to 
EFTA00035035
--- PAGE 2 ---
On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 6:30 am, EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, reg. no. 76318-
054, was found unresponsive in his cell in conjunction with an apparent suicide, 
and, subsequently, pronounced dead at the local hospital. No lawsuit has been filed 
yet, but one is anticipated. 
In this case, relevant information includes, but is not limited to: 
Please preserve all electronic files (e.g. emails, Word documents, TRUSCOPE 
entries, videos, BEMR records) and all handwritten or other physical documents 
pertaining to inmate Epstein. 
You have been identified as an individual likely to have information relevant to 
this matter. Therefore, you must take appropriate steps to preserve any such 
information in your possession, custody, or control even if it otherwise would be 
destroyed, deleted or overwritten, in the normal course of Agency operations. 
Knowingly altering, editing, or deleting potentially relevant information could 
result in court-ordered sanctions against the BOP and/or employment action 
against staff. 
Electronically stored information (ESI) includes all information stored in any 
digital medium, including the BOPA's computer network, any PCs, laptop computers, 
all back-up media, email, calendars, word processing documents, scanned documents, 
spreadsheets, photos and drafts. 
DO NOT DISCARD OR DESTROY ANY RECORDS (ELECTRONICALLY STORED OR OTHERWISE) 
RELATING TO THIS MATTER. 
Action Required: 
1. Complete the attached Custodian Document Search Checklist and return to 
by 08/21/2019. 
2. Preserve Relevant Information 
a. Do not alter, edit, delete, or otherwise destroy potentially relevant 
information in either paper or digital documents. All auto-deletion 
functions should be turned off and any retention policy should be 
suspended if execution would cause the loss of potentially relevant 
information. Do not move or alter electronic documents as this will 
modify the metadata. Should you need to work on a relevant document, 
please save it as a new version and edit the new version. 
b. Do not transfer any potentially relevant information to a 
Federal Records Center (FRC) or any other location. 
c. Notify me of any potentially relevant information that is in the 
process of being or has been sent to an offsite storage facility 
(FRC or any other offsite facility). 
3. Contact me if there are any staffing changes in your office that affect 
this matter (e.g., retirement, transfer, etc.). 
4. If you are aware of the loss of any potentially relevant ESI, notify me 
immediately. 
5. This document is privileged and confidential. 
DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE THIS NOTICE WITH ANYONE.

Good Morning: 
I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmates meals be delivered from the 
housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference? 
Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every hour without 
being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate? 
Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other inmates who are in 
attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch which is sent up from food service 
every morning. 
Please provide a response.

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I 
had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact 
with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was 
asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He 
wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch 
area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with 
his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE 
METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER 
FROM: 
=NS 
SUBJECT: 
Inmate Epstein, Jeffery Reg. No. 76318-054 
This memorandum is in regards of inmate Epstein, Jeffery Reg. No. 76318-054. On 
August 9, 2019, I spoke with inmate Epstein concerning him making a call to his family. I told 
inmate Epstein I was leaving the facility around 7:00 p.m. Inmate Epstein agreed to shorten his 
attorney visitation to make his social call. I escorted inmate Epstein to Special Housing Unit 
around 7:00 p.m. I placed inmate Epstein in the shower on (G) Tier and escorted the phone for 
him to make a social call. I placed the phone in the first jack to the left on G tier. Inmate Epstein 
explain to me that he didn't have his phone set up to use his Pac and Pin number. I asked inmate 
Epstein who he was calling, he stated his mother. I remember dialing a number starting with 347, 
but the number was note notated. Inmate Epstein began talking on the phone. I told the staff to 
end inmate Epstein's call after 15 minutes. They complied.

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had gone to 
visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report 
any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general 
population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a 
speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were 
no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

FROM: 
SUBJECT: 
Inmate Epstein, Jeffery Reg. No. 76318-054 
This memorandum is in regards of inmate Epstein, Jeffery Reg. No. 76318-054. On 
August 9, 2019, I spoke with inmate Epstein concerning him making a call to his family. I told 
inmate Epstein I was leaving the facility around 7:00 p.m. Inmate Epstein agreed to shorten his 
attorney visitation to make his social call. I escorted inmate Epstein to Special Housing Unit 
around 7:00 p.m. I placed inmate Epstein in the shower on (G) Tier and escorted the phone for 
him to make a social call. I placed the phone in the first jack to the left on G tier. Inmate Epstein 
explain to me that he didn't have his phone set up to use his Pac and Pin number. I asked inmate 
Epstein who he was calling, he stated his mother. I remember dialing a number starting with 347, 
but the number was note notated. Inmate Epstein began talking on the phone. I told the staff to 
end inmate Epstein's call after 15 minutes. They complied.

As I was doing the 10:00 PM count, I notice this inmate distraught sad and a little confused. I asked him if he was ok? he 
said, "that he's ok." but I am not convinced because he seems dazed and withdrawn. So just to be on the safe side 
and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from Psychology come and talk with him. I don't know the inmate register 
number because he is new, he is currently on 5 North. I don't know who did his in take, so I am not familiar with

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said yesterday he 
only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and dinner. 
Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that 
again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been urinating in a cup. I already sent an e-mail to

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse 
saw him. 
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has 
numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse 
He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the 
toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

NEW YORK NY 10007 RE: Obligation to Preserve Records and Electronically Stored 
Information in INMATE DEATH, LHN-CIV-2019-00204 
The BOP and its employees are required to preserve any potentially relevant 
information pertaining to 
EFTA00035286
--- PAGE 2 ---
On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 6:30 am, EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, reg. no. 76318-
054, was found unresponsive in his cell in conjunction with an apparent suicide, 
and, subsequently, pronounced dead at the local hospital. No lawsuit has been filed 
yet, but one is anticipated. 
In this case, relevant information includes, but is not limited to: 
Please preserve all electronic files (e.g. emails, Word documents, TRUSCOPE 
entries, videos, BEMR records) and all handwritten or other physical documents 
pertaining to inmate Epstein. 
You have been identified as an individual likely to have information relevant to 
this matter. Therefore, you must take appropriate steps to preserve any such 
information in your possession, custody, or control even if it otherwise would be 
destroyed, deleted or overwritten, in the normal course of Agency operations. 
Knowingly altering, editing, or deleting potentially relevant information could 
result in court-ordered sanctions against the BOP and/or employment action 
against staff. 
Electronically stored information (ESI) includes all information stored in any 
digital medium, including the BOPA's computer network, any PCs, laptop computers, 
all back-up media, email, calendars, word processing documents, scanned documents, 
spreadsheets, photos and drafts. 
DO NOT DISCARD OR DESTROY ANY RECORDS (ELECTRONICALLY STORED OR OTHERWISE) 
RELATING TO THIS MATTER. 
Action Required: 
1. Complete the attached Custodian Document Search Checklist and return to 
by 08/21/2019. 
2. Preserve Relevant Information 
a. Do not alter, edit, delete, or otherwise destroy potentially relevant 
information in either paper or digital documents. All auto-deletion 
functions should be turned off and any retention policy should be 
suspended if execution would cause the loss of potentially relevant 
information. Do not move or alter electronic documents as this will 
modify the metadata. Should you need to work on a relevant document, 
please save it as a new version and edit the new version. 
b. Do not transfer any potentially relevant information to a 
Federal Records Center (FRC) or any other location. 
c. Notify me of any potentially relevant information that is in the 
process of being or has been sent to an offsite storage facility 
(FRC or any other offsite facility). 
3. Contact me if there are any staffing changes in your office that affect 
this matter (e.g., retirement, transfer, etc.). 
4. If you are aware of the loss of any potentially relevant ESI, notify me 
immediately. 
5. This document is privileged and confidential. 
DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE THIS NOTICE WITH ANYONE.

I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. Ill be coming in tomorrow before his Legal 
visit to see him again. 
He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom 
breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because 
of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

Institution 
Supplement 
U.S. Dbtment of Justice 
Federal Bureau of Prisons 
Afetropolaan Correctional Center 
New York NY 10007 
OPI: 
NUMBER: 
DATE: 
SUBJECT: 
HSA 
NYM 6031.01C 
April 10, 2007 
Detoxification and Treatment 
Programs 
1. 
PURPOSE: To establish procedures to ensure the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, is in 
compliance with federal regulations for methadone detoxification and detoxification from other abuse 
substances, i.e., opiates, alcohol, and narcotics. 
2. 
REFERENCE: Program Statement 6031.01, Health Services Manual, dated January 15, 2005, Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulatory controls relating to registration, security and record 
keeping of institutions having a narcotic treatment program. Institutional Supplement 6501.5(A), is 
rescinded. 
3. 
INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Director will establish guidelines for evaluation and treatment of 
inmates who require detoxification from mood and mind altering substances such as alcohol, opiates, 
hypnotics, sedatives, etc. 
The guidelines will include specific detoxification protocols to be implemented upon order of medical 
staff. Treatment and supportive measures will permit withdrawal with minimal physiological and 
physical discomfort. 
Metropolitan Correctional Centers, Metropolitan Detention Centers, Federal Transportation Centers and 
jail units may provide methadone detoxification if clinically indicated. This program requires special 
registration. If an institution has a methadone detoxification program then the institution Chief 
Pharmacist will complete and maintain registration for a methadone program. Methadone is permitted to 
be administered or dispensed only for detoxification or temporary treatment of patients. If Methadone is 
administered for treatment of heroin dependence, for more than three weeks, the procedure passes from 
treatment of the acute withdrawal syndrome (detoxification) to a maintenance program. 
This institution has the authority to conduct only a detoxification program by the Food and Drug 
Administration and has been assigned an identification number. Detoxification suppresses major 
physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Each inmate possibly needing 
detoxification will be evaluated by the physician for an appropriate detoxification schedule. 
4. 
DEFINITIONS:
A. 
The following are the definitions of terminology used in discussing detoxification: 
EFTA00035317
--- PAGE 2 ---
1. 
DRUG - A chemical compound or biological substance producing a physiologic effect 
when taken internally. 
2. 
ABUSE OR DRUG ABUSE - The use of a drug for non-medical reasons. Typically this 
use is to satisfy an addiction or habituation or for altering ones perception. 
3. 
ADDICTION - physical dependency on a drug with a characteristic withdrawal or 
abstinence syndrome, leading to chronic use, including narcotics, barbiturates, etc. 
4. 
HABITUATION - Psychologic dependency on a drug leading to chronic use. 
5. 
NARCOTIC - A natural or synthetic opiate drug for pain relief which in increasingly 
larger doses produces dependency. Also, an addictive group of drugs including heroin, 
morphine, methadone, etc. 
6. 
ALCOHOL - Ethyl alcohol in water solution. 
5. 
PROGRAM PARTICIPATION:. Inmates on detoxification will not be hospitalized unless deemed 
necessary by medical staff. The medication will be administered on the units by medical staff. The 
physician is to determine the need based on the history, clinical findings, and verification of any 
Methadone Maintenance Program the inmate may have been enrolled in. The physician must document 
this information on the chronological record of medical care. 
6. 
CLASSIFICATIONS: 
A. 
At this facility the classification for treatment includes: 
1. 
All inmates committed with a history of alcohol use or physical findings indicating 
dependency. 
2. 
All inmates committed with a history of drug use or physical findings indicating 
dependency. 
3. 
All inmates discovered to be drug or alcohol dependent during the course of their 
incarceration. 
7. 
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES: 
A. 
Subjective: 
Subjective withdrawal complaints - presence or absence of: bone and muscle pain, nausea and/or 
vomiting (subjective if not observed), diarrhea. 
B. 
Objective: 
EFTA00035318
--- PAGE 3 ---
1. 
Pulse, blood pressure, temperature; 
2. 
Presence or absence of: Yawning, restlessness, lacrimation, dilated pupils, hyperactive 
bowel sounds, skin - goose flesh, sweating, jaundice, tracks; 
3. 
Liver size and presence or absence of tenderness 
4. 
Verify patient participation in a MMTP. (Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program). 
5. 
Urinary Dip Stick screening test for Opiates and Methadone 
6. 
Order RPR test for Syphillis screening 
C. 
Assessment: 
1. 
It is the responsibility of all medical staff to identify all inmates who are or may be drug 
dependent by taking a thorough medical history, including a drug history and the 
performance of a complete physical examination as a part of the inmate intake screening 
process. 
2. 
Inmates diagnosed as having either alcohol or drug dependency should be enrolled in the 
following protocol at this facility. 
a. 
Be seen by the medical doctor as soon as possible for determination of: 
1. 
Diagnosis 
2. 
Medical orders including pharmacologic support if deemed necessary. 
3. 
Special precautions to ensure inmate and staff security. 
3. 
After an inmate has been evaluated for methadone detoxification, he or she may be: 
a. 
Only observed because history and physical do not support the need for 
detoxification. These patients will have: 
1. 
Poor history for drug use/withdrawal; 
2. 
No subjective findings; 
3. 
No tracks; or 
4. 
The inmate decides he or she does not want detoxification. 
b. 
Placed on continued observation because subjective and objective findings 
suggest that, though unlikely, it is possible that the inmate will undergo 
withdrawal. Because the length of time between arrest and evaluation for 
methadone detoxification can be in excess of 48 hours, inmates may often fail to 
exhibit the objective signs of opiate withdrawal. The subjective component of the 
opiate withdrawal syndrome, however, persists for up to ten days. Inmates who 
have a history of drug addiction, have evidence of recent drug use (old/new 
tracks), and complain of the subjective symptoms should not be placed on 
EFTA00035319
--- PAGE 4 ---
c. 
d. 
continued observation, but should be placed on the 
Program. 
Placed on 7-Day Detoxification because subjective 
consistent with acute withdrawal (see above). 
Methadone Detoxification 
and/or objective findings are 
Placed on 21 -Day Detoxification schedule because the inmate was on a verified 
MMTP•. If the program cannot be verified at the time of evaluation, the inmate 
will be started on 7-Day Detoxification whether or not he or she shows drug 
withdrawal signs. When the program is confirmed, the inmate should be 
reexamined and seen by the Clinical Director to determine whether or not he or 
she should be continued on the 7-Day schedule. 
7-DAY PROGRAM 
Day 1= 20 mg. 
Day 2= 20 mg. 
Day 3= 20 mg. 
Day 4= 20 mg. 
Day 5= 10 mg.

EFTA00035320
--- PAGE 5 ---
D. 
PLAN 
1. 
For inmates who decide they do not want detoxification, a refusal for treatment form must 
be signed. 
2. 
For inmates who will receive methadone (seven or 21 day schedules): 
a. 
Record the information on which the decision was made on the progress note or 
intake physical form. If the inmate is on a MMTP and automatically gets 
methadone, this should also be recorded on the progress note or intake form. 
b. 
Write and sign the order for a methadone 7 or 21-day schedule, whichever is 
applicable, on the medication order sheet (duplicate form). All mid-level 
practitioner orders must be countersigned by a physician prior to administration 
(or a physician telephone order taken). 
c. 
All methadone patients should be given their first dose at the time of intake. Fill 
out the 7-day form and indicate date and time given as day one. If given on the 
next date as a day two. If patient is verified on MMTP, the 2I -day schedule 
should begin. 
d. 
If a patient is a late court return, stat medications should be administered. 
e. 
If a patient is verified on a MMTP dosage lower than our 21-day schedule (less 
than 40 mg) the lower dosage should be maintained until the next scheduled 
change, e.g., patient maintained on 30 mg. An order should be written to start 
methadone 21-day detoxification on 30 mg. All higher doses on the 
Administration Record should be crossed-out and replaced with "30 mg." It still 
remains a 21-day detoxification schedule. 
f. 
There are patients who have been on very long term MMTP programs. These 
patients should be evaluated by the Clinical Director or detoxification specialist 
for determination of possibly lengthening the detoxification process on an 
individualized basis. 
g. 
Make appointment for the patient to see a psychologist for counseling. 
h. 
If a patient is on methadone detoxification (7 or 21-day) and confirmation of 
pregnancy is established by both urine and gynecological examination, the patient 
has the option to either detoxify or be maintained on a dosage level to be 
determined by the Clinical Director until completion of pregnancy and/or 
discharge. 
I. 
If patient is discharged during the course of pregnancy, a psychologist should be 
called to help counseling. 
It should be explained to the patient that pregnant opiate users are to be 
maintained on low doses of methadone after the first trimester. Detoxification can 
possibly cause damage to the fetus. 
EFTA00035321
--- PAGE 6 ---
k. 
Patients must sign a consent form for methadone. If the patient is past the first 
trimester and refuses methadone, a Refusal of Treatment Form must be signed. 
1. 
All patients who have histories of drug abuse, even if not placed on a 
detoxification program, should be encouraged to have a counseling session 
regarding realistic plans post discharge and/or to seek supportive counseling. The 
psychology staff is available for counseling. If not available in the building they 
can be consulted by telephone for suggestions. In addition, they should be 
consulted when difficulties arise in determining addiction status. 
m. 
In the case of delirium tremens, barbiturate or ethyl alcohol withdrawal or severe 
opiate, withdrawal when the medical doctor is not present in the facility, the 
doctor on call is to be contacted by the ranking medical officer on duty for 
instructions. 
n. 
A list of all inmates currently undergoing detoxification will be maintained and 
updated by the Clinical Director. 
o. 
If the physician feels that the inmate is unable to receive proper care for 
detoxification at this facility, the inmate may be considered and processed for 
transfer in accordance with current Health Services Manual policy. 
Inmates on detoxification will not be approved for transfer without notifying the 
Clinical Director. 
q. 
Only physicians properly registered with the DEA will prescribe methadone at this 
facility. Under no circumstance will mid-level practitioners prescribe methadone. 
r. 
Inmates will not be transferred prior to completion of the detoxification treatment, 
unless it is to another BOP facility which has a detoxification program. 
11. 
RESPONSIBILITY; The Health Services Administrator and Clinical Director are assigned the 
responsibility of enforcing regulations pertaining to the Methadone Detoxification Program. 
The Health Services Administrator will establish the policies to assure compliance with the Federal 
Regulations. 
12. 
EFFECTIVE DATE: This Supplement is effective upon issuance.

Suicide Prevention Program 
U.S. Department of Justice 
Federal Bureau of Prisons 
Metropolitan Correctional Center 
New York, NY 10007 
Institution Supplement 
OPI: 
Psychology Department 
NUMBER: NYM5324.08d 
DATE: 
May 2I , 2013 
SUBJECT: Suicide Prevention Program 
1. 
PURPOSE: The prevention of self-destructive behavior is an essential component in the care, custody, 
and control of the inmate population. The procedures outlined below will be implemented to avert the 
loss of life, and to diminish the potential for further suicidal behavior. 
The stress associated with incarceration, as well as unpredictable stressful events, can result in the 
motivation to commit suicide. Early identification of self-destructive potential in conjunction with 
appropriate physical and mental health interventions and coordinated follow-up can reduce the 
likelihood of injury, fatality, and further self-destructive behavior. 
2. 
DIRECTIVES AFFECTED: 
Directive Referenced: 
P.S. 5324.08 Suicide Prevention Program. dated April 5, 2007. 
Directive Rescinded: 
NYM 5324.05c, Suicide Prevention Program, dated December I. 2006. 
3. 
RESPONSIBILITIES: The Chief Psychologist or his/her designee is designated as the Suicide 
Prevention Program Coordinator. 
4. 
PROCEDURES: 
A. REFERRAL: All staff shall immediately refer potentially suicidal inmates to Psychology 
Services for evaluation. During non-regular working hours, the inmate will be referred to the 
Operations Lieutenant and the Physician's Assistant on duty. Should the Physician's Assistant 
determine that the inmate is at serious risk for inflicting self-harm, he/she will inform the 
EFTA00035323
--- PAGE 2 ---
ca. 
NYM.5324.08d 
Suicide Prevention Program 
Operations Lieutenant, who in turn, will contact the On-Call Psychologist who will determine if 
a suicide watch will be initiated. However, in an emergency situation if a Physician's Assistant 
is not available, any staff member can initiate a suicide watch. The Operations Lieutenant should 
immediately be contacted, who will then immediately contact the On-Call Psychologist. 
I 
Psychology Services Inmate Questionnaire (PSIQ): This form (attachment 1) will be distributed in 
Receiving and Discharge during the intake screening process. Staff (Medical, Psychology, or 
Lieutenants) conducting the psychosocial interview will review the PSIQ for completion, check the 
inmate's response to item #7, i.e., "Are you considering suicide now?" and sign his/her name next to item 
#7. 
Outside of regular working hours and in the absence of any Psychologist at the institution, without 
exception, all inmates endorsing item #7 (current suicidal thoughts) or appearing to be potentially 
suicidal as determined by the staff member conducting the psychosocial interview, will be placed 
on suicide watch, pending direct interview by a Psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant will be 
contacted immediately and he/she will in turn notify the Psychologist as soon as possible about the new 
suicide watch. In the rare case the On-Call psychologist cannot be reached promptly, reasonable efforts 
should be made to contact another Psychologist. If there is a mid-level provider or Physician Assistant 
at the institution during non-routine hours, he/she will be called for further evaluation if the inmate 
endorses item #7, appears highly emotionally distressed, and/or displays unusual behavior (e.g., crying, 
shaking, talking to himself, paranoid, etc.). 
During routine working hours, the "duty psychologist" will be called immediately by radio for further 
evaluation of any inmate who endorses item #7, appears highly emotionally distressed, and/or displays 
unusual behavior. Referred inmates should be kept under direct observation of staff  until the 
Psychologist arrives. 
B. MAINTENANCE: When a suicide watch is initiated, the suicidal inmate will be placed under 
continuous visual observation. The following maintenance procedures will be followed: 
When there is an inmate in the institution placed on a suicide watch, the suicide 
watch will be in the 2nd floor suicide prevention area and conducted by inmate 
companions, unless staff are required for the suicide watch. If staff are used for the 
suicide watch, there are Post Orders explaining the suicide watch procedures in 
detail that must be signed by all staff before they assume this post. 
Inmate 
companions may only watch suicidal inmates of the same gender. The Unit 2 
Officer is responsible for making rounds and signing the suicide watch log every 
hour. 
FXCEPTIONS; The following exceptions to the above procedures will apply:

I 
NYM.5324.08d 
Suicide Prevention Prognun 
1. 
All Unit 3 inmates placed on a suicide watch will be observed only on Unit 3 
(cell C02-313) by Unit 3 inmate companions or staff only. 
2. 
If a suicide watch is being conducted in the 2nd floor suicide prevention area, 
an inmate of the opposite gender will not be placed on suicide watch in the 2nd 
floor suicide prevention area. The suicide watch with an inmate of the opposite 
gender will be conducted in an alternate location. See #3 below for the alternate 
locations. Therefore, if there is a male inmate on suicide watch in the suicide 
prevention area and a female inmate suicide watch is initiated, the female 
inmate will be placed on Unit 2 (cell B01-211) with a female inmate 
companion. If there are two female inmates on suicide watch in the suicide 
prevention area and a male inmate suicide watch is initiated, the male inmate 
will be placed on 9 South (Z03-965, H tier, Hard cells #1, #2) on suicide watch 
with a staff member watching the inmate. 
3. 
A suicide watch room waiver has been approved for alternate suicide watch 
rooms when needed other than the 2 suicide watch rooms in the suicide 
prevention area. They are as follows: Unit 2 (cell B01-211), Unit 3 (cell C02-
313), 9 South (cell Z03-965), and 10 South Lower — H tier (Hard cells #1 and 
#2). 
C. 
OPERATIONAL
1. 
Suicide Watch Requirements: Before placing a suicidal inmate in a suicide watch 
room, the room will be thoroughly inspected and the inmate will be strip-searched to 
ensure that he/she does not have access to any items which could be used to injure 
him/herself or others. Normally potentially suicidal inmates will be required to wear a 
suicide watch gown. Unless otherwise specified by the Program Coordinator or her 
designee, the inmate will be allowed a suicide watch blanket. The inmate will never be 
allowed razors, shoelaces, belts, sheets, metal cans, or other sharp objects. In the 
suicide watch log book, there will be a list specifying items that the inmate may be 
allowed in the suicide watch room, as well as any special instructions for the 
management of the inmate on watch. 
2. 
Monitoring and Psychological Interviews of Inmates on Suicide Watch: All 
inmates on Suicide Watch must be observed directly by staff or inmate companions at 
ALL TIMES. If inmate companions need to be removed from their Suicide Watch 
posts for any reason, a staff member will immediately assume the Suicide Watch post in 
order to continue direct observation of the inmate in the suicide watch cell. It is a fact, 
as reiterated by national policy; it takes only three to four minutes for many suicide 
deaths to occur. A Psychologist will interview the inmate on suicide watch daily, 
EFTA00035325
--- PAGE 4 ---
o 
NYM.5324.08d 
Suicide Prevention Program 
including weekends and holidays, and record clinical notes on the Psychology Data 
System (PDS) following each visit. 
3. 
Documentation of Observations of Inmates on Suicide Watch: Observations of the 
inmate's behavior will be documented in a Suicide Watch Log Book, which will be 
maintained as a secure document. As stated by the Suicide Prevention Program 
Statement, staff and inmate observers will document in separate log books. Post Orders 
will provide direction to staff on requirements for documentation (e.g., entering log 
entries at least every 15 minutes). 
4. 
Meats: Inmates on suicide watch will be fed sack meals to prevent their access to hard, 
breakable objects, hard containers, and plastic wrappings. 
5. 
Showers: Showers are allowed for inmates on suicide watch unless specific mental 
health or security concerns are identified by Psychology Services or Correctional 
Services. The Operations Lieutenant will be responsible for supervising and 
coordinating showering procedures. Any showering restrictions, due to security 
concerns, must be directly conveyed to the Operations Lieutenant. Receipt of such 
instructions will be noted in the Suicide Watch Log Book. 
6. 
Searches of Suicide Watch Cells: At a minimum, suicide watch cells will be searched 
once a day, to extract any contraband, items not allowed in the cell, and/or accumulated 
trash. This search will normally be conducted by the Unit Officer during Day Watch, 
supervised by the Operations Lieutenant or designee. The Unit Officer will also search 
the suicide watch cell when the inmate exits the cell to take a shower. 
7. 
Telephone Use: Inmates on suicide watch will not normally be permitted phone calls. 
Very seldom, phone calls may be recommended by Psychology Services staff as these 
phone calls may be deemed potentially beneficial to the inmate's mental health and/or 
may expedite recovery, and do not pose an increased risk for self-harm or harm to 
others. These rare exceptions must be approved by the Captain as well by the Associate 
Warden of Programs. Non-psychology staff recommending phone calls shall consult 
with Psychology Services staff, who if in agreement, will initiate proper procedures. 
8. 
Visits and Recreation: Normally, neither recreation nor visitation (either social or 
legal) are permitted for inmates on suicide watch. Occasionally, visits may be 
recommended by Psychology Services staff, as these visits may be deemed potentially 
beneficial to the inmate's mental health and/or may expedite recovery, and do not pose 
an increased risk for self-harm or harm to others. These rare exceptions must be 
approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Wardens of Programs. 
EFTA00035326

NYM.5324.084 
Suicide Prevention Program 
9. 
Emergency Medical Trips: Emergency medical trips will be the responsibility of the 
Operations Lieutenant. 
10. 
Court Trips: Court trips do not require approval from a Psychologist. Therefore, 
ordinarily, all inmates on suicide watch scheduled to go to court must be escorted to 
R&D to go to court. It will be the Operations Lieutenant's responsibility to notify the 
U.S. Marshals Service of any inmate on suicide watch who is scheduled to go to court. 
Any exceptions regarding inmates on suicide watch who are not permitted to go to court 
(i.e., actively suicidal and/or acutely psychotic), will be stated in writing by Psychology 
Services and/or Correctional Services. Every inmate who departs for court on suicide 
watch must be placed back on suicide watch upon returning to the institution, pending 
re-evaluation by a Psychologist. 
11. 
Escorting Procedures for Inmates on Suicide Watch: All inmates on suicide watch 
will be restrained when moved out of the suicide watch cell for showering, medical 
visits, court appearances, or legal visits. The level or type of restraints will be 
determined by Correctional Services. 
12. 
Termination of Suicide Watches: Once an inmate has been placed on suicide watch, 
the watch may not be terminated, under any circumstance, without a Psychologist 
performing a face-to-face evaluation. Upon termination of a suicide watch, the 
Psychologist will provide the Operations Lieutenant with a memorandum documenting 
the ending of the watch and requesting removal of the inmate from the watch cell. 
13. 
Housing Procedures for Inmates Discharged from Suicide Watch. All inmates 
discharged from suicide watch to a general population unit or the Special Housing Unit 
will be assigned a cellmate. If security and/or safety concerns preclude cellmate 
assignment, the Associate Warden of Programs will be contacted by the staff member 
recommending against cellmate assignment. 
The above procedures are to be strictly adhered to. Any deviation from established 
procedures must first be approved by the Associate Warden Operations and/or Programs. 
D. 
INMATE COMPANIQNS: The Program Coordinator will be responsible for the selection, 
training, assignment and removal of individual inmate companions. The following guidelines 
will be required for the use of inmate companions: 
1. 
Male volunteers will be recruited from the sentenced inmates designated to Unit 5S 
and, if needed, pretrial/holdover inmates without separatees from 5 North. Male 
volunteers for the suicide watches on Unit 3 will be recruited from the Unit 3 inmates. 
Female volunteers will be recruited from inmates on Unit 2. All volunteers must be 
approved in advance by the Program Coordinator, who will consult with Unit 2, Unit 3, 
Unit 5S and Unit 5N Unit Managers. 
EFTA00035327
--- PAGE 6 ---
NYM.5324.08d 
Suicide Prevention Program 
I 
I I
2. 
There will be one inmate companion designated as the Inmate Coordinator on Unit 5S 
and one designated as an Alternate Inmate Coordinator, either on Unit 5S or Unit 5N. 
There will be one inmate companion designated as the Inmate Coordinator on Unit 2. 
The Inmate Coordinator is responsible for maintaining a current schedule of round-the-
clock inmate companion assignments. Daily changes and additions will be maintained 
by the Inmate Coordinator. On Unit 3 there will be only 6 inmate companions and each 
one will be assigned a permanent 4-hour shift. The Inmate Companion schedule will be 
available to the Operations Lieutenant and the Unit 5S, Unit 5N, Unit 3, and Unit 2 
Officers at all times. 
3. 
Once a suicide watch has been initiated, the Operations Lieutenant will contact the Unit 
5S, Unit 3, or Unit 2 Officer/Unit Staff to inform them that inmate companions will be 
used. The Inmate Coordinator will then be notified by the Unit Officer and told to 
inform all inmate companions of their assigned shifts for the next 24 hours. The Inmate 
Coordinator will then maintain round-the-clock assignments of inmate companions for 
as long as the suicide watch remains in effect. If an inmate companion refuses to work 
or cannot work his/her shift because of illness, the Inmate Coordinator is responsible 
for providing a replacement. If the Inmate Coordinator does not fulfill his/her 
responsibility in assigning inmate companions, the Operations Lieutenant will make the 
assignments. 
4. 
Inmate companions will receive one dollar for each hour they monitor a suicide watch 
and forty cents for each hour they attend training classes. Payment will be made on a 
monthly basis. Hours worked and training sessions attended will be recorded by the 
Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator. 
5. 
Inmate companions will be required to work their regular 8-hour work details in 
addition to their 4-hour suicide watch shift. Whenever possible, inmate companions 
will not be scheduled for a suicide watch during their regular work details. If unusual 
circumstances result in a conflict between an inmate companion's suicide watch and his 
work detail, then Unit 5S, Unit 5N or Unit 2 Officer will notify the Detail Supervisor of 
the reason for the inmate's absence. 
E. 
STAFF TRAINING: The Program Coordinator will ensure that all staff will be trained by 
psychology services personnel to recognize signs indicative of a potential suicide, the appropriate 
referral process, and suicide prevention techniques. At a minimum, this will occur during 
Annual Training. 
1. 
Supplemental Specialty Training - Further training with regard to suicide prevention 
will ordinarily be conducted with Health Services staff, Lieutenants, and Connectional 
Counselors approximately six months after Annual Training. 
EFTA00035328
--- PAGE 7 ---
NYM.5324.08d 
Suicide Prevention Program 
Supplemental Training for SHU Staff - Information about recognizing potentially 
suicidal inmates and procedures to follow will be included in the SHU post orders with 
a separate signature sheet. 
Emergency Response Training - As indicated by the Suicide Prevention Program 
Statement, the Captain and the Chief Psychologist will conduct three joint mock 
exercises yearly, one on each shift, approximately four months apart. At least one of 
these exercises will take place in the SHU during the evening or morning watch. 
Ordinarily, this exercise will be coordinated between the Captain, and/or Emergency 
Preparedness Officer and the Chief Psychologist.

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
MEMORANDUM 
Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York 
DATE: 
April I 
TO: 
arden, MCC New York 
FROM: 
'hief Psyc ologi , 
CC New York 
THRU: 
ssociate Warden, Programs, MCC New York 
SUBJECT: 
RESUBMITTAL OF PROCEDURAL MEMORANDUM FOR 
PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION 
The original Procedural memorandum for Psychological Observation was initially submitted on July 20, 
2005 to the Warden and through the Associate Warden of Programs. The procedures outlined below 
have been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmitted as revisions 
have been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary. 
I. 
PURPOSE: 
To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), 
New York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status. 
2. 
DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a 
mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental 
status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate 
is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general 
population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). 
Inmates placed on psychological 
observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal 
(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to 
his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, 
disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. 
Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until 
such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in 
general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an 
inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
3. 
PROCEDURES: The following are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation: 
A. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an 
inmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an 
inmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological 
Observation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff 
(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food 
Service Administrator, and Duty Officer. 
B. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not 
feasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The 
inmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a 
EFTA00035330
--- PAGE 2 ---
.06 
staff member. 
C. An inmate on Psychological Observation status is allowed only items indicated by a 
Psychologist. These items will be indicated on the inmate's psychological observation log 
book. 
The suicide watch mattress and suicide watch blanket will be used for all inmates on 
psychological observation. 
D. Log entries as to the behavior of the observed inmate will ideally be made every 15 
minutes in a marble log book by the Inmate Companion or staff member, but observation of 
the inmate is continuous. 
E. When the observation is conducted in the suicide watch room, the Unit 2 Officer will 
make hourly rounds and sign the log book. 
F. A Lieutenant and Physician Assistant will also make rounds once a shift and sign the log 
book. 
G. On a daily basis a Psychologist will assess the inmate on Psychological Observation and 
sign the log book. 
H. If there is a staff watch being conducted on 9S. the staff member cannot watch more than 
Mo inmates on psychological observation at a time. If the Staff member is watching two 
inmates on psychological observation, they must be directly next to one another so that the 
officer can directly observe both of them on a continuous basis.

He said his cellmate is up all night talking which keeps him awake. When I offered to request a new cellmate for him, he 
stated he will try staying with his current cellmate 3 to 4 more days and will let staff know if it is getting too difficult.

I am writing in regards to your August 12, 2019 inquiry whether the investigations referenced in my 
August 10, 2019 letter will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 
2019. 
I can confirm that, although an internal investigation was completed regarding the July 23, 2019 
incident, the current investigations by the FBI and OIG will include this incident as well. 
Accordingly, I cannot divulge any information about the prior investigation at this time. 
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. If you have any questions or concerns, please 
feel free to call me at

My apologies, but I was at the courthouse most of the day. We are currently looking into this. Have any attorneys reported

Thank you,

Good morning 
I've received some complaints about the Epstein legal team taking over the SHU room for entire days. 
Given that visiting rooms are already in short supply, is there some plan to accommodate the increased demand so that 
other attorneys with SHU inmates also have access?

- The memo is very confusing. Please draft an email of his actions and current status. Also include 
what plans were in motion to move him to a GP unit. It will need to be something I can forward to IPPA and the 
Director.

Synopsis: On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the 
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey, Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The 
Lieutenant called out to the inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red 
marks on his neck. The inmate was placed in hand restraints and escorted to the 
Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While on watch, the inmate indicated that 
his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been harassing him and he had informed 
his Attorney of this matter. 
Medical Assessment: The inmate was medically assessed at 6:30 a.m., by the 
Physician Assistant and his findings were as follows: 
He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this clinical 
encounter. Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot explain the marks on 
his neck. Responded: "I don't know". 
He does not want to talk of the events leading to the marks on his neck. 
He does not look in any distress or pain. 
Has a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck. Reaching 2/3 of the neck 
circumference, 2 inches wide, sparing the back of the neck. Has one section of this 
erythema in the front with marks of friction. 
No inflammation, no deformities, no hematomas, no lacerations, no tenderness. Patient 
moving his neck without any restriction. Denies having any pain or discomfort. Denies 
any respiratory problem. 
Has another small erythema on left knee about 2cm in diameter (mild). 
Psychologist Assessment: He was evaluated on today at 9:10 a.m., and it has been 
determined he will remain on Suicide Watch for further observation. 
Current Status: At this time, we are reviewing his case for placement in the general 
population in Unit 7 South. We are currently looking for the appropriate cell mate.

This is the response I am sending the RD. Are you ok with this? 
Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. =, 
Chief Psychologist. He 
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms 
begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain 
in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ 
from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or 
engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., 
not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. 
Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the 
inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to 
his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate I 
. Inmate 
pleaded guilty. in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and 
Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because 
he requested Protective Custody.

He is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with Dr. 
who indicated that most likely he will be 
found competent because he is not mentally ill. Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. I am looking at the SHU 
Roster now to see who can be a good cell mate.

He is requesting a razor to shave. 
He wants to be able to get water in Attorney Conference. He stated the machine does not have water and he said he is 
getting dehydrated. 
He wanted it noted that he did not get all of his medications because the Doctor told him he was on Psych Observation. 
He said he has not slept well in 21 days because of not having his cpap machine. 
He said he read the Turning Points handouts about how to cope in SHU. He stated he knew of these strategies and had tried 
them previously and because of the banging on the cell doors and screaming in SHU he was not able to do them. He stated 
he may get psychological trauma from SHU. He said even with his cpap machine he may not be able to sleep in SHU 
because of the noise in SHU.

Supplement 
OPI: CMC 
NUMBER: 
NYM 7331.04e 
DATE: November 13, 2014 
SUBJECT: 
Pretrial Inmates 
I. 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE: The primary mission of the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), 
New York, is to confine pretrial inmates for the United States Marshals (USM) Service. Pretrial 
inmates are defined as those individuals who are legally detained, but for whom the Bureau of Prisons 
has not yet received notification of conviction. Ordinarily, pretrial inmates will be separated, to the 
extent possible, from convicted inmates. The purpose of this supplement is to establish the procedures 
and operations, as well as staff responsibilities, for the operation of the institution, as it relates to pretrial 
inmates. It is paramount this supplement is read in conjunction with the program statement as 
information stated in national policy is not reiterated within. 
II. 
DIRECTIVES AFFECTED: 
a. 
Directives Rescinded: I.S. 7331.04d, Pretrial Inmates, dated June 25, 2009. 
b. 
Directives Referenced: P.S. 7331.04, Pretrial Inmates, dated January 31, 2003. 
III. 
PROCEDURES: MCC New York provides the care, custody, and control of inmates for the USM 
Service, while they are in pretrial status. However, all pretrial inmates remain the responsibility of the 
U.S. Marshal Service until they are convicted by the Court. In addition to pretrial inmates, MCC New 
York also confines sentenced inmates and holdovers. Additionally, MCC New York houses inmates 
on writs to the local district courts who have already been sentenced in other federal or state courts. 
Although pretrial inmates are ideally separated from convicted inmates, it is not always possible or 
practical to keep all pretrial inmates separate from those who have been convicted. Due to the unique 
design, structure, and operation of MCC New York, staff may, based upon sound correctional judgment, 
permit pretrial inmates, who do not present a risk to the security or orderly running of the institution, to 
have regular contact with convicted inmates. Therefore, pretrial inmates at this facility may be housed 
with convicted inmates, provided a waiver is signed. However, it is essential that pretrial inmates be 
separated from sentenced inmates before and during the intake screening process.

A. 
Procedures for Admission: The following procedures shall be followed when processing all 
new commitments, to include the verification of commitment papers, and searches of inmates 
and property. 
1. 
Inmates entering the Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area will be identified by 
Correctional Systems (CS)staff, formerly Inmate Systems Management (ISM) staff via an 
interview with the remanding official and the inmate. CS staff will review the Prisoner 
Remand (BP377) for accurate and complete information. All legal documents delivered 
with the inmate will be verified. 
2. 
All inmates will walk through a metal-weapon detector, be pat searched, and visually 
searched; a hand-held metal detector may also be used. All inmate property will be 
searched. 
3. 
Prior to being escorted to their assigned housing units, all new commitments will receive 
two jumpsuits, two pair of socks, two pair of underwear, one ditty bag {a toothbrush, 
toothpaste, a comb, and shaving cream}, one pair of tennis deck shoes, and one 
institution bedroll {two blankets, two sheets, one pillow case, one towel, and one 
washcloth}. Female pretrial inmates receive two pair of pants and shirts, versus 
jumpsuits, and two bras. 
B. 
Intake Screening (Social Interview): Due to the lack of available information concerning 
pretrial inmates, it is imperative a thorough intake screening is completed on all new 
commitments. Unit team staff will conduct intake screening on all inmates committed to the 
institution between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday. If members of 
the Unit Team are not available, a Lieutenant will conduct the intake screening. All staff 
members conducting intake screening must be CIM certified. 
I. 
Staff conducting intake screening for new commitments will receive a SENTRY generated 
Intake Screening form (BP-64) from R&D staff once the inmate has been loaded into 
SENTRY. Staff must pay special attention to the CMC Clearance and Separatee Data 
printout attached to the Intake Screening form. If SENTRY is not operational, staff 
should utilize the manual Intake Screening form (BP-312) {Attachment A}. If possible, 
the staff member conducting the intake screening should obtain pertinent information from 
the Deputy U. S. Marshal, or arresting agent, committing the inmate. Staff conducting the 
intake screening must review the U.S. Marshals Remand to Custody form to determine the 
offense with which the inmate is being charged. The interviewer should notate if the 
inmate is charged with a sophisticated crime, such as, Racketeering or Engaging in a 
Continuing Criminal Enterprise, or a violent offense such as, Murder, Bank Robbery, or

Extortion. The staff member conducting the interview will document any security 
concerns on the Intake Screening form. Staff will also assess the inmate's physical and 
mental condition, and document his/her conclusions on the Intake Screening form. If a 
psychological condition is noted, screening staff must notify the Duty Psychologist 
immediately of any noted mental concerns inmate. If on a weekend, the screening staff 
must call the on call Duty Psychologist to interview the inmate. If available, the staff 
member conducting the screening must review the Pre-Sentence Report and the Central 
File. The staff member's review of this material shall be documented on the Intake 
Screening form. Finally, the staff member conducting the interview will determine if the 
inmate can be placed in the general population of this institution. If the inmate's 
placement in general population would pose a threat to the security or orderly running of 
the institution, the Operations Lieutenant should be notified in order for the inmate to be 
placed in Administrative Detention. The conclusion that the inmate warrants placement in 
Administrative Detention should be documented directly on the Intake Screening form. 
This form must be signed by the staff member conducting the intake screening. When 
intake screening court returns, the supplement on Intake Screening must be reviewed. A 
separate questionnaire will be completed which addresses all questions on the SENTRY 
generated form. All intake screening must occur in the privacy of a room with only the 
inmate being intake screened and staff. If a notorious pretrial inmate, an inmate whose 
presence could attract undue attention to the Bureau of Prisons, or an inmate who requires a 
higher degree of security based on a serious volatile background or violent crime is 
committed, the intake screener will make copies of (Inmate Alert Notice) for the 
Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist (SCSS), CMC, SIS Office, the Lieutenant's 
Office and the Captain. The Captain will then notify the Warden and Executive staff. 
2. 
The staff member conducting the intake screening will ensure the intake screening form is 
Filled out completely and correctly, to include all times and dates. The staff member 
conducting the intake screening must also ensure the following forms are completed: 
a. 
Pretrial Inmate Notice of Separation/Work Waiver, BP-5203.073: Staff will 
ensure Section II of this form is completed for each new pretrial inmate. If a 
pretrial inmate refuses to sign this form, staff will document this fact and any 
reasons the inmate provides for refusing to sign on the form. Each new pretrial 
inmate should also be asked to complete Section IV of this form, the work waiver 
section. If a pretrial inmate does not wish to volunteer for a work assignment, 
this fact should also be documented on the form. 
If an inmate's ability to comprehend this waiver appears questionable, a referral to 
Psychology Services will be made for determination of competency.

b. 
Pretrial Inmate Interview, BP-5562.073: This form must be completed in 
conjunction with the Intake Screening Form. It is essential a thorough review of 
the inmate's status be completed upon his/her commitment. This form must be 
completed and signed by the staff member conducting the intake screening 
interview. 
c. 
Acknowledgment of Inmates (BP407 and 408): Staff must either have each 
inmate read or read to each inmate the policies/procedures on these forms; staff 
must cross off the method of advisement not used. Staff must ensure these 
forms are completed in their entirety. 
3. 
The intake screener is also responsible for distributing the "Inmate Rights and 
Responsibilities" to all new commitments. The intake screener will ensure each inmate 
acknowledges his/her receipt of the rights and responsibilities by circling the appropriate 
response on the Intake Screening form and signing it. If an inmate refuses to sign the 
BP-64 to acknowledge receipt of the rights and responsibilities, staff shall document this 
fact on the form. The completed BP-64 shall be filed in the inmate's unit management 
file, hereinafter called the drop file. 
4. 
CS staff are responsible for reviewing the U.S. Marshals receipt to review the status of 
those inmates returning from court each day. If an inmate's pretrial status changes, ISM 
staff will make the necessary changes in SENTRY. ISM staff is also responsible for 
interviewing the escorting Deputy U.S. Marshal to determine if any unusual 
circumstances occurred in court which could affect an inmate's classification at this 
institution. 
5. 
All new commitments will be issued the pamphlet entitled "Sexual Abuse/Assault 
Prevention and Intervention." 
C. 
Medical Intake Screening and Procedures: 
1. 
All new commitments are examined by a physician's assistant. The physician's assistant 
will screen all inmates in accordance with BOP medical procedures to determine if there 
are any reasons for not placing the inmate in general population, or for restricting work 
assignments. Specific attention shall be given to evidence of depression and potential 
suicide, and whether the inmates are victims of recent sexual assaults during a period of 
incarceration. A copy of the completed Intake Screening Medical form (BP-354) will 
be placed in the inmate's file maintained in Correctional Systems. All pretrial inmates 
will receive a complete medical screening within fourteen days of their arrival at this 
facility.

2. 
The Health Services Department will conduct sick call, triage, and physical exams for 
each housing unit Monday through Friday. Medical emergencies are handled 
immediately. 
3. 
Medical staff is on duty seven days a week, in the event of a medical emergency. 
Pretrial inmates receive the same level of basic medical care, including dental care, 
provided to sentenced inmates. The decision to defer or deny elective medical 
procedures shall be based on the same policies or guidelines which apply to sentenced 
inmates. The transient nature of pretrial inmates often precludes many elective 
procedures. Emergency medical treatment is provided in accordance with local 
procedures, for both pretrial and sentenced inmates. The Unit Manager is responsible 
for preparing a letter from the Warden to the Judge, through the U.S. Marshal, to notify 
the Court of any inmate receiving any psychiatric medication and/or any other medication 
that may alter the inmates courtroom behavior. It has been established locally that 
the medications which fall under the realm of "psychiatric medication which may affect 
courtroom behavior" are anti-psychotic, anti-manic, and on occasion, anti-depressants 
medications. The Pharmacist is responsible for providing the respective Unit Manager a 
list of inmates prescribed either anti-psychotic or anti-manic medication on a daily basis. 
The Psychiatrist will provide the Unit Manager with a list of inmates prescribed 
anti-depressants when he believes the medication "may affect courtroom behavior." 
(See Attachment B). A copy of this letter will be sent to the Assistant United States 
Attorney (AUSA), the USM, and the inmate's attorney, via the AUSA. A copy of this 
letter will also be put in the inmate's medical file and forwarded to Psychology. These 
same procedures apply to inmates committed for 4241(a) and 4242 psychological studies. 
D. 
Housing: Pretrial inmates, who are appropriate for general population, are placed in one of the 
seven general population housing units; six male units and one female unit. Five male housing 
units contain secure two-man rooms; four units have a capacity of housing 96 inmates; one unit 
has the capacity to house 94 inmates. There is one male dormitory unit which has the capacity 
of housing 156 inmates. The female unit houses 79 inmates and housing style varies from two 
to six woman rooms. 
1. Unit Assignment: Due to the unique nature and structure of this facility, the MCC has the 
capability of housing inmates who must be separated from one another. Therefore, as long 
as an inmate does not present any unusual security or medical concerns which would require 
his/her placement in Administrative Detention, pretrial inmates will be assigned housing 
units in general population using their separation needs as the primary factor. The officer 
assigned to the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Office is responsible for ensuring that 
inmates are initially placed in the appropriate housing units. This decision will be based 
upon accessing SENTRY and determining the inmate's separation needs; and also 
information provided by unit staff, ISM staff, or a Lieutenant.

self-sufficient 
recreation, 
MCC New York's unique design and mission require that many activities are provided on 
the units (i.e., meal serving, pill line, recreation); the units are partially 
requiring movement off the unit only for purposes of medical care, outdoor 
law library, some educational classes, movement to court, and attorney meetings. 
2. 
Procedures: Unit Managers are responsible for the operations within their housing units, 
to include sanitation, clothing, property, feeding, recreation, etc. Ordinarily, Unit 
Managers may change an inmate's quarters assignment for valid reasons. Unit staff 
must review an inmate's CMC Clearance and Separatee Data before moving an inmate. 
Prior to moving an inmate classified as a disruptive group member or in the posted 
picture file, the Unit Manager must confer with the SIS Office to ensure there exists no 
other security reason preventing the move. To avoid sensitive information being 
brought onto the units, the Unit Managers can confer with the CMC who has SENTRY 
access to Security Threat Group (STG) information. Also, the Unit Manager must 
consult with the C&A Officer before making the move to ensure the institutional count is 
not disrupted and for further review of the inmate's CMC Clearance and Separatee Data. 
3. 
High Security Cases: Those inmates identified as requiring a greater degree of security 
and control, but who do not require placement in the Special Housing Unit, are to be 
placed on higher floors for increased security. Pretrial inmates whose presence in the 
general population would pose a threat to the security or orderly running of the institution 
will be housed in administrative detention in the Special Housing Unit. 
E. 
Admission and Orientation (A&O): An Institutional A&O Program for pretrial inmates is 
not required. Based on the extreme population pressures, unique needs to separate inmates by 
floor and constant movement, inmates identified in this section will not be required to receive 
institution and unit A & O, however, upon intake screening they will receive the following: 
I. Inmate Rights and Responsibilities (located in the A & O Handbook) 
2. Bureau Prohibited Acts and Disciplinary System (located in the A & O Handbook) 
3. Completion of the Inmate Acknowledgment Forms (BP-S407/408) 
A&O Handbooks are posted on all general population units in English and Spanish. All new 
commitments housed in the Special Housing Unit receive a copy of the handbook. 
F. 
Visiting: Immediate family members and one person of "meaning" will be placed on the visiting 
list absent strong circumstances that preclude visiting. Immediate family is defined as mother, 
father, step-parents, step-children, foster parents, grand-children, brothers, sisters, spouse and 
children. As the situation presents itself, other non-immediate family members will be allowed 
to visit at the approval of the Associate Warden of Programs (AWP). Further, in circumstances, 
when an inmate requests more than ten visitors to be placed on their visiting list, the Unit 
Sensitive Limited Vilma! Use Only

Manager will approve / deny any visitor exceeding the limit. Pretrial inmates may complete a 
NYM 7331.04e 
Pretrial Inmates 
Page 7 
visiting list for immediate family members as soon as they reach their assigned housing unit. 
Pretrial inmates have the opportunity for social visits once a week. Ordinarily, each social visit 
will last a maximum of one hour, the exception to this policy being when a visitor traveled more 
than three hours. Visiting hours for pretrial inmates are from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and from 
5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Monday thru Friday. The visiting day for each unit remains the same, 
yet the times change every other week to enable visitors to come in the afternoon and the 
evening. 
G. 
Pretrial Inmate Reviews: The Unit Manager is responsible for scheduling and documenting 
pretrial inmate reviews for all pretrial inmates assigned to his/her unit. Each pretrial inmate 
committed to this institution will be scheduled for a review within 21 days of admission. 
Subsequent reviews will be conducted every 90 days. It is the responsibility of the Case 
Manager and the Counselor to obtain the necessary information in order to hold a meaningful 
review. The Pretrial Inmate Review Report (BP-5561.073) shall be used to document these 
reviews. If an inmate refuses to attend a scheduled review, staff shall document the refusal, and 
if known, the reason. The emphasis of this review will be placed on the inmate's current legal 
proceedings, institutional adjustment, work/sanitation evaluations, and program recommendation 
based on needs and availability. The unit team should also review the inmate's CIM status, and 
document the review in the file (i.e. on team sheet, activity record in FOI Exempt section). 
Unit staff should also verify the accuracy of all load data and update Sentry as needed. A 
pretrial inmate review must have at a minimum, two Unit Staff in attendance. A docket 
containing the names of general population inmates scheduled for review should be posted in the 
multipurpose area of the unit at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled review. 
The Unit Manager is also responsible for monitoring the inmate's pretrial status. Once an 
inmate pleads guilty/is convicted, the inmate's Admission/Release status should be updated by 
CS to reflect holdover status rather than pretrial status. These inmates are no longer considered 
to be pretrial inmates. Once the inmate changes to A-HLD status, conducting a team is no longer 
necessary. However, the Case Manager shall ensure that monitoring of these cases are 
conducted informally through an informal interview documented on the Activity Log. Unit staff 
must carefully monitor the status of the cases of those inmates who have been identified as 
requiring a greater degree of security and control, or those inmates involved in high profile cases. 
All pretrial inmates are normally classified as IN custody. Ordinarily, there should be no 
reason to consider changing a pretrial inmate's custody. Changes in the custody levels of 
pretrial inmates should only occur in rare cases. If unusual circumstances occur, the unit team 
must refer a recommendation to increase an inmate's custody from IN to MAXIMUM to the 
Warden for approval. The Regional Director must approve a reduction of a pretrial inmate's 
custody from IN to a lower custody level.

H. 
File Accountability: Unit Management inmate files will be maintained in the CS. All files 
must be maintained consistent with the Program Statement and supplement pertaining to central 
files. All files are to be counted quarterly, with a SENTRY generated roster. All files must be 
secured at all times and no file may be left in a staff's office overnight. For specific handling 
procedures, the supplement on central files should be referenced. 
I. 
Property: Beyond those items issued by CSstaff during the admission process, section III(A)(3) 
within, further clothing is issued by the Laundry Department to balance out the amount allowed 
by local policy. Approved clothing for pretrial inmates is listed in the institution supplement on 
Inmate Personal Property. Other items such as bar soap, laundry detergent, additional 
disposable razors, paper, pencils, and envelopes are distributed on each housing unit. 
Once arraigned and remanded to custody, all personal clothing will be shipped to an address 
provided by the inmate. Lock boxes are not used at this facility. The committing federal 
agents of newly arrested persons who have not been arraigned are responsible for safeguarding 
all money and valuable items until inmates are remanded to custody, at which time the inmates 
will forward all valuables to a person identified by themselves; monies will be credited to their 
commissary accounts. 
A pretrial inmate may have two sets of court clothes delivered to the institution for a jury trial or 
for sentencing. Court clothing requests must be approved by a member of the unit team 48 
hours prior to the delivery of the clothing. Clothing exchange is Mondays, Wednesdays, 
Thursdays, and Fridays from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., excluding holidays, in the front lobby. 
Pretrial inmates may retain clothing items such as T-shirts, shorts, sweatshirts and sweatpants 
purchased at other institutions. Pretrial inmates may also retain all legal work, including audio 
tapes, pertaining to their current legal action. 
J. 
Education: The Education Department provide pretrial inmates with educational opportunities 
such as Adult Continuing Education (ACE). The Education Department maintains the 
institution's law library. A satellite law library is also maintained in the Special Housing Unit. 
Pretrial inmates have the opportunity to spend a reasonable amount of time to do legal research 
and prepare legal documents in the Law Library. More specifically, to obtain certain legal 
materials pretrial inmates may make copies of legal materials via use of the debit card system. 
Inmates who claim indigence must obtain the Indigence Form in Education and have it approved 
by their unit team. Inmates may check out materials by consulting with staff from the 
Education Department. The Education Department will provide current newspapers, including 
Spanish Newspapers, to each pretrial unit.

K. Recreation: Pretrial inmates may participate in recreation activities from 6:00 a.m. until 11:00 
p.m., except during official counts. Movies are shown on the units on weekends via the 
Closed-Circuit Television System. The Recreation Department conducts outdoor recreation 
seven days a week, and rotates the pretrial units' access to the roof on a daily basis. Pretrial 
inmates have access to approximately five hours of outdoor recreation a week. 
L. Legal Resources: The institution's Legal Department will coordinate and approve all legal 
activities unique to a pretrial facility. Examples of these activities include arranging 
co-defendant meetings, and providing inmates and defense attorneys with video tape players to 
review video tapes. Unit staff will deliver audio tapes to those inmates who receive them from 
their defense attorney or the U.S. Attorney's Office. Unit staff will also provide inmates with 
tape players to review their tapes. Read-only computer CD access is available in the Education 
Department if inmates' attorneys send legal material on CDs. Pretrial inmates may make 
unmonitored calls to his/her attorney by submitting a request to a member of their unit team. 
Staff will not limit a pretrial inmate's access to unmonitored legal calls, however, these calls are 
granted to the extent that staff resources allow and must meet the requirements as stated in the 
Program Statement Legal Activities, Inmate. All legal mail sent to pretrial inmates is opened in 
their presence. Pretrial inmates may meet with their attorneys in the Attorney Conference 
Room ordinarily from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., each day, including weekends and holidays. 
Exceptions to these times are made on a case by case basis. 
M. 
Institutional Work Assignments: All pretrial inmates are responsible for housekeeping tasks 
in their rooms and in the common living areas. Pretrial inmates may be assigned as unit 
orderlies and receive performance pay. Each pretrial unit shall have no more than 12 orderly 
positions. Pretrial inmates may also be assigned a work detail outside the confines of the unit, 
provided the inmates do not have separatees in the building and are not a security risk. The unit 
team will review each inmate's eligibility for a work assignment during pretrial inmate reviews. 
A pretrial inmate does not earn extra good time. The unit team must ensure Section IV of the 
Notice of Separation/Work Waiver form is executed prior to an inmate's assignment to any work 
detail. Any pre-trial inmate, not on writ from a state facility, whose status changes to holdover 
by virtue of the fact the inmate has been convicted or pled guilty, is eligible to work. This 
policy is contingent upon the fact the inmate does not have any separatees in the building. 
N. 
Community Activities: All pretrial inmates remain in the custody of the USM Service until 
convicted by the Court, and therefore, are not eligible for community-based activities. In the 
case of an emergency, unit staff shall facilitate contact with the pretrial inmate's attorney, who 
may seek from the Court a decision concerning release from custody, or an escorted trip. 
Additionally, unit staff will notify the U.S. Attorney's Office and the USM of the emergency. 
Staff shall document contact with each of these agencies in the inmate's file. Release of the 
inmate requires a Court Order, and an escorted trip must be approved by the Court. Ordinarily, 
the USM Service will provide the escorts. This rule does not apply to emergency medical trips 
to a local hospital.

O. 
Religious Programs: Pretrial inmates in general population may participate in religious group 
activities. Staff may enlist the aid of contract or volunteer personnel to assist in the ministering 
of pretrial inmates. Due to the large number of separatees housed at this facility, any inmate 
who appears on the institution's daily separation roster may not attend group services in the 
Chapel located on Unit 5 North. Religious services for female inmates will be conducted in the 
programs room of the female unit. Pretrial inmates who have separatees, and those housed in 
the Special Housing Unit, must be ministered to individually on his/her unit. Inmates have the 
opportunity to fill out a Religious Preference Summary during Intake Screening 
P. 
Marriage: Pretrial inmates may request permission to marry in accordance with current BOP 
policy. Unit staff shall contact the Court, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and in the case of an alien, 
the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to advise them of the marriage request of 
the inmate and to request their comments. 
Psychiatric and Psychological Counseling: Due to the transient nature of pretrial inmates, 
individual counseling is limited to inmate needs, resolutions, and crisis intervention. Pretrial 
inmates may be allowed the opportunity to receive counseling services by submitting a "Request 
to a Staff Member" to the Psychology Department. Further, should inmates have any drug 
dependency issues the 40-Hour Drug Program is available to pretrial male and female inmates 
via submitting a "Request to a Staff Member" to the Psychology Department. 
R. 
Death or Serious Illness: In the event of death or serious illness, unit staff shall prepare 
letters, for the Warden's signature, notifying the committing Court, the United States Attorney, 
the inmate's attorney of record, and the designated family member or next of kin, and other 
agency with an interest (i.e. Consulate). 
S. 
Discipline: Pretrial inmates are required to abide by the Bureau of Prisons rules and 
regulations. New commitments are provided with the inmates' rights and responsibilities. 
Regulations pertaining to discipline - prohibited acts, types of disciplinary actions which may be 
taken, and the disciplinary system within the institution - are posted on all units, except in the 
Special Housing Unit, and are explicit in the Admission and Orientation Booklet. 
The respective Unit Manager is responsible for ensuring a letter, signed by the Warden, is 
forwarded to the Court, through the U.S. Marshal, advising the Court of any findings of guilt, for 
serious high and greatest severity incident reports, by the Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO). 
Furthermore, if the inmate violates any of the rules and regulations of the Bureau of Prisons, a 
letter will be sent to the United States Probation Office and prosecuting Assistant United States 
Attorney which specifies all violations. Upon an inmate's plea of guilt/conviction, the 
discipline history of the inmate will be reviewed by the respective Unit Manager, or designee.

On Saturday July 20, 2019 food service received a phone call from the

Good afternoon all, 
Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and that his CPAP is 
plugged in? 
I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, so there is no 
recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 days has elapsed? 
Thank you,

Good afternoon Mr. 
> 8/6/2019 3:20 PM >> > 
Our client Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last 
night so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on 
speaker phone, with officers present. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Re:

United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB 
Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman: 
I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, 
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m. 
Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and 
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a 
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at 
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. 
At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An 
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the 
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is actively 
investigating the incident. 
EFTA00035425
--- PAGE 2 ---
MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and 
the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to call me at 
. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. 
Sincerely, 
Warden

Dear Mr. Epstein: 
I am writing to express my condolences to you regarding the passing of your brother, Jeffrey 
Edward Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019. 
On August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Edward Epstein was pronounced deceased at the New York 
Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. At this time, although 
there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death, it appears to be the 
result of suicide. 
Although I realize that words alone cannot lessen your sorrow, I hope that my thoughts and 
sincerest sympathy will be of some comfort to you. 
Sincerely, 
Warden

I am working with IPPA to finalize the press release (1st draft attached). Can you please give me answers to the below: 
(1) Has Epstein's next of kin been notified? 
(2) Did staff initiate life-saving measures when they first found Epstein at approximately 6:30 am in his cell? 
(3) Did EMS or some sort of hospital staff come out to the institution, and if so, did they initiate life-saving measures at the 
institution? And did EMS 
drive Epstein to the hospital or did BOP drive him to the hospital? 
(4) Was Epstein pronounced dead by EMS (transporting folks) or instead hospital staff at 7:30 am at the hospital? 
(5) Was the FBI notified? Is it being investigated as a suicide? 
(6) What date did he first arrive at MCC NY on his PP37? 
(7) What are his specific offense titles for which he is indicted? I believe generally the news calls it sex trafficking, but we 
should be as specifically accurate based on Sentry (or the court order if we have it). 
Thanks,

... This graph is pretty explosive: A person with knowledge of the investigation said that when the decision was 
made to remove Mr. Epstein from suicide watch, the jail informed the Justice Department that Mr. Epstein would 
have a cellmate and that a guard "would look into his cell" every 30 minutes. 
But that was apparently not done, the person said.

Hi, I know you are busy. Following up on this. Also wondering about a few details I see out there: 
was this already known? In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed al 
one in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail's norm 
al procedure, two officials said.

Thanks, Lee. 
I. When was Epstein taken off suicide watch? 
2. How long was he on suicide watch? 
3. What unit in the jail was he housed? 
4. Was he by himself? 
5. What's protocol for watching him at 6:30 in the morning? And in general during a 24 hour period? 
6. Is there an internal investigation? Are the guard(s) and/or supervisors placed on modified duty/or some sort of 
restricted duty while there is an ongoing investigation? 
7. Are there surveillance cameras? If so what do they show? 
8. What did he use to hang himself?

Hi there —
I understand officials may have given a statement yesterday on whether or not Jeffrey Epstein was on suicide watch. 
Are you able to confirm whether or not he was or might you have a statement regarding the issue that you sent to others? 
I appreciate it, on behalf of CBS News.

The email below is from one of two staff here that has been targeted by the New York Times soliciting information on Epstein 
via their personal email. I will monitor this closely and I have already put out an email to all staff on the media and who are 
the only approved staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition the Warden held a recall today expressing the 
concerns if staff are sharing information and how it is prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts.

Hi 
M
,
I hope this finds you well. My name is Christina Goldbaum and I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm sorry to reach out 
out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn 
a little more about the prison and how it works internally (I hear there have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and 
I was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or 
anything that could identify you). I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying 
around, as you know, and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. 
Please let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 
Thanks, 
Christina

Hi there, 
I'm writing a piece for the site Gothamist about conditions at MCC. See allegations below, compiled from defense attorneys , 
current prisoners and their loved ones. Please send comment ASAP if you would like to respond. 
Regards 
Aviva Stahl 
— that some cells in the facility are covered in mold 
— that some cells in the facility have separate spouts for hot and cold water, making it impossible for prisoners to take 
showers at a reasonable temperature 
— that prisoners at MCC are treated with disdain. They "be lucky if they were treated like dirt under somebody else's shoe, 
but they're not even treated that well: said one lawyer 
— that overcrowding, understaffing and underresourcing are grave problems at the facility ("whether its people who are 
suicidal, people who need medical care, people who need psychiatric care, people who need spiritual guidance or religious 
accommodation, people who need programming, so they don't just get warehoused there - all of that is lacking.") 
— that in the spring of 2019, toilets on the women's floor at MCC flooded, and the women were forced to clean up the feces 
themselves

SUBJECT: 
Security Expectations Involving Inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054 
During the week of July 31, 2019 in order to address management 
concerns with inmate Epstein. I felt it was necessary to hold informal 
training sessions with Correctional Services Supervisors and Line 
Staff assigned to the Special Housing Unit. The informal training 
sessions was conducted in the Lieutenants Office, inside the SHU, 
and while conducting rounds throughout the institution. I informed 
staff of the importance of being vigilant and being security minded 
when dealing with inmate Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054, and 
other inmates within the Special Housing Unit. I explained that 
Lieutenants were to conduct more un announced rounds in the unit, 
providing oversite over operations and security. I pointed out 
apparent security concerns such as observation windows being blocked 
preventing staff from completing proper rounds, torn bed sheets, 
clothing, covering of light fixtures, clotheslines, and the 
accumulation of food trays in cells. I made clear of my expectations 
of maintaining a clean and manageable unit. I explained should we 
not continue to be proactive in the management of our inmate 
population, there would be another occurrence of the below describe 
incident. 
Inmate Epstein while housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
located in New York City. In the early morning hours of July 23, 
2019, he was found unresponsive in his cell after an apparent suicide 
attempt. 
In detailed conversations with the SHU Lieutenant, he was informed 
of my expectations regarding the supervision of inmate Epstein. 
Specifically, he was reminded on several occasions that inmate 
Epstein was to housed with a cell mate.

Synopsis: On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the 
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey, Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The 
Lieutenant called out to the inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red 
marks on his neck. The inmate was placed in hand restraints and escorted to the 
Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While on watch, the inmate indicated that 
his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been harassing him and he had informed 
his Attorney of this matter. 
Medical Assessment: The inmate was medically assessed at 6:30 a.m., by the 
Physician Assistant and his findings were as follows: 
He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this clinical 
encounter. Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot explain the marks on 
his neck. Responded: "I don't know". 
He does not want to talk of the events leading to the marks on his neck. 
He does not look in any distress or pain. 
Has a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck. Reaching 2/3 of the neck 
circumference, 2 inches wide, sparing the back of the neck. Has one section of this 
erythema in the front with marks of friction. 
No inflammation, no deformities, no hematomas, no lacerations, no tenderness. Patient 
moving his neck without any restriction. Denies having any pain or discomfort. Denies 
any respiratory problem. 
Has another small erythema on left knee about 2cm in diameter (mild). 
Psychologist Assessment: He was evaluated on today at 9:10 a.m., and it has been 
determined he will remain on Suicide Watch for further observation.

population in Unit 7 South. We are currently looking for the appropriate cell mate.

>». 
Hello, 
> 8/10/2019 6:03 PM >> > 
I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in responding the 
Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media. 
We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before 
ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct 
and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you have any statement on the situation? 
Thank you,

D is so ridiculous lol. that's herjob. that's why M asks whoever saw the person for the SRA or whatever to do the disciplinary 
report. it seems like the reason he needs the report is because he received an incident report while on SW, or went to SW 
right after. we always do them in those cases, even for people who are not high care levels or forensics. the issue is a matter 
of the reported suicidality. all she needs to do is write what he said about the incident, and her opinion about it. if he shows 
no signs of memory loss or cause for concem, he's competent. she's not making a judgment on whether he's guilty of the 
infraction. she's just stating whether he's in his right mind to go through the process. isn't this part of her job as a 
psychologist lol?? or, if she really feels like she doesn't know, then that's what she should say in the report. i feel like we just 
enable her to skirt around her job and her clinical responsibilities, and i guess we're not going to change her at this point in 
her career, but it's really a shame that it's gotten this far, and yes, totally ridiculous for M to even involve you. poor leadership,

yes, and also claiming 
may have done it to him but that he wasn't conscious so does not know. his scar is very 
significant. there's obvi a ton of dishonesty and holes in the story. i spent 30 mins with him this morning and confronted him 
a couple of times. and he still claims lack of memory and sticks to the same nonsensical story 
>» 
7/24/2019 9:21 AM > » 
yeah, i don't know what's been going on with him, but i just think in general we really allow the guys to abuse the use of SW, 
and i just thought it was interesting to see the response of a chief at another detention center i also agree that we don't let 
other inmates on SW attend legal visits, so he shouldn't have either, and shouldn't have been in regular clothes even if he 
did. again, to the other chief's point, if he can attend the legal visit that way, then he likely isn't suicidal and doesn't need to 
be on SW. so, is the story that he has a mark on his neck and he's saying he doesn't remember how it got there? 
>» 
7/24/2019 9:18 AM >» 
totally. i wonder if 
was embarrassed intros 
ive seeing a response like that. this is b/c of epstein. he was on SW but in 
regular clothes on legal visit and 
questioned it. i told, when she asked that we have done it this way in the 
past. in light of the huge scar on epstein's neck (granted a ton of ambiguity surrounding the incident), he did need to be on 
SW yesterday. i guess we should have declined his legal visit if we were following this other chiefs advice 
>» 
7/24/2019 8:40 AM >» 
lol i love this guy's response. that if this is even a question, they probably shouldn't even be on watch. we put way too many 
people on there. i'm even seeing the difference in BRO. they just don't function that way. guys come here from MC and go 
to SHU, and tell staff they want to go on SW, and the staff laugh at them, and the inmates tell them they were able to get on 
watch that way at MCC. and the psych who responded to her is at Chicago, another detention center. so, I'm guessing they 
see a lot of the same things that we do, and probably use SW less as an option.

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is c 
urrently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment tomorrow. His attorney, Marti 
n Weinberg, has represented him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touc 
h with us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomo 
now, but was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state. 
We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we woul 
d be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you-
is it at allpossible to address this issue so Mr. Weinberg can meet with his client this evening? I'm available anyt 
ime 
to discuss, if that's helpful, or Mr. Weinberg can also be reached directly at 
if that's easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I'd be 
grateful). 
thanks very much,

150 Park Row 
New York New York 10007 
July 23, 2019 
Operations Lieutenant 
On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
t-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. 
His neck was red 
with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
"Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
Clarke who stated that inmate Eostein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
matter. 
I photographed and spoke with inmate 
who stated 
that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down. Upon fu, trier questioning, inmate-,.gated 
that he sleeps on 
the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
Inmate Epstein stated that he came in fr 
legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
handed him a copy of the Daily News. 
" was on 
ading the Daily News. 
He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that 
mentioned that he'd 
rt all day in Westchester and was carrying on. 
t t at point, inmate 
paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
ted, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
report it. 
(Officer), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
Duty medical, 
was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLP. 
or a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front 
with marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

This is the response I am sending the RD. Are you ok with this? 
Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. =, 
Chief Psychologist. He 
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where Ire will be reassessed. 
DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms 
begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain 
in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ 
from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or 
engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., 
not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. 
Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the 
inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to 
his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
Housin Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate I 
. Inmate 
pleaded guilty. in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and 
Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because 
he requested Protective Custody.

Hi DAD 
There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are trying to get some basic 
information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any information out of the facility. Is there someone we 
could speak to and get the basic information? The USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the

The National Suicide Prevention Coordinator from Central Office 
contacted me today about Epstein. He thought 
that housing him with another sex offender in SHU would be a goo i ea. told him I would speak with the executive staff 
about his suggestion. Also, 
thought it wise that we keep him down here for a bit (as is the plan already). 
I am heading to the hospital in about a half an hour or so. If you need me for anything, feel free to call my cell phone■ 
Thank you.

Yes, I already went back there but he was in the shower. As soon as he is done showering and dressed, I will go back there 
again. I wanted to assess that psych obs is still ok... Central Office Psych was concerned I stepped him down to psych obs 
rather than keeping him on SW. I gave my justification and feel it is appropriate, but I just want to make sure I still feel that 
way when he is interviewed today. I will be in touch this morning.

waiver. The waiver may be rescinded at the inmate's request and reasons for the rescission should be

Mr. Jeffrey Edward Epstein 
Register Number: 76318-054 
Age 66, White Male 
MCC New York 
Metropolitan Correctional Center 
Email: NYM/ 
New York City, NY 10007 
Dear Mr. Epstein, 
You called me circa August 2017 and you and I had a Skype call with my Ph.D. 
student, Ms. Zeinab Bandpey, in December 2017. 
Apr 
Zeinab Bandpey Wins vCalc Award for 
Excellence 
JonmIkelballey I News I Co Comments 
I can help you. 
C 
I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically 
black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world 
you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can 
EFTA00035613
--- PAGE 2 ---
be for "The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics," which will 
show the world your support for women. 
Alternatively, Mark Zuckerberg gave $3 million "Breakthrough Awards" to two math 
professors. You can give me a similar award. Lord Robert May of Oxford, 
former President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, "I thought your analysis of 
the bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful." In 2018, I solved a problem of Pdlya 
Prize-winner Anders Bjbmer which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a "challenging question" 
in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices. 
I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in 
the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now. 
If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject 
your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for 
a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They've raised less than £10,000! 
https://www.givecampus.comischoolsAincolnCollege/mathematics-fellowship 
I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting 
money from you would be "a tough one for a UK institution," but if you funded me as an 
individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might 
be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and 
you'd have an advocate at one of the world's most prestigious universities publically defending 
you. I could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don. 
Cordially, 
Jonathan Farley, D.Phil. (University of Oxford), A.B. summa cum laude (Harvard Universit 
♦ SEMMES Or THE Fug: Dr. S. Allen Counter, (1) director or the Harvard

Attachments: TEXT.htm 
Good afternoon all, 
Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and that his CPAP is 
plugged in? 
I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, so there is no 
recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 days has elapsed? 
Thank you, 
Supervisory Staff Attorney

Good afternoon 
Our client Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last 
night, so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on 
speaker phone, with officers present. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this 
inmate when he returns from court. Should he retum from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on 
PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. 
Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by 
BOP statistics. Let's be proactive. 
"This writer consulted with Dr. S 
Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors 
for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding 
today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns 
from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he 
returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate 
Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. =, 
Chief Psychologist. He 
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms 
begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain 
in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ 
from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or 
engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., 
not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. 
Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the 
inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to 
his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special 
Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate I 
. Inmate 
pleaded guilty. in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and 
Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because 
he requested Protective Custody.

Yes, I already went back there but he was in the shower. As soon as he is done showering and dressed, I will go back there 
again. I wanted to assess that psych obs is still ok... Central Office Psych was concerned I stepped him down to psych obs 
rather than keeping him on SW. I gave my justification and feel it is appropriate, but I just want to make sure I still feel that 
way when he is interviewed today. I will be in touch this morning.

I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow befor 
e his Legal visit to see him again. 
He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathr 
oom breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there 
because of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

I am working with IPPA to finalize the press release (1st draft attached). Can you please give me answers to the below: 
(1) Has Epstein's next of kin been notified? No. 
(2) Did staff initiate life-saving measures when they first found Epstein at approximately 6:30 am in his cell? Yes. 
(3) Did EMS or some sort of hospital staff come out to the institution, and if so, did they initiate life-saving measures at the 
institution? And did EMS drive Epstein to the hospital or did BOP drive him to the hospital? EMS arrived at the institution 
and BOP staff along with EMS transported the inmate to the local hospital. 
(4) Was Epstein pronounced dead by EMS (transporting folks) or instead hospital staff at 7:30 am at the hospital? No. 
Epstein was pronounced dead at the local hospital at approximately 7:36 am. 
(5) Was the FBI notified? Is it being investigated as a suicide? Yes. FBI was notified. 
(6) What date did he first arrive at MCC NY on his PP37? July 6, 2019. 
(7) What are his specific offense titles for which he is indicted? I believe generally the news calls it sex trafficking, but we 
should be as specifically accurate based on Sentry (or the court order if we have it). Sex Trafficking Conspiracy and Sex 
Trafficking of Minors.

Subject: Inmate Epstein, J. 76318054 - Notify Psychology ASAP when he returns from court 
Date: Mon, 08 Jul 2019 14:50:20 +0000 
Importance: Normal 
Attachments: TEXT.htm 
I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this 
inmate when he returns from court. Should he retum from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on 
PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. 
Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by 
BOP statistics. Let's be proactive. 
"This writer consulted with Dr. S 
Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors 
for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding 
today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns 
from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he 
returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate 
Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment'

PROGRAM REVIEW DIVISION 
Washington. DC 20534 
June 30, 2025 
MEMORANDUM FOR 
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
FROM: 
Acting Section Chief 
External Audits, Planning, and Analysis Section 
SUBJECT: 
Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) Final Report 
dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau 
of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on April 2, 2025. The Bureau has 
completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the analysis and 
its recommendations. 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on 
the particular individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
the revisions it is making to Program Statement 5321.09 to address the recommendation. The 
BOP has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
EFTA00035776
--- PAGE 2 ---
BOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of the BOP's previous status update, Program 
Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate Program Review, will be modified to address 
the recommendation. These revisions must follow the normal policy development and Union 
negotiation process. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow the normal BOP 
development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The BOP will provide 
further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high 
risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate 
until the recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency 
plan for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5321.09 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
negotiation process. Accordingly, the O16 will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
BOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of the BOP's previous status update, Program 
Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate Program Review, will be modified to address 
the recommendation. These revisions must follow the normal policy development and Union 
negotiation process. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow the normal BOP 
development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The BOP will provide 
further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, 
and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its 
process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5324.08 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
negotiation process. Accordingly, the O16 will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
BOP Response: The BOP is in the process of revising Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide 
Prevention Program, to address the recommendation, and has indicated that these revisions must 
follow the normal policy development and Union negotiation process. Because revisions to 
EFTA00035777
--- PAGE 3 ---
Program Statements must follow the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process, 
they are subject to change. The BOP will provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those 
methods through policy, training, or other measures. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5500.14 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy revisions referenced in its update; and (2) provides the 
finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
BOP Response: The BOP is in the process of revising Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional 
Services Procedures Manual, to address the recommendation, and these revisions must follow 
the normal policy development process. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow 
the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The 
BOP will provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
conducting a round. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5500.14 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
also previously indicated that the policy revisions will require Lieutenants to conduct training 
sessions that allow for individual assessment and training regarding conducting rounds to be 
tailored to the needs of each individual facility. The BOP has indicated that these revisions must 
follow the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will 
consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy revisions 
referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
BOP Response: The BOP is in the process of revising Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional 
Services Procedures Manual, to address the recommendation, and these revisions must follow 
the normal policy development process. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow 
the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The 
BOP will provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to 
address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has reported 
that it has implemented the staffing tool for all professions, but that it is still working on several 
EFTA00035778
--- PAGE 4 ---
other initiatives regarding staffing, including analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of 
both recruitment and retention incentives, analyzing whether the new incentives and nation-wide 
direct hire authority mentioned in its update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage, 
and establishing a nationwide special salary rate for institution positions. In this update, the BOP 
reported that it has analyzed its use of staffing incentives and found notable improvement in 
overall employee retention rates as a result of such incentives. However, the BOP further 
reported that due to budgetary constraints, the BOP is reducing or eliminating our use of 
incentives effective March 23, 2025. 
The OIG will continue to monitor the GOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. 
In addition, per the OIG's communications with the BOP, we believe that certain information 
that the BOP has provided or will provide to Congress and the Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) will facilitate the resolution and closure of this recommendation. Accordingly, we 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG any 
additional contractor and BOP work product that has been submitted to the GAO in response to 
the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations,; (2) provides the OIG an update on its use and 
analysis of staffing incentives and any efforts to seek additional funding to continue to pursue 
staffing incentives; (3) provides the OIG any additional reports submitted to Congressional 
appropriation committees related to staffing; and (4) provides the OIG with an update on the 
salary proposal submitted to OPM, including whether OPM has approved or disapproved of the 
pay table proposals. 
BOP Response: OIG indicates that it will consider whether to close this recommendation after 
the Bureau: 
1. Provides the OIG any additional contractor and BOP work product that has been 
submitted to the GAO in response to the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations. 
The BOP has not provided any additional work products to GAO. 
2. Provides the OIG an update on its use and analysis of staffing incentives and any 
efforts to seek additional funding to continue to pursue staffing incentives. 
As stated in the previous response, the analysis has been completed as the Bureau has begun to 
achieve its four identified goals with the increase in retention incentive spending. While it was 
noted in the previous response an analysis was still pending for FY 2024 new hires, an analysis 
was conducted from FY2021 to FY2023, and it noted an increase of 4.6% in retention rate from 
83.5% to 88.1%. However, it should be noted that in an effort to remain within the Agency's 
fiscal parameters, the BOP implemented significant reductions and eliminations of retention 
incentives agencywide in March 2025. These changes were necessary to ensure financial 
solvency and operational continuity. The BOP plans to continue to seek funding to reinstate 
incentives, and/or seek funding for special salary rates to retain staff in the BOP. 
EFTA00035779
--- PAGE 5 ---
3. Provides the OIG any additional reports submitted to Congressional appropriation 
committees related to staffing. 
No additional reports have been submitted to Congressional appropriation committees related to 
staffing. 
4. Provides the OIG with an update on the salary proposal submitted to OPM, 
including whether OPM has approved or disapproved of the pay table proposals. 
OPM has not provided any updates, to include approval or disapproval, of the pay table 
proposals. Currently funding is not available to support BOP's request. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera 
system functionality checks. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG reviewed the 
BOP's new Security Camera Monthly Report and appreciates the progress the BOP has made in 
creating this form and instituting the new monthly reporting process. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statements 5500.14 and 4200.12 to address the 
recommendation. The BOP has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP 
development and Union negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to 
close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy updates referenced in its update; 
and (2) provides the finalized policies to the OIG for review. 
BOP Response: Program Statements 5500.15, Correctional Services Manual, and 4200.12, 
Facilities Operations Manual, are being modified to include protocols and ensure accountability 
regarding various aspects of the Bureau's camera systems, including but not limited to 
functionality, documentation, and repair. Because revisions to Program Statements must follow 
the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. The Bureau 
will provide further updates as they become available.

U.S. Department of Justice 
Federal Bureau of Prisons 
PROGRAM REVIEW DIVISION 
Washington. DC 20534 
November 19, 2024 
MEMORANDUM FOR 
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
FROM: 
External Auditing Branch 
SUBJECT: 
Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on August 28, 2024. The FBOP 
has completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the analysis 
and its recommendations. 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on 
the particular individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, the 
BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the field on a 
process to ensure psychologists make recommendations regarding housing, including the presence of 
a cellmate, for individuals in custody following suicide watch or psychological observation. The BOP 
further reported that this process will include exemptions based on individual or security 
considerations. In a February 2024 update, the BOP indicated that this guidance had been drafted and 
was under review. The BOP has now stated that the guidance is still under review. Accordingly, the 
OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance 
referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
EFTA00035781
--- PAGE 2 ---
FBOP Response: As indicated in FBOP's previous status update, guidance is currently in 
development. FBOP has determined that the appropriate vehicle for this guidance is Program 
Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate Program Review, rather than in the form of a 
guidance memorandum. FBOP therefore plans to replicate in that policy the tracking process 
already established for single cells in Program Statement 5270.12, Special Housing Units, but 
apply it to general population. The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program 
Review policy will prescribe a specific process for single-cell placement and tracking only if 
single-cell placement in general population appears necessary, mirroring the language 
pertaining to the process in the policy for SHU. 
The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program Review policy will explain that, 
if it appears necessary to single cell an individual in a general population unit during regular 
working hours, the Unit Manager will contact the Captain and Chief Psychologist (or designee) 
for their recommendations. If a single cell is required after hours or on weekends, the Operations 
Lieutenant will contact the Captain and Chief Psychologist (or designee) telephonically for their 
recommendations. Monitoring single-ceiling in the general population will be recorded on 
"BP-A1121 CO Single Cell Review Form-GP" (see attachment). This form will be signed by the 
Warden as soon as feasible following the placement of an individual in a single cell. These forms 
will be reviewed and discussed during the weekly multidisciplinary team meetings and the 
recommendations (to continue or discontinue) will be recorded by the Unit Manager in 
TRUSCOPE, as a "daily log entry." 
Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they 
become available. 
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high 
risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate 
until the recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency 
plan for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
the BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the 
field on procedures to ensure communication regarding the requirement of a cellmate for 
individuals following suicide watch or psychological observation when recommended by a 
psychologist. The BOP further reported that this memo will include a procedure for exemptions 
based on individual or security considerations. In a February 2024 update, the BOP indicated that 
this guidance had been drafted and was under review. The BOP has now stated that the guidance 
is still under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (I) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized 
guidance to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in FBOP's previous status update, guidance is currently in 
development. Further, as stated in the response to Recommendation I, above, FBOP has 
EFTA00035782
--- PAGE 3 ---
determined that the appropriate vehicle for this guidance is Program Statement 5321.09, Unit 
Management and Inmate Program Review, rather than in the form of a guidance memorandum. 
FBOP therefore plans to replicate in that policy the tracking process already established for 
single cells in Program Statement 5270.12, Special Housing Units, but apply it to general 
population. The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program Review policy will 
prescribe a specific process for single-cell placement and tracking only if single-cell placement 
in general population appears necessary, mirroring the language pertaining to the process in the 
policy for SHU. 
Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they 
become available. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, 
and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its 
process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
the BOP reported that it was evaluating its process for obtaining and documenting approval for 
social and/or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. In a 
February 2024 update, the BOP reported that while it currently does not have guidance on these 
issues, new guidance had been drafted and was under review. The BOP has now stated that the 
guidance is still under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) 
provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in its previous status update, FBOP was developing guidance 
with regard to its process for obtaining and documenting approval for social and/or legal visits 
while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. However, upon further 
consideration, FBOP has determined that this guidance should not be in the form of a guidance 
memorandum, but should instead be included in Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention 
Policy. Therefore, FBOP is in the process of altering that policy accordingly. Because revisions 
to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and Union negotiation 
process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they become available. 
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those 
methods through policy, training, or other measures. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program 
EFTA00035783
--- PAGE 4 ---
statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the 
OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is being modified to include methods for accounting 
for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow 
the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will 
provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant N1 lien 
conducting a round. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP reported that 
it is updating its policy to address the recommendation. In its February 2024 update, the BOP 
also indicated that it would be conducting training for Lieutenants on conducting rounds. The 
OIG therefore previously asked the BOP to provide "a description of the training referenced in 
its update, sample training materials for OIG to review, and confirmation that the training is in 
effect." The BOP has indicated that, to allow for variation based on the specific needs of each 
institution, there will not be a specific BOP-wide curriculum for the training; however, training 
will be conducted and documented on the Daily Lieutenant Logs and reviewed by the Captain 
for specific local training needs. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program statement update referenced in its 
update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is being modified to include methods for accounting 
for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow 
the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will 
provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to 
address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG will continue 
to monitor the GOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. Accordingly, we will 
consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG an update on 
the contractor's or GOP's analysis of staffing incentives since March 2023, whether submitted 
yet to GAO or not; (2) implements the staffing tool for all BOP professions; (3) provides an 
analysis of whether the new incentives and nation-wide direct-hire authority mentioned in its 
update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage; (4) provides an update on its efforts 
to establish a nationwide special salary rate for institution positions; and (5) describes any 
additional proposals, including any legislative proposals to address pay rates in certain localities, 
that are being considered by the BOP to fully address the staffing shortage and provides an 
EFTA00035784
--- PAGE 5 ---
update to the OIG on the Department's consideration and cooperation with the BOP on any such 
proposal. 
FBOP Response: OIG indicates that it will consider whether to close this recommendation after 
FBOP: 
1. Provides an update on the contractor's or FBOP's analysis of staffing incentives 
since March 2023; whether submitted yet to GAO or not. 
The FBOP is currently analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of both recruitment and 
retention incentives. This analysis is ongoing. Therefore, FBOP will provide an update to OIG 
when completed. 
2. Implements the staffing tool for all FBOP professions. 
The Automated Staffing Tool (AST) went live officially on October I, 2024, and has been 
implemented for all FBOP professions. This workforce planning tool will allow FBOP 
leadership to identify true institution position needs to safely and effectively operate all of the 
FBOP's 122 institutions. The AST recommends position numbers based on data driven insights 
from internal and external subject matter experts, institution-specific criteria, and evolving 
mission requirements. 
3. Provides an analysis of whether the new incentives and nation-wide direct-hire 
authority mentioned in its update above have made an impact on the staffing 
shortage. 
The FBOP continues to collect data in an effort to complete its analysis in 2025. However, 
preliminary analysis has shown retention incentives to be an effective factor when comparing 
data from the recent fiscal years. In FY 2024, the lowest number of total separations occurred 
with 2,572 separations. In FY 2023, the FBOP had 2,900 separations. FY 2022 had the highest 
number of separations in the FBOP in recent years with 3,665. 
Recruitment measures have also made an impact in the most recent fiscal years. In FY 2024, 
FBOP saw the largest influx of staff since FY 2021, with 3,596 new hires. Comparatively, 
FY 2023 saw 2,622 new hires and 1,846 in FY 2022. After receiving nationwide DHA approval 
in May 2024, and continuing through September 2024, the FBOP has hired over 450 correctional 
officers with Direct Hiring Authority, totaling 642 for FY 2024. This is significantly greater than 
our total of 196 new hires for FY 2023 and 83 new hires for FY 2022 without nationwide DHA. 
4. Provides an update on its efforts to establish a nationwide special salary rate for 
institution positions. 
The FBOP is continuing to actively collaborate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop a special salary rate aimed at addressing 
recruitment and retention challenges within our institutions by offering more competitive 
salaries. Currently, the FBOP is focusing Special Salary Rate efforts on the Correctional Officer 
EFTA00035785
--- PAGE 6 ---
and nurse positions and submitted its request to DOJ at the end of September 2024. DOJ 
informed FBOP that both requests are under OPM review. 
5. Describes any additional proposals, including any legislative proposals to address 
pay rates in certain localities, that are being considered by the BOP to fully address 
the staffing shortage and provides an update to the OIG on the Department's 
consideration and cooperation with the BOP on any such proposal. 
As of November 2024, FBOP has no further input regarding proposals being considered to 
address the staffing shortage. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera 
system functionality checks. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy updates 
referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized policies to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, and Program Statement 4200.12, Facilities Operations 
Manual, are being modified to include protocols and ensure accountability regarding various 
aspects of FBOP's camera systems, including but not limited to functionality, documentation, 
and repair. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal development and 
Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates as they 
become available. 
However, to ensure immediate action, a joint memorandum from FBOP's Administration 
Division and Correctional Programs Division was sent to all CEOs addressing necessary camera 
protocols. See attachments "Camera Report Implementation signed" and "Security Camera 
Report Template." The joint memorandum implemented a monthly reporting process in all 
facilities and attached a template to use for monthly reporting. The monthly reporting requires 
electronic technicians at each facility to list the number of installed cameras, adjustments to the 
camera count as needed, information regarding camera recording capability and camera 
operational state, and information regarding any repairs made to the cameras during the month of 
reporting. The Captain and Facility Manager must review each monthly report from the facility 
and ensure accuracy. The monthly Security Camera Report will then be included in the Facilities 
Management Monthly Report to Regional offices and submitted from the Warden to the 
Regional Director. The new monthly Security Camera Report is now in use and became effective 
June 1, 2024.

Fox News Tucker Carlson Segment 
January 25, 2023 
Summary 
Tucker Carlson: So you would think as the Attorney General (referring to Bill Barr) his first concern would 
be finding out what actually happened but instead his first concern was worried that the public might jump 
to unapproved conclusions about what happened. And in some ways, Bill Barr was right to worry. Many 
Americans did not believe that Jeffrey Epstein had killed himself given the strange circumstances of his 
death—stranger than most people understood at the time. It was going to take a sustained public relations 
campaign to convince Americans that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, but Bill Barr was willing to make the 
effort. 2 days later, he flew to New Orleans, gave a speech, and said this: 
/ was appalled and indeed the whole Department was, and frankly, angry, to learn of the MCCs 
failure to adequately secure tin's. prisoner. We are now learning of serious irregularities at this 
facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation. The FBI and the Office of 
Inspector General are doing just that. We will get to the bottom of what happened, and there will be 
accountability. 
Tucker Carlson: 3.5 years after Jeffrey Epstein died, no one has gotten to the bottom of what happened 
that day and there has been no accountability for it. The only people ever punished for the grotesque 
malfeasance surrounding Epstein's death were two low-level guards who fell asleep on duty that night. 
Both pleaded guilty to falsifying government records. But last year, with no real explanation, an Obama-
appointed judge dropped all charges against both of them. One of the guards may still work for the federal 
government. As for getting to the bottom of what happened—despite many promises from many various 
officials—not to the FBI nor the Justice Departments Office of Inspector General has ever issued a report 
explaining how Jeffrey Epstein died...not a word. So, once again, 3.5 years after one of the most widely 
covered deaths of our time, there's still no answers and there's still no accountability. Why is that? 
Tucker Carlson quotes from Bill Barr's memoir regarding the medical examiner. Tucker Carlson questions 
why reporters never questioned Bill Barr's assessment of Epstein's death. Tucker Carlson resumes 
discussing the initial medical examiners assessment, and then discusses NYC's chief medical examiner 
Barbara Sampson's declaration of Epstein's death of suicide. Tucker Carlson then begins discussing 
Epstein's cell and surrounding inmates, saying BOP wouldn't provide Carlson with the inmate's names on 
Epstein's tier. 
Tucker Carlson: This week, we've called virtually every person involved in the story surrounding Epstein's 
death. With very few exceptions, none of them would speak to us. Some hung up immediately. Others 
declined all comment. One of them, the DOJ case officer supposedly assigned to investigate Epstein's 
death, refused even to acknowledge that he worked for the federal government. "I'm not going to confirm 
or deny that" said Mr. Lyeson Daniel when we reached him on his cell phone. 'Why is that?' we asked him. 
"I'm not going to confirm or deny that" he repeated. 
Tucker Carlson then begins discussing Jeffrey Epstein's denial of an alleged suicide attempt on July 23, 
EFTA00035791

2019. Carlson also asks wants to know if the celVs on Epstein's tier were locked the entire night he was 
killed and says a source claims they weren't. He also wants to know who moved Epstein's body, re-dressed 
Epstein's corpse, and intubated it. 
Tucker Carlson: We dutifully called the Department of Justice to ask them to explain some of this, they 
refused on the grounds that there is quote "an active investigation in progress." But that is a lie. There is 
no investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death. We're moving on 4 years now, there has never been an 
investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death...the death of an American citizen. We can only speculate as to 
why that is, but all the explanations are bad and ominous. Maybe someone in the new Republican 
Congress should look into all of this. Not because Jeffrey Epstein was an American hero, but because for 
once, it'd be nice to see the federal government forced to tell the truth about something.

U.S. Department of Justice 
Federal Bureau of Prisons 
PROGRAM REVIEW DIVISION 
Washington. DC 20534 
February 14, 2024 
MEMORANDUM FOR 
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
FROM: 
External Auditing Branch 
SUBJECT: 
Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on November 13, 2023. The 
FBOP has completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the 
analysis and its recommendations. 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the 
particular individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG will 
consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in 
its update, or puts in place other policies or procedures to address assignment of a cellmate following 
suicide watch or psychological observation; and (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for 
review. 
FBOP's Response: The FBOP Reentry Services Division (RSD) and Correctional Programs 
Division (CPD) have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is currently under review. 
FBOP plans to issue the guidance at the conclusion of the review process. 
EFTA00035793
--- PAGE 2 ---
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security 
considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is not responsive to the recommendation. This update 
essentially repeats the update for Recommendation I and does not address the need for 
continuity of a cellmate assignment, including a contingency plan for cellmate reassignment, 
with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations. The 
OIG's Epstein report found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a new 
cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of the Metropolitan Correction Center in 
New York, and that a contingency plan, such as a list of alternate cellmates, would have 
increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed alone at the time of his death. 
The OIG will need a further update from the BOP on this recommendation. 
FBOP's Response: RSD and CPD have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is 
currently under review. FBOP plans to issue the guidance at the conclusion of the review 
process. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and 
provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to 
mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
observation. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG will await 
further information from the BOP following its evaluation. 
FBOP's Response: An evaluation of FBOP policies shows there is no current guidance on this 
issue. Therefore, FBOP has drafted guidance. This guidance is currently under review. FBOP 
plans to issue the guidance at the conclusion of the review process. 
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods 
through policy, training, or other measures. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the 010 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the program 
statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized update to the OIG for 
review. 
FBOP's Response: The Correctional Services Procedures Manual is in the process of being 
updated to improve FBOP methods for accounting for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. FBOP 
will keep OIG apprised of its progress. 
EFTA00035794
--- PAGE 3 ---
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
conducting a round. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the program 
statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized update to the OIG for 
review. 
FBOP's Response: The Correctional Services Procedures Manual is in the process of being 
updated to clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round. FBOP will keep 
OIG apprised of its progress. 
Additionally, training sessions will be conducted, at a minimum with all Correctional Services 
staff, per the schedule issued annually by Correctional Programs Division. This training may be 
conducted in-person during Lieutenant Rounds or via virtual/telephonic platform, as annotated 
within the schedule. 
Documentation of all trainings will be annotated in the Lieutenant's Log specifying the training 
topic and the method in which it was completed (i.e., mock exercise, in-person walking tour, or 
via virtual/ telephonic). 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address 
staffing shortages at its prisons. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation, but does not provide 
adequate grounds for closure of the recommendation. In the interest of economizing resources 
for both the BOP and the OIG, the OIG will consolidate analysis of this recommendation with 
that of Recommendation 5 from the OIG's Limited-Scope Review of the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons' Strategies to Identify, Communicate, and Remedy Operational Issues, Report 
Number 23-065 (Limited-Scope Review). Please report any additional updates on the BOP's 
response to this recommendation to the OIG's Evaluation and Inspections Division in connection 
with the Limited-Scope Review. The OIG will close this recommendation when it closes 
Recommendation 5 from the Limited-Scope Review. 
FBOP's Response: FBOP appreciates OIG's efforts to consolidate recommendations where 
feasible during the audit resolution and follow up process but does not concur with consolidating 
the analysis of this recommendation with that of Recommendation 5 from the OIG's Limited-
Scope Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Strategies to Identify, Communicate, and 
Remedy Operational Issues, Report Number 23-065 (Limited-Scope Review). Although the two 
have similarities, the recommendations and action steps to address each differ. The automated 
staffing tool (AST), which continues to be tested and evaluated, and has an estimated completion 
of the end of FY2024. While the development and implementation of the AST will be responsive 
to the Limited-Scope Review, it will not fully demonstrate FBOP's current efforts to address 
staffing shortages. Therefore, FBOP requests the analyses and responses remain separate. 
EFTA00035795
--- PAGE 4 ---
The FBOP continues to offer several incentives to attract and retain staff. As indicated in its 
September 2023 status update, the Director has authorized a bureau-wide recruitment incentive 
of $10,000 or 25% on initial salary (whichever is greater), for newly hired Correctional Officers 
and this incentive has been extended through FY2024. Also noted was the current 10% retention 
incentive for all Lieutenants and the bureau-wide group retention incentive ranging from 5-8% 
that is available to employees eligible to retire through December 2022. Additionally, the FBOP 
currently offers retention incentives ranging from 10-25% percent for Correctional Officers and 
other institution positions working at hard to fill locations as well as relocation incentives for 
specifically identified locations ranging from 10-25%. To further expand recruitment and 
staffing efforts, a waiver was granted to increase the maximum entry age for Correctional 
Officers who enter on duty prior to September 30, 2024. 
The FBOP is taking a multistep approach to filing all funded vacancies across the FBOP to 
include increased marketing and branding, utilization of recruitment incentives, utilization of pay 
flexibilities, onboarding, and utilization of retention incentives. The FBOP is employing a 
marketing and branding campaign to attract new and highly qualified applicants to apply to 
current vacancies. Additionally, FBOP is utilizing various recruitment incentives and pay 
flexibilities to offer comparable and/or competitive salaries. This includes special salary rates, 
above minimum rate, and student loan repayment. Finally, FBOP increased its utilization of 
retention incentives, where warranted, to retain highly qualified and knowledgeable employees. 
Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes 
as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is not responsive to the recommendation. The update says that 
the BOP will discuss existing policies with staff, but does not indicate that the BOP has or will 
evaluate its cell search procedures and make any necessary changes to improve those procedures 
through policy, training, or other measures. 
FBOP's Response: CPD is in the process of formulating direction to ensure CPD can evaluate 
the logging of cell searches within TRUSCOPE. Additionally, the Correctional Services Manual 
update, per our response in Recommendation 5 states training sessions will be conducted, at a 
minimum with all Correctional Services staff, per the schedule issued annually by Correctional 
Programs Division. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
functionality checks. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the policy update 
referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized update to the OIG for review. 
FBOP's Response: In response to OIG's most recent analysis, the FBOP can confirm it is 
updating the Correctional Services Manual and the Facilities Operations Manual to include 
EFTA00035796
--- PAGE 5 ---
protocols and ensure accountability regarding various aspects of the FBOP's camera systems 
including but not necessarily limited to functionality, documentation, and repair. The FBOP will 
provide further updates as they become available.

to SHU prior to the start of each new quarter, regardless of how many 
times a staff member has completed the training. When assignment to 
a SHU post is known sufficiently in advance, each staff member should 
be afforded a reasonable amount of duty time to complete the training. 
For instances when last-minute assignments to the SHU occur, the 
employer must advise the staff of the general requirements of a SHU 
post and answer any questions. This training session may include, but is 
not limited to, search procedures, escort procedures, application of 
restraints, use of force, orderly supervision, cell/unit sanitation, 
emergency response, suicide prevention, and dealing with mentally ill 
inmates, as well as other security procedures related to the unit. If this 
in-person training is completed, a training sheet will be completed

There will be no inmate movement during an official count. The 
count process will not be interrupted under any circumstances, 
other than by an emergency. Exceptions to the no inmate 
movement must be when inmates are in the wrong place for a 
count and have to be moved by direct staff escort to their 
proper place of count. Staff must not be distracted during the 
count. One staff member will count while the second staff 
member stands in a position to observe inmate movement. 
When the first staff member completes the count, the staff 
member will change positions. The second staff member will 
conduct the count while the other staff member observes the 
inmates. If the staff members count totals do not match, a 
recount will be conducted in the same manner." 
c. "4. Staff will not conduct a count based upon movements, 
sounds, or configurations from a covered bed.

conducted the count. Altered/illegible count slips are not 
acceptable." 
3. 310. Special Accountability 
a. "A staff member must observe all inmates confined in 
continuous locked down status, such as administrative 
detention or disciplinary segregation, at least once in the first 
minute period of the hour (example, 12:00 a.m. - 12:30 a.m.) 
followed by another round in the second 30 minute period of 
the same hour (example, 12:30 a.m. — 1:00 a.m.), thus ensuring 
an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are 
to be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 
minutes apart. All observations must be documented. 
b. Closer observation may be required for an inmate who is 
mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre behavior. 
c. For specific instructions and guidance for the supervision and 
monitoring of suicidal inmates refer to the following Program

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
June 22, 2023 
DOJ OIG Releases Report on Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Custody, 
Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New 
York 
Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz announced today the release of a report 
regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison's custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein while detained at 
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York). The DOJ Office of the 
Inspector General (OIG) initiated this investigation and review upon receipt of information from the BOP 
that inmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, 
City of New York, determined that Epstein had died by suicide. The DOJ OIG conducted this investigation 
jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG's investigative focus being the conduct of 
BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein's death and determined 
there was no criminality pertaining to how Epstein had died. 
The OIG's investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, 
including multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which led to Epstein being 
unmonitored and alone in his cell, which contained an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately 
10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in his locked cell the following day. While the OIG 
determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence 
contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in connection with how Epstein 
died. 
The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing operational challenges that negatively affect the BOP's 
ability to operate its institutions safely and securely. Many of those same operational challenges, including 
staffing shortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide, functional security camera systems, and 
management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by 
the OIG during this investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the 
BOP's most notorious inmates. 
The OIG's findings included the following: 
EFTA00035824
--- PAGE 2 ---
• 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Following a July 
23, 2019 incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York 
Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate 
cellmate. On August 9, Epstein's cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York 
staff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate as was required, but did not take steps to ensure 
that Epstein was assigned a new cellmate. 
• 
MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein 
and Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all 
inmates at least twice an hour and that lieutenants conduct at least one round in the SHU each shift. 
BOP policy also requires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour period. Among other things, 
inmate counts and rounds enable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they are secure in their 
cells and in good health. Further, to eliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU staff to 
search SHU common areas and at least five cells daily, and to search the entire SHU every week. 
A search of Epstein's cell following his death revealed Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and 
clothing in his cell, and that some had been ripped to create nooses. Only one SHU cell search was 
documented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein's cell. BOP records did not indicate when 
Epstein's cell was last searched. The OIG also found that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute 
rounds after about 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were 
conducted after 4:00 p.m. on August 9. 
• 
MCC New York Falsified BOP Records Relating to Inmate Counts and Rounds. MCC New York 
falsified count slips and round sheets to show that they had been performed when they were not, 
leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his death. 
• 
The DOJ OIG Did Not Uncover Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was 
No Criminality Associated with Epstein's Death. The OIG reviewed the available recorded video 
footage and found that, between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and about 6:30 a.m. on 
August 10, no one was seen entering Epstein's cell tier from the SHU common area. Further, the 
SHU staff and three interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to Epstein's cell door on the night 
of his death stated that no one entered or exited Epstein's cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein 
to his cell on August 9. None of the MCC New York staff members we interviewed were aware of 
any information suggesting Epstein's cause of death was something other than suicide. Additionally, 
none of the inmates we interviewed had any credible information suggesting Epstein's cause of 
death was something other than suicide. 
We noted as well that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological 
observation due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous nooses made from the excess prison 
sheets-linens were found in his cell on the morning of August 10; that no weapons were recovered 
from his cell after his death; and that he signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days 
EFTA00035825
--- PAGE 3 ---
before he died. We found that the staffs failure to assign Epstein a cellmate on August 9, to conduct 
rounds and counts that evening, and to allow him to have excess linens in his cell, left Epstein 
unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours, which provided him an opportunity to commit 
suicide. 
The DOJ OIG made nine recommendations to improve the Bars management of its correctional 
institutions. The BOP agreed with all nine recommendations.

Executive Summary 
This analysis, conducted in response to GAO Priority Recommendation 2*, examines the correlation between inmate participation in drug 
treatment programs and staffing levels from FY2021 to FY2024. This analysis examines (1) the correlation between inmate participation in 
drug treatment programs and the total number of BOP employees, and (2) the correlation between inmate participation in drug 
treatment programs and the number of filled FSA positions. Findings reflect correlation only and do not imply causation. 
Key 
• 
• 
Insights 
Total Number of BOP Employees 
• 
No correlation between the total number of BOP employees and the number of inmates 
participating in all drug treatment programs. 
• 
No correlation between the total number of BOP employees and the number of inmates 
participating in individual drug treatment programs.** 
Number of Filled FSA Positions 
• 
No correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of inmates 
participating in the Drug Education Program, RDAP, or Community Treatment programs. 
• 
Moderate correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the total number 
of inmates participating in all drug treatment programs. 
• 
Moderate correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of 
inmates participating in NRDAP. 
• 
Strong correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of 
inmates participating in the MAT Program. 
There is no trend indicating 
that changes in the number 
of BOP employees affect 
inmate participation in 
drug treatment programs. 
This indicates that increases 
in filled FSA positions are 
generally associated with 
higher inmate participation 
in certain drug treatment 
programs, though other 
factors may also play a role. 
*GAO Priority RocommPndation 2: "The Director of BOP should develop and implement a plan for analyzing data to help identify and address the causes and potential impacts of staffing challenges on staff and inmates" 
**Individual drug treatment programs include the following: Drug Education Program, RDAP, NRDAP, Community Treatment Program, and MAT Program.

I. INTRODUCTION 
For this module of Back 2 Basics, we will be reviewing policy and procedures for effectively 
performing duties when managing a housing unit. 
Note: Refer to the Participant and Group packets. 
Note: Describe the logistics of the training. This should include start time, stop time, breaks, 
location change (if applicable), etc. 
Note: Ask if there are any questions before continuing. Address all questions. 
II. POST ORDERS 
A. General Post Orders 
Note: Instruct participants to look at their individual packets for specific post orders. 
Post Orders describe all procedures and any special instructions regarding a specific post. Per 
Program Statement, Correctional Services Procedures Manual, post orders must be based on 
Bureau and institution policies, must state each post's duty hours, and must be prepared under 
the Captain's supervision and direction. 
Note: Discuss procedures for reviewing and signing post orders in the Lieutenant's office. 
Discussion: What is the procedure if there is no opportunity to review post orders? 
In these cases, it is the responsibility of the employee to inform the employer of the fact they 
have not been able or afforded the opportunity to read such orders. The employer will then 
advise the employee of the general requirements of the post and answer any questions. 
Employees assuming posts under these circumstances still have the responsibility of 
exercising sound correctional judgment based upon their training and experience and will 
make reasonable efforts to read the post orders as soon as practicable. 
Note: Refer to the Group Resource Manual. Ask them to take a look at the Title and 
Location of Post Orders and Post Order Review Sheet noting the areas where signatures are 
needed. Ask if there are any questions before continuing. 
Each post order will contain instructions regarding the immediate action an employee should 
take in an emergency situation. These "first responder" instructions should contain specific 
action steps including, but not limited to, containment, employee protective considerations, 
and emergency reporting protocols. Particular requirements regarding assaultive inmates, 
suicides, fires, evacuation routes, and other "immediate" response emergency situations are 
addressed and are consistent with the corresponding Emergency Plan.

Instructor Guide 
B. Specific Post Orders 
Note: Refer to the Group Resource Manual as needed for the next section. 
All post orders contain five (5) separate sections in the following order: 
Section 1: Activities listed chronologically with responsibilities clearly defined. 
Section 2: Special instructions relating to the specific post. 
Section 3: General Post Orders - applicable to all posts. 
Section 4: List of Program Statements and Institution Supplements relevant to the post. 
Section 5: Employee Signature sheet. 
Post orders and log books are confidential documents and should never be left unattended or 
in an area accessible to inmates. They must be secured at all times when not in use by 
employees. 
Knowledge Check: Where are the Post Orders located in housing units at this institution? 
Knowledge Check: Where should you log pertinent information regarding inmates? 
Note: Ask if there are any questions regarding Post Orders. Upon completion of discussion, 
continue with instruction. 
III. ASSUMING DUTIES OF A CORRECTIONAL POST 
Discussion: What are some of the first things you must do upon arriving? 
A. Begin Logging Documentation 
According to the Correctional Services Procedures Manual and our identified post orders, you 
must begin logging documentation in TRUSCOPE. 
Items that must be logged upon assuming the post include: 
• 
Date 
• 
Shift 
• 
Base count of the unit (number of inmates) 
• 
Your name (printed legibly) 
• 
Key ring number 
• 
Number of keys 
• 
Equipment 
• 
Details about the fire alarm panel (indicating if it is operational) 
Back 2 Basics 
Managing Housing Units, Part I 
EFTA00035854
--- PAGE 8 ---
FY2024 
BACK 2 BASICS 
Instructor Guide 
Knowledge Check: What should you do if the fire alarm panel is not operational? 
B. Contact Control 
In addition to logging in the details of equipment, you should contact Control and, with their 
approval, 
• 
conduct a test of your radio/body alarm, and, 
• 
verify the unit count. 
C. Dial in with the Operations Lieutenant 
Once the base documentation is logged, you may contact the Operations Lieutenant or dial in 
for a briefing. It is at this time you should address any questions or concerns you may have 
about the shift. 
Note: Discuss local procedures for contacting Operations Lieutenant upon assuming duties. 
IV. ACCOUNTABILITY OF INMATES ON DETAIL 
Accounting for inmate work detail is a crucial part of inmate accountability as all departments 
and locations throughout the institution are responsible. If an inmate on your work detail is 
missing, the inmate is considered 'absent' and you should follow all procedures for locating the 
absentee inmate. 
Each detail supervisor should carry the updated and current electronic printout with them 
throughout the day. 
Note: Refer to your institution's procedures for printing and collecting Detail/Crew Kit Cards. 
A. Detail/Crew Kit Cards 
The Detail Crew Kit on BOPWARE will automatically be updated to reflect new admissions and 
any job or quarter's changes via SENTRY. Each crew kit has current detail cards on all inmates 
assigned to the detail. The printouts are never to be left unattended or in an area accessible to 
inmates. At a minimum, crew kit cards provide: 
• Names of the inmates; 
• Register number; 
• Current photo (a new photo must be made whenever an inmate's appearance changes); 
• Job assignment; 
• Quarters assignment; 
• Custody level; and 
• Any special conditions. 
Back 2 Basics 
Managing Housing Units, Part I 
EFTA00035855
--- PAGE 9 ---
FY2024 
BACK 2 BASICS 
Instructor Guide 
Inmates will never be allowed to handle detail/crew kits and/or the cards assigned to the kits. 
Note: Discuss how to identify an inmate that is on the posted picture file. The inmate is 
identified with an asterisk. 
Note: Discuss local procedures for reporting discrepancies in detail/crew kit cards. 
Note: Discuss the shift/responsibility for collecting the detail/crew kits for your local 
institution. 
Note: Discuss the specific location where the detail/crew kits can be found in the housing 
units (e.g., top drawer in desk of officer's station, etc.). 
B. Detail Accountability Checks 
Detail accountability checks are conducted to identify inmates in unauthorized areas, and to 
determine the presence and accuracy of detail cards (crew kit cards). 
AM/PM census checks will be documented on Daily Fire and Security Inspection Reports. You 
must conduct an AM/PM census of all inmates assigned to your area during each work period. 
Any discrepancies found during the census will be recorded on the inspection report and must 
be reported to the Operations Lieutenant immediately. 
C. Excusing Inmates from Detail 
Knowledge Check: Who can authorize excusing an inmate from work? 
The Associate Warden overseeing the department maintains the sole authority to "lay in" a 
Work Detail. Detail Supervisors are not authorized to release inmates from their assigned 
details prior to the end of normal working hours. 
As an additional note, Detail Supervisors will not make sick call appointments for inmates. 
V. LOCATING AN ABSENTEE INMATE 
If you are responsible for managing the housing unit, it is your responsibility to locate the 
inmate on your work detail. With that in mind, make proper notifications and take appropriate 
action against the inmate right away. 
Knowledge Check: What are the steps to take if inmates are missing or absent from their 
work? 
Note: Allow input from employees before continuing. 
Back 2 Basics 
Managing Housing Units, Part I 
EFTA00035856
--- PAGE 10 ---
FY2024 
BACK 2 BASICS 
Instructor Guide 
Per Program Statement 5500.14, inmates who are missing or absent from their work details 
should be located in the following manner: 
1. Take immediate action to locate the inmate if the inmate does not report to work as 
scheduled within ten (10) minutes or fails to return from an appointment. 
2. Exhaust all avenues of locating the inmate by calling appointments, the inmate's assigned 
housing unit, visiting room (if applicable), and Health Services. If the absent inmate cannot 
be located after ten (10) minutes, notify the Lieutenants Office. At this point, the 
Lieutenants Office will assume responsibility for locating the inmate. 
3. The Lieutenant will ensure proper notifications are made and proper action is taken when 
the inmate is found. 
Note: Discuss the following in as much detail as needed for your location. 
A. Daily Change/Transfer Sheet 
The Daily Change/Transfer Sheet is a SENTRY generated list which denotes changes in an 
inmate's status. This sheet must be published each regular work day. It includes changes in the 
following: 
• 
Housing unit; 
• 
Job assignment; 
• 
Medical idle; and/or, 
• 
Convalescence which exceeds one (1) day. 
Note: Identify where and how employees can locate the Daily Change/Transfer Sheet in your 
local housing units. 
B. Inmate Callouts 
The Call-Out sheet lists appointments inmates have with employees and is produced by 
SENTRY. As you know, it lists the reporting time and physical area where inmates are scheduled 
to report. The Call-Out sheet is made available to employees and posted in the inmate housing 
units. The employee who places the inmate on call-out must ensure the requested inmate 
arrives at the specified time. 
Discussion: Who is responsible for ensuring the inmate arrives to the callout at the specific 
time? 
Note: Identify where and how employees can locate the Inmate Callouts in your local 
housing units. 
Back 2 Basics

EFTA00035857
--- PAGE 11 ---
FY2024 
BACK 2 BASICS 
Instructor Guide 
C. Sick Call 
Discussion: What are times and days for Sick Call? 
For Sick Call, inmates will report to the Health Services Department. When an inmate, for 
medical reasons, is excused from work, Health Services employees will issue two (2) copies of 
the Medical Idle Authorization to the inmate. The inmate will retain one copy of the idle and 
deliver the second copy to the Housing Unit Officer. 
Knowledge Check: Who is responsible for notifying the work supervisor of the inmate's idle 
status? 
The Unit Officer will notify the work supervisor of the inmate's idle status. 
Once an appointment is made, the inmate will return to their unit until the assigned 
appointment. Inmates will return to Health Services during the assigned movement and remain 
there until released by the Health Services employees. 
D. SENTRY 
Discussion: What are the SENRY functions that may be used for locating an inmate? 
Some of the most notable options include PP42/PP44, Current Assignments and PP37, History. 
Note: Discuss any additional SENTRY options, as needed or mentioned by employees. 
VI. ACTIVITY #1— LOCATING AN ABSENTEE INMATE 
Note: Distribute the worksheet for Activity #1 — Locating an Absentee Inmate, one (1) per 
group. Facilitate the activity using the instructor notes provided. Upon completion, continue 
instruction. 
VII. CONDUCTING ROUNDS 
A. Irregular Rounds 
Every employee is responsible for the custody, control, supervision, and accountability of all 
inmates in their area of responsibility and supervision. 
Housing unit posts should make irregular rounds of the units they are assigned. Although there 
are no scheduled rounds when moves are open, it is imperative to make rounds for the security 
and orderly operation of the institution once moves are closed and the unit is locked. Upon 
completion of each round, notification of completion and any additional notes should be logged 
Back 2 Basics 
Managing Housing Units, Part I 
EFTA00035858

FY2024 
BACK 2 BASICS 
Instructor Guide 
into TRUSCOPE. 
Note: Discuss any additional local procedures for conducting rounds. 
B. Rounds During Lock Down Status in the Housing Unit 
Per policy, when inmates are in lock down status, rounds must be conducted at least once in 
the first 30 minute period of the hour (example, 12:00 a.m. — 12:30 a.m.) followed by another 
round in the second 30 minute period of the same hour (example, 12:30 a.m. — 1:00 a.m.). This 
ensures that an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be conducted 
on an irregular schedule and no more than forty (40) minutes apart. 
Note: Clearly define lock down status as applicable to housing units during normal 
operations. 
VIII. ACTIVITY #2 — CONDUCTING ROUNDS IN THE HOUSING UNIT 
Note: Distribute the worksheet for Activity #2 — Conducting Rounds in the Housing Unit, one 
per group. Facilitate the activity using the instructor notes provided. Upon completion, 
continue instruction. 
IX. CONDUCTING FIRE AND SECURITY CHECKS 
Each detail supervisor or departmental employee will conduct a daily security and fire 
inspection of their assigned area. The result of these inspections will be submitted on your 
local Daily or Weekly Security and Fire Inspection Report. Employees will use TRUSCOPE to log 
in the time conducted and findings, if applicable. 
The areas listed on the Daily Security and Fire Inspection Report should be completed at the 
conclusion of each manned shift. 
Knowledge Check: When should the Daily Fire and Security Checks be conducted? 
Note: Provide any feedback and/or procedures for your local facility. 
A. Fire and Security Inspection Report, Daily 
While managing a housing unit, you will be expected to perform the fire and security inspection 
in accordance with outlined procedures. Upon completion of the inspection, you will document 
your findings in TRUSCOPE noting any discrepancies found, along with the action taken to 
address the problem. If the discrepancy is considered significant or major, you will contact the 
Lieutenant's office immediately. 
Note: Refer to the Participant Manual for the Daily Fire and Security Inspection Report.

(1) per group. Facilitate the activity using the instructor notes provided. Upon completion, 
continue instruction. 
XI. CONDUCTING SEARCHES OF THE HOUSING UNIT 
A. Searches of the Housing Unit 
The inspection of a housing unit is primarily designed to detect contraband, prevent escapes, 
maintain sanitation standards, and to eliminate fire and safety hazards. Frequent and irregular 
searches should be conducted of all inmate living areas to include: 
• 
Cells 
• 
Cubicles 
• 
Storage rooms

EFTA00035860
--- PAGE 14 ---
FY2024 
BACK 2 BASICS 
Instructor Guide 
Note: Identify how searches of the housing unit should be documented at your local facility. 
Approaches to conduct searches in all areas of the housing unit include: 
1. Visual 
A visual inspection must be conducted inside the unit for items such as bent or spread bars, 
broken welds, cracked or cut bars, and any sign of steel filings. Any other evidence of 
tampering or weakness such as fresh paint or discolored areas is to be thoroughly investigated. 
2. Bar Tapping 
Accurate bar taps call for the use of a mallet to tap security bars and frames to set up vibrations 
which, by their deviation from normal sound, would indicate tampering or weakness. All 
housing unit bars within the institution will be tapped weekly, and this information should be 
recorded accordingly. 
Note: Discuss procedures for recording bar taps at your local institution. 
3. Metal Instrument 
A thin instrument such a putty knife can be passed along frames or bars to locate cuts or 
depressions which might indicate tampering. The instrument can also be used as a probe to 
uncover cuts filled with soap, putty, or other substances. 
Knowledge Check: How often are bar taps completed? 
Note: Explain the location and/or procedures for obtaining tools used for conducting 
searches. 
4. Mirror 
A mirror is an effective instrument for examining areas that would ordinarily be difficult to 
inspect. A mirror may be used to inspect any area that ordinarily would be difficult to observe 
during a routine visual inspection. 
Knowledge Check: What areas in the housing units are best searched using a mirror? 
B. Searches of Inmate Cells 
Employees may search an inmate's housing area and any personal items contained within an 
area, without prior notice, inmate approval, or inmate's presence. An inmate will be removed 
from the cell and searched prior to the cell search. When conducting the cell search, all items

False shoe bottoms, secret compartments and hollow legs are possibilities for concealing 
contraband. 
Discussion: What are some other common areas for concealing contraband that have not 
been mentioned? 
The employee searching the cell will be responsible for noting the date, time, inmate's name, 
inmate's register number, cell/room number, results, and name of searching employee in 
TRUSCOPE. 
Identify how cell searches should be documented at your local facility. 
C. Contraband

• 
Tobacco and other items hidden in Bibles 
Note: Discuss additional contraband items and locations. 
When conducting searches of inmates, housing units, and cells, it is important to be familiar 
with items inmates may and may not have. When in doubt, you can refer to the local 
Commissary List and/or the Inmate Personal Property List. You may also ask the inmate to 
provide a receipt of purchased items. 
Note: Inform participants to refer to the local Commissary Sheet and/or Inmate Personal 
Property List in the Participant Manual as needed. 
Knowledge Check: What would you do if you found an item you suspected was contraband 
but wasn't completely sure? 
1. Areas Approved for Inmate Property Storage 
Inmates in the general population housing units will be issued specific locations for the storage 
of personal property, for example, lockers. Items authorized outside of the areas may include 
items such as: 
• 
One (1) mesh laundry bag 
• 
Footwear 
• 
Issued clothing 
Property storage may not be in offices of the unit team or the correctional supervisor except in 
temporary, emergency situations. 
Note: Discuss specific locations in your location for property storage. Discuss any special 
instructions (e.g., shoes should be stored under the bunks). 
2. Confiscation and Disposal of Contraband 
Confiscated contraband will be disposed of in accordance with institution procedures. 
Exceptions from these procedures can only be made upon written authorization of the Warden 
or his designee.

and Inmate Cells, one (1) per group. Facilitate the activity using the instructor notes 
provided. Upon completion, continue instruction. 
XIII. CONDUCTING BED BOOK AUDITS 
Knowledge Check: When should employees conduct a bed book audit? 
Note: Allow participants to provide feedback. Provide feedback for your local facility. 
A minimum of one (1) bed book audit will be conducted every 24-hour period to ensure the 
accuracy of inmate assignments. 
Note: Provide information on where/how the Bed Book is retrieved/located at your local 
facility. 
The Bed Book contains the following information for each inmate: 
• 
Inmate's name 
• 
Register number 
• 
Cell location 
• 
Job assignment 
• 
Custody level 
• 
Any additional information (e.g., medical information) 
Bed Book Cards are strictly confidential and should never be viewed by inmates. 
A. Procedures for Conducting a Bed Book Count 
At least two (2) employees will conduct bed book audits. Inmates must be positively identified 
using printed pictures, by asking the inmates to state both their name and register number. 
Both employees must agree the inmate matches the picture, name, and register number on the 
bed book card. Inmates must also be in their assigned cell as documented in the bed book and 
unit SENTRY roster. 
The first employee will carry the SENTRY roster while the second employee will carry the Bed 
Book picture roster. Upon completing count, both officers verify all inmates are present, 
compare the numbers with each of the counting employee, and identify any inmates not

Employees will then call Control Center and verify this information. 
B. Updating an Inmate's Picture Card 
Discussion: What issues warrant the update of a picture card? 
When conducting a Bed Book count, you may discover that an inmate has changed their 
physical appearance. If this is the case, the following standard operating procedures should 
occur: 
1. Find correct inmate Picture Card on file. 
2. Write and submit a memorandum to the Unit Team requesting a new picture be taken and 
explain why. 
3. Use reverse side of Picture Card to note changes in the inmate's physical appearance. 
4. Return Picture Card file to proper secure location. 
Knowledge Check: Who can request the update of a picture card? 
Any employee can submit the request for an inmate's picture card to be updated. The same 
procedures mentioned above will apply to any employee submitting the request. 
1. Locate inmate's Picture Card. 
2. Record information from inmate's Picture Card into assigned bed/cell slot in unit Bed Book. 
3. File inmate's Picture Card with your unit cards.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Slide 1- Conducting Searches 
Since inmates often possess different types of contraband, find ways to modify government-
issued items inappropriately, and create weapons out of any type of material, inmates and all 
areas of our institution must be searched routinely at irregular times. Conducting searches is 
an important part of a correctional workers duties and responsibilities. This lesson provides the 
information you will need to perform a thorough search of inmates and all areas that inmates 
have access. Our objectives for this lesson are: 
Slide 2 — Objectives 
• 
Identify the purpose and importance of conducting searches. 
• 
Identify the general guidelines for conducting searches. 
• 
Given an inmate living area, an institution space or open area, and search equipment, each 
participant will conduct pat and area searches. 
• 
Identify the proper sequence of steps used in conducting a visual search, as delineated in 
this course of instruction. 
Slide 3 - Reasons for Conducting Searches 
II. CONDUCTING SEARCHES 
A. Reasons for conducting searches 
There are critical reasons for conducting searches which relate to safety and well-being. It is 
important to remember searches are not conducted for the purpose of harassing inmates. 
Reasons that searches are conducted are to: 
1. Protect staff and inmates 
The most important reason for conducting searches is to protect employees and inmates. 
Searches help us maintain a safe and secure environment for everyone. 
2. Detect and remove contraband 
Contraband may be a restricted item or an excessive amount of permitted items. Searches 
allow staff members to locate and remove contraband items. 
3. Prevent escapes

Agri! 2015 
Instructor Guide 
Through searches, staff may uncover tools or devices that could be used in an escape attempt. 
Staff members also inspect buildings and structures for signs of tampering. 
4. Maintain sanitary standards 
Institution areas must be kept neat and clean for health purposes. Searches ensure sanitary 
conditions meet established standards. 
5. Eliminate fire and safety hazards 
Area searches help uncover fire and safety hazards such as exposed or faulty electrical wires. 
When such hazards are discovered, they must be reported for repair. 
Slide 4 - Reference Materials 
B. Reference Materials 
Your primary references for conducting searches will be PS 5500.11,Correctional Services 
Manual and Program Statement 5521.05, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work 
Areas. These sources provide thorough coverage as follows: 
1. The Correctional Services Manual provides guidance on records and methods of inspection. 
It also provides guidance to search visually and how to use instruments during a search. For 
example, it tells how to use a mallet for tapping and how to use metal instruments to check for 
cuts or other signs of tampering. 
Detailed instructions for searching inmates and specific areas such as housing units, utility 
rooms, shops, and buildings are also provided. 
2. The PS 5521.05, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas explains how 
and why search procedures are established. It also outlines documentation requirements for 
searches. 
3. Local Procedures such as the list of items carried by our institution Commissary and the list 
of locally authorized inmate personal property are two other important sources of information. 
You can use these lists to help you tell the difference between authorized items and nuisance 
contraband. 
Slide 5 - Search Conditions 
Introduction to Correctional Techniques 
Conducting Searches 
Phase I 
Tab 22 
EFTA00035884
--- PAGE 5 ---
April 2015 
Instructor Guide 
C. Search Conditions 
It is important you understand the conditions under which searches are conducted. In this 
section, we will discuss when these searches are performed and who is authorized to perform 
them. 
• 
When to conduct searches? 
Searches are performed according to scheduled Post Orders and/or supervisory instructions. 
Searches may be performed any time of the day or night, during any shift. They may be 
scheduled or unscheduled. 
• 
Who may conduct searches? 
All staff members are authorized and encouraged to perform random searches. In certain 
institution areas such as the living quarters, dining hall, Health Services Department, or library, 
specific staff may be assigned to conduct a search. Any staff member may be asked to search a 
specific inmate or area at any time. 
Slide 6 - Types of Searches 
III. TYPES OF SEARCHES 
Now that we have discussed why searches are performed, sources for additional information, 
and search conditions, we will move on to the actual steps for conducting various searches. 
Slide 7 - Types of Searches - Area Searches 
A. Area Searches 
1. Initiate the search 
First, determine the type of search to be conducted. You can do this by following your Post 
Orders and/or contacting your supervisor. In general, searches are performed as follows: 
• 
Daily security inspections are conducted during each shift. 
• 
Searches of living quarters or individual cells are conducted daily on a routine and random 
basis. 
• 
Searches of other areas (such as UNICOR, education building, electrical shop, library, or 
yard) are conducted daily on an irregular time schedule. 
• 
Institution grounds inspections are conducted frequently on an irregular schedule. 
Introduction to Correctional Techniques 
Conducting Searches 
Phase I 
Tab 22 
EFTA00035885
--- PAGE 6 ---
April 2015 
Instructor Guide 
Note: Show an Institution Search Log. 
If appropriate, determine the specific living quarters/cell to be searched by referring to the unit 
or area search log book located at the Unit Officer's station. The search log book identifies all 
areas/cells recently searched and the contraband found and documented by the staff member. 
Referring to the unit or area search log book prior to conducting a search may help eliminate 
different staff searching the same area or cell on different shifts. It also helps to identify other 
areas in need of searching and reduces the appearance of harassing a particular inmate. 
2. Obtain search tools 
The right tools make a search job much simpler, safer, and more effective. Used correctly, the 
recommended tools will help you uncover concealed evidence without putting yourself in 
danger. 
Note: Display tools used in searches. 
Obtain any necessary tools before you begin an area search: 
• 
Screwdrivers (Phillips head and flat head) to disassemble equipment or other items. 
• 
Mirrors with a long handle to look under, over, or behind objects. 
• 
A flashlight to see under furniture, equipment, or other dark areas. 
• 
Appropriate keys to open locks and lockers. 
• 
Probing devices to check dense areas such as the ground. 
• 
A mallet to tap items such as bars and grilles. It can also be used to inspect walls where 
paint chips are detected. 
• 
A putty knife to check window sashes, sills, and bars. The knife can also be used to inspect 
hidden areas, such as the ledge behind a piece of heavy furniture. 
• 
A hand-held metal detector to find concealed contraband items, such as knives or razor 
blades in a mattress, pillow, or clothing. 
3. Dealing with the presence of inmates 
Inmates are not allowed to observe a search or to remain in an area which is being searched. 
If inmates are in the area to be searched, pat search them and direct them to leave the area.

--- PAGE 7 ---
April 2015 
Instructor Guide 
Note: Inmate pat searches will be discussed later in this lesson plan. 
4. Plan a systematic search process. 
Area searches must be conducted in a thorough, systematic manner. They are not random spot 
checks. 
The area search process is detailed and careful preparation is necessary. Think of the plan you 
will develop as a road map for your area search. Prepare a plan for the area being searched. Be 
sure the plan is thorough and systematic. 
• 
How do you plan to tackle this assignment? What approach will you take? 
• 
Assess the area to be searched. What is the size of the area? Where are the doors and 
windows? 
• 
Look over the actual area to be searched. Establish an overall impression and identify 
anything suspicious. Check all parts of the area thoroughly, but also try to imagine yourself 
as an inmate. Where would you hide something? 
• 
Select a starting point and determine a systematic approach. You may start anywhere, but 
search the entire area systematically to ensure thorough coverage. For example, you may 
enter at the cell door and search from the left, inspecting all items from top to bottom. 
5. Inspecting the area and all contents 
Note: Describe Typical Hiding Locations. 
a. Review search strategy. 
Keep the following points in mind as you begin your search: 
• 
Follow your search plan. Even if you find contraband, you must continue searching until 
you have covered the entire area. Contraband may have been planted in several places. 
Sometimes, a minor contraband item is planted to bait and distract you from a more serious 
article. 
• 
Plan to conduct your search so all legitimate articles and bedding may be left as neat and 
orderly as you found them at the beginning of the search. 
• 
Focus on maintaining your concentration throughout the search. This is a detailed task and 
it is important you keep your mind on what you are doing.

Conducting Searches 
Phase I 
Tab 22 
EFTA00035887
--- PAGE 8 ---
April 2015 
Instructor Guide 
Note: Discuss possible distractions. 
b. Consider safety. 
(1) Concealed contraband. 
Inmates may conceal contraband such as needles, razor blades, tattoo paraphernalia, and other 
sharp objects out of plain view of staff. For this reason, use extreme caution to never run 
hands along a surface they have not visually inspected, and remember to never put hands or 
fingers anywhere you cannot see. 
Avoid squeezing inmate clothing and laundry items to avoid injury in the event that contraband 
may be concealed in these items. Always visually inspect, unfold, and shake these items prior 
to searching. Further prevention strategies include the use of the search tools mentioned 
above. 
If contraband is, in fact, discovered, be cautious. Always use a search tool to pick up needles, 
razor blades, or other sharp objects. When transporting these types of contraband, continue to 
use caution by placing the items in a sharps container, when applicable. 
(2) Exposure to Blood borne Pathogens. 
Exposed employees must report all exposures to their immediate supervisor as soon as 
possible. Prompt reporting of exposure incidents ensures timely medical evaluation and follow-
up. If evaluation of the circumstances indicates post-exposure treatment, the exposed 
employee will benefit from the prompt initiation of treatment. 
c. Search the area. 
Check all movable or installed items and equipment. Use tools as appropriate to search 
inaccessible areas and protect yourself. For example, use the mirror, probe, or metal detector 
to check inaccessible areas. Take note of unusual circumstances or needed repairs. 
(1) Inspect all furniture. Concentrate on hollow legs, cracks, and crevices; underside; and any 
upholstered cushions. 
• 
Check beds and upholstered furniture thoroughly. 
• Strip the bed. Examine all pillows, sheets, covers, blankets, and the mattress carefully. 
Check to see if contraband has been pinned or sewn to any item. 
• 
Search the mattress, pillows, and cushions for hard objects. Consider using the metal 
detector to protect yourself from sharp items such as needles and blades.

• 
Check the underside of all furniture such as chairs, tables, and stools. Look for taped or 
stuck items and small holes bored into the wood. Contraband could be plugged into holes 
by paper or wooden plugs. 
(2) Inspect any plumbing fixtures such as toilets, wash basins, shower stalls, water fountains, 
and ice machines. Concentrate on the legs, cracks, and crevices; the underside and inside of all 
water-holding devices. Ensure you: 
• Flush toilets and look for suspicious water flow. 
• Drain water, if possible. Run fresh water to check for contraband hidden in pipes. 
• Inspect drains. Remove drain grilles where possible, and look for contraband suspended on 
thin wire or thread. 
(3) Inspect ventilation devices. Remove ventilation grilles where possible and look for 
contraband suspended on thin wire or thread. 
(4) Inspect electrical fixtures. Remove light fixture covers, light bulbs, and electrical face 
plates. 
(5) Inspect doors, windows, bars, and wall surfaces. Concentrate on cracks, crevices, locks, 
caulking, recent repairs, and bars that have been bent, broken, or tampered with. 
(6) Inspect mechanical equipment. Ensure power to equipment is turned off before you open 
and inspect it. 
(7) Inspect all items and materials stored in area. 
Ensure you: 
• 
Check all personal items such as picture frames, toothpaste, and medicine containers. 
• 
Look for expired medications or those issued to an inmate other than the one whose locker 
you are checking. Look for false bottoms and examine contents. 
• 
Check all institution items such as trash cans, brooms, and cleaning utensils/supplies. 
• Inspect all packaging, such as soap bars. Ensure the seals have not been tampered with. If 
seals have been opened, check contents carefully. 
• Inspect all books, magazines, and papers within the area. Check the bindings and covers. 
Look between individual pages.

• Confiscate all contraband found in the area. Remember to follow the proper procedures for 
the confiscation of contraband and inmate personal property. 
Note: Review procedures for confiscating contraband. 
In outdoor areas concentrate on recently transplanted trees, shrubs, and flowers. Check areas 
where repairs have caused soil displacement. The dense undergrowth creates an ideal 
hiding/burial spot. 
• Drive probes into the ground in recently planted areas. Investigate suspicious areas. 
• Use hand-held metal detectors to check for weapons and other contraband. 
6. Leave the area as you found it. 
As we discussed, area searches are necessary in institution life. However, a little consideration 
on your part will go a long way in helping inmates accept the intrusion. Treat their property 
with respect by: 
• 
Ensuring the area is returned to its original condition as neatly as possible. There should be 
little evidence that a search was performed. 
• 
Folding bedding items neatly and place them on the bed. Staff members are not required 
to remake an inmate's bed after removing all bed clothing while conducting a search. 
• 
Replacing personal items to the approximate location they were found prior to the search. 
Remember that a cell is an inmate's home. 
7. Document the search. 
Each time you complete a search, you must complete the necessary documentation. Complete 
a log entry to document your actions and findings. If necessary, write a memorandum and/or 
an Incident Report. 
(1) living quarters 
Note: Display Unit Search Log. 
• If you find contraband, remove it from the living quarters. Tell your supervisor, and 
determine appropriate actions to take regarding confiscation and disposal of contraband. 
• Document your search in the Unit Search Log. (It is important to document the fact that 
you conducted a search, whether or not you found contraband.) This documentation

proves the Bureau of Prisons is doing everything it can to make the institution safe and 
secure. 
Note: Refer to Appendix. 
If you find hard contraband or contraband of significance, you must document your findings as 
follows: 
• 
If your finding can be directly attributed to one inmate, complete an Incident Report. In 
addition, if you know of any recent event or sensitive information that may relate to your 
finding, write a memorandum to your shift supervisor to support the Incident Report. 
• 
If your finding cannot be attributed to a single inmate, write a memorandum to the Captain 
through your shift supervisor. 
All Incident Reports and memorandums should include the following information: 
• Name and register number of the inmate whose cell was searched 
• Number of the cell searched 
• Name of the officer conducting the search 
• Time of search 
• 
List of any contraband discovered 
• Disposition of the contraband 
(2) areas outside living quarters 
• If you find contraband, remove it from the area. Tell your supervisor, and determine 
appropriate actions to take regarding confiscation and disposal of contraband. 
Note: Explain how to complete a log book entry. 
• Document your search in the area log or lieutenant's log. (It is important to document the 
fact you conducted a search and whether contraband was found.) 
• If you found hard contraband or contraband of significance, write a memorandum. If your 
finding can be directly attributed to an inmate, complete an Incident Report. 
8. Submit work requests 
During your search, you may find areas that need repair and/or further inspection. Perhaps you 
noticed plumbing or structural problems. In such cases you should submit a work request. 
Note: 
Describe local procedures used to submit work orders.

9. Practice area search 
We have discussed the fundamentals of conducting an area search. Now you will have the 
opportunity to practice what you have just learned. 
Note: 
Assign the participants to conduct a limited area search of identified areas. Observe the participants as 
they conduct this exercise to ensure they are using proper search techniques. Provide feedback as 
needed. 
Note: 
Did you have any problems with completing the area search? Did you find anything which requires an 
Incident Report, a Work Request, or memorandum? How would you document the area search? 
Encourage discussion. 
Slide 8 - Types of Searches - Pat Searches 
B. Pat searches 
1. When to conduct pat searches? 
• 
Staff may conduct a pat search of an inmate on a routine or random basis to control 
contraband. 
• 
Inmates should be pat searched several times a day at non-scheduled intervals. 
• 
Inmates should be randomly pat searched when they move from one area of the institution 
to another. For example: pat searches should be conducted during open movements, 
entering or exiting inmate housing units, when inmates leave a work assignment, or when 
they return to the work site after a scheduled call-out, religious activity, etc. Inmates must 
assume a pat search will be conducted at any time and any place. Inmates must be 
uncertain as to when, where and how they will be questioned and searched. 
2. Who conducts pat searches? 
A pat search may be conducted by any staff member, at any time, and on any inmate of either 
gender. 
3. Pat Searches of Staff and Inmate Visitors 
The following procedures apply to searching staff and inmate visitors, both social and legal, 
official visitors, contractors, and volunteers, upon entering Bureau grounds or facilities. 
Persons refusing to submit to or comply with authorized Bureau search procedures will be 
denied entry or required to leave. 
A pat search of an inmate visitor or staff member will be conducted in the same manner as an 
inmate pat search with the following exceptions:

Conducting Searches 
Phase I 
Tab 22 
EFTA00035892
--- PAGE 13 ---
April 2015 
Instructor Guide 
• 
Except in emergencies, pat searches of visitors/staff must be conducted by staff of the same 
sex as the non-inmate being searched. 
• 
Religious headwear is not considered part of a visitor's/staff's belongings, but rather their 
person. Random pat searches should NOT ordinarily include removal and inspection of 
religious headwear. Except in emergencies, Warden authorization is required before staff 
perform pat or visual searches of religious headwear. Searches of religious headwear 
should be conducted out of the view of other visitors and inmates. 
• 
Religious headwear that obscures a person's face must be removed sufficiently to reveal the 
face for identification upon entering and leaving facilities, and does not require the 
heightened conditions described above or documentation. In these cases, the entire 
headwear need not be removed if partial removal will reveal the face for identification. 
• 
Staff must be respectful of the belongings of others. Belongings and contents should not be 
handled carelessly, or in a manner that attracts unnecessary attention by others in the area. 
• 
Staff should not make unnecessary or inappropriate comments regarding their belongings 
that might cause embarrassment. 
• 
All containers —for example, purses, backpacks, and medication (prescription or over-the-
counter)— must be electronically screened or opened and inspected. 
Note: Pat Search Video 
4. Pat search video 
Before we get into the process of a pat search, I want to show you a video on the procedures 
we will be following. Please observe each step closely as these are the steps we will be 
following and on which you will be tested. 
Note: Direct the participants to remove the Pat Search Job Aids from the Appendix of their manuals. 
5. Initiate the pat search 
• 
Determine which inmate is to be searched. 
• 
Determine the location of the search. 
• 
Communicate your intentions to the inmate. 
Note: The presence of other inmates should not be a deterrent to performing an effective pat search.

6. Systematic steps in conducting a pat search 
The pat search is conducted utilizing a systematic step-by-step approach to ensure maximum 
effectiveness. During the performance evaluation, you must complete the pat search in the 
systematic order taught. 
Slide 9 - Types of Searches - Pat Search 
7. Conducting the pat search 
a. Pat search positioning 
While conducting a pat search, staff must remain alert to their surroundings and the inmate at 
all times. For safety, it is imperative that staff be aware of their positioning as well as the 
inmate's positioning throughout the pat search. 
(1) Inmate Positioning 
• 
The inmate will face away from the staff member during all hands-on search procedures. 
• 
While facing away from the staff member, the inmate will be instructed to stretch out their 
arms perpendicular to the inmate's side and parallel to the ground with palms facing up and 
fingers spread. 
• 
The staff member will instruct the inmate to place their feet shoulder width apart. 
• 
Throughout the pat search, the inmate will be instructed to turn. While the inmate is 
turning the staff member remains in place monitoring the inmate's actions. 
(2) Staff Member Positioning 
• 
The staff member will maintain a T-stance while conducting the pat search. 
• 
The staff member's head should never pass the plane of the inmate's side. (Example: Do 
not allow your head to be in a position where the inmate could strike with an elbow, arm or 
fist). 
• 
Larger inmates may require a staff member to move from one side to the other while 
searching the chest and waist area. The staff member will stay behind the inmate's 
outstretched arms at all times. 
• 
While searching the lower extremities, the staff member should maintain their T-stance 
while going to one knee. Never place both knees on the ground at the same time.

b. Removal of inmate's personal items 
• 
Direct the inmate to remove all items from their pockets. Instruct the inmate to place the 
items in a specific location (out of reach). Inspect the inmate's hands to ensure there is no 
concealed contraband in the hand or between the fingers. When conducting this 
procedure, observe the inmate's body language and movements, noting signs of anxiety or 
any attempt to throw away contraband. 
• 
Direct the inmate to remove any head wear (hats, clips, head bands, barrettes, or hair 
ornaments) and place it with the items removed from their pockets. 
c. Inspect the inmate's head and neck 
As part of a thorough pat search, you will start at the head and work your way down the 
inmate's body to the feet. However, there may be times that the inspection of the head will 
not be necessary. 
• 
Direct the inmate to lean forward and run their fingers vigorously through the hair several 
times to dislodge any hidden contraband items. 
d. Searching the inmate's arms and upper torso 
• 
Have the inmate turn and face away from you, raise their arms to the side, shoulder high 
with fingers spread, and palms facing up. From behind, visually look at the inmate's hands 
to ensure there is nothing concealed. 
• 
Search the inmate's collar by placing the collar material between your index finger and 
thumb, using both hands. Press the material, feeling for hidden contraband. Be sure to 
cover the entire length of the collar. 
• 
In a systematic method, search one shoulder, arm, and armpit at a time. Begin at the 
shoulder area with one hand flat against the back of the shoulder and the other flat against 
the front of the shoulder. Pressing the palms against the inmate's body and using a 
sweeping motion, work your hands from the shoulder to the wrist ensuring total coverage 
of the shoulder, armpit, and length of the arm. While searching the inmate's arms and 
upper torso, use a sweeping motion; do not squeeze or give the appearance of groping. 
Larger inmates may require a staff member to use a rotational sweeping motion in order to 
ensure all areas are properly searched. 
• 
Repeat this procedure to search the other shoulder, armpit, and arm.

• 
With your palms flat and thumbs aligned on each side of the spine, search the inmate's back 
and sides by pressing down as you work your way to the inmate's belt line. Considering the 
size of the inmate, this portion of the search may require more than one sweeping motion. 
• 
Go back to the armpit area. With both palms flat against the inmate's side, using a 
sweeping motion, search each side simultaneously down to the belt line. 
(1) 
Male Inmate 
• 
Once the back and sides have been completed, search the chest and stomach from behind. 
• 
Place both palms flat on the inmate's chest, near the top of the chest. In a downward 
sweeping motion, paying close attention to seams, button areas, and pockets, search to the 
inmate's belt line. 
(2) 
Female Inmate 
• 
Have the inmate lower one arm (your choice). 
• 
Place yourself to the side of her lowered arm, place your inside arm (forearm) in a position 
which affords protection of your groin, preventing the inmate from raising her arm. 
• 
With your outside hand in a position with all four fingers and thumb extended and joined 
together, and held in a vertical position, place the thumb side of your hand on the chest 
area starting at or above the sternum. Run your hand downward, circling under the breast, 
then upwards toward the armpit area, applying enough pressure to detect any contraband. 
• 
Check the abdomen area with the flat palm portion of the searching hand. 
• 
Repeat the above procedures for the other side. 
Larger inmates may require a staff member to move from one side to the other while searching 
the chest. Stay behind the inmate's outstretched arms at all times. 
e. Searching the belt line and waistband areas 
• 
This is a common area to hide sharp items - exercise caution when searching this area! 
• 
With the inmate's arms raised to the side, shoulder high, search the waistband of the 
inmate. Standing to the rear of the inmate, reach around the waist and begin at the navel 
area. Placing the trouser material between your fingers and thumb, pinch the material, 
working your way from the front to the rear on both sides, simultaneously.

• 
Once the waistband has been completed, using the same technique, search the belt. 
• 
Larger inmates may require a staff member to move from one side to the other while 
searching the belt and waistband. Stay behind the inmate's outstretched arms at all times. 
Slide 10 - Types of Searches - Pat Search 
f. Searching the lower abdomen and groin 
• 
Search the inmate's lower abdomen and groin area. This is accomplished by placing the 
palm flat, directly below the inmate's waistband, on the lower abdomen, with fingers 
aligned with the zipper. The other hand, the palm is flat, placed directly below the 
waistband on the inmate's buttocks. Move your hands downward in a sweeping motion 
toward the crotch area. 
• 
Pay special attention to the inmate's lower abdomen and crotch, carefully checking seams, 
waistbands, zippers, and buttons. 
Note: 
Explain to the participants to thoroughly search the crotch area, using a sweeping motion; do not 
squeeze or give the appearance of groping. 
g. Searching the legs 
• 
In a systematic method, search one leg at a time. Pressing the palms against the inmate's 
leg and using a sweeping motion, work your hands from the crotch area to the ankle. While 
searching the inmate's legs, use a sweeping motion; do not squeeze or give the appearance 
of groping. Larger inmates may require a staff member to use a rotational sweeping 
motion in order to ensure all areas are properly searched. 
h. Searching the socks and shoes 
• 
Inspect the shoe tops, and any area of the leg/ankle covered by socks. If you feel there is 
contraband, the inmate should be removed to an appropriate area for a visual search. 
• 
Remaining behind the inmate, move to the other side. Repeat the procedure to search the 
other side of the inmate's lower abdomen, groin, leg, and shoe. 
• 
Instruct the inmate to lift each foot, one at a time, showing you the bottom of the shoe. 
Visually inspect the bottoms of the shoes to ensure there is no item of contraband 
concealed on the bottom. Examine shoes closely for any split soles or removable heels. 
• 
Once the inmate has been searched, have the inmate lower their arms. 
i. Inspecting the inmate's possessions

• 
Inspect items removed from the inmate's pockets by visually and physically checking each, 
disassembling as necessary. 
• 
Inspect head wear for concealed items by running your fingers over material, folding down 
and checking under all hat bands and head bands. 
• 
Direct the inmate to retrieve their personal possessions. 
• 
Release the inmate to their assigned duty. 
j. Documenting confiscated contraband 
You have learned how to document confiscated contraband. Let's review the forms used in 
documenting confiscated contraband: 
• 
Confiscation and Disposition of Contraband form 
• 
Incident Report 
• 
Memorandum 
Slide 11 - Pat Search Special Concerns 
9. Pat search special concerns 
a. Casts and artificial limbs 
Dangerous weapons, drugs, and money are often concealed in casts and artificial limbs. 
• 
Inspect any plaster cast or artificial limb the inmate may have by using a flashlight and 
mirror. If you suspect the plaster cast conceals contraband, contact your supervisor for 
further instructions. 
• 
Inspect any artificial limb the inmate may be wearing by directing them to remove the limb 
and thoroughly searching the limb and all attaching hardware. This will be done in private. 
• 
Contact the Health Services Department if problems arise when searching inmates with 
either casts or artificial limbs. 
b. Dealing with the inmate 
Most inmates accept pat searches as a part of the normal day. Even so, you must: 
• 
Respect the inmate's right to not be harassed. 
Introduction to Correctional Techniques 
Conducting Searches 
Phase I 
Tab 22 
EFTA00035898
--- PAGE 19 ---

Instructor Guide 
• 
Be systematic when performing the pat search. 
• 
Maintain professionalism by conducting all searches in a calm, no-nonsense manner. 
• 
Remain alert at all times. Remember, keeping contraband out depends on how well you do 
your job. Others depend on you. 
c. If you suspect contraband or a weapon 
We must ensure our own safety while conducting searches. When contraband is suspected, 
you should have a second staff member assisting with the search. 
(1) Direct the inmate to face away from you with arms extended, palms up, and feet apart. 
(2) You may want to instruct the inmate to assume a position against a wall if possible. 
• 
Arms outstretched and palms of the hands on the wall. 
• 
Legs spread more than shoulder width. 
• 
Move feet away from the wall. 
(3) Request assistance and have the inmate submit to a visual search. 
Note: Direct participants to refer to the Job Aids located in the Appendix. 
9. Practice pat search 
The instructor will demonstrate the proper pat search technique with a volunteer member of 
the class or a member of the instructional team. Following the demonstration, each participant 
should be required to properly perform a thorough pat search on another participant. 
Note: The instructor should hide contraband on the person who is being searched. Using the evaluation form 
located in the Instructor Guide's Appendix to rate the participant's performance and provide feedback. 
C. Visual Search 
Slide 12 — Visual Search 
The intent of the pat search is to control the introduction of contraband in our institutions, 
ensuring a safe environment for staff and inmates. Pat searches do not detect all contraband; 
however, this important security procedure will assist in deterring the introduction and 
movement of contraband. If you suspect the inmate may possess contraband, which you did 
not detect during your pat search, you should initiate a visual search. We must ensure our own 
safety while conducting searches. If the staff member conducting the search believes they are

April 2015 
Instructor Guide 
at particular risk, they should immediately seek assistance. Staff should not try to remove any 
contraband from the inmate without a second staff member present. 
In a recorded case an inmate undergoing a visual search was found to have a greasy substance 
around his rectum. A digital and simple instrument search located an item, but the item could 
not be removed from the inmate's bowels. An x-ray revealed that the item was a small-caliber 
pistol. When the pistol was finally recovered, it was found that it did not have a trigger guard 
and that it was fully loaded! The pistol could have discharged at any time. The inmate had 
received the pistol and inserted it into his rectum while in the Visiting Room. A very alert 
Correctional Officer performing a professional visual search prevented this weapon from 
entering the institution. 
The visual search is probably the most sensitive search procedure you will conduct. As the 
name implies, a visual search involves the visual inspection of an inmate's body after all clothing 
has been removed. Unlike the pat search, staff members should never touch an inmate while 
conducting a visual search. 
Inmates may view visual searches as humiliating and feel it can be a form of harassment. 
Visual searches are extremely effective in preventing the introduction and circulation of 
contraband. As a correctional worker, a visual search is one of the many areas of your job that 
will test your professionalism. 
1. Purpose of a visual search 
Visual searches are conducted to protect staff members and inmates by controlling the 
introduction and conveyance of contraband into the institution. 
a. When to conduct visual search 
(1) Conduct a visual search when there is reasonable belief that contraband may be concealed 
on the inmate. 
(2) Conduct a visual search when a good opportunity for concealment has occurred. 
(3) Based on the security level of the institution, conduct a visual search when an inmate is 
entering or leaving the: 
• 
Visiting Room 
• 
Institution 
• 
Special Housing Unit 
(4) Conduct a visual search when an inmate has been apprehended after an escape or an 
escape attempt.

b. Who may conduct a visual search? 
(1) A routine visual search is conducted by staff members of the same sex as the inmate. 
(2) A staff member of the opposite sex may conduct the search in an emergency situation. The 
staff member must be fully prepared to articulate their actions and be able to document the 
conditions and reasons for the opposite sex search. A copy of the report will be placed in the 
inmate's central file. 
2. Systematic steps in conducting a visual search 
a. Initiating the visual search 
(1) Determine which inmate is to be searched. 
(2) Determine where the inmate is to be searched by locating an area out of public view, 
maintaining the inmate's dignity to the maximum extent possible. 
(3) Notify the inmate by verbally stating your intention to visually search them, and direct the 
inmate to the area where the search will take place. 
Slide 13 - Visual Search 
b. Conducting the visual search 
(1) Direct the inmate to remove all items from clothing pockets. 
• 
Direct the inmate where to place personal items. 
• 
Ensure the items are placed out of reach of the inmate. 
(2) Direct the inmate to remove all clothes. 
• 
As the inmate removes their clothes, watch for signs of anxiety or any attempt to throw 
away contraband. 
• 
Direct the inmate to place their clothes next to the items previously removed from the 
pockets. 
Inspect any artificial limbs the inmate may be wearing by directing the inmate to remove the 
limb and thoroughly search the limb and all attaching hardware. Dangerous weapons, drugs, 
and money are often concealed in artificial limbs.

If the inmate is wearing a cast, ask your supervisor for instructions. 
As you conduct the search, look for items taped to the inmate, fresh tattoos, or needle marks. 
If you encounter any of these situations, you should notify a supervisor upon completing the 
search. 
(3) Visually inspect the inmate's head: 
• 
Direct the inmate to bend forward at the waist, with head tilted down, run their fingers 
vigorously through their hair several times to dislodge any hidden contraband. 
Note: 
Advise students that inmates with hair that is unable to be searched in this manner will need to be 
inspected prior to the inmate removing their clothes. This could include dread locks or hair that is too 
thick to effectively search. 
• 
Visually inspect inside and behind both ears. Use a flashlight, if necessary. 
• 
Visually inspect inside the inmate's nose. Use a flashlight, if necessary. 
• 
Visually inspect inside the inmate's mouth and under the tongue. Use a flashlight, if 
necessary. 
• 
Direct the inmate to remove dentures/partial plates if applicable. 
• 
If applicable, visually inspect the dentures/partial plates while the inmate holds them. 
• 
Direct the inmate to pull their lower lip out and down. Next, direct the inmate to pull their 
upper lip out and up. Be certain to inspect the inmate's gum line. 
• 
If applicable, have inmate put dentures/partial plates back in mouth. 
(4) Visually examine the inmate's front torso: 
• 
Remain professional, search thoroughly, and maintain your concentration. 
• 
Observe the inmate, looking for cuts, bruises, or any trauma on their body. Report any of 
these observances to your supervisor upon completing the search. 
• 
If bandages are found during the search, direct the inmate to remove them, or at least lift 
one side to show that nothing is concealed underneath. 
• 
Direct the inmate to extend their arms forward, palms down, and fingers spread. Examine 
the back of hands and under the fingernails.

• 
Direct the inmate to turn their hands over and examine the palms. 
• 
Direct the inmate to raise their arms above their head, with fingers extended and spread. 
Examine the inmate's armpits and arms. 
• 
If the inmate is a female, direct her to lift her breasts so that you can see if anything is taped 
or hidden under the breasts. 
• 
If the inmate is obese, direct them to lift the folds of skin so you can see if anything is taped 
or hidden between the folds. 
(5) Visually examine the inmate's groin: 
• 
If the inmate is a male, direct him to spread his legs and lift his genitals so that you can see 
if anything is hidden or taped under the penis or scrotum. If the inmate is not circumcised, 
the inmate must pull back the foreskin to expose the head of the penis. 
• 
If the inmate is female, direct her to squat down, spread her vagina, and cough several 
times to dislodge anything that may be hidden in the vaginal cavity. 
(6) Visually examine the front of the inmate's legs and tops of the feet. 
Slide 14 — Visual Search 
(7) Direct the inmate to turn around and visually examine the inmate's back upper torso. 
(8) Visually examine the back of the inmate's legs and bottom of the feet. 
Check between the toes by directing the inmate to lift one foot at a time and wiggle the toes. 
(9) Have the inmate face away from you and visually examine the inmate's (male and female) 
anus by directing them to bend over and spread the buttocks. Use a flashlight, if necessary. 
A common place for both male and female inmates to hide keys, drugs, and even hacksaw 
blades, is inside the rectum. 
If you suspect contraband, have the inmate squat and cough several times. 
• 
If you find any evidence (a greasy substance around the rectum) that something may be 
concealed in the anal cavity, call a supervisor immediately. 
• 
Only medical personnel are permitted to conduct body cavity searches, and then only with 
the permission of the Warden.

IV. SEARCHES OF CROSS-GENDER INMATES 
Slide 16 — Cross-Gender Searches 
Currently, all staff may pat search inmates. Guidance for pat searches of transgender inmates is 
provided in conjunction with the implementation of PREA standard 115.15. Pat searches 
should be conducted in a professional and respectful manner and in the least intrusive manner 
as possible consistent with security needs. 
Individual transgender or intersex inmates will present different physical characteristics, which 
may change over the course of incarceration. Staff members should be mindful of these 
characteristics when conducting pat searches, and adjust procedures accordingly. For example, 
if a transgendered inmate has or develops breasts, staff should use the back of the hand to 
conduct a search of this area, as is appropriate for female inmates. 
A transgendered inmate with breast removal would indicate the use o male pat search 
procedures for the upper torso area. 
A. Female Inmates 
For a facility whose rated capacity does not exceed 50 inmates, cross-gender pat-down 
searches of female inmates are not permitted absent exigent circumstances. Facilities shall not 
restrict female inmates' access to regularly available programming or other out-of-cell 
opportunities in order to comply with this provision. 
B. Documentation of Cross-Gender Searches 
Institutions must document all cross-gender strip searches and cross-gender visual body cavity 
searches, and shall document all cross-gender pat-down searches of female inmates. 
Cross-gender strip searches or cross-gender visual body cavity searches (meaning a search of 
the anal or genital opening) are not permitted except in exigent circumstances or when 
performed by medical practioners. 
If there are any questions as to the appropriate search procedures for a transgendered inmate, 
please consult supervisory staff. 
V. REVIEW OF OBJECTIVES 
Slide 17 — Review of Objectives 
In review of our objectives, we have: 
• 
Identified the purpose and importance of conducting searches. 
Introduction to Correctional Techniques 
Conducting Searches 
Phase I 
Tab 22 
EFTA00035905
--- PAGE 26 ---
April 2015 
Instructor Guide 
• 
Identified the general guidelines for conducting searches. 
• 
Given an inmate's living area, an institution space or open area, and search equipment, 
each participant conducted pat and area searches. 
• 
Identified the proper sequence of steps used in conducting a visual search, as delineated in 
this course of instruction. 
VI. SUMMARY 
Slide 18 - Summary 
There are several reasons why searches are conducted. The most important is that searches 
help to protect staff, inmates, and the general public. Searches help us to maintain a safer 
working environment for all. When conducting searches, it is important to be thorough and 
systematic in your procedures. 
As a correctional worker, remember: 
• 
Conducting searches is every correctional worker's duty and responsibility. 
• 
We conduct searches to prevent escapes by controlling the introduction and conveyance of 
contraband into the institution. 
• 
Searches help ensure a safe working environment for yourself and other staff members and 
a safe living environment for inmates. 
Slide 19 — Thank You 
Note: 
Upon completion of the summary, ensure each participant had an opportunity to participate in all three 
performance evaluations (area search, pat search, and visual scramble test).

MEMORANDUM FOR imp. 
CTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
FROM: 
External Auditing Branch 
SUBJECT: 
Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on April 22, 2024. The FBOP has 
completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the analysis and 
its recommendations. 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the 
particular individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, the 
BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the field on a 
process to ensure psychologists make recommendations regarding housing, including the presence of 
a cellmate, for individuals in custody following suicide watch or psychological observation. The BOP 
further reported that this process will include exemptions based on individual or security 
considerations. The BOP has now indicated that this guidance has been drafted and is under review. 
Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes 
the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
EFTA00035907
--- PAGE 2 ---
FBOP's Response: The FBOP Reentry Services Division (RSD) and Correctional Programs 
Division (CPD) have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is currently under review. 
FBOP will provide further updates as the draft guidance is reviewed and approved as needed. 
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security 
considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
the BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the 
field on procedures to ensure communication regarding the requirement of a cellmate for 
individuals following suicide watch or psychological observation when recommended by a 
psychologist. The BOP further reported that this memo will include a procedure for exemptions 
based on individual or security considerations. The BOP has now indicated that guidance has 
been drafted and is under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) 
provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
FBOP's Response: RSD and CPD have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is 
currently under review. FBOP will provide further updates as the draft guidance is reviewed and 
approved as needed. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and 
provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to 
mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
observation. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
the BOP reported that it was evaluating its process for obtaining and documenting approval for 
social and/or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. The 
BOP has now reported that while it currently does not have guidance on these issues, new 
guidance has been drafted and is under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to 
close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and 
(2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
FBOP's Response: RSD and CPD have collaborated to draft guidance. This guidance is 
currently under review. FBOP will provide further updates as the draft guidance is reviewed and 
approved as needed. 
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods 
through policy, training, or other measures. 
EFTA00035908
--- PAGE 3 ---
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program 
statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the 
OIG for review. 
FBOP's Response: Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is 
being modified to improve FBOP methods for accounting for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. 
Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. 
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
conducting a round. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program 
statement update referenced in its update; (2) provides the finalized program statement to the 
OIG for review; and (3) provides a description of the training referenced in its update, sample 
training materials for OIG to review, and confirmation that the training is in effect. 
FBOP's Response: Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is 
being modified to clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round. Because 
revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and Union 
negotiation process, they are subject to change. 
However, FBOP intends for the updated policy to include clarification for Lieutenants to conduct 
trainings sessions, via in-person required rounds and shift briefings daily. These trainings will 
cover topics such as cell searches, minor emergency mock discussions, and other correctional 
services training needs as assessed by local correctional services supervisors. This will allow for 
individual assessment and training to be tailored to the needs of each individual facility while 
also remaining in conformance with current training requirements. Training topics and formats 
will be documented on the Daily Lieutenant Logs and reviewed by the Captain to assess and 
implement specific local correctional training needs. Therefore, although no specific training 
curriculum will be developed, the training requirement and supervisory review will be in effect 
with the issuance of the updated program statement. 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address 
staffing shortages at its prisons. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG will continue 
to monitor the GOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. At the GOP's request, 
the OIG will not consolidate this recommendation. In addition, per the OIG's communications 
with the BOP over email, we believe that certain information that the BOP has provided or will 
provide to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will facilitate the 
resolution and closure of this recommendation. Accordingly, we will consider whether to close 
this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG all contractor and BOP work product 
that has been submitted to the GAO in response to the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations, 
including the August 2022 assessment by the contractor on staffing incentives and the 
EFTA00035909
--- PAGE 4 ---
information BOP submitted to GAO in March 2023 related to the assessment; (2) provides the 
OIG an update on the contractor's or BOP's analysis of staffing incentives since March 2023, 
whether submitted yet to GAO or not; (3) provides the OIG any reports submitted to 
Congressional appropriation committees related to staffing; (4) implements the staffing tool for 
all BOP professions; and (5) provides an analysis of whether the new incentives mentioned in its 
update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage, and what additional proposals, 
including any legislative proposals to address pay rates in certain localities, are being considered 
by the BOP to fully address the staffing shortage. 
FBOP's Response: FBOP appreciates OIG's determination to not consolidate the analysis of 
this recommendation with that of Recommendation 5 from the OIG's Limited-Scope Review of 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Strategies to Identify, Communicate, and Remedy Operational 
Issues, Report Number 23-065 (Limited-Scope Review), at FBOP's request. OIG indicates that it 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after FBOP does the following: 
(1) OIG requests all contractor and FBOP work product that has been submitted to the GAO in 
response to the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations, including the August 2022 assessment by 
the contractor on staffing incentives and the information FBOP submitted to GAO in March 
2023 related to the assessment. 
FBOP now provides the requested information. Please see the following attachments: 
"Attachment I Staffing_GAO 21-123," "Attachment 2 Staffing_GAO 21-123," "BOP Staffing 
Current State Assessment FINAL," "FINAL Incentives Playbook_All Resources_June 13," 
"Fully executed contract 2_Redacted," "Interviews and Survey Results," "NTT DATA Response 
to BOP Staffing Risk Management 04062021 Final," "SOW-BOP Staffing Risk 
Management_l," and "STATEMENT OF WORK." 
(2) OIG requests that FBOP provide an update on the contractor's or FBOP's analysis of staffing 
incentives since March 2023, whether submitted yet to GAO or not; 
The FBOP is currently analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of both recruitment and 
retention incentives. This analysis is ongoing. Therefore, FBOP will provide its analysis to OIG 
when completed. 
(3) OIG requests any reports submitted to Congressional appropriation committees related to 
staffing. See the following attachments: "FY23 BOP Vacancies at Facilities CRPT Package," 
"FY 2023 BOP CRPT Vacancies at BOP Facilities — Attachment," and "FY 2023 CRPT BOP 
FSA Implementation Q2 Hill Letters Package - WF220990." 
(4) OIG requests that FBOP implements the staffing tool for all BOP professions. 
Currently, the Automated Staffing Tool is a workforce planning tool that remains in development 
and testing. Position recommendations for the following departments have been completed and 
remain in ongoing testing and feedback stages: Correctional Services, Correctional Systems, 
Chaplaincy Services, Education, Food Service, Health Services, ITDD, Recreation, Safety, and 
Unit Management. 
EFTA00035910
--- PAGE 5 ---
All other disciplines are tentatively scheduled to be completed by October 2024. It is anticipated 
that the workforce planning tool will be fully utilized beginning in October 2024. 
(5) OIG requests FBOP to provide an analysis of whether the new incentives mentioned in its 
previous status update have made an impact on the staffing shortage, and what additional 
proposals, including any legislative proposals to address pay rates in certain localities, are being 
considered by the BOP to fully address the staffing shortage. 
Additional time will be required to determine the effect of those incentives implemented during 
the current fiscal year. However, it should be noted the FBOP was approved for nation-wide 
direct-hire authority by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on May 13, 2024. This will 
assist the FBOP in filling vacancies in the future. FBOP is working with the Department of 
Justice on a nationwide special salary rate request for our institution positions. 
Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes 
as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is partially responsive to the recommendation. The update for 
Recommendation 5 is related to Lieutenant Rounds and not cell searches. The update does not 
indicate that the BOP has or will evaluate its cell search procedures and make any necessary 
changes to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. The update 
only addresses the logging of cell searches within TRUSCOPE rather than evaluating its cell 
search procedures. The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP 
(1) completes the evaluation of using TRUSCOPE to log cell searches; (2) otherwise evaluates 
its cell search procedures and makes any appropriate changes to improve those procedures; and 
(3) provides a description of the training referenced in its response, sample training materials for 
OIG to review, and confirmation that the training is in effect. 
FBOP's Response: FBOP's Correctional Programs Division has evaluated current policy and 
training as related to cell searches. FBOP has concluded that cell search requirements, including 
appropriate documentation requirements via TRUSCOPE, are clearly outlined in two separate 
current policies: Program Statement 5500.15, Correctional Services Manual, and Program 
Statement 5521.06, issued January 2, 2018; and the Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and 
Inmate Work Areas, issued on June 4, 2015. 
In addition to the general requirements for conducting cell searches contained in the above 
program statements, an institutional supplement is required for Security Inspections at each 
institution detailing specific local procedures. Locally, specific post orders are developed which 
include search requirements and documentation requirements. Current policy and training are 
adequate to convey the specific requirements for conducting cell searches. 
Further review indicates that specific training exists for conducting cell searches and is included 
in the below training curriculums. Initially, all staff receive specific training on cell searches 
during Introduction to Correctional Techniques, Phase I. Additionally, in January 2020, Back to 
Basics training was implemented as mandatory training for all institution employees. Back to 
Basics is an annual in-person training which includes a set curriculum with practical exercises. 
The sections listed below specifically include cell searches and practical exercises. 
EFTA00035911
--- PAGE 6 ---
• (Initial) Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT) Phase I, Tab 22: Conducting 
Searches. See attachment "ICTPhaseI-Tab 22-IG." 
• (Annual) Back 2 Basics Managing Housing Units Part I - Conduct searches of the 
housing unit to include cell searches. See attachment "7-B2B-Managing Housing Units 
Part I-Lesson Plan-FY2024." 
• (Annual) Back 2 Basics Managing Housing Units Part 2 - Conduct searches of the 
housing unit to include cell searches (Practical Exercise). See attachment "8-B2B-
Managing Housing Units Part II-Lesson Plan-FY2024." 
Therefore, because FBOP has demonstrated completion of its evaluation of using TRUSCOPE to 
log cell searches and its evaluation of cell search procedures, and has provided a description of 
training referenced, including confirmation that the training is currently in effect, FBOP now 
respectfully requests closure of this recommendation. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
functionality checks. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy updates 
referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized policies to the O1O for review. 
FBOP's Response: FBOP is currently in the process of making modifications to Program 
Statement 4200.12, Facilities Operations Manual; and Program Statement 5500.15, Correctional 
Services Manual, to include protocols and ensure accountability regarding various aspects of the 
FBOP's camera systems including but not necessarily limited to functionality, documentation, 
and repair. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP 
development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide 
further updates pertaining to these revisions as they become available. 
To ensure immediate action, a joint memorandum (from FBOP's Administration Division and 
Correctional Programs Division) was sent to all CEOs addressing the Security Camera Monthly 
Report. The new report is now in use and became effective June 1, 2024. See attachments 
"Camera Report Implementation signed" and "Security Camera Report Template."

MEMORANDUM FOR MICHAEL E. HOROWITZ, INSPECTOR GENERAL, 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
FROM: 
Warden (Retired) 
SUBJECT: Response to Draft for the Office of Inspector General 
Investigation (OIG) of Jeffrey Epstein Suicide 
On Wednesday April 5, 2023, I reviewed the OIG draft report for 
the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center (MCC) in New York, New York. The draft stated that I 
used poor judgement in not selecting a backup cellmate for 
Jeffrey Epstein while he was housed in the Special Housing Unit 
(SHU). 
MCC New York is a pre-trial institution. The majority of the 
inmates housed at the facility are not designated and the 
facility had one designated unit that housed approximately 
seventy inmates. Pre-trial and designated inmates cannot be 
housed together. Mr. Epstein was housed in the SHU. The SHUs 
are housing units in Bureau institutions where inmates are 
securely separated from general inmate population, and may be 
housed either alone or with other inmates. Special Housing 
Units help ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of 
correctional facilities, and protect the public, by providing 
alternative housing assignments for inmates removed from general 
population. 
Prior to placing Mr. Epstein in the SHU, we vetted several 
inmates as potential cellmates for him. There was only one 
inmate that was identified as an appropriate cellmate. The 
inmates in SHU were constantly being moved to other units, being 
transferred, or released on a daily basis. We were constantly 
monitoring the inmate population in SHU for Mr. Epstein's safety 
and potential cell mates. Based on the mission of the 
institution, the constant movement of inmates out of SHU, along 
with the number of inmates that posed a threat to his safety, 
there were no potential backup inmates to be housed with Mr. 
Epstein during the period he was housed in the SHU. 
Thank you for your time and consideration in reviewing my 
response. 
Respectfully submitted, 
EFTA00035913

MEMORANDUM FOR 
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
FROM: 
ief 
SUBJECT: 
Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office 
of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on August 28, 2024. The FBOP 
has completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding the analysis 
and its recommendations. 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on 
the particular individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, the 
BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the field on a 
process to ensure psychologists make recommendations regarding housing, including the presence of 
a cellmate, for individuals in custody following suicide watch or psychological observation. The BOP 
further reported that this process will include exemptions based on individual or security 
considerations. In a February 2024 update, the BOP indicated that this guidance had been drafted and 
was under review. The BOP has now stated that the guidance is still under review. Accordingly, the 
OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance 
referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
EFTA00035919
--- PAGE 2 ---
FBOP Response: As indicated in FBOP's previous status update, guidance is currently in 
development. FBOP has determined that the appropriate vehicle for this guidance is Program 
Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate Program Review, rather than in the form of a 
guidance memorandum. FBOP therefore plans to replicate in that policy the tracking process 
already established for single cells in Program Statement 5270.12, Special Housing Units, but 
apply it to general population. The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program 
Review policy will prescribe a specific process for single-cell placement and tracking only if 
single-cell placement in general population appears necessary, mirroring the language 
pertaining to the process in the policy for SHU. 
The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program Review policy will explain that, 
if it appears necessary to single cell an individual in a general population unit during regular 
working hours, the Unit Manager will contact the Captain and Chief Psychologist (or designee) 
for their recommendations. If a single cell is required after hours or on weekends, the Operations 
Lieutenant will contact the Captain and Chief Psychologist (or designee) telephonically for their 
recommendations. Monitoring single-ceiling in the general population will be recorded on 
"BP-A1121 CO Single Cell Review Form-GP" (see attachment). This form will be signed by the 
Warden as soon as feasible following the placement of an individual in a single cell. These forms 
will be reviewed and discussed during the weekly multidisciplinary team meetings and the 
recommendations (to continue or discontinue) will be recorded by the Unit Manager in 
TRUSCOPE, as a "daily log entry." 
Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they 
become available. 
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high 
risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate 
until the recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency 
plan for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
the BOP reported that RSD and CPD were collaborating on a memo to provide guidance to the 
field on procedures to ensure communication regarding the requirement of a cellmate for 
individuals following suicide watch or psychological observation when recommended by a 
psychologist. The BOP further reported that this memo will include a procedure for exemptions 
based on individual or security considerations. In a February 2024 update, the BOP indicated that 
this guidance had been drafted and was under review. The BOP has now stated that the guidance 
is still under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (I) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized 
guidance to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in FBOP's previous status update, guidance is currently in 
development. Further, as stated in the response to Recommendation I, above, FBOP has 
EFTA00035920
--- PAGE 3 ---
determined that the appropriate vehicle for this guidance is Program Statement 5321.09, Unit 
Management and Inmate Program Review, rather than in the form of a guidance memorandum. 
FBOP therefore plans to replicate in that policy the tracking process already established for 
single cells in Program Statement 5270.12, Special Housing Units, but apply it to general 
population. The modification to the Unit Management and Inmate Program Review policy will 
prescribe a specific process for single-cell placement and tracking only if single-cell placement 
in general population appears necessary, mirroring the language pertaining to the process in the 
policy for SHU. 
Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and 
Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they 
become available. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, 
and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its 
process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. In a previous update, 
the BOP reported that it was evaluating its process for obtaining and documenting approval for 
social and/or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. In a 
February 2024 update, the BOP reported that while it currently does not have guidance on these 
issues, new guidance had been drafted and was under review. The BOP has now stated that the 
guidance is still under review. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the guidance referenced in its update, and (2) 
provides the finalized guidance to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in its previous status update, FBOP was developing guidance 
with regard to its process for obtaining and documenting approval for social and/or legal visits 
while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation. However, upon further 
consideration, FBOP has determined that this guidance should not be in the form of a guidance 
memorandum, but should instead be included in Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention 
Policy. Therefore, FBOP is in the process of altering that policy accordingly. Because revisions 
to Programs Statements must follow the normal FBOP development and Union negotiation 
process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates they become available. 
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those 
methods through policy, training, or other measures. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program 
EFTA00035921
--- PAGE 4 ---
statement update referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the 
OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is being modified to include methods for accounting 
for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow 
the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will 
provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant N1 lien 
conducting a round. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP reported that 
it is updating its policy to address the recommendation. In its February 2024 update, the BOP 
also indicated that it would be conducting training for Lieutenants on conducting rounds. The 
OIG therefore previously asked the BOP to provide "a description of the training referenced in 
its update, sample training materials for OIG to review, and confirmation that the training is in 
effect." The BOP has indicated that, to allow for variation based on the specific needs of each 
institution, there will not be a specific BOP-wide curriculum for the training; however, training 
will be conducted and documented on the Daily Lieutenant Logs and reviewed by the Captain 
for specific local training needs. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this 
recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the program statement update referenced in its 
update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is being modified to include methods for accounting 
for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow 
the normal development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will 
provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to 
address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
OIG Analysis: The GOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG will continue 
to monitor the GOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. Accordingly, we will 
consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG an update on 
the contractor's or GOP's analysis of staffing incentives since March 2023, whether submitted 
yet to GAO or not; (2) implements the staffing tool for all BOP professions; (3) provides an 
analysis of whether the new incentives and nation-wide direct-hire authority mentioned in its 
update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage; (4) provides an update on its efforts 
to establish a nationwide special salary rate for institution positions; and (5) describes any 
additional proposals, including any legislative proposals to address pay rates in certain localities, 
that are being considered by the BOP to fully address the staffing shortage and provides an 
EFTA00035922
--- PAGE 5 ---
update to the OIG on the Department's consideration and cooperation with the BOP on any such 
proposal. 
FBOP Response: OIG indicates that it will consider whether to close this recommendation after 
FBOP: 
1. Provides an update on the contractor's or FBOP's analysis of staffing incentives 
since March 2023; whether submitted yet to GAO or not. 
The FBOP is currently analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of both recruitment and 
retention incentives. This analysis is ongoing. Therefore, FBOP will provide an update to OIG 
when completed. 
2. Implements the staffing tool for all FBOP professions. 
The Automated Staffing Tool (AST) went live officially on October I, 2024, and has been 
implemented for all FBOP professions. This workforce planning tool will allow FBOP 
leadership to identify true institution position needs to safely and effectively operate all of the 
FBOP's 122 institutions. The AST recommends position numbers based on data driven insights 
from internal and external subject matter experts, institution-specific criteria, and evolving 
mission requirements. 
3. Provides an analysis of whether the new incentives and nation-wide direct-hire 
authority mentioned in its update above have made an impact on the staffing 
shortage. 
The FBOP continues to collect data in an effort to complete its analysis in 2025. However, 
preliminary analysis has shown retention incentives to be an effective factor when comparing 
data from the recent fiscal years. In FY 2024, the lowest number of total separations occurred 
with 2,572 separations. In FY 2023, the FBOP had 2,900 separations. FY 2022 had the highest 
number of separations in the FBOP in recent years with 3,665. 
Recruitment measures have also made an impact in the most recent fiscal years. In FY 2024, 
FBOP saw the largest influx of staff since FY 2021, with 3,596 new hires. Comparatively, 
FY 2023 saw 2,622 new hires and 1,846 in FY 2022. After receiving nationwide DHA approval 
in May 2024, and continuing through September 2024, the FBOP has hired over 450 correctional 
officers with Direct Hiring Authority, totaling 642 for FY 2024. This is significantly greater than 
our total of 196 new hires for FY 2023 and 83 new hires for FY 2022 without nationwide DHA. 
4. Provides an update on its efforts to establish a nationwide special salary rate for 
institution positions. 
The FBOP is continuing to actively collaborate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop a special salary rate aimed at addressing 
recruitment and retention challenges within our institutions by offering more competitive 
salaries. Currently, the FBOP is focusing Special Salary Rate efforts on the Correctional Officer 
EFTA00035923
--- PAGE 6 ---
and nurse positions and submitted its request to DOJ at the end of September 2024. DOJ 
informed FBOP that both requests are under OPM review. 
5. Describes any additional proposals, including any legislative proposals to address 
pay rates in certain localities, that are being considered by the BOP to fully address 
the staffing shortage and provides an update to the OIG on the Department's 
consideration and cooperation with the BOP on any such proposal. 
As of November 2024, FBOP has no further input regarding proposals being considered to 
address the staffing shortage. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera 
system functionality checks. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. Accordingly, the OIG 
will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy updates 
referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized policies to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statement 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, and Program Statement 4200.12, Facilities Operations 
Manual, are being modified to include protocols and ensure accountability regarding various 
aspects of FBOP's camera systems, including but not limited to functionality, documentation, 
and repair. Because revisions to Programs Statements must follow the normal development and 
Union negotiation process, they are subject to change. FBOP will provide further updates as they 
become available. 
However, to ensure immediate action, a joint memorandum from FBOP's Administration 
Division and Correctional Programs Division was sent to all CEOs addressing necessary camera 
protocols. See attachments "Camera Report Implementation signed" and "Security Camera 
Report Template." The joint memorandum implemented a monthly reporting process in all 
facilities and attached a template to use for monthly reporting. The monthly reporting requires 
electronic technicians at each facility to list the number of installed cameras, adjustments to the 
camera count as needed, information regarding camera recording capability and camera 
operational state, and information regarding any repairs made to the cameras during the month of 
reporting. The Captain and Facility Manager must review each monthly report from the facility 
and ensure accuracy. The monthly Security Camera Report will then be included in the Facilities 
Management Monthly Report to Regional offices and submitted from the Warden to the 
Regional Director. The new monthly Security Camera Report is now in use and became effective 
June 1, 2024.

Federal Bureau of Prisons 
Cenral Office 
Office of the Director 
MEMORANDUM FOR 
FROM: 
Weuhington, DC 20534 
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
June 16, 2023 
SUBJECT: 
Response to the Ofti of Inspector Gen 
OIG) Draft Report: 
Investigation and R ew of the Federal Bureau o 
sons' Custody, Care, 
and Supervision of 
E ein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in New York, New Yo 
The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to formally respond to the Office of the 
Inspector General's above-referenced draft report. BOP values OIG's careful review of the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and will utilize this report to apply lessons 
learned where applicable to the broader BOP correctional landsrapP. Under its current leadership, BOP 
is committed to improving the agency's ability to meet its mission. In fact, in April of this year. BOP 
announced its new mission as "corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment 
and ensure public safety by preparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities." BOP 
must treat the adults in its custody with dignity and respect and ensure they receive necessary medical 
and mental health care on an individualized basis, content with sound correctional judgment. 
However, certain recommendations from this report appear to reflect an assumption that because a 
limited number of employees at MCC New York failed to adhere to BOP policies and practices. those 
policies and practices must themselves be flawed. As an agency with more than 35,000 employees 
across more than 120 facilities, BOP believes that employees who fail to adhere to the law, regulations, 
and BOP's own policies must be held accountable. However, the vast majority of BOP's employees 
work tirelessly under challenging conditions. We must be careful not to ascribe the facts specific to the 
Jeffrey Epstein incident at MCC New York to BOP's entire workforce. Using the Jeffrey Epstein 
incident as a basis for overhauling national policies and practices without evaluating whether similar 
trends exist at other locations or considering the role of employee accountability and training could be 
detrimental to sound correctional practices. 
BOP previously provided OIG its technical assessment of these recommendations in an effort to 
resolve potential concerns prior to the publication of this report. BOP appreciates OIG's review of this 
EFTA00035925

OIG Official Draft Report: BOP's Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC 
New York, New York 
June 15, 2023 
Page 2 of 6 
information and looks forward to working with OIG to address any remaining unresolved issues in the 
immediate future. BOP's specific comments regarding OIG's recommendations are as follows: 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation. 
BOP's Response: Although BOP cannot concur with this recommendation based on its current 
wording, BOP agrees to implement a process for assigning a cellmate following suicide watch or 
psychological observation whenever appropriate for the individual and when security concerns 
allow. 
BOP's current process, updated in the years following Jeffrey Epstein's death, already takes an 
individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody in the context of suicide 
watch and psychological observation. Upon removal from suicide watch or psychological 
observation, psychologists make individualized care recommendations about clinical follow-up 
and other custodial concerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit 
team staff work collaboratively to ensure each individual removed from suicide watch has a 
cellmate whenever clinically and correctionally appropriate. In the event an individual is 
determined to have moderate to high baseline risk for suicide and no suitable cellmate can be 
identified, continued placement on suicide watch is to be considered. BOP provides guidance 
through national trainings each fiscal year for its psychologists about individualized care 
recommendations. 
It is not sound correctional practice to apply a one size fits all approach regardless of a person's 
individual needs and without factoring the safety of others or the security concerns of the 
institution. For example, some persons may be extremely violent or pose a risk to other adults in 
custody at the conclusion of suicide watch. Additionally, some of these persons may require 
protective custody from others and placing them with a cellmate may create additional risk to 
their safety. An adult in custody's status post suicide watch or psychological observation cannot 
be the sole factor considered in cellmate placement; sound correctional judgement must be 
utilized and is vital to the safe and orderly operations of BOP's institutions. Therefore, at times, 
single ceiling may be the only sound correctional decision for an individual who has been 
removed from suicide watch or psychological observation. However, single-ceiling is routinely 
monitored by each region in the BOP. 
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cell mate until the 
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
re-assignment, ensuring that another cellmate can be assigned efficiently. 
BOP's Response: BOP concurs with this recommendation insofar as BOP agrees to establish 
procedures to ensure adults in custody at high risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is 
appropriate and recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the recommendation is 
changed or rescinded. 
EFTA00035926

OIG Official Draft Report: BOP's Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC 
New York, New York 
June 15, 2023 
Page 3 of 6 
BOP's current process already takes an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults 
in custody in the context of suicide watch and psychological observation. Upon removal from 
suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care recommendations are made by 
psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP already makes each ceiling 
assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at moderate to high risk for suicide. 
These considerations include both mental health and custodial concerns. Psychology Services, 
Correctional Services, and Unit Team work closely to monitor individuals identified to be at risk 
for suicide to determine placement considerations. BOP uses the Psychology Advisory List 
(PAL) and PSY ALERT status to monitor those individuals whom employees should have 
heightened awareness. These codes ensure employees are better able to monitor individuals at 
risk for suicide to ensure they have an appropriate cellmate. 
Regarding contingency planning, BOP has serious concerns about "contingency-planning" for 
cellmates for adults in custody at high risk for suicide. The process of assessing this procedure 
is impossible given the number of individuals determined high risk, the frequency of movement, 
and the complexity of security concerns. Movement is frequent among BOP's mainline facilities 
and even more so at pre-trial facilities. It is not feasible to maintain accurate, individualized 
contingency plans listing several back-up individuals for each high-risk individual in its custody. 
Identifying appropriate cellmates is best done in real time with the most current information, 
resulting in the safest outcomes. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should implement a process that requires approval to be 
obtained and documented for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation. 
BOP's Response: Although BOP cannot concur with this recommendation based on its current 
wording, BOP agrees to evaluate its processes and train its employees to ensure approval is 
obtained and documented for social or legal visits while an adult in custody is on suicide watch 
or psychological observation. Pre-trial institutions such as MCC New York have supplemental 
policy to address legal visits for persons on suicide watch. MCC New York had an appropriate 
institutional supplement to address this issue but did not adhere to that policy. As noted above, 
BOP will evaluate Program Statement 5324.08 and other relevant program statements to 
determine an effective method for integrating information from the local Suicide Prevention 
Coordinator regarding individuals' current stressors and protective factors into the Warden's 
decision-making process. 
Recommendation Four: The BOP should improve its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing by expanding institutional controls, training, and documentation. 
BOP's Response: Although BOP cannot concur with this recommendation based on its current 
wording, BOP agrees to improve its methods for holding employees accountable for failing to 
account for adult in custody whereabouts and wellbeing as required through established 
institutional controls and documentation. BOP respectfully asserts that its current 
EFTA00035927
--- PAGE 4 ---
OIG Official Draft Report: BOP's Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC 
New York, New York 
June 15, 2023 
Page 4 of 6 
policies already require personnel to account for adult in custody whereabouts and wellbeing. 
Program Statement 5500.14 outlines basic principles of accountability, such as count procedures, 
census checks, control center records, daily change/transfer sheet, adult in custody callouts. 
Policy also mandates institutions to develop a supplement which outlines adult in custody 
accountability, specifically census checks. 
The OIG report's findings indicate a lack of employee accountability at MCC New York during 
the period when this incident occurred. BOP acknowledges the lack of accountability at MCC 
New York and is committed to ensuring its employees are appropriately trained and held 
accountable. This includes employees being held accountable for the completion of job duties 
involving controlling and documenting adult in custody movement, observation, and related 
activities. 
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when 
conducting a round. 
BOP's Response: BOP concurs with this recommendation and intends to clarify what is required 
of a lieutenant when conducting a round. 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should develop and implement a plan to address staffing 
shortages at its prisons. 
BOP's Response: BOP agrees that hiring and retaining qualified personnel is a key priority. 
BOP has already developed and implemented a multi-pronged approach that involves enhanced 
recruitment efforts and appropriate incentives. However, the scope of OIG's work in this 
product was limited to the investigation and review of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide at MCC New 
York and OIG did not request or give the BOP an opportunity to address the significant work 
that has already been undertaken regarding staffing. 
Further, we disagree with the inference in this recommendation that a staffing shortage 
compounded the issues in this incident. While we recognize the statement by one employee that 
rounds were not conducted because they were tired, the incident did not result from lack of 
staffing. The Special Housing Unit was fully staffed on all three shifts prior to Jeffrey Epstein's 
suicide, with employees who chose not to conduct rounds.' OIG's position that employees failed 
to attend to their duties as a result of staffing challenges is tenuous and alleviates the 
responsibility of employees to perform duties during their scheduled shifts. This responsibility is 
carried out by the vast majority of BOP's employees every day and ensures the safety and 
security of those in our care and custody. The negligence of specific employees at MCC New 
York in their duties should not be excused by reinforcing BOP's staffing challenges as the basis 
for misconduct. 
I 010 notes that these employees worked a 24-hour shift. Although these employees volunteered to work beyond 16 
hours, BOP is examining options to ensure employees no longer work a consecutive 24-hour shift absent an 
institution emergency.

New York, New York 
June 15, 2023 
Page 5 of 6 
Recommendation Seven: The BOP should clarify and improve the cell search policy. 
BOP's Response: BOP does not agree with this recommendation. BOP has established policy, 
Program Statement 5521.06, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas, and 
Program Statement 5580.08, Inmate Personal Property, that outlines what an adult in custody is 
allowed to have in their possession and defines contraband, to include procedures for handling it. 
Program Statement 5270.11, Special Housing Units, outlines conditions of confinement, as well 
as personal property allowed, within the Special Housing Unit. Controlling excessive property 
and specifically linens is an employee performance and conduct issue rather than a policy issue. 
It is not realistic or sound correctional practice for BOP's policy to specifically list each piece of 
property an adult in custody may possess and the appropriate quantity for those items. 
Additionally, institutions are required to supplement BOP cell search policy on a localized basis. 
To insist upon an across-the-board national cell search requirement detailing specific item 
restrictions fails to account for the wide variety of needs and diverse population of adults in 
custody throughout BOP's many facilities. We do, however, believe that employees should be 
held accountable when not following our policies. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
functionality checks. 
BOP's Response: BOP concurs with this recommendation and agrees to enhance policies that 
already exist to ensure institutional security camera systems have capacity to record video and 
are regularly checked for functionality. BOP notes that policies already exist concerning 
institutional security camera systems. Program Statement 5500.15, Correctional Services 
Manual, requires an Institutional Supplement for Security Inspections/Searches, and specifically 
states, "The Warden is to establish, by Institution Supplement, a security inspection system that 
involves all departments. The Institution Supplement will include posts and areas required to 
submit inspection forms, frequency of submission, guidelines for checking security features, and 
reporting of weaknesses and inconsistencies." 
Additional Concerns: While the above is our formal response to the recommendations, BOP 
would also like to note our continued strong objections to some of the technical 
language/inconsistencies/security concerns still included in the version of the report provided to 
us on June 15th, 2023. 
Specifically, BOP was unaware of any changes to Mr. Epstein's last will and testament prior to 
his death, yet it is consistently mentioned in the report, leading the reader to conclude 
differently (i.e., that BOP was aware prior to his death). Additionally, the report indicates that 
there were delays in completing the camera upgrade/repair; however, BOP would like to note 
that the upgrade/repair had been requested. Also, the BOP adamantly objects to the use of the 
EFTA00035929

New York, New York

term "widespread" in relation to the failure of employees to follow policy. Finally, our concerns 
regarding the specific language in relation to Special Housing Unit keys was inconsistent in the 
report (i.e., differences in language were noted on pages iii, 23, and 96). We have attached all 
of our technical comments to this memorandum. 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this report. We look forward to OIG closing the 
recommendations that the BOP has agreed to address.

March 4, 2025 
MEMORANDUM FOR 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR 
HOMELAND SECURITY AND JUSTICE 
FROM: 
SUPERVISORY ATTORNEY 
EXTERNAL AUDITING BRANCH 
SUBJECT: 
Status Update to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
Report Bureau of Prisons: Opportunities Exist to Better Analyze Staffing 
Data and Improve Employee Wellness Programs, Report Number GAO-21 
123 
The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a formal response to the 
Government Accountability Office's (GAO) regarding the report entitled, Report Bureau of Prisons: 
Opportunities Exist to Better Analyze Staffing Data and Improve Employee Wellness Programs 
(GAO-21-123). The BOP has completed our review, and we offer the following status update 
regarding the report and its recommendations. 
Priority Recommendation One: The Director of BOP should develop and implement a reliable 
method, or amend existing methods, for calculating staffing levels at BOP institutions. 
GAO Analysis Regarding Priority Recommendation One: BOP concurred with this 
recommendation and has begun taking steps to address it. In June 2021, BOP reported that it 
hired a contractor to assist the agency in calculating staffing levels at BOP institutions and, in 
August 2022, BOP reported that the contractor had completed its assessment and developed a 
new automated staffing tool prototype. BOP reported that the intent of the new tool is to address 
BOP staffing challenges by providing an updated, standardized, and transparent view of staffing 
guidelines, and also for assessing staffing levels. BOP also reported in August 2022 that the 
contractor was testing the new tool prototype, primarily focusing on correctional services 
positions, in one of BOP's regions before expanding it to additional regions. In March 2023, 
EFTA00035931
--- PAGE 2 ---
BOP reported that the contractor was testing a prototype of the tool in three of BOP's six regions, 
primarily focusing on positions in the correctional services discipline. BOP anticipated that the 
tool would be rolled out to all six BOP regional offices by June 2023, followed by positions from 
additional BOP disciplines. In March 2024, BOP reported that the tool will be fully implemented 
by October 2024, covering all regions and all position disciplines. We will continue to monitor 
BOP's progress toward addressing this recommendation by assessing (1) the extent to which the 
tool's test shows that it can effectively calculate staffing levels based on its expanded usage in 
more regions and all position disciplines, and (2) the implementation of the tool for all positions, 
so that BOP can address total staffing needs. 
FBOP's Response: The AST uses a consistent approach to calculate the number of needed 
positions across all disciplines in the institutions. The calculation starts with forming guidelines 
for baseline positions and then incorporates additional criteria to determine the total number of 
recommended positions for each institution. Baseline positions are calculated by developing 
updated guidelines with FBOP SMEs and are validated with leadership and external 
benchmarking conversations. The AST then uses broad and discipline-specific criteria derived 
from multiple working sessions with FBOP SMEs to account for specific needs and 
considerations of institutions. Only institutions that meet the relevant criteria for the given 
discipline will receive position adjustments. Criteria adjustments are added along with baseline 
positions to determine the true total number of positions needed at an institution. Currently, the 
tool provides recommendations for all institutional level positions regardless of funding source 
(e.g., FSA, PHS, contracted, etc.). The AST only calculates institution positions by department, 
with the exception of institution Executive staff (i.e., Wardens, Associate Wardens, etc.). 
Therefore, because the FBOP has developed and implemented a reliable method for calculating 
staffing levels at FBOP institutions, the FBOP respectfully requests closure of this 
recommendation. 
Recommendation Two: The Director of BOP should develop and implement a plan for 
analyzing data to help identify and address the causes and potential impacts of staffing 
challenges on staff and inmates. 
GAO Analysis Regarding Recommendation Two: BOP concurred with this recommendation 
and has begun taking early steps to address it. In June 2021, BOP reported that it hired a 
contractor to assist the agency over several months in analyzing data to identify and address 
impacts of staffing challenges. In March 2023, BOP reported that the contractor had conducted 
research, including interviews with BOP leaders and focus groups across BOP, discussing topics 
such as staffing, recruiting, and retention. BOP reported that the contractor conducted additional 
interviews with 50 BOP employees to gain additional understanding related to employee 
retention. BOP reported that the research resulted in an assessment. In March 2024, BOP 
officials told us that the assessment was illustrative for determining trends related to what 
contributes to employee retention. However, BOP officials told us that limited data is available 
to determine additional impacts, such as the effects of staffing challenges on inmate 
programming, for example. We will continue to monitor BOP's progress toward addressing this 
recommendation.

FBOP's Response: The FBOP has asked the contractor to conduct further analysis in this area. 
We expect to receive an updated analysis on the impact of staffing on inmate programming by 
May 2025. 
Priority Recommendation Three: The Director of BOP should conduct a risk assessment of its 
overtime and augmentation use, including identifying risks to staff, inmates, and institution 
security; and determining actions to respond, as appropriate. 
GAO Analysis Regarding Priority Recommendation Three: BOP concurred with this 
recommendation and has taken steps to address it. In June 2021, BOP reported that it hired a 
contractor to assist the agency in assessing the risk of overtime and augmentation usage and 
develop an overtime calculation tool. In August 2022, the contractor finalized its risk assessment 
of overtime and augmentation use. The study concluded that there were few risks of overtime 
and augmentation, for example, related to sick leave, vacancies, or inmate and staff incidents. 
However, the study was based on limited data, and, in March 2024, BOP officials acknowledged 
that there are likely additional risks to overtime and augmentation than what was found in 
the contractor's report, but they do not have plans to pursue an additional study on the risks. 
Related to the same August 2022 contractor study, BOP reported that the contractor created a 
tool to retroactively track overtime spending. In March 2023, BOP reported that the contractor 
had finished the analysis, and that BOP had been tracking overtime and augmentation usage and 
trends for several months. In March 2024, BOP reported that it has continued to track overtime 
and augmentation usage monthly and acknowledged that BOP needs to reduce its reliance on 
overtime and augmentation. Continued tracking will illuminate drivers and trends of overtime 
and augmentation usage and help BOP invest in short and longer-time solutions to mitigate 
associated risks. We will continue to monitor GOP's progress in addressing our recommendation. 
FBOP's Response: The FBOP continues to track overtime and augmentation at a minimum of 
twice monthly. The safety of staff, inmates, and the public is the highest priority for the FBOP. 
When an insufficient number of Correctional Officers are available to cover mission critical 
correctional posts, which can occur for several reasons including staff absences, population 
increases, or other reasons, the FBOP may assign non-custody staff as officers to reduce the need 
to vacate posts deemed critical for the safety and security of the institution. 
Priority Recommendation Four: The Director of BOP should assess the outcomes of the 
staffing incentives it utilizes by developing performance measures and goals, measuring 
outcomes against them, and adjusting incentives, as appropriate. 
GAO Analysis Regarding Priority Recommendation Four: BOP concurred with this 
recommendation and reported in February 2022 that its contractor was finalizing a risk analysis 
of the agency's current use of staffing incentives. In August 2022, the contractor finalized its 
analysis of staffing incentives. In March 2023, BOP stated that, based on the assessment, the 
contractor continued its work to standardize incentive usage, including working with BOP 
Executive Staff and other Human Resources staff to identify performance measures and goals for 
its use of incentives. In June 2023, BOP released its Incentives Playbook, with the intended 
purpose of standardizing BOP's approach to staffing incentives. The Incentives Playbook also 
includes performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the incentives. In March 2024, 
EFTA00035933
--- PAGE 4 ---
BOP reported that it will have sufficient data to be able to measure the outcomes of performance 
metrics in 2025. This ongoing work should help BOP determine the effectiveness of staffing 
incentives. 
FBOP's Response: The Incentive playbook identified four performance goals to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the BOP utilization of retention incentives. Although not a true calculation of the 
retention rate, the below data supports the overall rationale that when compared to historical data 
(previous 5 years), the FBOP has reduced separations and therefore retained more staff. Further 
analysis is being conducted to more clearly associate the nexus of retention incentive utilization 
against retention rates against the below performance metrics. 
a) Increase overall employee retention by 5% compared to historical retention rate. 
The overall turnover rate in CY24 was 8.3%. Based on historical data of 8.5%, the FBOP 
turnover rate decreased by 2.4%. 
b) Increase Correctional Officer retention by 10% compared to historical retention 
rate. 
The turnover rate for CO in CY24 was 8.5%. Based on historical data of 8.6%, the FBOP 
turnover rate decreased 1.2%. 
c) Increase New Hire retention by 10% compared to historical retention rate. 
The turnover rate for new hires in CY24 was 16.7%. Based on the historical data of 
19.1%, the turnover rate decreased by 12.6% 
d) Increase Nurse retention by 10% compared to historical retention rate. 
The turnover rate for CO in CY24 was 11.7%. Based on historical data of 12.9%, the 
FBOP turnover rate decreased by 9.3%.

The Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not attended SHU training, but he 
had worked in the SHU approximately 10 to 20 times. According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he 
reported for a voluntary overtime shift from 12:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and then worked his regular 8:00 a.m. 
to 4:00 p.m. shift in the warehouse. At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations 
Lieutenant called and asked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed. The 
Material Handler said he worked the 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge and Noel. The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, 
which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from 12:00 a.m. on August 9 through 12:00 a.m. on August 
10. After the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge left at 10:00 p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were 
the only employees working in the SHU from 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. The Material Handler recalled that 
Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting with his attorneys at approximately 8:00 p.m., which was later 
than the rest of the inmates, and was returned to his cell on L Tier. After the Material Handler and Noel 
gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said they left the L Tier area. The Material Handler said Epstein 
was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that Epstein needed a cellmate.

2. 
The 10:00 p.m. SHU Count on August 9 
At the time of the 10:00 p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in 
their cells for the night. At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for 
conducting the 10:00 p.m. stand up count. At 10:00 p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were 
 nd the Material Handler. Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness 
statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff did not perform the 10:00 p.m. 
count in the SHU.34 Nonetheless  
 .nd the Material Handler completed and signed the 10:00 p.m. SHU 
count slip. The 10:00 p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as "73 + 1." According to the 
MCC New York master count sheet for the 10:00 p.m. count on August 9, 2019, all units had verbally 
reported their inmate counts to the Control Center by 10:30 p.m.3s At approximately 10:36 p.m., the Control 
Center completed all paperwork and officially cleared the 10:00 p.m. institutional count. 
The Material Handler said he was present at the time of the 10:00 p.m. count, but that the count was not 
conducted because everyone was tired. The Material Handler noted that on August 9, he had worked an 
overtime shift from 12:00 a.m. until 8:00 a.m., his regular shift from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., followed by his 
SHU overtime shift from 4:00 p.m. to midnight. Thus, at the time of the 10:00 p.m. count, he had worked 22 
consecutive hours at MCC New York. The Material Handler verified that he and Noel signed the 10:00 p.m. 
count slip, and believed that Noel called the Control Center with their count numbers. He did not know why 
the count slip listed "73 + 1". 
The quality of the SHU video footage was poor. Therefore, in conjunction with reviewing the video, the 0IG analyzed 
witness statements and BOP records to better determine what the video depicted.

 The Material Handler said he believed the 
rounds listed on the round sheet as having occurred between 
4:01 p.m. to 7:36 p.m. probably had been done, but he was 
uncertain about the remaining rounds. The Material Handler 
said he had seen officers "blow off' 30-minute rounds in the 
past.'

1. 
Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU 
Federal regulations require that employees "use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties."65
Additionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees "[c]onduct themselves in a manner that 
fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government."66 Because 
"(i]nattention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents," BOP 
standards of conduct also require employees "to remain fully alert and attentive during duty hours." BOP 
policy also requires "fc]ontinuous inmate accountability," which is accomplished through rounds and inmate 
counts.67 Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and ensure that 
they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health. 
BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability 
measures, specifying that correctional staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice 
each hour, no more than 40 minutes apart. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify 
that at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 
5:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., and 10:00 p.m. daily, and also at 10:00 a.m. on weekends and federal holidays. 
The OIG's investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the 
SHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:15 p.m. on August 9, 2019; however, this inmate transfer 
was not documented until approximately 12:35 a.m. on August 10, 2019. Based on this internal transfer, 
BOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. SHU inmate 
counts on August 9 were erroneous. In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, 
which did not show correctional officers walking up or down the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers 
during the count times, a process that is necessary to conduct an accurate count of inmates.° During their 
OIG interviews,' 
_ 
_ 
 the Material Handler 
leach admitted that they did not conduct all of the mandatory 
rounds and inmate counts in the SHU on the evening of August 9 and the morning of Au yst 10.

BOP Program Statement 5500.14. 
As discussed in Chapter 5, OIG found that the security camera video was of low quality. Therefore, the OIG analyzed 
the video in conjunction with BOP records and witness statements regarding the personnel in the SHU and their 
activities.

 land (4) the Material Handlers 
statement to the OIG that no one conducted the 10:00 p.m. count because everyone was tired. 
Instead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found 
that officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and 10, including the Material Handler, 
primarily remained seated in the SHU Officers' Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time, 
suggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of internet searches on MCC New York 
computers. 
All The 
OIG's analysis of the SHU security camera video revealed that after approximately 10:40 p.m., no 
Correctional Officer entered Epstein's tier in the SHU until just before 6:30 a.mj 
The OIG investigation and review concluded that 
the Material 
Handler,' 
railed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their 
respective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and that their actions constituted 
violations of S C.F.R. §§ 2635.101(b)(5) and 2635.705(a), BOP Program Statements 3420.11 and 5500.14, and 
MCC New York SHU Post Orders. 
2. 
False Statements and Lack of Candor 
The OIG's investigation and review found that on August 9 and 10, 2019 
 he Material Handleri 
I made false statements when they falsified BOP records by 
attesting that they had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not. 
Federal law provides that "whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the 
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully...makes or uses any false writing or document 
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry" has violated 
U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). 
As discussed above, the OIG found that 
the Material Handler, 
failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each 
institutional inmate count, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two correctional officers 
to conduct each count and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York 
form, often called a count slip.69 On the count slip, both correctional officers are required to fill in the date 
and time the count had been performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
counted, and then sign the count slip. Once the correctional officers complete and sign the count slips, the 
count slips are then collected and delivered to the MCC New York Control Center. Officers assigned to the 
Control Center are responsible for comparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's 
overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each inmate was accounted for.7° Only after all the count slips 
have been collected from each housing unit and the numbers on the count slips had been matched to the

the Material Handler 
signed a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability 
responsibilities when, in fact, they had not." These individuals admitted to the OIG that instead of 
performing their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed 
were in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the 
documents knowing that they falsely attested to having completed the counts.

Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime 
The Material Handler told the OIG that on August 9 he reported for a voluntary overtime shift from 12:00

that he felt pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from 12:00

to the OIG that on the evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not 
conduct the mandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired.

The BOP should develop and implement a plan to address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
Since at least 2015, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including 
medical staffing shortages." This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies 
on inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts-24 hours straight—
on August 9, 2019, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for 
inmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the 10:00 p.m. 
SHU inmate count because they were tired.'

Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the O16 that on August 9, 2019, he worked in the Control Center from 
approximately 4:00 p.m. until 12:00 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from 12:00 a.m. until 
8:00 a.m. on August 10. According to Senior Officer Specialist 6, he took the August 9 10:00 p.m. 
institutional count by himself in the Control Center, and assisted with the 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 
a.m. counts on August 10 as an internal officer. Senior Officer Specialist 6 confirmed to the OIG, as MCC 
New York records reflect, that he had received verbal counts from all units by 10:30 p.m., and further stated 
that he had cleared the institutional count at 10:36 p.m., which was when paperwork was complete and the 
count was officially complete. 
Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the MCC New York 10:00 p.m. institutional count, which showed that the 
SHU had 73 inmates assigned, whereas the Receiving and Discharge Department had zero inmates assigned 
to the unit. When questioned by the OIG about the 10:00 p.m. SHU count slip that listed "73 + 1" inmates 
and was signed by the[ 
and Noel, Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that he believed 
that the "+ 1" on the count slip was in his handwriting. Senior Officer Specialist 6 also reviewed the 10:00 
p.m. Receiving and Discharge count slip, which listed "95 + 1" on the count slip, and told the OIG that it was 
his handwriting.36 Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the "9S + 1" on the SHU count slip meant that he 
was "ghost counting" the inmate (Inmate 4) who had been moved from the SHU, located in the 9 South area, 
to the Receiving and Discharge area earlier that day. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said that because there 
were, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the 10:00 p.m. count, he should have written "73 - 1" on 
the SHU count slip rather than "73 + 1".

Senior Officer Specialist 6 did not recall if he wrote on the count slips at the time of the 10:00 p.m. count or 
during the 12:00 a.m. count when Inmate 4 was transferred in SENTRY from the SHU to Receiving and 
Discharge. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that if he had made the notations at the time of the 10:00 
p.m. count, he should not have cleared the count. Instead, he should have created a new master count 
sheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the 
inaccurate SHU count slip. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that an Operations Lieutenant would have

The 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. SHU Counts on August 10 
During his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate 
transfer, the 12:00 a.m. institutional count, and the housing unit count slips. Based on his review of this 
material, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the 12:00 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued 
to list 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior 
Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. 
counts and told the OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff 
members were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with 
transporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then followed the 
ambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.

4. 
Clearing the 10:00 p.m. Institutional Count Knowing that It Was Inaccurate 
The OIG's investigation and review determined that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York staff cleared the 
10:00 p.m. institutional count knowing that the inmate counts from two housing units were inaccurate. 
During his OIG interview, Senior Officer Specialist 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admitted that 
he amended the 10:00 p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an 
attempt to reflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU following the internal inmate transfer that 
resulted in a SHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day. Senior 
Officer Specialist 6 acknowledged that he should have requested a recount from the SHU, but instead he 
cleared the 10:00 p.m. count. Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the action he took was known as 
"ghost counting," something he said he would not have done without authorization from the Operations 
Lieutenant or someone of a higher rank than himself.

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 
from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved 
the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, 
a Material Handler, Correctional Officer 2, and Correctional Officer Tova Noel. The Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge stated that when he began his shift, Epstein was visiting with his attorneys in the attorney 
conference room. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a 
conversation with the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate. When advised 
that the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge was confident about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge stated, "I don't necessarily want to call anyone a liar() per se, but I don't remember him 
speaking to me about this. So, maybe he spoke to (Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe I was standing 
there, and he thought I heard him." The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC 
New York with all of his belongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him 
because Epstein was required to have a cellmate. 
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he eventually learned later that evening that 
Epstein did not have a cellmate. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after Epstein 
returned from his attorney visit and placed a telephone call, he escorted Epstein to his cell and saw that 
Inmate 3 was not there. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that 
Epstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU 
that evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said 
SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein. In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that 
Epstein did not have a cellmate.

The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during 
the time of Epstein's telephone call but did not overhear Epstein's conversation. The Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge also said that while Epstein was having his telephone call, the officers were distracted by 
the actions of another inmate.!

In his interview with the OIG. the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknowledged that neither he nor 
any other SHU staff member conducted the 4:00 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4:00 p.m. SHU count slip and said 
he had prepared the count slip ahead of time because "Where was so much going on" in the SHU that day. 
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel's name and signature also appeared on the 
4:00 p.m. count slip.33 During his OIG interview, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed BOP 
documents regarding the inmate's transfer from the SHU and acknowledged further that based on that 
transfer, the number of inmates listed on the SHU count slip he and Noel submitted for the 4:00 p.m. count, 
the count slip was incorrect.

The available video showed that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted toward the L 
Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge.%  
" The OIG found the video captured by the camera at the entrance to the 10 South Unit to be of low quality. Due to the 
video's low quality and the distance between the camera and the SHU common area, the OIG was able to observe 
movement of Individuals within the SHU but was not always able to conclusively Identify the individuals. The OIG was 
also not always able to determine the specific destinations of the individuals seen in the video given that the camera 
only captured partial views of the stairways to the various SHU tiers. The OIG found that movements captured on the 
video were generally consistent with employee actions described by multiple witnesses and certain actions documented 
in BOP records.

On August 9, 
al the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
 !assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their permanent quarterly 
assigned pos and served as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts.59 The OIG 
investigation found that each of these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all 
times per the Psychology Department's directive. 
The OIG further found that on August 9 
the Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge' 
became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein's 
cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status known to all 
MCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the 
institution.

The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHUM the Evening 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge  
became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate. The Evening 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein's 
telephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed 
the need for Epstein to have a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG 
that he notified an unspecified supervisor. 
The OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2019  
the Evening 
Watch SHU Officer in Chargr 
failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein's cellmate was 
permanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of 
conduct. Additionally 
 inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none I
MMI
documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally, 
officers 
failed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not 
immediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who 
had been released from suicide watch and psychological observation 10 days earlier had an appropriate 
cellmate.

The OIG investigation and review concluded that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
failed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts du ing 
respective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and that  
 • ctions constitute 
violations of S C.F.R. §§ 2635.101(b)(5) and 2635.705(a), BOP Program Statements 3420.11 and 5500.14, and 
MCC New York SHU Post Orders. 
2. 
False Statements 
The OIG's investigation and review found that on August 9 and 10, 2019, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in 
Charge,' 
made false statements when 
falsified BOP records by 
attesting thatis
lhad completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact 
had not. 
Federal law provides that "whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the 
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully...makes or uses any false writing or document 
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry' has violated 
U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). 
As discussed above, the OIG found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge  
failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each 
institutional inmate count BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two correctional officers 
to conduct each count and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York 
form, often called a count slip.69 On the count slip, both correctional officers are required to fill in the date 
and time the count had been performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
counted, and then sign the count slip. Once the correctional officers complete and sign the count slips, the 
count slips are then collected and delivered to the MCC New York Control Center. Officers assigned to the 
Control Center are responsible for comparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's 
overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each inmate was accounted for.7° Only after all the count slips 
have been collected from each housing unit and the numbers on the count slips had been matched to the 
This BOP form is officially entitled "Metropolitan Correctional Center; New York, New York; Official Count Slip?

institution's overall inmate count sheet, could the institutional count be deemed "cleared" or completed. 
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
signed a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability 
responsibilities when, in fact, they had not." - 
 admitted to the OIG that instead of 
performing their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed 
were in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them 
documents knowing that they falsely attested to having completed the counts.

 that the

Additionally, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9, 2019, said he and all other SHU staff were 
aware of Epstein's cellmate requirement.

ge said that since he had the most experience and 
seniority, he was considered by everyone to be the SHU Officer in Charge,' 
 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a 
cellmate. He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or 
psychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant 
had instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge, between July 30 and August 9, 2019, he told all other MCC New York staff members 
who worked in the SHU of Epstein's cellmate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in 
the SHU should have known that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knowledge, training, 
and experience. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2019, the SHU staff 
received an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as "WAB," which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was 
being removed from MCC New York. He told the O16 that sometime between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., he 
escorted Epstein from the SHU to the attorney conference room for Epstein's daily legal visit, during which 
time Epstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were 
accompanied by Correctional Officer 1, who was escortin: Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge 
  told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to 
Receiving and Discharge with all of his belongings  
said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge informed Epstein that he would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3's departure 
and the requirement that Epstein have a cellmate 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he and Correctional Officer 1 left 
the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities 
Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants' Office and should have seen that Inmate 
was departing the institution when they passed the office. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York, 
there had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal, 
only to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances. According to the Day 
Watch SHU Officer in Charge, he did not select a new cellmate for Epstein because he was not certain that 
Inmate 3 had been discharged from the institution, although he assumed that Inmate 3 would not return to 
the SHU. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when his shift ended at approximately 2:00 
p.m., he informed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Senior Officer Specialist 5 that, if Inmate 3 
did not return to the SHU, Epstein would need a new cellmate upon Epstein's return from his attorney visit. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he specifically recalled telling the Evening Watch SHU Officer in 
Charge, in the presence of Senior Officer Specialist 5, "Make sure this guy gets a bunkie," to which the 
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge replied, "All right." The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that, at 
Limited Official Use Only—Not for Public Release 
EFTA00035973
--- PAGE 5 ---
Limited Official Use Only—Not for Public Release 
some point that day, it was likely that he also informed the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, but he could 
not specifically recall if he had done so. 
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that a replacement cellmate should have been identified 
as soon as it was confirmed that Inmate 3 had left the institution. He said a new cellmate could have been 
reassigned before the 4:00 p.m. SHU count if it was known that Inmate 3 was not coming back, but the SHU 
staff members had until Epstein returned from his attorney visit to assign Epstein a new cellmate. 
According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, SHU staff definitely should have realized that Inmate 3 
was not returning both during the 4:00 p.m. count and when Epstein returned from his attorney visit later 
that evening. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that Epstein's daily routine was that he 
would be with his attorneys in the attorney conference room until approximately 8:00 p.m., so SHU 
personnel had time to make a new cellmate assignment. He said all SHU staff members shared the 
responsibility to find a replacement cellmate and that anyone assigned to the SHU could have found 
another inmate to replace Inmate 3. However, he also said that due to Epstein's high profile, the SHU 
personnel should have asked a lieutenant to contact the Psychology Department to see which inmate 
should be placed with Epstein. 
On August 12, 2019, following Epstein's death, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge wrote a memorandum 
to the Warden stating, "On Friday August 9, 2019 at approximately 1:50 p.m., I S/O/S [the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge] passed on to oncoming staff member [the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge] and 
present shift staff [Senior Officer Specialist 5] and [Correctional Officer 2] that Inmate [3] was going WAB 
[i.e., with all of his belongings] and possibly may not return. Also that Inmate Epstein #76318-054 will be 
needing a cell mate upon arrival from his attorney visit" The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge departed the 
SHU at approximately 2:00 p.m. and worked an overtime shift as a driver for MCC New York. He stated that 
he did not follow up with the SHU staff to verify that Epstein had been assigned another cellmate.

the Day Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a "cheat sheet," which lists the number of 
inmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time. 
When interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4:00 p.m. SHU count slip 
from August 9, 2019, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Correctional Officer 
Noel. Based on his review, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge and Noel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote down 
the numbers they thought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately 
included an inmate (Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been 
transferred to another housing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, 
earlier that afternoon the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 attempt to retrieve an 
unknown item from his visitor in h MCC New YorkS

The Day Watch SHU Officer in 
Charge told the OIG that if the 4:00 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge and the SHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.

every day. He said that the Warden, lieutenants, and other MCC New York staff members frequently told 
the SHU staff to conduct rounds and to keep an eye on Epstein. To reinforce this message, the Day Watch 
SHU Officer in Charge created a sign on orange paper that he hung on a computer in the SHU officers area 
that said, "MANADATORY [sic] ROUNDS MUST BE CONDUCTED EVERY 30 MINUTES ON EPSTEIN # 76318.054

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the O16 that at least five cell searches should be conducted on 
the day and night watch shifts within the SHU, and that cell searches are conducted in cells every time the 
inmate departs the cell. He said the SHU Officer in Charge was responsible for making sure the searches 
were conducted and logged into the BOP TRUSCOPE database. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said 
that only one cell search was entered into TRUSCOPE on August 9, 2019, because cell searches were tedious 
to enter, and he was busy. He did not believe that it was a problem that only one cell search was logged on 
August 9, because he said the SHU staff would have gone into every cell when the inmates took their 
showers. He said that during the period of Epstein's custody, SHU inmates showered on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that during showers, SHU staff 
searched every cell. He explained that all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9 
because it was a shower day. He said SHU staff should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to the 
recreation area or for attorney visits. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein's cell 
should have been searched because both Epstein and Inmate 3 left the cell on the morning of August 9. He 
further stated that he believed that the majority of cells in the SHU were searched

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the O16 that in 
August 2019, each inmate would have been authorized to 
have two sheets and one blanket. He said that in the winter, 
inmates are allowed to have an additional blanket. When 
interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in 
Charge reviewed a picture of Epstein's cell from August 10, 
2019, after Epstein had been removed from the cell. The 
Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said there appeared to be 
an excess number of linens and blankets in the cell, which 
he believed were for both Epstein and Inmate 3, and that 
there were possibly a couple of extra sheets as well. He 
noted that there were two mattresses in the cell and 
deduced that Inmate 3's assigned items had not yet been 
removed even though he had departed MCC New York 
earlier that day. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in 
Charge, Inmate 3's items should have been removed as 
soon as the SHU staff knew Inmate 3 was not returning. He 
told the OIG that any extra linens or blankets should be 
removed when the inmates take showers and their cells are 
searched. He told the OIG that he believed the purpose of 
limiting the linens provided to the inmates was to ensure 
there was enough to go around and that it was more of an administrative matter rather than a security

On August 9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
were each assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their permanent quarterly 
assigned post and served as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts.S9 The OIG 
investigation found that each of these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all 
times per the Psychology Department's directive. 
The OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, 
became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein's 
cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status known to all 
MCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the 
institution. Specifically, the OIG investigation found that on the morning of August 9, the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Chargear—r-a
Ireviewed 
the MCC New York 
daily call out list, a document that identifies all inmates who were leaving their housing units each day, 
which listed Inmate 3 as being scheduled to depart MCC New York with all of his belongings.  
t 
he Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the 
SHU to the attorney conference room fort 
daily meeting with his attorneys. 6° During the escort, the Day 
Watch SHU Officer in Char,,. • 
discussed the need to assign Epstein with a new  
cellmate due to Inmate 3's transfer.b1 I he Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG  
that he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified 
lieutenant. However, the OIG did not credit the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge's account because no 
other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in fact passed on information regarding Epstein's need 
for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.

The OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2019, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge,  
failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein's ce mate was 
permanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of 
conduct. Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because n 
individuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally, 
 officers 
failed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not 
immediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who 
had been released from suicide watch and psychological observation 10 days earlier had an appropriate 
cellmate.

As discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge

August 9; however, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that he failed to document the cell searches 
within the TRUSCOPE system as required because he was too busy with other duties. The Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge further stated that any of the SHU staff could have logged the cell searches into 
TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily h SHU Officer in

The OIG found that on August 9, 2019, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the 
required cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU,) 
Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU 
Officer in Charge 
who served as the SHU Officer in 
Charge during their respective shifts on August 9 and 10, 2019, to have permitted Epstein to have an 
excessive amount of linens in his cell.

breakfast to Epstein through the food slot in his locked 
cell door, Epstein did not respond to Thomas's verbal 
commands. Thomas unlocked the cell door and saw 
Epstein hanged. Thomas immediately yelled for Noel 
to get help and call for a medical emergency. 
Thomas told the OIG that when he entered Epstein's 
cell, Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a 
sheet or a shirt, around his neck that was tied to the 
top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended 
from the top bunk in a near-seated position, with his 
buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off 
the floor. Thomas said he immediately ripped the 
orange string from the bunkbed, and Epstein's buttocks 
dropped to the ground. Thomas then lowered Epstein's 
body to the floor and began chest compressions until 
responding MCC New York staff members arrived 
approximately 1 minute later. Shortly thereafter, 
outside medical personnel arrived and took over the 
emergency response, eventually removing Epstein to a 
local hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical 
Examiner performed an autopsy and determined the 
cause of death was hanging and the manner of death 
was suicide. Blood toxicology tests did not reveal any 
medications or illegal substances in Epstein's system. 
The Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy told 
the OIG that Epstein's injuries were consistent with 
suicide by hanging and that there was no evidence of 
defensive wounds that would be expected if his death 
had been a homicide. Epstein did not have marks on 
his hands, broken fingernails or debris under them, 
contusions to his knuckles that would have evidenced a 
fight, or, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to 
convulsing from hanging, bruising on his body. 
On August 10, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the two SHU 
staff on duty,  
land 
Material Handler Michael Thomas, began delivering 
breakfast to SHU inmates. Tova unlocked the door to 
Epstein's SHU tier. When Thomas attempted to deliver

Significant Entities and Individuals 
L _ 
land Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC New 
York SHU at 12:00 a.m. on August 10, 2019.5 During their shift, they each created and submitted falsified 
official BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as "count slips"),I 
Thomas did not work his regular 4:00 p.m. to 12: 00 a.m. 
shift as a Material Handler in a different location of MCC New York and instead worked an overtime shift in the SHU 
from 12:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. on August 10, 2019.

On November 19, 2019, a federal grand ry of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York 
returned an indictment that chargennd Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple 
counts each of falsification of records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1001(a)(3), and 2. The indictment 
alleged that on August 9, 2019,1 
 and that on August 10, 2019, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the 
mandatory 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. counts and mandatory 30-minute rounds within the MCC 
New York SHU. The indictment further alleged that 
j and Thomas created, certified, and submitted false 
documentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to 
perform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU, 
including Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact no correctional officer had checked on 
Epstein from approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9, 2019, until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 2019, 
when Epstein was found hanged in his cell. 
On May 25, 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred 
prosecution agreements with 
l
e
and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court 
record in their cases, included admissions band 
Thomas that they falsely certified that they had 
conducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely 
disclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the U.S. 
Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete 100 hours of 
community service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision 
and their establishment of good behavior. On December 13, 2021, after Inland Thomas successfully 
fulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all charges 
pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count slips and 
round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein's death. 
As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report the OIG found that, in addition to 
and 
Thomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor 
judgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties. 
II. 
Methodology 
During the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one 
occasion. The witnesses interviewed included 
Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the 
SHU on Au ust 9-10 
• MCC New York 
These BOP forms are officially entitled " Official Count Slip" and "MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute 
Check sheer Each of the six tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had 13 entries reflecting 30-
minute rounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.

Material Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August 10 from 12:00 
a.m. until 8:00 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on 
numerous previous occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures. Thomas said he 
knew that if an inmate came off suicide watch or psychological observation, they should be assigned a 
cellmate, and said he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological 
observation. Therefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, but said no one had 
spoken with him about that requirement. Thomas said the SHU staff should have notified the Operations 
Lieutenant as soon as they knew that Epstein's cellmate had departed MCC New York on August 9. 
However, Thomas said he did not know that Inmate 3 was removed from MCC New York on August 9, and 
that Epstein was without a cellmate during his shift on August 10.

At approximately 12r
. 
-n. on August 10, 2019, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material 
Handler, and he an . 
 were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. 
and Thomas were 
responsible for conducting the 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and 
analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that 
and Thomas did not perform any of these counts. Nonetheless b 
1. nd Thomas completed and 
signed SHU count slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center 
cleared the 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. institutional counts at approximately 12:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., 
and 5:30 a.m., respectively 
A and Thomas both admitted to the OIG that they did not conduct the 12:00 
a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. counts on August 10, and that they had falsified the respective count slips.

Thomas told the OIG that since he had begun working with the BOP in 2007, he had worked in the SHU fairly 
regularly and he was familiar with how to work in the SHU and how the SHU operated. Thomas described 
his responsibilities while working in the SHU as to maintain the count of inmates, make sure the inmates are 
fed, and, depending on the shift, make sure they get their showers. Thomas's Overtime Schedule showed 
that he worked 21 shifts in the SHU during morning watch from May through August 2019. The overtime 
schedule also showed that Thomas worked 12 overtime shifts in the SHU when Epstein was assigned to the 
SHU in July and August 2019. 
Thomas acknowledged that neither he nor Noel conducted any rounds or counts in the SHU during their 
shift between approximately 12:00 a.m. and approximately 6:30 a.m. Thomas said the August 10, 2019 
round sheets were signed, but the rounds were not conducted because he was tired that day. Thomas 
recalled "dozing off from here and there" during his shift, but he did not know if Noel slept. 
Thomas did not recall having a conversation with anyone concerning the discrepancy between the 12:00 
a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 73 inmates, and the institutional count, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU. 
Thomas said he had filled out and signed the 3:00 a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU. 
Thomas did not know why the number of inmates was different on the 12:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. count slips 
and did not recall speaking with the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant about the 12:00 a.m. count. 
Thomas told the OIG that he knew he was falsely certifying the count slips when he signed them on August 
10, 2019. 
This BOP form is officially entitled "MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check Sheet."

SHU Round Sheet on August 10, 2019, from 12:00 a.m. until Epstein was found hanged in his cell at 
approximately 6:30 a.m. I 
Through review and analysis of the SHU 
video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined thatinnd Thomas did not

VI. 
Epstein's Death on August 10 
A. 
Discovery of Epstein Hanged in Cell and Emergency Response 
On August 10, 2019, shortly after 6:00 a.m., the doorbell to the SHU rang, indicating that a delivery of 
breakfast carts had arrived at the SHU  
 nd Thomas retrieved the breakfast carts from the double-
locked entrance to the SHU and brought them inside the SHU. At the time, Thomas andl 
 ere the only 
officers in the SHU. At approximately 6:30 a.m., MCC New York security camera video recordings show  
and Thomas walking toward the L Tier. 
nd Thomas told the OIG that at this time they were entering 
the L Tier, in which Epstein was housed, to deliver breakfast to the inmates. As discussed previously, 
between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, the OIG did not 
observe on the available recorded video any correctional officers or other individuals approach the L Tier 
where Epstein was housed from the common area of the SHU. 
Thomas told the OIG that he knocked on Epstein's cell door, saw a portion of Epstein through the window 
but could not make out what he saw, so he said to Epstein, "Come to the door, come to the door.' Thomas 
said he did not observe any movement or hear a response, so he unlocked the cell door, entered the cell, 
and saw Epstein hanged as described further below. Thomas said he immediately yelled for Noel to get 
help, and that Noel activated a body alarm, signaling a medical emergency, and began taking the steps 
described below.

Figure 5.3: Photograph of a Piece of Orange Cloth Hanging from the Bunkbed in Epstein's Cell 
Following His Death 
Thomas explained that when he first entered Epstein's cell, 
Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a sheet or a 
shirt, around his neck. The end of the string was tied to the 
top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended from the 
top bunk in a near-seated position, with his buttocks 
approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his 
legs extended out straight on the floor. Thomas said Epstein 
did not look discolored or very different from when he last 
saw Epstein alive. Thomas said he immediately ripped the 
orange sheet or shirt away from the bunkbed, and Epstein's 
buttocks dropped approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half to 
the ground. Thomas then lowered Epstein's entire body to 
the floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was 
breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest 
compressions until responding MCC New York staff members 
arrived approximately 1 minute later. Thomas said he did not 
provide rescue breaths and was unaware if Epstein was dead 
or alive because he never checked for a pulse before initiating 
chest compressions. Thomas said medical personnel took 
over the emergency response, including chest compressions 
and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when they arrived. Thomas said he assisted with 
bringing Epstein down to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and that he left MCC New York at 
approximately 8:00 a.m. Thomas said he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training during 
MCC New York annual refresher training and had responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this 
was the first time he was the first responder. 
Thomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on August 10, 2019, from 12:00 a.m. until the 
time he attempted to deliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:30 a.m., and did not see anyone go 
inside Epstein's cell during his shift. Thomas said that he would have known if someone went in or out of 
Epstein's cell, and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see Epstein's cell door from the SHU 
Officers' Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage point. Thomas said that it was not 
possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knowledge because he or Noel would have had to 
open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to the SHU was located in the Control 
Center; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys required to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, 
Thomas said that anyone attempting to access the L Tier where Epstein was located would have had to walk 
directly in front of the SHU Officers' Station where Thomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that 
he or Noel had any role in Epstein's death.

and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers' Station immediately outside the L tier during 
that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the L Tier. We additionally found that 
Thomas' and r 
reaction on the morning of August 10 upon finding Epstein hanging in his cell, as 
described to us by Thomas, 
was consistent with their being 
unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein's cell at about 6:30 a.m. on

Instead of performing the required duties to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing, the OIG found 
that officers assigned to the SHU on August 9 and 10, including 
and Thomas, 
primarily remained seated in the SHU Officers' Station—sometimes without moving for a period of time, 
suggesting that they were asleep—and conducted a variety of internet searches on MCC New York 
computers. Thomas also admitted to the OIG that he "dozed off for periods of time during his shift. The 
OIG's analysis of the SHU security camera video revealed that after approximately 10:40 ..m., no 
Correctional Officer entered Epstein's tier in the SHU until just before 6:30 a.m. when 
d Thomas 
began to serve breakfast to the inmates. 
 Invf igation and review concluded that 
and Thomas failed to conduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their 
respective shifts in the MCC New York SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and that their actions constituted 
violations of S C.F.R. §§ 2635.101(b)(5) and 2635.705(a), BOP Program Statements 3420.11 and 5500.14, and 
MCC New York SHU Post Orders. 
2. 
False Statements and Lack of Candor 
The OIG's investigation and review found that on August 9 and 10, 2019, 
land Thomas made false statements when they falsified BOP records by 
attesting that they had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts when, in fact, they had not. 
Federal law provides that "whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the 
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully...makes or uses any false writing or document 
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry" has violated 
U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). 
As discussed above, the OIG found that 
 and Thomas failed to conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts. As part of each 
institutional inmate count, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require two correctional officers 
to conduct each count and memorialize the number of inmates in the SHU on an official MCC New York 
form, often called a count slip.69 On the count slip, both correctional officers are required to fill in the date 
and time the count had been performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
counted, and then sign the count slip. Once the correctional officers complete and sign the count slips, the 
count slips are then collected and delivered to the MCC New York Control Center. Officers assigned to the 
Control Center are responsible for comparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's 
overall inmate count sheet to ensure that each inmate was accounted for.7° Only after all the count slips 
have been collected from each housing unit and the numbers on the count slips had been matched to the

 and Thomas each prepared and/or 
signed a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability 
responsibilities when, in fact, they had not?' These individuals admitted to the OIG that instead of 
performing their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed 
were in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the 
documents knowing that they falsely attested to having completed the counts.

rounds. Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office 
for the Southern District of New York. 
The OIG investigation has found that

had completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2019, and morning of

MEMORANDUM FOR 
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION 
FROM:

External Auditing Branch 
SUBJECT: 
Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP or Bureau) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to 
the Office of the Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on December 22, 2024. 
The Bureau has completed its review of the analysis and offers the following status update regarding 
the analysis and its recommendations. 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on 
the particular individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5321.09 to address the recommendation. The BOP has 
indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union negotiation 
process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) 
finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the finalized policy to the OIG for 
review. 
EFTA00036006
--- PAGE 2 ---
FBOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of the Bureau's previous status update, the 
Bureau is in the process of revising Program Statement 5321.09, Unit Management and Inmate 
Program Review, to address the recommendation, and has indicated that these revisions must 
follow the normal policy development and Union negotiation process. Because revisions to 
Program Statements must follow the normal Bureau development and Union negotiation process, 
they are subject to change. The Bureau will provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high 
risk for suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate 
until the recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency 
plan for cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular 
individual or security considerations. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5321.09 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: Please see the Bureau's status update to Recommendation One, above. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, 
and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its 
process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5324.08 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (1) finalizes policy revisions referenced in its update, and (2) provides the 
finalized policy to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of the Bureau's previous status update, the 
Bureau is in the process of revising Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program, to 
address the recommendation, and has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal 
policy development and Union negotiation process. Because revisions to Program Statements 
must follow the normal Bureau development and Union negotiation process, they are subject to 
change. The Bureau will provide further updates as they become available. 
EFTA00036007
--- PAGE 3 ---
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those 
methods through policy, training, or other measures. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5500.14 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
has indicated that these revisions must follow the normal BOP development and Union 
negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation 
after the BOP (1) finalizes the policy revisions referenced in its update; and (2) provides the 
finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in OIG's analysis of Bureau's previous status update, the Bureau 
is in the process of revising Program Statement 5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures 
Manual, to address the recommendation, and has indicated that these revisions must follow the 
normal policy development and Union negotiation process. Because revisions to Program 
Statements must follow the normal Bureau development and Union negotiation process, they are 
subject to change. The Bureau will provide further updates as they become available. 
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
conducting a round. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has described 
revisions it is making to Program Statement 5500.14 to address the recommendation. The BOP 
also previously indicated that the policy revisions will require Lieutenants to conduct training 
sessions that allow for individual assessment and training regarding conducting rounds to be 
tailored to the needs of each individual facility. The BOP has indicated that these revisions must 
follow the normal BOP development and Union negotiation process. Accordingly, the OIG will 
consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the policy revisions 
referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized program statement to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: Please see the Bureau's status update to Recommendation Four, above. 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to 
address staffing shortages at its prisons. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The BOP has reported 
that it has implemented the staffing tool for all professions, but that it is still working on several 
other initiatives regarding staffing, including analyzing the agency's usage and effectiveness of 
both recruitment and retention incentives, analyzing whether the new incentives and nation-wide 
direct hire authority mentioned in its update above have made an impact on the staffing shortage, 
and establishing a nationwide special salary rate for institution positions. The OIG will continue 
to monitor the BOP's progress regarding staffing shortages at its prisons. In addition, per the 
OIG's communications with the BOP, we believe that certain information that the BOP has 
EFTA00036008
--- PAGE 4 ---
provided or will provide to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will 
facilitate the resolution and closure of this recommendation. Accordingly, we will consider 
whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides the OIG any additional 
contractor and BOP work product that has been submitted to the GAO in response to the GAO 
Staffing Audit recommendations,; (2) provides the OIG an update on the contractor's or BOP's 
analysis of staffing incentives since March 2023, whether submitted yet to GAO or not; (3) 
provides the OIG any additional reports submitted to Congressional appropriation committees 
related to staffing; and (4) provides the OIG with an update on the salary proposal submitted to 
OPM, including whether OPM has approved or disapproved of the pay table proposals. 
FBOP Response: O1O indicates that it will consider whether to close this recommendation after 
the Bureau: 
1. Provides any additional contractor and BOP work product that has been submitted 
to the GAO in response to the GAO Staffing Audit recommendations. 
Please see the Bureau's response to GAO's staffing audit recommendations (attachment "Rec 6 
GAO Staffing Audit response"). 
2. Provides an update on the contractor's or BOP's analysis of staffing incentives since 
March 2023, whether submitted yet to GAO or not. 
Following GAO's recommendation, the Bureau developed four goals: 1) Increase overall 
employee retention by 5% compared to historical retention rate; 2) Increase Correctional Officer 
retention by 10% compared to historical retention rate; 3) Increase New Hire retention by 10% 
compared to historical retention rate; and 4) Increase Nurse Practitioner retention by 10% 
compared to historical retention rate. These goals were developed based on the Bureau's most 
pressing needs and high-risk positions and were formalized in the 2023 Bureau Incentives 
Playbook. Additionally, to provide a holistic understanding of the effectiveness of the Bureau's 
incentives usage, an assessment of FY2024 local awards and incentives was conducted after 
tracking this information for a full year and collecting local awards data across all Bureau 
institutions. The report details monetary awards spending, time off hours awarded, and 
recruitment and referral awards distributed at the local level. 
Based on the analysis, the Bureau has begun to achieve the four identified goals. Between 
FY2023 and FY2024, the Bureau saw notable improvement in overall employee retention rates, 
increasing from 90.7% in FY2023 to 93.9% in FY2024, an increase of 3.2%. For Correctional 
Officers specifically, the position saw a retention rate increase of 3.9%, from 91.8% in FY2023 
to 95.7% in FY2024. Additionally, Nurse Practitioners retention increased by 6.2%, from 85.8% 
in FY2023 to 92% in FY2024. Additional data is pending to review whether the Bureau is 
meeting its goal for New Hires. 
Due to budgetary constraints, the Bureau is reducing or eliminating our use of incentives 
effective March 23, 2025. 
EFTA00036009
--- PAGE 5 ---
3. Provides any additional reports submitted to Congressional appropriation 
committees related to staffing. 
The Bureau has no further information to provide regarding reports submitted to Congressional 
appropriation committees related to staffing. However, the Bureau's funding proposal seeks 
$1,000,730,000 over the next five years to cover Special Salary Rates for the Bureau's current 
authorized levels of corrections officers and covered nurses; and an increase of 4,500 
Correctional Officer positions and 200 nurses along with $1,570,000,000 to fund those positions. 
The increase in positions is based on projections from the newly launched Automated Staffing 
Tool. 
4. Provides an update on the salary proposal submitted to OPM, including whether 
OPM has approved or disapproved of the pay table proposals. 
The Bureau has not received any updates nor been advised of any adjudications related to the 
submitted Special Salary Requests for Correctional Officers and Nurses. Both requests are still 
under OPM review and pending an outcome. The Bureau will continue to evaluate and submit 
special salary rate requests during the annual OPM data call for individual institution and 
positions; however, no additional nationwide proposals are being considered at this time. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera 
system functionality checks. 
OIG Analysis: The BOP's update is responsive to the recommendation. The OIG reviewed the 
BOP's new Security Camera Monthly Report and appreciates the progress the BOP has made in 
creating this form and instituting the new monthly reporting process. Accordingly, the OIG will 
consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (I) finalizes the policy updates 
referenced in its update; and (2) provides the finalized policies to the OIG for review. 
FBOP Response: As indicated in the previous status update, Program Statements 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, and 4200.12, Facilities Operations Manual, are being 
modified to include protocols and ensure accountability regarding various aspects of the 
Bureau's camera systems, including but not limited to functionality, documentation, and repair. 
Because revisions to Program Statements must follow the normal development and Union 
negotiation process, they are subject to change. The Bureau will provide further updates as they 
become available.

SUBJECT: 
Status Update to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) 
Final Report dated June 26, 2023: Investigation and Review of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York 
The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to provide a response to the Office of the 
Inspector General's above referenced memorandum received on June 26, 2023. The BOP has 
completed our review of the analysis and we offer the following status update regarding the analysis 
and its recommendations. 
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate 
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the 
particular individual or security considerations. 
BOP's Response: Reentry Services Division (RSD) and Correctional Programs Division (CPD) 
are collaborating on a CEO memo to provide guidance to the field on a process to ensure 
psychologists make recommendations regarding housing, including the presence of a cellmate, 
for individuals in custody following suicide watch or psychological observation. This process 
will include exemptions based on individual or security considerations. 
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for 
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the 
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate 
EFTA00036011
--- PAGE 2 ---
re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security 
considerations. 
BOP's Response: RSD and CPD are collaborating on a CEO memo to provide guidance to the 
field on procedures to ensure communication regarding the requirement of a cellmate for 
individuals following suicide watch or psychological observation when recommended by a 
psychologist. This will include a procedure for exemptions based on individual or security 
considerations. 
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and 
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or 
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and 
provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to 
mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
observation. 
BOP's Response: The BOP is currently evaluating its process for obtaining and documenting 
approval for social and/or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological 
observation. This evaluation will inform future guidance on this issue. 
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate 
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods 
through policy, training, or other measures. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Program Statement 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is currently being updated to include additional inmate 
accountability aspects. 
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when 
conducting a round. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Program Statement 5500.14, 
Correctional Services Procedures Manual, is currently being updated to include clarification on 
the requirements for conducting Lieutenant rounds. 
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address 
staffing shortages at its prisons. 
BOP's Response: As of June 2023, the BOP has deployed an automated staffing tool for 
institution correctional services departments to be evaluated. The tool continues to be tested and 
evaluated as we prepare to move forward with additional disciplines/departments throughout the 
BOP. Other efforts to retain qualified personnel include but are not limited to the various 
recruitment and retention incentives the BOP currently offers that are available to staff to include 
staggered retention incentives for all who were retirement eligible as of December 31, 2022. In 
March 2023, the Director authorized a bureau-wide recruitment incentive of $10,000 or 25% on 
initial salary (whichever is greater), for newly hired Correctional Officers who onboard between 
EFTA00036012
--- PAGE 3 ---
March 26, 2023, through September 24, 2023. That incentive was recently extended to 
Correctional Officers who enter on duty with an effective date no later than December 17, 2023. 
Further, in July 2023, the Director approved a Bureau-wide retention incentive for all 
Lieutenants. Additionally, the BOP continues to seek other viable pay options for Correctional 
Officers in an effort to remain competitive and attractive to new applicants. 
Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes 
as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As such, our policies will be 
discussed with staff during regular rounds to ensure current procedures are followed where it 
relates to cell searches. 
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional 
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the 
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system 
functionality checks. 
BOP's Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Policy will be updated to 
include the regular functionality checks.

When did you officially become the MCC New York Facility/Facilities Manager? 
When did Facility/Facilities Manager 
stop working at the MCC New York? I have 
been informed that he retired from the BOP in September 2019, but it is my understanding from 
speaking with you that he stopped working at the MCC New York a long while prior. Can you please 
confirm when he stopped filling the role as the MCC New York Facilities Manager? 
Thank you very much in advance. I hope you are well.

Good Afternoon, 
Yes, the camera system was scheduled to start March 17, 2019 and started on schedule. When I 
arrived TOY February 2019 we, only had one Communication Technician. Therefore, after talking to 
the regional office, they started a project to assist in funding and labor, so we were able to start the 
week of March 17, 2019 for the camera system and all other infrastructure throughout the 
institution.

The staff will be working 12 hour days to make repairs to the above items. Once I get a list of interested staff, a

possible, NER and MXR staff first weeks because they are able to drive GOV's. Travel days will be the Sunday 
before and Saturday after. In order to defray costs as much as possible, hotel arrangements have been made at 
a location close to the institution that you are able to walk to and from and of course staff will be receiving per

interested staff and the dates they are available that by leaving your institutions will not create a hardship for 
your daily operation. 
All expenses will be paid from Special Project #1-MIS Project Request - 79F New York Repairs. Because this is a 
MCC there are a very limited number of inmates that can assist therefore the work will be 
accomplished by staff only.

Thank you very much. Per our telephone conversation, was the camera system that was already on 
site and installed the week ending August 16, 2019, ever scheduled to be installed prior to August 10, 
2019? If so, when was it scheduled to be installed and can you please provide documentation (i.e. 
emails or other documents) supporting the date(s)? If not, why was it not scheduled to be installed 
prior to August 10, 2019? 
Thanks again for all of your assistance with this matter.

I didn't want to leave you hanging so this is what we know so far: 
It appears that FedEx must recycle tracking numbers. The order was placed on 9/27/2018 from 
SigNet to Qognify/Nice and the original PO shows it was shipped directly to the site MCC New York. It 
shows that it was scheduled to ship on 9/30/2018 from Qognify. We currently don't have the tracking 
that shows when you exactly received it but best guess is 7 to 14 days which would put it on your 
dock around October 14th 2018 and it was installed the week of August 16th 2019. 
We will continue to try and find the tracking information for when it actually hit your dock. Let me 
know if you need anything else.

Re: Epstein arrival at MCC

This is accurate from the information I have, unless= has additional information. Thanks 
Regional Director 
Northeast Region 
8/12/2019 1:17 PM >> > 
Please review for accuracy before I send to. 
here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC: 
7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population 
(apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming 
so no pkans had been established). 
7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his 
personal safety in general population. 
7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by 
Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was 
under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC: 
7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently 
USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no pkans had been 
established). 
7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal 
safety in general population. 
7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc 
Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour 
observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU. 
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

ANALYSIS OF EVENTS 
Inmate Epstein arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019, as a pre-
trial commit. It appears the staff receiving Inmate Epstein were 
not aware of his broad publicity and placed him within general 
population as a typical inmate. The following day he was placed 
in SHU, reportedly at the direction of the Warden. It is unclear 
how his cellmate was chosen or what method was used to determine 
appropriateness. A review of the assigned cellmate raises 
questions concerning the selection process. 
From his initial placement in SHU, until the date of the incident, 
Inmate Epstein was outside the institution on four occasions to 
attend court appearances and spent a considerable amount of time 
in attorney visitation. His interactions with the various 
departments was considered ordinary, although Inmate Epstein had 
many interactions with the Psychology Department. 
On July 23, 2019, Inmate Epstein was found in a state of 
unresponsiveness within his SHU cell. The investigation into this 
incident was inconclusive to determine if the cellmate was 
involved, if Inmate Epstein had made a suicide attempt or gesture, 
or if he was feigning the incident in an attempt to gain single 
cell status. The investigation was completed properly and 
appropriately without a definitive conclusion. 
Following the July 23, 2019 incident, psychology staff maintained 
appropriate contact with Inmate Epstein to assess his condition 
and level of supervision. Psychology was clear in their 
recommendation for Inmate Epstein to be housed with another inmate

when returned to SHU. Although this information was distributed 
on several fronts, by email from a staff psychologist, through 
individual conversations by the Captain to his Lieutenants, and 
verbally between SHU Officers, there was ultimately a failure to 
place a cellmate with Inmate Epstein. 
On August 10, 2019, the two assigned morning watch SHU Officers 
failed to make their designated rounds or count the SHU inmates 
for two counts. At 6:33 am, upon finding Inmate Epstein 
unresponsive in his cell, with a torn bedsheet around his neck, 
staff utilized a body alarm to initiate a call for assistance. 
The medical response to the incident was timely, efficient, and 
exhaustive. Staff utilized an AED, as well as continuous CPR 
until care was assumed by EMS personnel. 
OTHER FACTORS 
(Directly Related to the Incident) 
Significant discrepancies exist within SENTRY regarding cell 
quarters assignments (QTR). Although it is well documented Inmate 
Epstein was housed with two other inmates during his assignment in 
SHU, SENTRY does not reflect this information accurately. Inmate 
Epstein was found within cell 220, yet SENTRY never reflects him 
being housed within that cell at any time. 
Significant discrepancies exist within SENTRY regarding 
admission/release status (ARS). SENTRY does not reflect Inmate 
Epstein being escorted from the institution by the USMS on 
July 31, 2019, although a signed Prisoner Remand form is 
documented receiving him from the USMS. 
SHU has multiple cells equipped with video recording capability. 
Inmate Epstein was not housed in one of these cells and there 
appears to be no set guidance on when to utilize these cells. 
No notations concerning a requirement for a cellmate were entered 
into the SHU program, and subsequently available for SHU Officers 
to reference. 
An outside person sent $200 each to Inmate Epstein and his 
cellmate Inmate Reyes. The outside person appears to be Inmate 
Epstein's attorney. The purpose of this transaction is 
undetermined at this point. 
In an email to the Warden, dated post incident, the Supervisory 
Staff Attorney reported details of a conversation with Inmate

Epstein's attorneys. Inmate Epstein's attorneys requested he be 
housed in a single cell, the staff attorney stated Inmate Epstein 
could not be housed alone due to previous suicide attempt/gesture. 
During the immediate response to the incident both SHU officers 
made reference to not completing required rounds and counts. This 
was documented by the responding Lieutenant. 
In an email to the Warden, the Captain reported he had "informal 
training sessions" regarding SHU conditions and the housing of 
Inmate Epstein specifically. This meeting was held with 
Correctional Services supervisors and line staff during the week 
of July 31, 2019. Additionally, the Captain states he spoke with 
the SHU Lieutenant concerning the need to house Inmate Epstein 
with a cellmate. 
The Raxichology intake screening contains errors in identifying 
details. Inmate Epstein is referred to as a black inmate and a 
different inmate name is used within the report. 
There are errors within the Risk of Sexual Abusiveness report, 
such as referencing an inaccurate program statement and noting a 
history of prior prison sexual predation. 
Correctional Services and Health Services are not completing 
regular rounds of inmates housed under psychology observation. 
On July 16, 2019, a psychologist met with Inmate Epstein in the 
presence of his attorneys. This was done at the request of Inmate 
Epstein and appears to have been for the purpose of airing 
grievances with conditions of confinement. 
The Suicide Risk Assessment dated July 23, 2019, refers to the 
ligature as a "string" when in fact it was a sizable portion of 
torn bed sheet. 
On August 1, 2019, Correctional Systems staff reported the USMS 
concerns from the previous day regarding Inmate Epstein's suicidal 
tendencies to Psychology staff. It is unknown why this issue was 
not reported to Psychology the previous day. There was a time 
delay between this report and Psychology conducting a suicide risk 
assessment. 
On August 9, 2019, during a shift change in SHU, the SHU #3 
6:00 am-2:00 pm officer briefed his 2:00 pm-10:00 pm relief and 
the other two 8:00 am-4:00 pm officers of the likelihood Inmate

Reyes, Register Number 85993-054 would not be returning and Inmate 
Epstein would require a cellmate upon returning from an attorney 
visit. Inmate Epstein was not placed with a cellmate upon his 
return to SHU. 
SHU 30-minunte check documentation shows a trend of missing rounds 
and rounds which extend beyond the 40-minute limit. 
Count documentation for August 9, 2019, could not be located. 
Official count documentation shows all counts were conducted as 
scheduled, but based cn the statements of the responsible 
officers, this appears to be inaccurate for at least the 3:00 am 
and 5:00 am counts. 
The initial medical screening noted essential hypertension, but 
did not provide treatment. Upon further review it appears this 
diagnosis should not have been issued. 
On July 6, 2019, Health Services notes inmate Epstein has no known 
allergies. On July 30, 2019, a Modified Diet Request is issued by 
Health Services with no accompanying medical record note. 
All psychologists at the institution are state licensed 
clinicians. 
Psychology Observation procedures dictate a Physician's Assistant 
perform daily rounds. This is clearly not possible based on 
Health Services staffing. 
It is not uncommon for staff working vital posts, which require 
effectuating SENTRY transactions, to not have the needed access. 
A review of inmates housed within the suicide watch cells, during 
the period of this review, revealed the inmates were not properly 
assigned within SENTRY. 
Institution Duty Officers (IDO) do not routinely visit SHU each 
day as required by the Institution Supplement (I85502.11). 
Additionally, the IDO reports consistently documents the condition 
of SHU as "satisfactory", when observations have shown the SHU to 
be less than satisfactory. 
The Correctional Services roster requires a complete review to 
best utilize staffing resources. Currently, the roster appears to 
have posts which could be reprioritized.

Staffing 
Staffing changes within the Correctional Services department have 
changed significantly over the past several years. In May of 
2018, during pay period 5, the institution lost 21 positions as a 
result of phase 1 and 2 reductions. These positions consisted of 
correctional officers, 1 lieutenant and 1 SIS technician.

overtime leading up to the incident. The SHU #1 was assigned to 
SHU on mandatory overtime during the incident. This staff member 
does not typically work a large quantity of overtime. The SHU #2 
was assigned to SHU on voluntary overtime. This staff member 
typically works a high volume of overtime on a volunteer basis.

After a thorough review of all available evidence, the review team 
concluded there was a significant breakdown in basic correctional 
practices and communication within the institution. Inmate 
Epstein was an inmate who fell within multiple suicide risk 
groups. He was also an inmate who had risk factors for assault by 
other inmates and did require careful selection for appropriate 
cellmates. Although these issues were noted, well documented, and 
communicated, a failure still occurred by allowing Inmate Epstein 
to be placed in a cell alone. Although feasible for an inmate to 
effectuate suicide while housed with a cellmate, the odds of this 
occurring are significantly lowered when housed with another 
inmate. Without the use of compelled interviews, it is not 
possible to determine the true root of the communication 
breakdown. 
Concerning deficiencies were noted in common functions within the 
institution. It appears a less than satisfactory state of 
condition within the Special Housing Unit has become acceptable to 
responsible staff. The review team observed significant failures 
in basic tasks such as SENTRY entries for quarters changes to the 
base count of the facility. Failure in the area of inmate 
accountability is a substantial finding which will require 
immediate attention.

Although inmate suicides do occur, the Bureau of Prisons has 
developed substantial training resources and processes to mitigate 
an environment leading to a suicide. While many correctional 
professionals completed their responsibilities within these 
processes, the failure to carry out all aspects of the suicide 
prevention process laid the groundwork for an environment 
vulnerable to suicide. At the core of this event was a direct 
dereliction of duty by the assigned correctional workers within 
the Special Housing Unit. Their failure to perform the most basic 
of correctional tasks should be viewed as the primary factor which 
exposed the institution to this event. Had they performed the 
basic task of counting and viewing inmates within their assigned 
area, it is possible this suicide could have been detected or a 
minimum, responded to the event quicker. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
• A multi-disciplinary team assessment should be conducted 
throughout the institution to determine shortcomings and 
provide a corrective action plan. 
• Regional Psychology Administrators should be considered for 
reinstatement to provide a direct contact to field staff. 
• The Institution Supplement on Suicide Prevention is not 
required and occasionally not followed. It is recommended to 
review the need for having this supplement. 
• Currently the Drug Abuse Prevention Coordinator (DAPC) has 
responsibilities between MCC New York and MDC Brooklyn. It 
is recommended this be reviewed to determine if the 
responsibilities are appropriately distributed or if they 
would be better served with an independent DAPC. 
• A single post should be designated to document all movement 
within the facility. This should include internal, court, 
releases, etc. 
• The Correctional Services roster should undergo a complete 
review to determine the best possible use of staff resources. 
• A Deputy Captain should be considered t 
higher level supervision.

MEMORANDUM FOR 
FROM: 
SUBJECT: 
Retention, Recruitment, and Relocation Incentive 
Requests for MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York 
A group retention incentive of 10% and recruitment and 
relocation incentive of 25% is being requested for MDC Brooklyn 
and MCC New York. 
The use of incentives assists the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in 
retaining highly qualified and experienced staff who routinely 
consider leaving the agency and for attracting highly qualified 
applicants. 
Hiring activity reports for all positions advertised for MDC 
Brooklyn and MCC New York between Fiscal Years 2016-2018 
document the following: 
• Fiscal Year 2016, 229 applicants were referred by CSU to 
fill 85 positions. Only 69 were selected for positions. 
• Fiscal Year 2017, 47 applicants were referred by CSU to fill 
positions. Only 12 were selected for positions. 
• Fiscal Year 2018, 82 applicants were referred by CSU to fill 
positions. Only 12 were selected for positions. 
EFTA00036099
--- PAGE 2 ---
• The remaining applicants referred for each period listed 
above either failed pre-employment testing or exceeded 
hiring guidelines. 
MDC Brooklyn's and MCC New York's staffing levels are among the 
lowest in the agency. Currently, their vacancy rate is 12.12% 
and 15.5% respectively. This is a 7% increase from the previous 
year. MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York continue to experience 
difficulty retaining and recruiting qualified employees. Since 
2017, MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York lost 43 and 30 positions 
respectively. Responses compiled through the Exit Survey 
supports reasons for why staff are electing to leave this 
location: urban location of the institutions and lack of 
competitive salary compared to other law enforcement agencies in 
New York City. Additionally, FCI Otisville, located 62 miles 
from MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York, offers the same salary 
despite being a lower security institution in a rural setting. 
Since 2016, MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York has extended retention 
incentives to health services staff occupying hard-to-fill 
medical positions and lieutenants, which resulted in the 
successful recruitment and retention of staff in those 
occupations. If this retention request of 10% for all eligible 
employees and recruitment/relocation request of 25% is approved, 
it may deter current employees from leaving MDC Brooklyn and MCC 
New York and may assist with attracting other employees to these 
facilities. 
REQUEST APPROVED:

Hi 
Ijust received a copy of MCC New York's UST NOV issued 07-15-2019. Attached. 
I also spoke with 
He's working to address the NOV. 
enrolled to obtain Class A & B UST Operator status 
within the next two weeks. Once he's been designated as the Class A & B Operator he should be able to assume the role of a 
Class C Operator as well. He's checking with the NY Department of Environmental Conservation to make sure. As a back up 
plan, 
(Facilities Manager, Brooklyn) and 
(General Foreman, Brooklyn) are Class A & B Operators and 
may be able to temporarily fill that role for MCC New York. 
Please place this NOV in procedure 009 and use the EMS to document the institution's corrective actions. Don't forget to 
establish a "flow" by holding an EMS Committee Meeting to create UST Class AM & C Operators objectives and targets (003) 
and a detailed Environmental Management Plan a, 
to address training (004), documentation, reporting and record-
keeping (005, 006..). You may need to work with 
to draft a new Operational Control (007) to ensure continued 
compliance in the future (002, 008, 010, 011). 
Please keep me informed of developments. I'll continue to follow up. 
Let me know you need anything.

Here is the game plan: 
The Corn Tech's are currently un-boxing the new hardware and getting the equipment in the new racks. Need power and 
network drops and IP Addresses to the new racks. Need to make sure the existing coax jumpers from the old recorders 
will reach the new racks for cutover between old equipment and new. 
Jeff McKenzie from SigNet will be on site Monday. He will be sending NCIC forms. 
The old system will run continuing to record the existing remaining channels until the new system is ready for cutover. 
First priority is to restore recording to all channels. Redundancy/PTZ control etc. will be converted once recording is 
restored. 
The existing analog matrix switch will remain for PTZ control and PLC camera call up. 
I will provide an update once we are on-site and assess current site conditions.

RE: Duty Officer Report (July 2, 2019 to July 9, 2019) 
TO:

OPERATIONS: 
Sanitation throughout the institution was good. The common 
areas in the housing units were sanitary and sally ports had 
garbage bins that were over filled with food and debris. The 
stairways do need some attention. During this tour, daily 
inmate counts were conducted and were completed with no 
concerns. Food Service menus were in compliance with the 
National Menu and there were no complaints regarding the meals 
during my tour. Visiting operations were examined. The 
institutional entry processing of visitors was conducted and 
visitors were processed with no concerns. Daily tours of the 
institution were made without incident and staff members were 
observed to be following security procedures throughout the 
institution. 
2. 
PROGRAMS & ACTIVITIES: 
Normal education and recreation programs were conducted 
during the tour. Jumah Services on Friday, July 5, 2019;

On Saturday August 10, 2019 I was informed that there was no recording of the closed circuit 
cameras (CCTV) from recorder 2 (Nice). I had Electronic Technician 
see 
about getting the recorder operational again by replacing the two (2) hard drivers and start the 
rebuilding process. Mr. 
called Signet Technologies to make sure what he was doing was 
correct and not going to make the problem worse. As the process of the rebuilding of the records 
the FBI came to the institution to retrieve all video needed. They took all eighteen (18) hard 
drives, two bad ones that were being replaced and the sixteen (16) that were in the RAID. While 
this was happening I made phone calls to Steve Smith from Signet Technologies to see about 
getting a technician from Signet to come to the institution to get the new CCTV equipment up 
and recording. On Sunday August 11, 2019 Steve Smith called me back and informed me that a 
technician will be on site Monday afternoon, Mr. Smith informed me to get Mr. 
to get all 
the new equipment on the racks and ready for when Jeff McKenzie arrives. On Monday August 
12, 2019 Jeff McKenzie from Signet arrived and started to look at the existing and new 
equipment with Mr. 
. While they were looking the FBI came back and had question on 
how the system worked and information about the old equipment. Mr. McKenzie assisted with 
them on how to download what they were asking for. Since it was taking so long to download 
the Agents left and would return the next day to pick up what was downloaded. 
On Tuesday August 13, 2019 I had a teleconference with Signet Technli•eve 
Smith, Jeff 
McKenzie, Northeast Regional Staff 
MCC staff 
and myself to 
figure the best and fastest way to get the recording of cameras at the institution. During the 
conversation of what took place we found out that when the FBI took the sixteen (16) hard drives 
out of the RAID without it finishing the rebuild it might have corrupted any data on the drives. 
Signet also told us that they would be able to get us recording of the operational cameras by 
August 14, 2019.

Here in Victorville FCI 1 we have had Nice since 2006 and it has been amazing. We got an update in 2014 and it has 
been a really solid system. In 2017 they replaced a Viconet system at the FCI 2 that was in really bad shape. Since their 
upgrade they have been really happy. I did not have any of these problems you guys are experiencing now. I'm 
guessing it has to do with the Windows upgrade. Once these issues are ironed out Fm sure you guys will love your new 
Nice system like we do here in Victorville. It has been the best Camera system I have ever worked with. Just give it a 
chance!

Looking for some help or advice from anyone using NICEVision. I just tried logging into Administrator to unlock an 
account and I get a pop up that states "Database Error." I click "ok," and it closes the application. I'm getting the error 
on the AMS as well as a BOPNet computer that is running the NICEVision software. I reached out to Justin Houston but 
he is out of the office and I haven't heard back from anyone at the tech support number he left. If anyone has any ideas 
or has experienced this error, I'd appreciate any advice or guidance to fix it.

Thank you fellows. It just took a little push to get the right message out there. Not patronizing, just playing Devil's 
advocate. Just knew somebody would be a little more articulate explaining where the BOP is going with this. We personally 
like our NICE system, since 2006, and understand the reason behind Fitara. It just takes a while and patience for people to 
accept change. It happened with us.

8/12/2019 1:02 PM > » 
OH YEAH. Sorry couldn't resist. Always been a big fan of Mr. Kool Aid. 
I do like the idea of a national supported system that would standardize the FBOP. It only makes sense. We have Motorola, 
Medtel and CEIA as universally recognized systems. I think most would agree those three were good choices and we would 
probably all fight tooth and nail to keep them. I can't say that I'm a fan boy of putting our systems on BOPNet. Everyone 
being on a different system has been the comm tech's best defense against absorption by IPPA and keeping local authority 
over IP assignments and network infrastructure. 
I don't think hiring a contractor to provide third party multi-manufacture support was ever a good idea. Avigilon was 
purchased by Motorola a while back. They have a good camera selection with a Windows based recording system just 
like all major CCTV VMS manufactures these days. The problem with standardizing is if the selected system isn't what you 
cut your teeth on you probably won't like it. Great thing about Avigilon right now is few to none of us have it or have even 
seen it so everyone would get a new system and be on the same learning curve. 
If Motorola offered a direct customer support contract to the FBOP for Avigilon on a nation wide bases it would be a good 
contender for standardization in my book. Also any other system manufacture with direct national support and separate 
network infrastructure would get my vote also. Every system I've seen was plagued by the same problem and that's a 
windows OS so what does it really matter?

Just to add a different point of view on this. There are currently 2 systems approved for BOP use (more specifically for new 
purchasing). NICE and Avigilon. We got a lot of Avigilon products FITARA approved and added to the approved hardware 
list a few months ago. 
As I see it, the main issue is the contract with SIGNET. We have a BOP-wide maintenance contract with them for our 
DVR/NVR systems. Currently, that contract is set up for NICE, Pelco and Vicon. With only 1 manufacturer on both the 
approved hardware list and maintenance contract, we're in a bit of a pickle. I do not know when the contract is up for 
renewal. I can see Avigilon being added to the contract, and Pelco and Vicon remaining with only legacy support. 
On one hand, it seems the BOP is trying to relatively standardize camera systems nationwide. Along with radios and 
telephones, cameras are probably the most used system we have that has actual user interface; specifically for transferring 
staff. Having the same system across the board will benefit a lot of people. Also, having a standardized system also helps 
with staff assist visits. A tech from Yazoo would know how to work on a system in Marianna. Another consideration is the 
BOP Command Center and Backup Command Center are both NICE-centric platforms from what I understand. 
On the other hand, yes, someone in Central Office seems to have gotten the agency to jump head first in to the SIGNET/NICE 
pool. The main reason that I can think of as to why is the migration to IPv6. NICE was one of the first. Vicon and Pelco were 
way behind. I am not saying any of this to bolster NICE. I have my reasons for pushing to get Avigilon approved as I feel it is 
a far superior system. But, with seemingly 75-80% or more of the BOP already on NICE, it does make sense to go ahead and 
standardize across the board if possible. 
Personally, I would love to roll out a bunch of Avigilon systems. Like all of you, I have my personal takes on the equipment 
that I like to work on. I would love to standardize all of the systems we have from coast to coast. That would cut down on 
training expenses, spare parts packages, improve responses to emergencies and staff assist visits, etc. Unfortunately, there is 
too much bureaucracy with our purchasing guidelines and required approvals for purchases such as these. 
I have probably heard as many positive reviews as negative reviews from BOP techs regarding NICE. Personally I went to 
NICE training a few years ago to check it out and was entirely unimpressed. I am sure that there have been changes to the 
system since then that would alleviate many of my negative thoughts on the system. 
I'm certainly not championing or trashing NICE. I just wanted to lay out some other trains of thought as to why things might 
be going the way they are right now. There are many camera systems out there so very out of date that they are practically 
useless. It would seem money is finally being made available to rectify that situation. 
This was just my $.02. I'm not trying to get anyone to drink the Kool Aid. Take it for what it's worth.

One other thing that happened after the new version was installed. The colors on the AMS and 1 workstation (the Captains) 
are way off. Yellow comes in as Light Blue and Red comes in as Purple. I've tried all the settings on the AMS and the

Yep. Same exact issue here in Houston. It happened after we loaded the latest update. Might be a pain, but if you still 
have a copy of the old AppSuite you could load it just long enough to unlock the work station and then go back to the

you inserted it.

additional overhead. The end result is system designed according to specifications and within

We are currently extremely understaffed in our psychology department and are therefore covering both clinical and

of 
STANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION 
As part of your supervised release, you must comply with the following standard conditions of supervision. These conditions arc imposed 
because they establish the basic expectations for your behavior while on supervision and identify the minimum tools needed by probation 
officers to keep informed, report to the court about, and bring about improvements in your conduct and condition. 
I. 
You must report to the probation office in the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside within 72 hours of your 
release from imprisonment, unless the probation officer instructs you to report to a different probation office or within a different time 
frame. 
2. 
After initially reporting to the probation office, you will receive instructions from the court or the probation officer about how and 
when you must report to the probation officer, and you must report to the probation officer as instructed. 
3. 
You must not knowingly leave the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside without first getting permission from the 
court or the probation officer. 
4. 
You must answer truthfully the questions asked by your probation officer. 
5. 
You must live at a place approved by the probation officer. If you plan to change where you live or anything about your living 
arrangements (such as the people you live with), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying 
the probation officer in advance is not possible due to unanticipated circumstances, you must notify the probation officer within 72 
hours of becoming aware of a change or expected change. 
6. 
You must allow the probation officer to visit you at any time at your home or elsewhere, and you must permit the probation officer to 
take any items prohibited by the conditions of your supervision that he or she observes in plain view. 
7. 
You must work full time (at least 30 hours per week) at a lawful type of employment, unless the probation officer excuses you from 
doing so. If you do not have full-time employment you must try to find MI-time employment, unless the probation officer excuses 
you from doing so. If you plan to change where you work or anything about your work (such as your position or your job 
responsibilities), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying the probation officer at least 10 
days in advance is not possible due to unanticipated circumstances, you must notify the probation officer within 72 hours of 
becoming aware of a change or expected change. 
8. 
You must not communicate or interact with someone you know is engaged in criminal activity. If you know someone has been 
convicted of a felony, you must not knowingly communicate or interact with that person without first getting the permission of the 
probation officer. 
9. If you are arrested or questioned by a law enforcement officer, you must notify the probation officer within 72 hours. 
10. You must not own, possess, or have access to a firearm, ammunition, destructive device, or dangerous weapon (i.e., anything that was 
designed, or was modified for, the specific purpose of causing bodily injury or death to another person such as nunchakus or tasers). 
I I. You must not act or make any agreement with a law enforcement agency to act as a confidential human source or informant without 
first getting the permission of the court. 
12. You must follow the instructions of the probation officer related to the conditions of supervision.

In your email, you state, "I am reminding you." I haven't spoken to you or anyone else regarding the incident involving 
inmate Epstein or anything else pertaining to August 10, 2019, so how is it possible for you to be reminding me? Second, I'd 
been properly relieved prior to the incident involving inmate Epstein. 
> » 
8/12/2019 10:10 AM > » 
Lt. 
I am reminding you to submit your supervisor memorandum for the inmate Epstein incident that occurred on 8/10/19. 
Please have complete and ready for submission on 8/13/19. 
Thank you

Please be reminded that per policy and the T&A Handbook any employee hired for overtime prior to the administrative 
workweek, is entitled to any applicable night differential in addition to the overtime pay. This results in a notable increase in 
overtime costs. Therefor, unless otherwise unavoidable, the practice of hiring overtime prior to the administrative work week 
should be avoided. Specifically, the administrative work week begins at 12:01 am Sunday, so if you hire overtime on 
Saturday for the following Sunday or beyond, it is scheduled prior to the administrative workweek. The verbiage below is cut 
and paste from the T&A Handbook, if you have further questions please contact me. 
Regularly Scheduled Overtime. Overtime (over 8 in a day, over 40 in a week, or 
over 80 in a pay period), which has been scheduled, both day(s) and hours, 
prior to the administrative workweek for a specific employee. This overtime 
must be scheduled before the Sunday of the week in which it was worked to be 
considered "regularly scheduled." This is the only type of overtime that may 
be subject to GS night differential, 
if worked between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M. It 
is 
the only type of overtime (besides INS 1931 Act Overtime) that may be paid 
to recipients of annual premium pay.

Capt, please ensure the Lts are aware they should immediately discontinue the practice of placing inmates in observation 
that are not on official Psych Ops or Suicide Watch status. Per the below guidance, inmates will not be placed in the suicide 
area unless authorized by Psych staff. If an inmate arrives after hours and has to be screened, the inmate should be placed in 
SHU until UT and medical staff arrive in the am and conduct the social and medical screening process. Please have a verbal 
discussion and send out guidance.

This morning the new Warden addressed new procedures: 
1. The new Warden indicated he is very hands on and wants to know everything going on. He indicated every time 
someone goes on or off suicide watch and psychology observation he wants to be informed by phone (in addition to the 
emails we send out) You can call the office or his cell, 
. He wants to be called no matter what day or time it is. 
2. The Warden indicated he would like to be the one making the decisions regarding the use of inmate companions. So 
please make sure when someone is placed on suicide watch or psychology, a conversation is had with him regarding if it 
should be a staff watch or inmate companion watch. 
3. As it was brought up we are not always informed of inmates being placed on watch/observation, when they go on 
overnight, he related, there would now be biweekly department head meetings and Dr. 
should bring this up at the 
meeting so he can address this. She should also bring up we are not always getting PSIQs. 
Thank you.

Dear, Warden welcome on board M.C.C. New YORK, we spoke the other day on 10South High security unit. I just wanted to 
run this by you, the bunk beds in the S.H.U. unit are not centered in the middle of the cell. Making it very difficult in seeing 
the inmate in the cell, especially at night If it could be done to weld the bunk in the center of the cell, it would make the 
inmate more visible and better seen during counts and rounds.

When management is aware that OIG, FBI or the US Attorneys Office will arrive to start interviews; please 
inform the local. That is not investigation sensitive information but it allows us to effectuate the availability of 
representatives in the event employees request one, in accordance with their Weingarten Rights. 
Thank You,

Once the employee invokes their Weingarten rights, questioning is to stop and the employee seeks their 
representative. The Local President determines the representative for the employee, not the agency or its 
representative.

What do you mean I don't have the authority to remove myself from the roster? I informed you weeks ago about this surgery 
that I'm having on Monday and Fm not coming in on Monday so this isn't news and you didn't request documentation about 
my surgery. I really don't have to provide specific information about my surgery that's why there's HIPPA laws and time for 
recovery varies from individual to individual everyone is different. You were informed about this surgery 
so I 
don't know why there is an issue and you are requesting documentation last minute all of a sudden this should of been 
requested weeks ago.

possibly had contraband on her to ass to the inmate. When I arrived in the lob", 
of the institution I asked 
the visitor who was identified as 
if she had any intentions on giving inmate 
anything prohibited she 
stated " Yes it's wrap up, I don't know what it is but I can take it out ". I then ask for female staff to take her in a private 
area so she could forfeit the items. 3 bundles wrapped in electric tape containing a cellphone, tobacco, pills, marijuana, 
rolling papers and other contraband was recovered.

Hi guys, 
Today I was Acting Captain and it was bought to the Operation's Lieutenant's attention as well as management that the 
current overtime procedures are not being implemented. Please get back to the current hiring procedures that were put into 
place back in May and fill as much of the overtime as possible. Hopefully this will eliminate us having so many vacancies on 
the roster although we know there are no guarantees. Additionally, D/W Ops. (Sunday) and E/W Ops. (Wednesday) please 
1/4/2019 10:08 AM > » 
EFTA00036411
--- PAGE 2 ---
annotate in your daily lieutenant's log that the overtime hiring procedures were completed. Thank you as always for a job 
well done! 
> > 
5/25/2018 9:09 AM >>> 
Reminder of procedures in place. 
1) Each Wednesday, the D/W Operations Lieutenant will fill overtime for the following Sunday utilizing the overtime sign up 
list. Once the overtime sign up list has been exhausted any remaining vacancies can be filled with anyone that volunteers. If 
the D/W Lieutenant is not able to complete filling Sunday's overtime vacancies, during their shift on Wednesday, the E/W 
Operations Lieutenant will finish whatever is remaining. 
2) Each Sunday, the D/W Operations Lieutenant will fill all overtime vacancies for the week (Monday thru Saturday) utilizing 
the overtime sign up list. Once the overtime sign up list has been exhausted any remaining vacancies can be filled with 
anyone that volunteers. If the D/W Lieutenant is not able to complete filling overtime vacancies for the week, on Sunday, the 
E/W Operations Lieutenant will finish whatever is remaining. 
3) On Saturday and Sunday, PRIOR TO MANDATING STAFF, the Operations Lieutenant on each shift will have the Control 
Center send a message via the Ops Planner to all staff announcing there is overtime available. The announcement will only 
be done once, per shift, and if there are no volunteers after the announcement is made you will begin mandating staff.

Congratulations to the August 9, 2019, graduating ERT T4T class and welcome to the group. They had a few people (9) 
cancel out of their class but we were able to make some last minute phone calls and get some people to step up and make

some last minute plans (THANK YOU VERY MUCH). Graduates welcome to the ERT T4T group. Please remember do not 
give away to future T4T's our Thursday surprise. Next class is January and it will start our FY20 classes. I have sent out to a 
first round of T4T's to schedule them for the FY20 classes to come out to MSTC and get them re-certified. I am not getting a 
lot of responses so I will be moving on to the next names shortly to request you to come out and re-certify. I want to get 
started on the classes as soon as possible. IF you get to go to a CMT as a ERT T4T to re-certify PLEASE let me know so I can 
update the master list. 
Please also let me know if you transfer to another institution so I can keep the Master list up to date. 
Their has been a lot of questions about the CD burner lately and which one is authorized to get. As long as you are NOT 
going to be connecting it to the BOP Network or any BOP Computer, your facility/IT can approve it without going through 
Central Office. We are only making a recommendation and NOT ordering or mandating that you get them. It will however 
make it easier for you when you need to make copies of the photos that you took during the Crime Scene. IF you get the 
single CD burner you will have different times on the Chain of Custody for when the CD was created (found). IF you are able 
to find the multi CD Burner and the CD's all come out at the same time then you would have the same times on the Chain of 
Custody. 
Info is coming in that the CD Burner that we recommended is no longer available and is outdated.

ADDRESS: 150 PARK ROW New York 
NEW YORK NY 10007 RE: Obligation to Preserve Records and Electronically Stored 
Information in INMATE DEATH, LHN-CIV-2019-00204 
The BOP and its employees are required to preserve any potentially relevant 
information pertaining to 
EFTA00036429
--- PAGE 2 ---
On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 6:30 am, EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, reg. no. 76318-
054, was found unresponsive in his cell in conjunction with an apparent suicide, 
and, subsequently, pronounced dead at the local hospital. No lawsuit has been filed 
yet, but one is anticipated. 
In this case, relevant information includes, but is not limited to: 
Please preserve all electronic files (e.g. emails, Word documents, TRUSCOPE 
entries, videos, BEMR records) and all handwritten or other physical documents 
pertaining to inmate Epstein. 
You have been identified as an individual likely to have information relevant to 
this matter. Therefore, you must take appropriate steps to preserve any such 
information in your possession, custody, or control even if it otherwise would be 
destroyed, deleted or overwritten, in the normal course of Agency operations. 
Knowingly altering, editing, or deleting potentially relevant information could 
result in court-ordered sanctions against the BOP and/or employment action 
against staff. 
Electronically stored information (ESI) includes all information stored in any 
digital medium, including the BOPA's computer network, any PCs, laptop computers, 
all back-up media, email, calendars, word processing documents, scanned documents, 
spreadsheets, photos and drafts. 
DO NOT DISCARD OR DESTROY ANY RECORDS (ELECTRONICALLY STORED OR OTHERWISE) 
RELATING TO THIS MATTER. 
Action Required: 
1. Complete the attached Custodian Document Search Checklist and return to 
by 08/21/2019. 
2. Preserve Relevant Information 
a. Do not alter, edit, delete, or otherwise destroy potentially relevant 
information in either paper or digital documents. All auto-deletion 
functions should be turned off and any retention policy should be 
suspended if execution would cause the loss of potentially relevant 
information. Do not move or alter electronic documents as this will 
modify the metadata. Should you need to work on a relevant document, 
please save it as a new version and edit the new version. 
b. Do not transfer any potentially relevant information to a 
Federal Records Center (FRC) or any other location. 
c. Notify me of any potentially relevant information that is in the 
process of being or has been sent to an offsite storage facility 
(FRC or any other offsite facility). 
3. Contact me if there are any staffing changes in your office that affect 
this matter (e.g., retirement, transfer, etc.). 
4. If you are aware of the loss of any potentially relevant ESI, notify me 
immediately. 
5. This document is privileged and confidential. 
DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE THIS NOTICE WITH ANYONE.

Suicide Prevention for Inmates 
"If you are going to tolerate a few deaths in your 
correctional system, then you've already lost the 
battle." - Commander, Orange County Jail 
MCC New York 
Special Housing Unit 
EFTA00036447
--- PAGE 2 ---
Why Should I Care? 
Isn't this _ 
a Psychology Program'? 
• An inmate suicide represents major 
liability exposure of the agency and in 
some cases, staff could be held personally 
liable for the death. 
EFTA00036448
--- PAGE 3 ---
Suicide Statistics 
FY 2012 
of
• Numb• er 
 Suicides 
— 29 
• Number of Attempts — 1,304 
• Number of Suicide Watches — 2,595 
• Locations — SHU (9), GP (17), FMC (2), 
Other (1) 
Of these 29 suicides 62% had a history of 
mental illness, 31% had a history of a sex 
offense and 5% were on p• rotective custody 
status 
("I 
• 
EFTA00036449
--- PAGE 4 ---
Suicide Prevention Program 
P.S. 5324.08 
• All Staff need to read and be 
familiar with this policy. Nobody 
can say one suicide is no big deal, 
it can't be helped, but when it 
happens it puts a microscope on 
your area and the institution. 
EFTA00036450
--- PAGE 5 ---
Suicide Prevention Program 
• No such thing as a bad referral. During day 
watch refer to Psychology. Non-duty hours 
to on-call psychologist. Report any inmate 
that you feel may be suicidal or that you 
have other mental health concerns about. 
Make sure your officers are similarly 
trained to make referrals. If you refer and 
the inmate dies, that is on psychology. If 
you don't refer and the inmate dies, that is 
on correctional services. 
EFTA00036451
--- PAGE 6 ---
Suicide Prevention Program 
• All staff are required to attend annual 
refresher training on suicide prevention 
during ART. SHU officers are required to 
have suicide prevention training in SHU 
quarterly. This is ordinarily done by psych 
services adding the information to the SHU 
post orders. The officers meet this policy 
requirement when they read and sign the 
post orders. 
EFTA00036452
--- PAGE 7 ---
Suicide Prevention Program 
Watches — Call the Operations Lieutenant 
immediately and notify Psychology staff if 
concerns are present. Any Shift Lieutenant 
can put on a watch during emergency or non-
duty hours. While policy allows any staff to 
place an inmate on watch, the intent is that 
this call will generally be reserved for shift 
LT. Some institutions preference is to sit the 
inmate down where shift LT can observe until 
on call psych shows up. Only Psychology can 
terminate the watch. 
EFTA00036453
--- PAGE 8 ---
Suicide Prevention Program 
• If inmate companions are used, staff should 
provide two checks during an 8 hour shift. 
Initial log (critical for liability). 
• Maintain the integrity of the watch. Strip 
search the inmate going in and out of watch. 
Search the cell before the inmate is placed 
in the suicide watch cell. Only those things 
authorized by Psychology are allowed in the 
cell — everything else out. 
EFTA00036454
--- PAGE 9 ---
Suicide Prevention Program 
What's New? 
• Psychology will provide SHU (copy to 
Correctional Services, Health Services, and 
Unit Team) a list of inmates (Hot List) with 
mental health conditions who may become 
dangerous, self-destructive, or suicidal 
when placed in SHU. The list will be 
updated as needed. 
• When a `hot list' inmate is placed in SHU, 
Correctional Services supervisor shall 
notify Psychology immediately. 
EFTA00036455
--- PAGE 10 ---
Historically High Risk Groups 
• Pre-Trial Prisoners 
• Mentally Ill 
• Inmates Who Voluntarily PC 
• Low Security Inmates — Poor 
Adjustment with Sudden Loss of 
Relationship 
EFTA00036456
--- PAGE 11 ---
Suicide Watch 
• The Warden decides if the watch will be conducted using inmate 
observers or staff. It is based upon a recommendation by psych and 
depends on the level of acting out expected by the inmate. 
• Why constant visual supervision? We use constant observation to 
prevent an inmate from killing themselves. An inmate committed 
suicide while on watch at MDC Los Angeles. He drowned himself in 
his toilet while the inmate observer when back to his cell to use the 
restroom (10-15 minutes). 
• Do you think that an inmate can kill themselves under constant 
observation? Inmate at Seagoville cut a hole in his mattress cover and 
cut his wrist. He slid his arm inside the cover so the observer could 
not see the blood. One drop of blood dripped through on to floor, the 
observer saw it and summoned help. 
• Why 15 minute log entries? So psych can monitor inmate behavior, 
sleeping, eating taking meds, etc. 
EFTA00036457
--- PAGE 12 ---
Challenging Inmates... 
Tough for Everyone! 
• Psychology realizes that inmates who try to manipulate the 
system are really problematic for Correctional Services. 
• No matter how many times you have reported it in the 
past... If an inmate makes a statement about suicide, or 
makes gestures that indicate they are trying to make you 
think they will commit suicide, go ahead and report it. 
• The danger with them is that they can unintentionally kill 
themselves if the officer doesn't walk by or make that 
round at the expected time. 
EFTA00036458
--- PAGE 13 ---
What is Your Role? 
Your Example is critical! 
• Communicate and work closely 
with psychology 
• You set the example — if all staff 
think suicide prevention is 
important and they emphasize it 
with others then all staff will 
respond

Special Housing Unit 
Remember taking short cuts while 
working in SHU will get you or your 
fellow staff injured or killed 
EFTA00036461
--- PAGE 2 ---
Introduction 
The Special Housing Unit is not the same as if 
you were working in a normal housing unit. Thus 
the name `Special Housing Unit.' 
The Special Housing Unit is designed to house 
inmates: 
Who have committed violations of the rules and 
regulations 
Disruptive inmates 
Pending a SIS investigation 
Hold-overs 
Psych concerns 
Pending transfer and classification 
EFTA00036462
--- PAGE 3 ---
Special Housing Staff must have a strong 
knowledge of Policy and Procedures to 
succeed. 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons has made a 
basic commitment to the development of a 
comprehensive philosophy which places equal 
emphasis on custody, care and correction of 
the criminal offender. 
This objective can only be accomplished to all 
aspects of inmate management and treatment 
if we take responsibility of meeting this 
challenge.

The sanitation of SHU is a direct reflection upon 
the staff assigned. 
Additionally, it's a reflection of all staff who conduct 
rounds ( Non Custody staff). 
We have a responsibility to ensure all areas of the 
institution maintain a high level of sanitation. 
A bigger ownership concerning SHU operations is 
a custodial one.

Security 
Security is everyone's responsibility and must not be taken 
lightly. 
Security starts with staff reading and being familiar with post 
orders, program statements, institutional supplements, 
memorandums, etc. 
Are inmates correctly placed in restraints? 
, Complacency will get you hurt. 
r-Security is NEVER convenient. 
:Don't assume anything. 
EFTA00036474
--- PAGE 15 ---
Security 
■ Do you carry all the appropriate equipment? 
■ Do you utilize good communication skills? 
■ Professional bearing is critical. 
➢How we present ourselves (as a Soft target/ 
Hard target) 
Counts must be conducted in accordance with 
policy, not negotiated at any time. 
The 4:00pm, 10:00pm, and 10:00am (weekends 
and holidays) are stand up counts period. 
Immediate corrective action if needed. 
EFTA00036475

Security 
You are empowered to assume responsibility 
within the limits of your job. 
If you can resolve a situation at your level, do it.

Communication 
If you lack the ability to communicate, you can't do your job 
effectively. 
You have to communicate 24/7 
If you can't say NO perhaps the Special Housing Unit is not 
for you. 
Your job is communication with the inmates and staff. 
Be assertive.

Keys to Understanding Inmate 
Body Movement 
Observe the inmate's head position 
If the head is down while you are talking, this usually indicates a 
negative attitude. 
■ Observe the inmate's eyes 
Eyes can be very deceptive 
>If an inmate is lying to you, he will fail to maintain eye contact. 
Closing of the eyes or placing the hand over the face is a 
good indicator of deception 
Some deceptive inmates may actually turn their head to 
avoid eye contact. 
EFTA00036482
--- PAGE 23 ---
Keys to Understanding Inmate 
Body Movement 
An inmate may attempt phony smiles or smirks to show 
sincerity. 
The inmate may even chew his finger nails 
➢The inmate may appear to have a dry mouth 
➢The inmate may lick his lips continually 
The hand to nose gesture is often used to screen eyes and 
face during the course of a lie. 
Deceitful inmates are vague and stammering in their 
responses. 
EFTA00036483

Sanitation 
Sanitation is a direct reflection of all staff assigned to the 
Special Housing Unit. 
Staff who conduct daily rounds 
First impressions are critical. If you walk into a Special 
Housing Unit and the first things you see are trash on the 
floor, marks and writing on the walls, food trays laying about, 
it signifies staff just don't care. If this is happening, there is 
more behind the scenes occurring. This leads to assaults on 
staff, assaults on inmates, and inmates refusing to comply 
with orders. Basically, a unit where inmates are in charge. 
EFTA00036485
--- PAGE 26 ---
Sanitation 
■ How do you achieve high levels of sanitation? 
➢Inmate received rules and regulations 
➢Staff trained 
➢No compromises 
➢Orderlies 
➢Supplies 
➢Communication 
➢Hold the inmates accountable 
➢Strategies to combat disruptive inmates 
Support staff in the performance of their duties.

EFTA00036487
--- PAGE 28 ---
Feeding 
Trays have been fashioned into all types of weapons. 
Be accountable for what goes into and what comes out of an 
inmates cell. 
Your safety and the safety of your fellow staff depend on your 
ability to maintain security concerning weapons grade 
material 
Slow down, again, No short-cuts.

Co, thanks for this. One question on the attached MCC sign up sheet for OT. Are the names on the shee 
t 
final list of people who asked for a shift and received it? Or is this everyone who asked, and some got the s 
hilts and some did not? Just want to know what I'm looking at. Thlc

nfo for questions 8-10: 
After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-
10, 2019, the numbers are as follows: 
8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated) 
8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated) 
8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated) 
8/7 (27 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 27, 2 were mandated) 
8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated) 
8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated) 
8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated) 
Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-
custody staff. Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to 
all staff and an all-
call via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening 
and morning shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized. 
Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7114/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

Boss, 
Just curious....why did "they ask Grand Prairie for this information? (see attached email) I will supply to them, but a little 
confused because GP has nothing to do with position management.

Info for questions 8-10: 
After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-10, 2019, 
the numbers are as follows: 
8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated) 
EFTA00036559
--- PAGE 2 ---
8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated) 
8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated) 
8/7 (27 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 27, 2 were mandated) 
8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated) 
8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated) 
8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated) 
Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-custody staff. 
Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to all staff and an all-call 
via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening and morning 
shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized. 
Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7/14/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

Boss, 
I think we have a viable plan. I know that you are extremely busy, so If you can let me know when is a good time to talk. 
Below you will find a brief synopsis. 
• It is looking like MCC will have some recording by the end of the day today and the rest by the end of day tomorrow. 
• The new recording system will not be on the BOPNET but will have local recording/viewing capabilities. 
• In order to get the system on the BOPNET and get the additional digital cameras installed, I am recommending that 
we bring 6 electricians to finish running conduit and 2 Comm techs TDY to run the fiber. This would be their only 
mission. I am estimating that if this happens they will work 12 hour days and it should take 4-6 weeks once work 
begins. 
So when you have time please let me know and ill give you a call and explain everything that needs to be accomplished. 
I told the Facility Manager to get with the-and 
let him know what is going on and maybe you can all talk 
together also as an option.

The FBI is going to be retrieving the previous recordings from or camera system at MCC, but because we 
aving dificulty retrieving the recordings, they have told us the recording capabilities will be off line for up to 8-10 days 
while they retrieve this data. We will still have live viewing/monitoring. My question: are there options for remote recording 
from another location, or do we possess other equipment that can be connected to the system while the current recording 
capabilities are off line?

following up on the below info, a lot of media are speculating that he should not have been removed from SW. While 
of course the length of time someone is there is not a determining factor, and the information below explains what SW is like 
and why it is generally used for just short periods, I pulled some info on the average time inmates are on SW. This info 
covers the past year: 
3,893 Suicide Watches were conducted (for 2,175 unique inmates) 
11,267 Total Days of Suicide Watch 
Average Length of Suicide Watch: 2.89 Days/Watch (which includes a number of longer watches where inmates were waiting 
for a hospital bed) 
Median Length: 1.5 Days 
I think this provides a more complete picture on how SW is used and why it is not usually used for long periods.

- Below is the explanation as provided by our Psychology Services Administrator. They will be providing the 
research behind this tomorrow, but wanted to get this information to you tonight. Let me know if you have any 
questions regarding this information. 
Suicide watch is widely regarded as a short-term crisis intervention. As practiced in the BOP, it is a highly 
restrictive intervention that focuses on preserving the life of an individual in crisis. Typical conditions of a suicide 
watch include containment in an identified suicide watch cell absent tie-off points and sharp objects, placement in 
a suicide watch smock that is resistant to use as a ligature, constant observation by another individual, lights on 24 
hours per day to ensure effective observation, extreme limits on personal property for safety, and at least daily 
contact with a BOP psychologist. While these restrictive conditions are extremely effective in the short-term 
prevention of suicide, they are inconsistent with a quality of life that supports future oriented goals and the 
achievement of those goals. For this reason, suicide watch is used to prevent a suicidal crisis, but is ended when 
an individual is no longer assessed to be an immediate threat to himself and is able to resume goal directed 
behaviors that support a quality of life, such as interactions with peers, visits with family or 
attorneys, work, etc. The assessment used to determine that suicide watch is no longer warranted is conducted by 
a doctoral level psychologist. Following the conclusion of a suicide watch, psychologists follow up with ongoing 
assessment and interventions such as additional suicide risk assessments, counseling sessions, and/or supportive 
visits.

I attached Epstein 292 forms from 7/7-2019 to 8/10/2019. During this periods, Epstein was moved in and out from SHU 3 
times. 
I looked into his SHU history records and filled SHU administration data into 292 history reports.

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to 
reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through 
Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and e-mail me the results when you are done. This is a 
time critical task. 
Thanks.

(OAG) 
- Below is the explanation as provided by our Psychology Services Administrator. They will be providing 
the research behind this tomorrow, but wanted to get this information to you tonight. Let me know if you have 
any questions regarding this information. 
Suicide watch is widely regarded as a short-term crisis intervention. As practiced in the BOP, it is a highly 
restrictive intervention that focuses on preserving the life of an individual in crisis. Typical conditions of a 
suicide watch include containment in an identified suicide watch cell absent tie-off points and sharp 
objects, placement in a suicide watch smock that is resistant to use as a ligature, constant observation by another 
individual, lights on 24 hours per day to ensure effective observation, extreme limits on personal property for 
safety, and at least daily contact with a BOP psychologist. While these restrictive conditions are extremely 
effective in the short-term prevention of suicide, they are inconsistent with a quality of life that supports future 
oriented goals and the achievement of those goals. For this reason, suicide watch is used to prevent a suicidal 
crisis, but is ended when an individual is no longer assessed to be an immediate threat to himself and is able to 
resume goal directed behaviors that support a quality of life, such as interactions with peers, visits with family or 
attorneys, work, etc. The assessment used to determine that suicide watch is no longer warranted is conducted 
by a doctoral level psychologist. Following the conclusion of a suicide watch, psychologists follow up with 
ongoing assessment and interventions such as additional suicide risk assessments, counseling sessions, and/or 
supportive visits.

probably send to all media that emailed me (over 50 emails) and then I'm

I like the concept but would remove certain portions that suggest we failed or you are responsible. While it 
appears at least 2 or 3 people failed, saying WE failed speaks to the 36K that did their jobs right. I do think we 
should get something out that reinforces our appreciation for the good work most are doing.

Below is a 
a message to staff. I debate in my mind whether to send a message or not, but I am very 
concerned for our staff, and how we are all being criticized. I also think everyone needs a reminder to not let 
their guard down and do all aspects of their jobs. Thus, I think it is important to get a message such a this out. 
Each of you either have a role in this situation, or are overseeing other institutions, and I greatly value your 
opinions. I would like each of you to review this and provide me any feedback by the end of the weekend. If we 
do post a message, I will want to do that Monday morning. Feel free to call me tomorrow if you prefer. Thank 
you.

Draft: 
As all of you have heard by now, one of our high profile inmates was found dead this weekend of an apparent 
suicide. The media and others are questioning how this could happen and some are jumping to conclusions. A 
number of investigations are being conducted to find out exactly what happened. The FBI and Inspector General 
are already onsite doing their work. We will follow up with a suicide reconstruction and after action review. 
These investigations need to be allowed to come to their own conclusions. It is premature and inappropriate to 
be placing blame or speculating as to what may have happened or why. Appropriate steps will be taken once all 
the facts have been flushed out through these investigations. We have clear policies and procedures. If the 
investigations determine they were not followed then appropriate steps will be taken. Likewise, if it is 
determined that our policies and procedures are insufficient, then we will take immediate steps to improve those 
as well. Let me be clear, it is our job to safely confine all inmates in our custody. We failed to do that job. 
Period. However, we should not be speculating as to who did or did not do something. Ultimately, I am 
responsible for what happens in our facilities, and at this point in time, no-one should be blamed for this failure 
other than me. Instead of blaming or speculating, we all need to use this event as a reminder that every aspect of 
our jobs are important. Everyone needs to be on alert all day and night when on the job. Everyone needs to 
remember that people's lives are at stake, and our actions or inactions can have dire consequences. 
The work we do is difficult on the best of days. The scrutiny we are all under right now, will only add stress and 
make our jobs more difficult. Please be sure we all watch each others backs and help everyone do their jobs, and 
most importantly, that everyone remains safe and goes home at the end of each shift. I remain in awe of the great 
work you do every day, and you have, and will always have, my support and appreciation.

Thanks. Just FYI, we do have a limited number of SAMS in other USPs. We hold them there pending their ADX hearings. 
Not all USPs, but a select few. I routinely had one at McCreary.

They do house SAM inmates there. SAM are Special Administrative Measures. 
See: 
https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-24000-requests-special-confinement-conditions 
Only the AG can put a SAM on an inmate and this results in significantly limiting an inmates communication. We have SAM 
inmates in 10 South and at the ADX (rd have to check to see if we house anywhere else, but I don't think so). There are very 
few inmates subject to SAM as this is very limiting, and generally are due to national security cases. 
Have a good day off (I hope it's a day off). We can talk at your convenience. Thx.

If they give us the date range we can make a notation of that fact. My question would be, were they there to be an addition 
to the number of available staff or did they have a special purpose? If they were basically additional officers, then the overti 
me use will show that even with additional people they keep having shortages. But it will show relief was provided by the ag 
ency to head off potential overtime fatigue by regular MCC staff. Sent from my Verizon, Samsun Galax smartphone<!--

Great report. Appreciate the help. Quick question; page 15 breaks down the OT occurrences over a period of time. During 
a 30 day portion of that time we had approximately 15 Officers from other locations TDY to MCC NYM, and much of that OT 
EFTA00036617

was provided by those staff. Would it help if we provided that information to show there were additional staff available and t 
he OT was not performed by the current Corr Svc compliment?

After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-
10, 2019, the numbers are as follows: 
8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated) 
8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated) 
8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated) 
8/7 (27 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 27, 2 were mandated) 
8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated) 
8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated) 
8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated) 
Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-
custody staff. Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to 
all staff and an all-
call via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening 
and morning shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized. 
Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7/14/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

Jo for questions 8-10: 
After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-
10, 2019, the numbers are as follows: 
8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated) 
8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated) 
8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated) 
8/7 (27 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 27, 2 were mandated) 
8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated) 
8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated) 
8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated) 
Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-
custody staff. Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to 
EFTA00036626
--- PAGE 2 ---
all staff and an all-
call via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening 
and morning shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized. 
Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7/14/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

What are the Actual Authorized and Actual Current On-
Board employee numbers for MCC New York? Also, can you provide snapshots of MCC auth vs. onboard staff 
for past three years (quarterly snapshots fine). 
2. 
What are the Actual Authorized and Actual On-
Board Correctional Officer numbers for MCC New York? Pls provide Correctional Officer count by PP last thre 
e FYs. 
3. 
What is regular entry level grade and salary (with locality) of a entry level CO at the MCC? 
4. 
Pls provide MCC Inmate count weekly for past 5 years (fiscal or calendar, your choice). Or, if weekly isn't 
convenient, whatever your standard reporting is will be OK. 3 years OK if you don't have 5 quickly. 
5. 
What was the normal staff count supposed to be for Friday 8/9 night shift and overnight shift into Saturday 
8/10? What was the actual staff count for those two shifts? 
6. 
What 3R bonuses are being offered at MCC NY? How many staff have received them the past two FYs? 
How many current staff have received 3R bonuses? 
7. 
This FY or last FY, did MCC New York request additional Correctional Officer positions or total positions f 
rom the Region and/or CO BOP, and if so, were they provided? 
8. 
Does MCC New York generally use augmentation or overtime to address staffing shortages? We assume b 
oth. Does BOP have a rough breakdown of the usual split between the two? 
9. 
Do you track mandatory vs. voluntary OT at MCC NY? If so, pls provide breakout of usage by PP this FY 
or readily available time period. (Is voluntary OT vs. mandatory OT coded differently in NFC? If so, we can ru 
n rpt here). If you need to ask the MCC for a breakout, skip this. 
10. Does MCC use the traditional BOP "bid sheet" (or whatever the BOP term is) process whereby staff can sig 
n up in advance for OT shifts? If so, do you save? Can you provide YTD data on how much requested OT has b 
een used vs. total OT? 
Pls answer what you can from Central Office, no intention of adding to work at MCC. Just let me know if you c 
an't answer something because you'd have to ask the MCC. Thks=

Boss, 
I think we have a viable plan. I know that you are extremely busy, so If you can let me know when is a good time to talk. 
Below you will find a brief synopsis. 
• It is looking like MCC will have some recording by the end of the day today and the rest by the end of day tomorrow. 
• The new recording system will not be on the BOPNET but will have local recording/viewing capabilities. 
• In order to get the system on the BOPNET and get the additional digital cameras installed, I am recommending that 
we bring 6 electricians to finish running conduit and 2 Comm techs TDY to run the fiber. This would be their only 
mission. I am estimating that if this happens they will work 12 hour days and it should take 4-6 weeks once work 
begins. 
So when you have time please let me know and ill give you a call and explain everything that needs to be accomplished. 
I told the Facility Manager to get with the-and 
let him know what is going on and maybe you can all talk 
together also as an option.

were having difficulty retrieving the recordings, they have told us the recording capabilities will be off line for up to 8-10 days

Recently, if you watch the news, you will see some things happening around our agency that does not 
highlight the great work we do each and every day. I just want to remind you that the work you do is 
important and valued by everyone. Even those who often times don't understand what that work is or 
they do NOT walk in the shoes we walk in daily. 
This message is to remind everyone of the policies and protocols we put in place in order to keep 
people safe! Example; 30 minute irregular rounds, walking and talking, detailed counts, close attention 
to detail, and being positive, responsive, and proactive while working in a correctional environment. 
Our message as an Executive Team to everyone is we "Do the Right Thing,  at the Right Time,  for the 
Right Reasons"! We ensure this by being caring human beings, charged with a very important task for 
the responsibility, safety of staff, inmates, and the community. This is an awesome challenge and each 
and every one of you should be proud and honored to take on. 
Be cognizant of the message you put out in the community as we are all representatives of this agency. 
The only person designated to speak with the media is our designated Public Information Officer. 
Thank you for what you do! At McKean

Subject: Suicide Watch 
>>> 
8/11/2019 19:38 >>> 
Hi 
Please see the following paragraph as a justification for why every individual with some level of suicide risk is n 
of maintained on long-term suicide watch: 
Suicide watch is widely regarded as a short-
EFTA00036644
--- PAGE 2 ---
term crisis intervention. As practiced in the BOP, it is a highly restrictive intervention that focuses on preserving 
the life of an individual in crisis. Typical conditions of a suicide watch include containment in an identified suici 
de watch cell absent tie-
off points and sharp objects, placement in a suicide watch smock that is resistant to use as a ligature, constant obs 
ervation by another individual, lights on 24 hours per day to ensure effective observation, extreme limits on pers 
onal property for safety, and at least daily contact with a BOP psychologist. While these restrictive conditions ar 
e extremely effective in the short-
term prevention of suicide, they are inconsistent with a quality of life that supports future oriented goals and the 
achievement of those goals. For this reason, suicide watch is used to prevent a suicidal crisis, but is ended when 
an individual is no longer assessed to be an immediate threat to himself and is able to resume goal directed behav 
iors that support a quality of life, such as interactions with peers, visits with family or attorneys, work, etc. The a

Warden, 
Per our conversation, I spoke to two of his attorneys yesterday, August 9, 2019, primarily in relation to his request for access 
to water in attorney conference. Attorney Mariel Colon, with whom I spoke in person in the late morning, had asked as an 
aside whether we would consider housing him in the Cadre. I advised we could not since he was a pretrial inmate. Later that 
day but prior to the 1:00 close-out meeting, I spoke to Attorney Michael Miller on the phone. He had asked whether we 
could house Mr. Epstein alone in SHU, to which I replied that we could not based on his prior suicide attempt/gesture. He 
acknowledged that he understood. To my recollection, neither attorney referenced consideration for suicide watch or 
psychological observation during yesterday's conversations. 
Please let me know if you need any further information. 
Thank you,

Hi Rogi 
Please see the following paragraph as a justification for why every individual with some level of suicide risk is n 
of maintained on long-term suicide watch: 
Suicide watch is widely regarded as a short-
term crisis intervention. As practiced in the BOP, it is a highly restrictive intervention that focuses on preserving 
the life of an individual in crisis. Typical conditions of a suicide watch include containment in an identified suici 
de watch cell absent tie-
off points and sharp objects, placement in a suicide watch smock that is resistant to use as a ligature, constant obs 
ervation by another individual, lights on 24 hours per day to ensure effective observation, extreme limits on pers 
onal property for safety, and at least daily contact with a BOP psychologist. While these restrictive conditions ar 
e extremely effective in the short-
term prevention of suicide, they are inconsistent with a quality of life that supports future oriented goals and the 
achievement of those goals. For this reason, suicide watch is used to prevent a suicidal crisis, but is ended when 
an individual is no longer assessed to be an immediate threat to himself and is able to resume goal directed behav 
iors that support a quality of life, such as interactions with peers, visits with family or attorneys, work, etc. The a 
ssessment used to determine that suicide watch is no longer warranted is conducted by a doctoral level psycholog 
ist. Following the conclusion of a suicide watch, psychologists follow up with ongoing assessment and intervent 
ions such as additional suicide risk assessments, counseling sessions, and/or supportive visits.

I like the concept but would remove certain portions that suggest we failed or you are responsible. While it 
appears at least 2 or 3 people failed, saying WE failed speaks to the 36K that did their jobs right. I do think we 
should get something out that reinforces our appreciation for the good work most are doing.

Below is a draft message to staff. I debate in my mind whether to send a message or not, but I am very 
concerned for our staff, and how we are all being criticized. I also think everyone needs a reminder to not let 
their guard down and do all aspects of their jobs. Thus, I think it is important to get a message such a this out. 
Each of you either have a role in this situation, or are overseeing other institutions, and I greatly value your 
opinions. I would like each of you to review this and provide me any feedback by the end of the weekend. If we 
do post a message, I will want to do that Monday morning. Feel free to call me tomorrow if you prefer. Thank 
you. 
Draft: 
As all of you have heard by now, one of our high profile inmates was found dead this weekend of an apparent 
suicide. The media and others are questioning how this could happen and some are jumping to conclusions. A 
number of investigations are being conducted to find out exactly what happened. The FBI and Inspector General 
are already onsite doing their work. We will follow up with a suicide reconstruction and after action review. 
These investigations need to be allowed to come to their own conclusions. It is premature and inappropriate to 
be placing blame or speculating as to what may have happened or why. Appropriate steps will be taken once all 
the facts have been flushed out through these investigations. We have clear policies and procedures. If the 
investigations determine they were not followed then appropriate steps will be taken. Likewise, if it is 
determined that our policies and procedures are insufficient, then we will take immediate steps to improve those 
as well. Let me be clear, it is our job to safely confine all inmates in our custody. We failed to do that job. 
Period. However, we should not be speculating as to who did or did not do something. Ultimately, I am 
responsible for what happens in our facilities, and at this point in time, no-one should be blamed for this failure 
other than me. Instead of blaming or speculating, we all need to use this event as a reminder that every aspect of 
our jobs are important. Everyone needs to be on alert all day and night when on the job. Everyone needs to 
remember that people's lives are at stake, and our actions or inactions can have dire consequences. 
EFTA00036690
--- PAGE 2 ---
The work we do is difficult on the best of days. The scrutiny we are all under right now, will only add stress and 
make our jobs more difficult. Please be sure we all watch each others backs and help everyone do their jobs, and 
most importantly, that everyone remains safe and goes home at the end of each shift. I remain in awe of the great 
work you do every day, and you have, and will always have, my support and appreciation.

See: 
https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-24000-requests-special-confinement-conditions 
Only the AG can put a SAM on an inmate and this results in significantly limiting an inmate's communication. We have SAM 
inmates in 10 South and at the ADX (I'd have to check to see if we house anywhere else, but I don't think so). There are very 
few inmates subject to SAM as this is very limiting, and generally are due to national security cases. 
Have a good day off (I hope it's a day off). We can talk at your convenience. Thx.

■info for questions 8-10: 
After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-
10, 2019, the numbers are as follows: 
8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated) 
8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated) 
8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated) 
8/7 (27 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 27, 2 were mandated) 
8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated) 
8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated) 
8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated) 
Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-
custody staff. Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to 
all staff and an all-
call via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening 
and morning shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized. 
Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7/14/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

ISSUES AND IDEAS 
Program Review Branch: 
Review Team Participation: 
Examiners continue to face difficulties staffing program review 
teams. Participation on program reviews provides valuable experience and training. 
All 
CEOs are encouraged to support their staff's involvement as participants on program review 
teams. 
Operational Review & Working Papers: 
Untimely and incomplete operational reviews remain 
an issue across all disciplines. 
The operational review is an important local evaluation process 
that enables staff to closely evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a program and take 
corrective action. 
By using this process effectively, weaknesses can be identified and 
corrected quickly through strategic planning. Action plans can be developed to ensure 
correction over time and the strengthening of the program. In addition, the operational 
review process enables program managers to establish strong internal controls to ensure 
corrective action continues to be effective. P1210.23 Management Control and Program 
Review Manual, Chapter 3, provides guidance on the operational review process. 
Sites are 
strongly encouraged to review this information to ensure policy compliance. 
Additionally, the 
Program Review Division is available to provide training in person (requester expense), or via 
VTC training for field, regional, and central office staff. 
This training outlines many segments 
of P1210.23, and outlines the review process and quality control. 
Working papers provide a systematic record of the work done by a reviewer or team. They 
contain the information and evidence necessary to support the findings and recommendations 
presented in the operational review report. 
The operational review working papers are to be placed in a file that would facilitate their use 
and prevent loss or mutilation. The department head, or administrator of the program 
reviewed, must retain the working papers for subsequent operational reviews, as well as the 
report, until the next scheduled program review has been conducted and a final report issued. 
During the next program review, the reviewers are to examine working papers from the 
operational review(s) to determine that the review was comprehensive and the adequacy of 
controls were assessed.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
AFFIRMATIVE EMPLOYMENT 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Ten Affirmative Employment Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of two superior and eight acceptable. 
Two repeat 
deficiencies and twenty deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Vacant SEPM and ROPC positions were not advertised within 30 calendar days. 
• 
Newly selected SEPMs, alternate SEPMs, and ROPCs have not met training 
requirements. 
• 
Not all AEP Meeting minutes document the review of the DVAAP, FEORP, and MD-715 
reports. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Vacant SEPM/ROPC positions are not announced within 30 days of becoming vacant. 
The 
chairperson should forward a copy of the employee's resignation memorandum/E-mail to the 
HR office in order for the collateral duty position to be advertised again. 
Collateral duty 
positions should continue to be re-advertised until they are filled. 
HR and the AEP 
chairperson should work closely together to ensure positions are advertised timely. 
Newly selected SEPMs, alternate SEPMs, and ROPCs are not meeting training requirements. 
Newly selected committee members have 6 months to complete training as outlined on the 
Affirmative Employment Sallyport page at http://sallyport.bop.gov/co/prd/aa/index.isp. 
Staff 
who have served on AEP Committees previously will be given credit for training received, as 
long as it is documented in their training record. It is recommended that AEP chairpersons 
conduct yearly AEP retreats and cover any new items during the retreat. A sign-in sheet 
should be utilized, and provided to HR to key into the employees training record. 
One of the purposes of the AEP Meeting is to review the progress being made towards the 
initiatives outlined in each of the following reports: 
FEORP, DVAAP, and MD-715, on at least a 
quarterly basis. 
The chairperson can pick one month each quarter (i.e., first month of each 
new quarter) to review the reports (review the goals, accomplishments made, and what the 
focus is for the next quarter), and ensure it is documented in the meeting minutes, as required 
by policy. It is important to refrain from cutting and pasting the same information from one 
month to another. 
EFTA00036708
--- PAGE 5 ---
When responding to the program review report, include both components (Human Resource 
Management and Affirmative Employment Program), and ensure all subsequent 
communication relative to the review is provided in one response, not separate responses. 
All correspondence regarding the program review/operational reviews needs to be sent to

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019, 3rd QUARTER 
CORRECTIONAL PROGRAMS 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Eleven Correctional Programs Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of six good, four acceptable, and one deficient. 
Five 
repeat deficiencies and seventy-four deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
RPP CMA assignments are not always accurate 
• 
State and local law enforcement officials are not always notified of inmates releasing to 
a term of supervision. 
• 
Sex offender inmates are not always notified of the requirement to register. 
• 
Required unit staff do not always work a late night. 
• 
Unit managers do not always work a weekend/holiday each month. 
• 
Unit staff do not always conduct daily SHU rounds. 
• 
Locator Center staff do not always have the proper SENTRY verb access. 
• 
Authorities holding detainers are not always notified of impending releases as required. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Management should provide additional oversight with regard to RPP CMA assignments. 
Additionally, implementation of the Release Orientation Program (ROP) should not negate the 
"RPP Part" CMA assignment, or the relevance of previously completed traditional RPP courses. 
Offenders convicted of certain sexual offenses, drug trafficking crimes, or crimes of violence 
require notification to designated law enforcement and sex offender registration officials. 
Notifications should be mailed 2 weeks prior to the inmates' release to a term of supervision to 
ensure the notifications are received at least 5 days prior to the inmates' release date. Also, 
inmates convicted of certain sexual offenses should be notified that they may be required to 
register upon release from custody. 
Documentation of compliance should be maintained in 
the inmate central file. 
Management should provide additional oversight, and monitor unit staff schedules, to ensure 
staff are working the required schedules as dictated by policy. Specifically, unit managers, 
case managers, and correctional counselors must work a late night each week. Also, unit 
managers are required to work a weekend/holiday each month. 
Out of eleven reviews 
conducted this rating period, this area was identified as a deficiency during seven reviews. 
The unit team, specifically, unit managers, case managers, and correctional counselors, are 
required to conduct daily SHU rounds, to include weekends and holidays. 
The unit team is 
considered all of the previously stated positions under the direction of one unit manager. 
For 
EFTA00036710
--- PAGE 7 ---
the purposes of program review, staff may not substitute or sign for another unit team. 
SHU rounds are not required if there are no inmates assigned to the unit housed in SHU. 
However, documentation should be maintained demonstrating this is the case. 
All staff assigned to the Control Center, on all shifts, and the Correctional Systems Department, 
should have the WITSEC SENTRY verb access when assigned to these posts. Control Center 
staff access, to this SENTRY verb, should be provided and removed based on the quarterly 
rotation. The CIM coordinator should ensure the staff access list maintained by IMS is 
consistent with the local CSM list of staff. 
Authorities holding detainers on inmates in BOP custody should be notified of the inmates' 
impending release at least 90 in advance. Detainer Action Letters sent, on possible pending 
charges/sentences for newly arriving inmates, may not be substituted for the release 
notification. 
EFTA00036711

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
CORRECTIONAL SERVICES 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Ten Correctional Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of six superior, one good, one acceptable, and two 
deficient. 
On repeat repeat deficiency, three repeat deficiencies, and thirty-two deficiencies 
were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Inmates in SHU are not observed each 30 minute period, on an irregular schedule, with 
rounds being no more than 40 minutes apart. 
• 
Special Housing Unit Record, BP-A292.052, forms are not completed to document all 
required information. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
At three institutions during this review period, inmates assigned to SHU were not being 
observed in accordance with policy. It is the responsibility of staff to conduct these rounds 
ensuring the welfare of each inmate, and to document the rounds. 
Inmates in continuous 
lockdown must be observed each 30 minute period, on an irregular schedule, and no longer 
than 40 minutes apart. It is essential that management ensures rounds are being conducted 
and documented according to policy. 
A lieutenant must visit SHU during each shift to ensure 
all procedures are followed. 
It was noted, at three institutions during this review period, that Special Housing Unit Records, 
BP-A292.052, are not properly completed to document that inmates are receiving 5 hours of 
recreation, medical visits, OIC assignments, showers, and meals. 
A lieutenant must visit SHU 
during each shift to ensure all procedures are followed. 
EFTA00036712
--- PAGE 9 ---
PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
EDUCATION/RECREATION SERVICES 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Thirteen Education Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of four superior, six good, and three acceptable. 
One 
repeat deficiency and twenty-eight deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Literacy progress assignments, and 240-hour progress reviews, are not monitored and 
documented appropriately. 
• 
Instructional staff do not spend a minimum of 50 percent of their work hours in direct 
class instruction. 
• 
Operational reviews are not conducted and documented appropriately. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
In accordance with VCCLEA/PLRA and policy requirements, all inmates enrolled in the literacy 
program must be reviewed for satisfactory progress every 240 hours of instruction, with the 
progress results documented on the PERW screen in SENTRY. 
Also, education progress 
assignments must be monitored and documented appropriately. In addition to meeting the 
element of the law, this documentation of inmate progress in literacy is also a behavioral 
management tool. Review findings this quarter showed evidence that this tool is often not 
appropriately utilized, and VCCLEA/PLRA literacy requirements are not always documented and 
followed. 
To ensure instructional systems are effective, it is imperative that instructional staff are present 
and engaged in the learning process. Staff shortages, ineffective scheduling, mismanagement 
of staff resources, and over usage of inmate tutors have been evidenced during reviews 
conducted this quarter. Managers are encouraged to reevaluate scheduling and staffing to 
ensure all staff assigned to literacy classes, to include GED, ESL, and SLN, are actively engaged in 
their respective classes. 
Operational reviews provide management with an annual opportunity to reexamine program 
areas that have been identified as crucial to program success through the management 
assessment process. 
Review findings suggest that greater emphasis is needed during 
operational reviews to ensure the accuracy of review findings, timeliness of reporting, and 
adequate modification of internal controls to prevent reoccurrence. 
EFTA00036713

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Twelve Environmental and Safety Compliance Program Reviews were 
conducted from 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of six superior, five good, and one 
acceptable. 
Four repeat deficiencies and sixteen deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Not all Institution Safety Committee requirements are being met. 
• 
CA-7 forms were not always submitted timely to the respective Office of Workers' 
Compensation District Office. 
• 
OSHA recordkeeping requirements were not always being met. 
OSHA 300 logs were 
not always accurately maintained, and did not always include all inmate recordable 
injuries. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Institution Safety Committee Meetings must be conducted quarterly. Additionally, they must 
cover all required topics and meeting minutes must be appropriately disseminated in 
accordance with policy. 
In compliance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), institutions must 
effectively manage Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP) requirements, including 
the timely submission of CA forms to the respective OWCP District Office. 
Regulations require 
the employer to complete and transmit the agency portion of the CA-7 form within 5 working 
days of agency receipt. 
OSHA 300 logs and OSHA form 301 are not always accurately maintained. 
These logs are 
important for spotting injury trends, and are often requested during OSHA compliance site 
visits. 
In addition, OSHA issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2017, and phased in over 2 
years, which revised OSHA's regulations on "Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and 
Illnesses" (29 CFR 1904). 
The rule requires employers to begin submitting injury and illness 
data to OSHA electronically, via a secure website. 
While the rule has been suspended, OSHA 
has the prerogative of implementing various rules which makes recordkeeping accuracy critical. 
Establishments, with 250 or more employees, were required to maintain information from all 
OSHA recordkeeping forms (300A, 300, and 301). 
Accurate recording and reporting of 
work-related injuries is therefore essential.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
FACILITIES MANAGEMENT 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Eleven Facilities Management Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of three superior, three good, four acceptable, and one 
deficient. 
One repeat deficiency and thirty-four deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Fire inspections are not being conducted per NFPA. 
• 
Refrigerant quantities reported in CMMS do not match what is entered in the 
technician's log. 
• 
Operational reviews were not timely or incomplete. 
REVIEWER'S COMMENTS: 
As per P4200.12, Facilities Operations Manual, fire system inspections and testing shall be 
conducted and documented in accordance with NFPA 25, NFPA 72 (latest edition), and 
applicable policies. 
As per P4200.12, Facilities Operations Manual, daily refrigerant records must be maintained, 
within a bound log book or electronic database, by the certified technician (HVAC, Garage, 
Utility Systems Repairer-Operator, etc.). 
To enable proper reporting of Ozone Depleting 
Substances (ODS) to the U.S. Department of Energy, the facility manager or designee must 
enter refrigerant records into CMMS quarterly. 
As per P1210.23, Management Control and Program Review Manual, each program at all 
organizational levels should conduct an operational review between 10-14 months from the 
week of the previous program review (including those programs receiving a deficient rating). 
An additional operational review should be conducted 22-26 months from the week of the 
previous program review for those programs that receive good or superior ratings. 
The 
review authority will direct that a follow-up be conducted to measure the effectiveness of the 
corrective action. 
The follow-up review will be conducted 120-150 calendar days after the last 
day of the operational review. It will be under the associate warden's supervision (institution 
reviews), and focus on areas of concern and deficiencies.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY2019. 3rd QUARTER 
FEMALE OFFENDERS 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Two Female Offender Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of one superior and one good. 
One deficiency was 
identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Reviews conducted this quarter showed evidence of gender-responsive program opportunities 
being provided, and programming needs being appropriately considered, in accordance with 
the institution's mission. Staff ensure appropriate documentation, designation, and 
monitoring is completed for expectant inmates. Gender specific services are provided as 
necessary to female offenders, to include commissary items, personal hygiene items, and other 
needs that are unique to the female population.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Ten Financial Management Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of eight superior and two good. Three deficiencies 
were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS:

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
FOOD SERVICE 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Eighteen Food Service Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of two superior, eight good, seven acceptable, and one 
deficient. 
Seven repeat deficiencies and sixty-seven deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Machine guarding is not always in place during operation to prevent injury to staff and 
inmates. 
• 
Potentially hazardous food is not always protected from possible overhead 
cross-contamination. 
• 
Temperature logs are not always maintained according to policy. 
• 
Potentially hazardous foods are not always maintained according to policy. 
• 
Hand washing sinks are not always utilized or maintained in accordance with policy. 
• 
Access panels, leading to energized circuits and gas components, are not always secured 
with locks or security screws to prevent unauthorized access. 
• 
Walk-in refrigerators and freezers do not have a device that allows the door to be 
opened from the inside, even if locked from the outside. 
• 
Wiping cloths are not always stored in a chemical sanitizer according to policy. 
• 
Budget projections are not always accurate, and do not include all foods needed to 
support the National Menu. 
• 
Operational reviews are not always complete and/or timely. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Inspection of equipment revealed machine guards are not always in place and/or functional on 
machinery. 
Daily monitoring of equipment is needed to ensure guards, for all machines that 
require them, are properly in place and functional prior to the use of the equipment. 
This will 
greatly reduce the possibility of injuries to staff and inmates. 
Food items stored, prepared, or served below an unsanitized area greatly increases the 
probability rate of cross-contamination. 
Food items must be protected from all possibilities of 
contamination from an overhead source. Detailed sanitation practices are imperative to assist 
in preventing the possibility of contamination. Evidence of condensation, ice, dripping water, 
food debris, dust, dirt, mildew, and chipping paint are to be reported immediately to the 
FSA/AFSA, the Facilities Department must be notified to make repairs, if necessary, and/or a 
detail cleaning performed to remove possible contaminants from all sources. 
EFTA00036718
--- PAGE 15 ---
A review of temperature logs revealed that temperatures are not always recorded and/or 
annotated according to policy. Temperature logs are often missing the required temperature 
readings, and in some cases, the logs are not present. Additionally, corrective action and/or 
justification for temperatures recorded outside the acceptable ranges are not listed on the 
temperature logs. Additional training should be provided to increase staff awareness of the 
importance of proper temperature monitoring and annotation of the temperature logs. 
Observations this quarter identified the need for closer oversight in the handling of potentially 
hazardous food items. Potentially hazardous foods (hot and cold) were found being stored, 
prepared, and served outside the acceptable temperature ranges. Additional training should 
be provided to increase staff awareness of the proper techniques of monitoring food 
temperatures to prevent the potential for food borne illness. Consistent temperature checks, 
in food storage, production, holding, and serving, will reduce the potential for problems in this 
vital function area. 
Hand washing sinks, and/or hand washing stations, were not always utilized or maintained in 
accordance with policy. Utility and food preparation sinks were observed being utilized for 
hand washing. 
Hand washing stations were lacking warm water, soap, and/or the means to 
dry hands. Not all hand washing stations were equipped with a sign instructing food handlers 
to wash their hands upon reporting for duty, or after the use of restroom facilities. Regular 
monitoring of all hand washing sinks/stations is recommended to ensure policy is being 
adhered to. 
Inspection of equipment and physical plant revealed access panels leading to energized circuits 
and mechanical components continues to be an issue. 
Observations during this review period 
revealed that access panels are not properly secured with locks or security screws. Daily 
monitoring of equipment is needed to ensure all equipment is properly secured, and there is no 
evidence of tampering with security features. Building a cooperative relationship, and 
maintaining open lines of communication between Food Service and the Facilities Department, 
is paramount to a functional and safely operated Food Service Department. 
Wet wiping cloths were observed not being stored according to policy. Wet cloths, used for 
clean contact or non-contact food surfaces, are to be stored in a chemical sanitizer at a 
concentration specified by the manufacturer. Wet cloths used for raw animal foods must be 
kept in a separate sanitizing solution. Wet wiping cloths not in use were observed being 
stored improperly. Additional training should be provided to increase staff and inmate 
awareness of the importance of properly storing wet wiping cloths to minimize the risk of 
cross-contamination. 
Issues are still occurring in the budget process. Oversight and additional training is needed to 
ensure budgets are accurate and include all items needed to support the approved menus. 
Closer attention should be paid to ensure the information in FNS is accurate and updated to 
EFTA00036719
--- PAGE 16 ---
correctly reflect the needs of the department. This includes recipes being accurate, and the 
acceptability of menu items being in close proximity to the actual usage and updated as 
needed. 
Operational reviews were frequently found not being timely and/or complete. The timeliness 
of operational reviews was not always in accordance with P1210.23, Management Control and 
Program Review Manual. 
Operational reviews were found to be missing working papers 
and/or memorandums. Staff conducting operational reviews should become familiar with all 
aspects of P1210.23. 
Throughout this rating period, there continues to be numerous repeat deficiencies and 
deficiencies attached to ACA mandatory standards, and deficiencies that are considered vital 
functions. To ensure there are no concerns during upcoming ACA reaccreditations, and 
continued deficiencies with vital functions, food service management must place more 
emphasis on, and monitoring of, all ACA mandatory standards to ensure compliance. 
As a reminder, all items listed in Attachment B of the Program Review Notification are to be 
present in the work area of the review team when they arrive at the facility to conduct the 
review. This is imperative to ensure that adequate time is available to complete working 
papers and stay on schedule to complete the review in the 3 day time frame.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
HEALTH SERVICES 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Eighteen Health Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of four superior, seven good, four acceptable, and three 
deficient. 
One significant finding, six repeat deficiencies, and seventy-three deficiencies were 
identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Physical, dental, and female examinations for new commitments were not always 
completed as required by policy. 
• 
Inmates enrolled in chronic care clinics were not always evaluated timely, and/or had 
clinically indicated treatment completed as ordered. 
• 
Inmates with HIV infection were not always managed according to guidelines. 
• 
Inmates with latent TB infection (LTBI) did not receive chest radiographs timely, and/or 
offered treatment appropriately. 
• 
Emergency disaster drills were not conducted as required, and did not always have 
appropriate critique and/or corrective actions. 
• 
Medication Administration Records (MARS) were not always completed after 
administering narcotic medications. 
• 
Licensed Independent Practitioner (LIP) privileges were not always granted and 
approved in accordance with policy, and/or licenses were not verified timely. 
• 
Ancillary staff licenses were not always verified timely. 
• 
Practice agreements were not always completed properly. 
• 
Peer reviews for LIPs were not completed in accordance with policy. 
• 
T&A files were not always accurate. 
• 
Operational reviews were not always completed according to policy. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Reviews conducted this quarter revealed three deficient reviews due to a lack of administrative 
and clinical oversight, as well as a breakdown in compliance with ACA mandatory standards. 
There was one significant finding noted as well. During the significant finding review, it was 
found that the Health Services Department is not maintaining strict and accurate monitoring 
and tracking of inmates with significant medical conditions. 
Failure to evaluate, examine, and 
provide ongoing medical needs and treatment presents the potential for rapid deterioration of 
the health of inmates. This review could negatively impact the institution's ability to regain 
ACA reaccreditation. Non-compliance with ACA mandatory standards continues to have a 
huge impact on program review ratings and ACA accreditation. 
EFTA00036721
--- PAGE 18 ---
Physical and dental examinations for new commitments must be conducted within the required 
time frame. It is essential to complete the examination timely to determine an inmate's 
medical needs. Failure to identify inmate health issues can cause deterioration of patient 
health and possible legal consequences. 
Inmates enrolled in chronic care clinics must be evaluated every 12 months, or more often if 
clinically indicated. Clinically ordered testing must be completed as ordered to ensure chronic 
illnesses are monitored closely to prevent further disease progression. 
Clinical management of inmates with HIV infection is essential in controlling the disease 
process. Proper immunizations and timely evaluations help prevent further disease 
progression and appropriate management of laboratory testing results. 
Timely chest radiographs, on inmates with latent TB infection (LTBI), helps prevent spreadable 
infections throughout the inmate population. Clinical review of each case, with appropriate 
treatment offered, prevents future outbreaks from latent infections. 
Emergency disaster drills need to be completed twice per year. Appropriate drills help test 
the resources available of each health services department, and ensures proper supplies and 
responses to emergencies are accurate and effective. Critique and corrective actions will help 
identify weaknesses which can be corrected prior to actual emergencies. 
MARs were not always completed after administering narcotic medications. Accountability is 
very important for DEA controlled medications, therefore, administering of medications must 
be documented in the MARs after it is dispensed. 
Credential files must be maintained appropriately. 
LIPs must have accurate privileges and all 
licenses verified timely. Practice agreements must be complete and institution specific. 
Mid-level practitioners and dental hygienists must have a practice agreement with a licensed 
physician/ dentist prior to providing any health care in the institution. Peer reviews should 
address all required elements and have corrective actions addressed appropriately. Continual 
training to field staff, and frequent review of credentialing policy requirements, as well as 
monitoring of internal local tracking mechanisms, is paramount in reducing the number of 
recurrent deficiencies. Failure to maintain accurate credential files imposes risks for both ACA 
and Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) reaccreditation. 
Proper management of T&A files continues to be an issue throughout the institutions. Eight 
deficiencies were identified due to inaccurate maintenance of T&A files. Proper 
documentation of leave, overtime, and corrected T&A's need to be maintained to prevent 
waste, fraud, and abuse. 
A large number of reviews were conducted this quarter, and there were many deficiencies and 
repeat deficiencies identified. Operational reviews were a finding on three occasions. Solid 
operational reviews can be used as a tool to monitor the deficiencies which were identified.

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Ten Human Resource Management Program Reviews were conducted 
from 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of one superior, five good, and four acceptable. 
Two repeat deficiencies and thirty-four deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
T&As were not accurate. 
• 
Not all mandatory payroll reports were run each pay period. 
• 
Mandatory training standards were not in compliance. 
• 
Not all staff received female offender training. 
• 
Not all staff completed firearms training timely, and approved waivers and supporting 
documentation was not on file for the entire lapse period, nor did they contain 
projected completion dates. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
T&A records were not accurate. Timekeepers/keyers are responsible for accurately recording 
and keying time and attendance data for the employees assigned to them to ensure accuracy of 
entitlements/pay. Timekeeper/keyers are responsible for ensuring each T&A is certified as 
accurate by the supervisor prior to transmitting to the National Finance Center. Annual 
refresher training must be provided by HR to ensure policy compliance. 
Documentation must be maintained to verify which mandatory payroll reports were run each 
pay period. 
HR must ensure that mandatory payroll reports are run each pay period, and have 
a clear audit trail reflecting corrective action when warranted. 
Mandatory training is not being completed within the required time frame. There are reports 
in BLU that will assist HR offices in ensuring mandatory training is completed prior its 
expiration. 
HR needs to notify managers, and/or supervisors, before staff certifications are 
due to expire. 
Executive staff should also be kept abreast in order to support HR in their 
effort to ensure mandatory training compliance is met. 
HR managers are responsible for ensuring all new staff, and staff transferring to institutions 
housing female offenders, complete the training developed by the Women and Special 
Populations Branch and the trauma-informed correctional care module. 
P5200.02 Female 
Offender Manual, states in relevant part: 
"All staff at institutions or complexes housing 
female offenders are required to complete training developed by the Female Offender Branch 
and the trauma-informed correctional care module." In addition, the Bureau Mandatory 
Training Standards require the training be completed within 60 days of entry on duty to a 
facility housing female inmates. 
EFTA00036723
--- PAGE 20 ---
Approved waivers, and supporting documentation, was not on file for the entire lapse period 
for staff unable to maintain firearms certification. Annual firearms certification is an ACA 
mandatory requirement, therefore, it is imperative, when staff are unable to certify annually, 
there is a signed waiver (by the CEO), and supporting documentation, on file to justify the lapse 
period (i.e., military leave, extended sick leave, OWCP). If the employee is unable to complete 
the certification by the projected due date, HR must ensure another waiver, which is supported 
by updated documentation, is routed to the CEO for signature. A waiver must be on file for 
the entire firearms certification lapse period. 
When responding to the program review report, include both components (Human Resource 
Management and Affirmative Employment Program), and ensure all subsequent 
communication relative to the review is provided in one response, not separate responses. 
All correspondence regarding the program review/operational reviews needs to be sent to 
EFTA00036724

PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT - FY 2019. 3rd QUARTER 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SECURITY 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Eleven Information Systems and Security Program Reviews were 
conducted from 4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of two superior, seven good, one 
acceptable, and one deficient. Twenty-one deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Critical and sensitive systems have not been identified in the current contingency plan. 
• 
Staff are not aware of the proper procedures for protecting sensitive information. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Critical and sensitive systems have not been identified in the current contingency plan. Staff 
must ensure critical and sensitive systems are properly documented in the current contingency 
plans. The guidance provided at national IT training, quarterly video conferences, and most 
recently by your regional computer services administrators, should be followed. There were 
four deficiencies identified for this step this quarter, and one deficiency identified last quarter. 
P1237.16, Information Security provides guidance on critical and sensitive systems. 
Sensitive information is not labeled. Staff are not aware of, or adhering to, local and national 
information security procedures. 
End users must be trained in the protection of sensitive 
information. There were five deficiencies identified for this step this quarter, and one 
deficiency identified last quarter. P1237.16, Information Security, provides guidance on 
sensitive materials. 
Although not a frequent deficiency, additional oversight is needed to ensure required annual 
recertifications are completed by the due date provided by the Office of Information Systems. 
There were two deficiencies identified for this step this quarter. P1237.14 Personal 
Computers and Network Standards, provides guidance on annual recertifications, and OIS 
Technical Bulletins outline the due date and method of submission. 
Additionally, operational reviews not being timely and complete is another recurring finding. 
In order to ensure operational reviews are complete, the correct guidelines must be used, all 
working papers must be completed (this includes the standard program review steps), working 
papers must be signed and dated, and all identified issues must be documented on the report. 
The entire process includes completion of the follow-up review/report and obtaining closure. 
There were two deficiencies identified for this step this quarter. P1210.23 Management 
Control and Program Review Manual, provides guidance on the operational review process. 
The program review team also provided guidance on this subject at annual training in Denver in 
August 2018.

PSYCHOLOGY SERVICES 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Eighteen Psychology Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of six superior, five good, and seven acceptable. 
Three 
repeat deficiencies and eighty-four deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Suicide watch log books are not always utilized, in accordance with the post orders, to 
document constant observation of suicidal inmates. 
• 
Suicide Risk Assessments are not always conducted and documented in PDS-BEMR 
within 24 hours of the referral. 
• 
Identified high risk inmates are not always screened by a psychologist within 24 hours of 
SHU placement. 
• 
Sexual Abuse Interventions are not always documented in PDS-BEMR within 24 hours. 
• 
Inmates coded as CARE2-MH do not always have a rationale for their diagnosis and care 
level documented in PDS-BEMR. 
• 
Inmates prescribed antipsychotic medication do not always have the rationale for 
frequency and type of care documented in PDS-BEMR. 
• 
Inmates participating in follow-up drug treatment do not always have timely progress 
reviews documented in PDS-BEMR. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Suicide watch log books are not always utilized, in accordance with the post orders, to 
document constant observation of suicidal inmates. 
Post orders need to be adhered to when 
staff are watching suicidal inmates. 
Staff are typically required to sign suicide log books every 
minutes to document the constant observation of suicidal inmates. 
Coordination between 
Psychology Services and Correctional Services staff is required when conducting suicide 
watches. 
Suicide Risk Assessments are not always conducted and documented in PDS-BEMR within 24 
hours of the referral. 
Suicide Risk Assessments need to be documented in the PDS record or 
review queue within 24 hours of the referral. 
Please be mindful, policy discusses it being 24 
hours from the referral and not 24 hours from the time the Suicide Risk Assessment was 
completed. 
Identified high risk inmates are not always screened by a psychologist within 24 hours of SHU 
placement. 
Any inmates coded as CARE3-MH, CARE4-MH, PSY ALERT, and/or who are on the 
Psychology Advisory List, need to have a restrictive housing mental health screening within 24 
EFTA00036726
--- PAGE 23 ---
hours of placement in SHU. 
Please be mindful, the policy time frame is 24 hours and not one 
working day. 
Sexual Abuse Interventions are not always documented timely. 
Sexual Abuse Interventions, 
for victims of sexually abusive behavior, need to be documented in PDS-BEMR within 24 hours 
of the contact. 
Inmates coded as CARE2-MH do not always have a rationale for their diagnosis and care level 
documented in PDS-BEMR. 
Inmates coded as CARE2-MH need to have a rationale for the 
diagnosis and assigned mental health care level documented in a Diagnostic and Care Level 
Formulation. Additionally, inmates who are prescribed antipsychotic medication need to have 
the rationale for frequency and type of care documented in PDS-BEMR. 
Current and thorough 
documentation assists in guiding the treatment process, and with continuity of care if inmates 
transfer to different institutions or are released. 
Inmates participating in follow-up drug treatment do not always have timely progress reviews 
documented in PDS-BEMR. 
Inmates who have completed the residential component of the 
RDAP, and are participating in follow-up services, need to have timely progress notes 
completed and documented in PDS-BEMR.

RELIGIOUS SERVICES 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Ten Religious Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 - 6/30/19, with overall ratings of five superior, three good, and two acceptable. 
One repeat deficiency and ten deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Chaplains should be mindful of the special needs populations [i.e., female inmates, and inmates 
in Special Management Units (SMUs), Communication Management Units (CMUs), and Mental 
Health Units (MI-Ills)]. Also, care should be given in providing spiritual resources to inmates 
housed in SHU. 
All incoming chapel media, whether purchased or donated, should be previewed and logged 
into the "Standardized Chapel Library Catalog" (SCLC) prior to distribution to the inmate 
population, per the Second Chance Act of 2007. Several chapels have developed a log sheet, 
of all incoming media items that are currently under review, comprised of the title and date of 
purchase (or donation), which has proven to extremely beneficial.

RESIDENTIAL REENTRY 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Four Residential Reentry Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of two acceptable and two deficient. 
One repeat 
significant finding, one repeat repeat deficiency, two repeat deficiencies, and thirteen 
deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
Operational reviews were not conducted within the required time frames, and were not 
complete. 
• 
Escape reports were not always completed on all escapes (actual or technical). 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
There was one repeat significant finding identified this quarter in contracting. 
Proper 
oversight of contracts is not being accomplished. 
Basic contract administration tasks, to 
include staff clearances, tracking of contract actions, and proper contract monitoring 
procedures, are not being followed. This causes a lack of credible accountability of the 
contract and assurance to the public, while increasing liability to the agency. 
Operational reviews are often not completed according to policy. 
Staff should monitor 
operational review and follow-up date requirements to ensure they are in compliance with 
policy. Staff should ensure each guideline step is completed for an effective, policy compliant 
operational review. 
RRO staff are reminded that operational reviews must be closed prior to 
their next program review. 
P1210.23, Management Control and Program Review Manual 
provides guidance on the operational review process. 
Oversight needs to be strengthened to ensure all contracting documentation (e.g., monitoring 
reports, IGAs, CEFs, and contractor training) is reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and policy 
requirements, as well as ensuring it is in accordance with BOP guidelines and in the best 
interest of the agency. Failure to do so causes a lack of credible accountability of the contract 
and assurance to the public, while increasing liability to the agency. 
Victim/Witness notifications were not always submitted immediately upon an inmate being 
placed on escapes status. 
RRO staff failing to notify victims/witnesses of escapes could have 
life threatening consequences.

TRUST FUND 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Ten Trust Fund Program Reviews were conducted from 4/1/19 -
6/30/19, with overall ratings of nine superior and one good. 
One deficiency was identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Although not a frequent deficiency, inmate performance pay continues to be a concern. 
Procedures should be put in place to ensure inmate pay is posted, reconciled, and transmitted, 
via IPAC to the Deposit Fund, Trust Fund Branch, no later than the 15th of the month. 
Refer to 
P4500.12 Trust Fund/Deposit Fund Manual Chapter 9, Para 9.10, and Chapter 11, for further 
guidance. 
Operational reviews continue to be a concern. 
Operational reviews must be completed using 
the correct guidelines, the working papers must be signed and dated, and all identified areas of 
concern documented in the report. In addition, responses, follow-up reports, and closures are 
required for operational reviews. 
P1210.23 Management Control and Program Review 
Manual, provides procedures and time frames for completing operational reviews.

UNICOR 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Four UNICOR Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of four superior. 
One deficiency was identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
There were no frequent deficiencies identified this quarter. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Work measurement files need to be maintained for all products manufactured within the 
factory, and for all processes within factory operations. 
The set-up and run times in the work 
measurement file should reflect accurate data and match the times on the current Item 
Standard Routings. 
The current policy on production scheduling requires production schedule stability (PSS) of 85 
percent or better. This rate is determined by the number of jobs with no changes x 100, then 
divided by the number of released jobs for the period being reviewed. Although there are a 
variety of reasons or justifications why a job would start late or finish late, factory managers are 
reminded to document the reason or justification in the job header text within SAP. 
Staff should ensure that operational reviews are conducted based on the week of the last 
program review (10-14 months and 22-26 months afterwards). Current PRGs and operational 
review working papers are available on Sallyport. 
Staff are reminded, when conducting an 
operational review, all components, with the exception of the climate, must be completed. 
If a step does not apply to the site, then N/A can be used on the working paper and that step 
should be retained with the working papers. 
The program review process continues to be policy driven, and regardless of the overall 
performance, the operation must still adhere to all policies, procedures, and laws. 
Staff are 
encouraged to stay abreast of program statements and other directives for program 
compliance. 
Use of the program review guidelines as the only means of program compliance 
is inadequate, as the guidelines were developed for periodic program examination, and only 
cover small parts of various processes and procedures.

VOLUNTEER SERVICES 
NUMBER OF REVIEWS: 
Ten Volunteer Services Program Reviews were conducted from 
4/1/19 — 6/30/19, with overall ratings of four superior, two good, and four acceptable. 
Fourteen deficiencies were identified. 
MOST FREQUENT DEFICIENCIES THIS REPORTING PERIOD: 
• 
There were no frequent deficiencies identified during this quarter. 
REVIEWERS' COMMENTS: 
Reentry Affairs Coordinators (RACs) should retain the old Volunteer Checklist (BP-A0578), along 
with the new checklist, in section one of the Official Volunteer File (OVF). 
This will ensure the 
approving official's signature is on file certifying the 4-hour training and packet completion. 
RACs are to enter "end dates" for all Level 2 inactive volunteers in the National Automated 
Volunteer System (NAVS). 
Inactive OVFs should be maintained for 3 years from the end date 
of service, inclusive of the expired volunteer badges. 
The Volunteer Services Institution Supplement does not need to be approved annually by the 
regional reentry affairs coordinator. 
This is only necessary when the supplement is updated. 
As a reminder, RACs are to use and maintain the official forms, as noted in Attachment A, 
P5300.22, Volunteer Services. 
Maintaining the appropriate volunteer documentation is the 
responsibility of the RAC.

consider, talk to the other CSAs but let me ask the RDs before scheduling. Thanks.

Good Morning All: 
Following yesterdays incident, we are all under a microscope. The event is unfortunate and will have a lot of backlash 
associated with it but I want to say THANK YOU to each and every one of you for doing the job that you do. 
People don't understand how hard you all work and how you put your life at risk every day. Don't allow all of the criticism to 
define who we are as people and employees because you all keep this building afloat in the most daunting times 
and situations. 
Below are a number of items to remember to protect yourselves: 
1. As an employee, you can not speak to the media. Refrain from any remarks or statements. That is the duty of the Public 
Information Officer, 
at 
2. We have a lot of visitors in the institution. Have your credentials on you at all times. Additionally, if you're unsure of a 
person's identity, you can request identification. 
EFTA00036752
--- PAGE 3 ---
3. Maintain integrity in all forms of communication. Be honest, don't lie. It's the experience that dishonesty is disciplined 
more severely than the actual offense. 
4. There will be a lot of requests for memorandums. As a bargaining employee, you have a right to route your memorandum 
through your Union prior to submitting it to the agency or it's representative, if YOU reasonably believe it can lead to 
discipline. 
4. If called for questioning by ANY representative of the agency (BOP, CA, OIG); you are entitled to a representative as a 
witness or subject if YOU reasonably believe it can lead to discipline. 
5. The agency and or it's representative are REQUIRED by law to advise you of your right to have representative prior to 
conducting any questioning. If they don't, please keep the Union informed. While they must inform you YOU have the 
responsibility of invoking your Weingarten Rights and informing that you want a representative. By law, upon that 
invockation, all questioning is to cease. 
6. It is not a condition of employment to speak with O1G. If you find yourself in a room with OIG, you request a representative 
immediately!! Once you make communication with the Union, further guidance will be given. Investigations/ examinations 
should not take place at your residence or away from your duty location. 
7. If you find yourself in a room being questioned by the FBI. Immediately inform that you want an attorney. 
IN UNITY!!!

The light is Suicide Watch Cell #1 is out. This needs to be replaced ASAP. As there is an inmate in the cell currently, the light 
needs to be working. (All cells are currently in use so he can not be moved to another cell.) He will need to be moved by the 
Lt. while the light is being replaced.

Both fall under this category that's why travel authorizations were created for both staff. 
Thanks

GSA FTR 301-11.1 allows per diem when the trip is over 12 hours. 
The travel must be over 50 miles and over 12 hours to get per diem. 
If you have any other questions, please let us know.

Good afternoon, 
I have a travel related question, 
If a staff member is assigned as an escort staff and this trip is over the 50 mile radius and goes over 12 hours all together. Is 
he/she entitled to per diem "75%" on travel days?

Good Afternoon, 
As your supervising Associate Warden, it is my goal to have a one on one with each of you and provide you with my 
expectations. Due to the current situation, I am unable to do this at this time. However, I do want to pass a few things on to 
you until we can have a sit down discussion: 
(1). Please ensure you have accountability for your staff because when you are not here and something happens, I am the 
next in the chain of command to have to respond. If you are out, please ensure that you have an Acting and that Acting 
knows that he/she is/will be given the same courtesies as you. 
(2). Timely submission. Please ensure that you submit paperwork in a timely manner. Meaning that if you are late, please 
don't email it to me and expect me to print, proof, route, etc.... This is not professional and not my job. Submit your T&A in 
WEBTA timely. 
(3). Provide me with your leave requests for the entire remainder of the year. Please ensure that those previous and current 
requests are entered in WEBTA. I would hope that you would have a discussion with me prior to submitting them in WEBTA. 
(4). If you are late or call in sick, please do not leave me a voice mail message or text. Please contact me on my BOP cell 
phone at 
Once you arrive at work, please submit your leave in WEBTA. 
(5). Comp Time must be pre-approved by me. No exceptions. Once worked, a Comp Sheet must be completed and routed 
in a folder for my review and then I will forward it on to the Warden. 
There are additional expectations forthcoming and will be discussed in person during our meeting. You will have your 
opportunity to discuss any concerns you may have at that time as well. Thanks.

I do remember you and I am glad to hear fro you. Thank you for your kind words. 1 don't know why they decided to provide 
fake and non-factual information about me, but hey, if it takes the heat off of my boss, I will take it any day. I know what the 
truth is and therefore, they can say whatever they want. They think they can get a response from me, they are sadly 
mistaken. I have been in this business a long time and could have retired years ago and I am going when I want to go. Lol! 
Please keep us in your prayers. We are trying to keep the staff uplifted during this time. Thanks again.

instead of creating a new Supplement just for Naloxone. This is what the other institutions have done. Your thoughts? 
Thanks.

The Council of Prison Locals is advising all subjects and witnesses associated with this incident to remember, Art 6, section 
f(1) "If an employee reasonably believe discipline may result (2) he/she should exercise their right to requesting a 
representative. All staff are reminded Art. 6, section h, which protects them from answering any further questions until a 
representative is made available. I also, advise staff to read Art. 7, section e (2). Understand, the FBI will also be investigating 
this event. This doesn't applies to the FBI. So, if they desire to speak with any subject (s) or witnessed of an investigation 
stemming from this, I would strongly advise those staff seek or request assistance of counsel (Attorney). 
IN UNITY!!

any foreign area, theatrical exhibitions and exhibitions in any 
supplemental market. 
29. No Partnership/Joint 
Venture 
Nothing herein contained will constitute a partnership between, or 
joint venture of, the parties to this Agreement or establish either 
party as the agent of the other. No Party hereto will hold itself out 
contrary to the terms of this section, and no Party will become 
liable for the representation, warranty, act, or omission of any 
other contrary to the provisions hereof. 
30. Remedies 
a) Author's Remedies / No Injunctive Relief:Author acknowledges 
that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement by Company 
or any third party, the damage, if any, caused to Author thereby 
will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle Author 
to seek injunctive or other equitable relief. Author 
acknowledges that its rights and remedies in any such event will 
be strictly limited to the right, if any, to recover damages in an 
action at law, and Author shall not have the right to terminate 
this Agreement or any of Company's rights hereunder, neither 
the right to enjoin the distribution, publication, or other use of 
the Granted Rights or the exercise of any right in and/or to the 
Productions, nor the right to enjoin the production, exhibition 
or other exploitation of any motion picture produced pursuant 
to the Granted Rights, any element thereof, any subsidiary or 
allied rights with respect thereto, or any other results and 
proceeds of Authors services hereunder, nor will Author have 
the right to terminate their respective services or obligations 
hereunder by reason of such breach. Without limiting the 
foregoing or Company's other rights under this Agreement or 
at law or in equity, under no circumstances will any act or 
omission of Company which would otherwise constitute a 
breach or alleged breach of this Agreement be deemed such 
unless Author notify Company in writing setting forth in detail 
the basis for such breach or alleged breach and Company fails 
to commence reasonable efforts to cure such breach or alleged 
breach within thirty (30) days of Company's receipt of such 
notice. 
b) Company Remedies: The rights and services which are the 
subject matter of this Agreement are of a special, unique, 
extraordinary and intellectual character which gives them a 
peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or 
adequately compensated in damages in an action at law and 
which would cause Company great irreparable injury and 
damage. Accordingly, Company shall be entitled to seek 
injunctive relief, to preserve its rights and interest in and to such 
rights and services. This provision shall not, however, be 
construed as a waiver of any rights Company may have for 
damages or otherwise arising from any breach of this 
Agreement. At all times, Company shall have all rights and 
remedies which it has at law or in equity pursuant hereto or 
otherwise, all of which rights and remedies shall be construed 
as cumulative.

31. Copyright 
a) Protection of Copyright 
L Author shall ensure that the Property will be protected by 
copyright and will be registered in the United States 
Copyright Office in Washington, D.C. for copyright 
protection, following initial publication in the United States. 
In connection therewith, Author agrees and acknowledges 
that (1/ the Property is a work of authorship protected under 
Title 17 of the United States Code and is intended to 
constitute, and does constitute, intellectual property' 
within the meaning of sections 101(52)( E) and 365(n) of Title 
of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), and 
(2) the rights of Company hereunder are "rights to 
intellectual property" within the meaning of such sections. 
ii. Author shall take all reasonable steps at Authors expense to 
protect all copyrights pertaining to the Property from 
infringement, and Author agrees that it will institute such 
action and proceedings as may be reasonable to prevent any 
unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation 
by third parties of the Property or any part thereof which 
may be in contravention of the rights granted to Company 
hereunder. Company shall provide Author copies of all 
documents executed pursuant hereto. 
iii. If Author elect not to take any action in the event of an 
infringement of copyright or of the Granted Rights, Author 
shall so notify Company promptly, in writing, and Company 
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take such 
action as Company shall deem reasonable in the 
circumstances, at Authors sole cost and expense. Author 
appoints Company as its attorney-in-fact (which power is 
coupled with an interest) to act in its name for the purpose 
of permitting Company to prevent any unauthorized use, 
reproduction, exhibition or exploitation of the Property or 
any part thereof. 
iv. Author further agrees that it shall not take any steps to 
prevent, challenge or otherwise hinder Company from 
registering any and all of Company's interest in the 
Productions with the United States Copyright Office in 
accordance with this Agreement. 
b) Copyright Termination 
i. If at any time after Company's exercise of the Option, Author 
or any party succeeding to Authors termination interest or 
otherwise claiming through Author or any other party so 
empowered by law is deemed to have any right to terminate 
any or all of the rights granted to Company hereunder (the 
"subject rights") pursuant to Section 203 or 304 of Title 17 
of the U.S. Code (the "Copyright Act") or any other laws of 
the United States, or any of its subdivisions, or of any foreign 
country, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to 
preclude Author from freely exercising said right to 
terminate. Any exercise or further grant of the subject rights 
WIYIYISIc.X.0.000c.4151motOrl vettrissw w,". evnevekvIeco 
EFTA00037031
--- PAGE 18 ---
so terminated shall be subject to the terms and conditions 
of this paragraph. Any such right to terminate the subject 
rights shall in no event apply to any rights granted to 
Company hereunder other than those rights arising under 
the Copyright Act or any comparable act of a foreign 
country. If the parties do not reach an agreement with 
respect to a reacquisition of the subject rights prior to the 
effective date of such termination, Company shall have a 
right of first negotiation and last refusal with respect to the 
subject rights as follows: If at any time, Author proposes to 
accept or make a bona fide offer to produce, license, 
transfer or exploit ("Exploit") any of the subject rights, 
Author shall first offer to negotiate to grant such rights to 
Company by giving Company written notice of the rights 
which Author desires to Exploit and the terms and 
conditions of any proposed transaction. Within ten (10) days 
after the receipt of such notice, Company may notify Author 
whether or not Company desires to negotiate, failing which 
Company shall be deemed to have elected not to negotiate. 
If Company notifies Author within such ten (10) day period 
that it elects to negotiate, then the parties shall negotiate in 
good faith regarding the subject rights for a period of thirty 
days thereafter. If Company agrees to negotiate, but such 
negotiations do not result in an agreement between the 
parties within such thirty (30) day period, then Author 
thereafter may negotiate with any third party with respect 
to the subject rights; provided, that Company may meet any 
bona fide third party offer which Author are willing to accept 
(or which is proposed by Author to any third party) ("Third 
Party Offer"). Author shall give Company written notice of 
the Third Party Offer, specifying its particulars, including, but 
not limited to, the identity of the offeror or offeree, the price 
and other terms, and Company shall have the exclusive right 
for ten days after its receipt of such notice to acquire the 
subject rights upon the terms and conditions in Author's 
notice; provided, that Company shall not be required to 
meet any term of condition of the proposed transaction 
which may not be as easily met by Company as by any other 
party. If Company exercises its right within such ten (10) day 
period, then Company shall be deemed to have acquired the 
subject rights and Author shall execute and deliver such 
additional documentation as Company may reasonably 
request to further evidence such acquisition. If Company 
fails to exercise its rights, Author may make or accept the 
Third Party Offer; provided, that if the transaction 
contemplated by such Third Party Offer is not consummated 
upon the terms and conditions in Author's notice within 
sixty (60) days after the expiration of such ten (10) day 
period, or if such transaction is so consummated but the 
subject rights return to Author for any reason, then 
Company's rights hereunder shall revive and apply to each 
WIYIYISIc.X.0.000c.4151.notOrl vettrissw OotimewstrekvIeco 
EFTA00037032
--- PAGE 19 ---
further Third Party Offer regarding the subject rights. 
ii. Author agrees to use commercially reasonable good faith 
efforts to prevent the Property from becoming public 
domain material to the extent possible; (to the extent 
required by law) to cause to be affixed to each copy of the 
Property or any part thereof published or offered by sale by 
or with the authority of Author, notice of copyright 
complying in all respects with the U.S. copyright law and 
with the Universal Copyright Convention; and to register the 
Property wherever necessary for such protection. If the 
Property or any part thereof is unpublished at the time any 
motion picture or sound record produced hereunder is 
published or released, it is expressly agreed that any 
statutory copyright secured by Company in its own name 
hereunder, covering such motion picture or sound record, 
shall extend to any and all copyrightable component parts of 
such motion picture or sound record, and shall be held by 
Company and that Company may, if it so elects, obtain 
separate statutory copyright protection for the Property or 
any part thereof in the name of Company, or otherwise, as 
it may elect. 
iii. Author recognizes that a material part of the consideration 
motivating Company to enter into this Agreement is that 
Company shall enjoy all rights granted to Company for the 
full term of any and all of said copyrights (including, without 
limitation, all extensions of such copyrights, and to the full 
extent for or at any time hereafter permitted by law, the 
renewal term of all United States copyrights involved). If any 
United States statutory copyright in the Property or any part 
thereof was existing prior to January 1, 1978 and is in its 
initial term as of the date hereof, Author agrees to make 
application for, and secure a renewal of, each and even/such 
United States copyright involved, prior to the expiration of 
each such copyright, or, if Author is not entitled to renew 
any such copyright, Author will use its best efforts to cause 
the person entitled to do so to make application for, and 
secure a renewal of, such copyright; and in either event 
Author will promptly notify Company in writing that such 
renewal copyright has been applied for and has been 
secured. Promptly after each such copyright has been 
renewed, Author shall, without payment of any further 
consideration by Company, execute and deliver to Company, 
or cause to be executed and delivered to Company, such 
further instrument or instruments as shall be necessary or 
proper to vest in Company all of the rights herein granted 
for the full period of such renewal copyright, upon and 
subject to all of the identical terms, conditions, limitations, 
representations, 
covenants 
and 
warranties 
herein 
contained, except for the monetary consideration herein 
specified. Regardless of the execution and delivery of any 
such instrument, all such rights shall be deemed to have 
WIYIYIHeXt0.000a111.1cnotOrnanjilosvy Nom ewe.. etriao 
EFTA00037033
--- PAGE 20 ---
been acquired by Company under such renewal copyright 
upon and subject to all of the terms, conditions, limitations, 
representations, covenants and warranties herein contained 
simultaneously with the effective date of renewal of such 
copyright. 
32. Legal Clearance 
Upon Company's request, Author shall cooperate with Company 
or any attorneys for Company or any insurance company 
providing errors and omissions insurance for the Productions, in 
connection with the legal clearance of such Productions 
33. Public 
Domain 
Material/Member of 
the Public 
Nothing contained in herein: (a) shall at any time limit Company's 
right to utilize freely, in any work or production, any story, idea, 
plot, theme, sequence, scene, episode, incident, name, 
characterization or dialogue or other material which may be in 
the public domain, whether included in the Property or derived 
from some other source; or (b) shall be construed to be prejudicial 
to or operate in derogation of or prejudicial to any rights, 
licenses, privileges or property which Company may enjoy or be 
entitled to as a member of the public, as if this Agreement were 
not in existence. Company may exercise any such rights, licenses, 
privileges or property at any time and in any manner, whether 
or not competitive with the activities of Author. This section shall 
not affect the scope or validity of Author's representations, 
warranties or indemnities in this Agreement. 
34. Applicable Law 
This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance 
with the internal laws of the state of New York. The Parties agree 
to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and 
state courts of the State of New York located in the City of 
Manhattan, which the Parties acknowledge and agree are 
convenient forums to litigate any such action. The Parties waive 
any right to transfer such action to any other court and expressly 
consent to the permanent jurisdiction of such courts with respect 
to the resolution of any disputes under this Agreement and agree 
to be bound by the judgment rendered by such courts. 
35. Additional Documents 
a) Without limiting Authors obligations or Company's rights 
under this Agreement, Author shall execute, acknowledge, 
verify, and deliver to Company or cause to be executed, 
acknowledged, verified and delivered to Company any and all 
further assignments, instruments and documents pertaining to 
the Granted Rights, consistent herewith, which Company may 
request and deem necessary to effectuate the purposes and 
intent of this Agreement and in the form Company may 
prescribe, after opportunity to review; provided, however, that 
Author's failure or refusal to do so shall not affect any of 
Company's rights in the Property, or any of Author's 
representations or warranties with respect thereto. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Author agrees to timely 
obtain or cause to be obtained renewals of all copyrights in and 
to the Property. If Author fail or refuse to do so after a 
reasonable opportunity to review and negotiate such 
instruments or documents not to exceed five (5) business days 
(or three (3] business days in exigent circumstances as 
1YIYISic.X.0

determined by Company in good faith), Author hereby appoints 
Company (which such appointment is coupled with an interest 
and hence irrevocable) as Author's attorney-in-fact to execute 
any such instruments and documents in Author's name and on 
Author's behalf and to institute and prosecute such 
proceedings as Company may deem expedient to secure, 
protect, or enforce the rights Company is acquiring hereunder. 
Company shall have the right to place the same of record in the 
U.S. Copyright Office and elsewhere as Company may 
determine. Company may sue in its own name or may use the 
names of Author or may join Author as party plaintiff or 
defendant in any such suit or proceeding. Company shall 
provide copies of all final documents to Author executed on 
Author's behalf under this section following Authors request 
therefor provided, however, inadvertent failure to so provide 
such documents shall not be a breach hereof. Notwithstanding 
the failure or omission of any party to this Agreement to 
execute and/or deliver such additional instruments, it is agreed 
that upon the exercise of the Option, all rights agreed to be 
transferred to Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be 
deemed vested forever in Company, effective as of the date of 
the exercise of the Option, which rights shall be irrevocable 
under any and all circumstances, subject to reversion provided 
for in section 18. 
b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Author 
shall execute the short-form assignment (hereinafter, the 
"Assignment") attached to and incorporated in this Agreement. 
If Company shall exercise the Option and pay the Series 
Purchase Price and/or the Film Purchase Price, Author's 
signature on the Assignment shall be deemed to be effective 
and the Assignment shall constitute a valid and binding 
agreement and assignment and shall be deemed to have been 
executed, and shall be dated and deemed to be effective, as of 
the date of exercise of the Option. Company is authorized and 
empowered to date the Assignment accordingly. If Company 
fails to exercise the Option, then Author's signature on the 
Assignment shall be void and of no further force and effect 
whatsoever, and Company shall not be deemed to have 
acquired any rights in the Property other than the Option 
provided for in this Agreement. 
c) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Author 
shall execute and deliver to Company the short-form option 
agreement (hereinafter, the "Option Agreement") which is 
attached to and incorporated in this Agreement. Company may 
record the executed short-form Option Agreement at any time, 
and may record the executed Assignment (but only after 
exercise of the Option and payment of the Series Purchase Price 
and/or the Film Purchase Price) with the U.S. Copyright Office 
and with the copyright office or comparable registry of any 
country.

its rights or privileges hereunder, and/or delegate all or any of its 
obligations hereunder, to any person or entity. In the event of such 
assignment or delegation, Company shall remain secondarily liable 
hereunder (unless such assignment or delegation is to a so-called 
"major' or "mini-major motion picture distributor or television 
network, any similarly financially responsible party, or any party 
which substantially controls, is substantially controlled by or is 
under common control with Company or which through merger, 
consolidation or acquisition succeeds to substantially all of the 
assets of Company, and such assignee/delegee assumes in writing 
all of Company's obligations hereunder, in which event Company 
shall be released and discharged from all of its obligations 
hereunder and Author shall look solely to such assignee or delegee, 
as the case may be, for performance thereof). Author may not 
assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder, in whole or in part, 
except with Company's prior written approval, and any such 
purported assignment shall be deemed null and void. This 
Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their 
successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of 
Company's successors, licensees and assigns. 
37. Miscellaneous 
Nothing herein shall be construed to require the commission of 
any act contrary to law. In the event of any conflict between any 
provision of this Agreement and any present or future statute, law 
or regulation, the latter shall prevail and the affected provision of 
this Agreement shall be modified only to the extent necessary to 
bring it within legal requirements, such provision shall be deemed 
stricken from this Agreement to the extent required to bring it 
within the legal requirements and the remaining terms of this 
Agreement shall continue in hill force and effect. No waiver by 
either Party of any failure by the other to perform hereunder shall 
be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the 
same or any other obligation. Company may deduct and withhold 
from Author's compensation all amounts required to be deducted 
or withheld under any present or future statute, law, ordinance, 
regulation, order, writ, judgment or decree. 
38. Entire Agreement 
This Agreement (including exhibits and all accompanying 
documents) contains the entire understanding between the 
Parties regarding this subject matter, supersedes any prior or 
contemporaneous understandings or agreements between the 
Parties with respect to Property, whether written or oral, and 
constitutes a valid and binding agreement. No officer, employee or 
representative of Company has any authority to make any 
representation or promise in connection with this Agreement or 
the subject matter of this Agreement that is not contained in this 
Agreement and Author has not executed this Agreement in 
reliance upon any such representation or promise. Any 
modification or amendment of this Agreement must be in writing

EXHIBIT A 
DEFINITION OF MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS RECEIPTS (MAGR) 
a) "Gross Receipts" means all non-returnable, non-refundable revenues actually received and earned 
by Company (and which are convertible to U.S. currency) in the United States from all sources 
worldwide in connection with Ancillary Use(s) (as defined below) of the Series (herein, "Project"), 
if any, including (if and when earned) non-returnable, non-refundable advances specifically related 
to the Project that otherwise qualify as Gross Receipts, but excluding all: (i) revenues received, 
earned, allocated, or recorded from distribution, availability, or other exploitation of the Project 
on Network Services, including, but not limited to, advertising revenue and subscriber fees; (ii) 
revenues received, earned, allocated, or recorded from distribution, availability, or other 
exploitation of a Project cycle or episode on Third-Party Network Services (such a cycle, or the cycle 
of which such episode is a part, the "Applicable Cycle"), (x) which distribution, availability, or 
exploitation occurs before the end of the six months following the Applicable Cycle's last episode's 
Premiere during such Applicable Cycle's Premiere ("Premiere" means the first distribution, 
availability, or other exploitation on any Network Service(s) and/or Third-Party Network Service(s)) 
(such end date, the "Tail End Date") or (y) which revenues constitute advertising revenue; (iii) 
Network trademark license 
fees, 
Network 
brand fees, promotional fees, and/or 
marketing/advertising monies, in each case paid in connection with the Project and/or any 
Ancillary Uses; (iv) amounts paid or payable to Company to finance development, production, or 
distribution costs or expenses, or as advances for such amounts, or as reimbursement of such costs 
or expenses; (v) tax benefits related to the Project, including, but not limited to, tax or other 
governmental credits or incentives ("Tax Credits") and any foreign tax credits; and (vi) amounts 
paid or payable to Company in connection with Company furnishing, supplying, rendering, 
procuring, arranging for, or making available any materials, equipment, facilities, or services in 
connection with the Project and/or any Ancillary Uses thereof. With respect to revenues received 
pursuant to agreements that cover other projects in addition to the Project, which revenues would 
otherwise constitute Gross Receipts: 
Company will allocate to Gross Receipts a portion 
(determined in Company's sole good-faith discretion) of such revenues. Participant acknowledges 
that the foregoing allocation requires the application of subjective factors, and Participant 
therefore waives any remedy Participant may have at law or equity with respect to Company's 
allocation of revenues made in accordance with this Paragraph. 
b) "Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts" means Gross Receipts less the following items on a continuing 
basis in the following order: (a) a 15% distribution fee; (b) distribution costs and expenses incurred 
in connection with distribution and other exploitation of any Ancillary Uses (including, but not 
limited to, any and all development, production, manufacturing, publishing, publicity, advertising, 
marketing, promotion, delivery, and guild residual/reuse costs associated with such Ancillary Use, 
but less all Tax Credits received and credited against such costs and expenses (which Tax Credits 
are not excluded from Costs deducted pursuant to clause (f) below)) ("Expenses"); (c) the 
contingent portion of any agency package commission payable on account of any Ancillary Use 
(defined below); (d) any and all third-party participations payable by Company in connection with 
the Project, other than those payable to net profit participants; (e) interest on the Costs (as defined 
below) at an annual percentage rate equal to 2% over and above the rate announced from time to 
time by J.P. Morgan Chase as its prime rate on unsecured loans ("Interest"); and (f) any and all 
costs incurred in connection with the development, production, and delivery of the Project (as 
defined in the Agreement) (including, but not limited to, any amounts payable to Participant) 
(collectively, "Production Costs"), but less all Tax Credits received and credited against such costs, 
plus an overhead charge of 15% of the Production Costs and Interest ("Overhead") (Overhead and 
Production Costs, together "Costs").

any manner or media now known or hereafter devised (including, but not limited to, DTO (as 
defined below)), throughout the universe, in perpetuity, other than (i) on Network Services, (ii) on 
Third-Party Network Services (x) before the Tail End Date or (y) to the extent revenues therefrom 
constitute advertising revenue, and (iii) the use or licensing of elements or characters from the 
Project which were not created by Participant and/or on which Participant did not perform 
services. "DT0" means the method commonly referred to as download-to-own (DTO) or 
electronic-sell-through (EST), i.e., permanent download, or the method commonly referred to as 
download-to-rent (DTR), in each case directly to the consumer through retail digital-distribution 
services (e.g., 'Tunes or Amazon Video), including (notwithstanding clause (i) of the foregoing 
sentence) any such services that constitute Network Services, for a discrete charge paid by such 
consumer for such episode (or "season" or other bundle of episodes). 
d) "Network Services" means all ViacomCBS Media Networks ("Network") branded and/or affiliated 
worldwide content distribution services, blocks, and feeds made available on any platform 
(including television, online, players, areas, applications, etc.) and in any manner (including linear, 
on-demand, non-permanent download, etc.), by any means of transmission (induding cable, 
satellite, telecom, intemet, wireless, cellular, etc.), and/or on any device (including television, 
computer, tablet, mobile, etc.), whether now known or hereafter devised. 
e) "Third-Party Network Services" means all third-party content distribution services to which 
Network makes available the Project, which services: make content available to their customers 
for exhibition on one or more platforms (including television, online, players, areas, applications, 
etc.) and in any manner (including linear, on-demand, nonpermanent download, etc.), by any 
means of transmission (including cable, satellite, telecom, intemet, wireless, cellular, etc.), and/or 
on any device (including television, computer, tablet, mobile, etc.), whether now known or 
hereafter devised; and charge their customers a subscription or other regular fee for the services

Party Network Services do not include services or portions of services that charge a per-item 
transactional fee for the exhibition of one episode, series or project. 
f) Interest will be charged only on the unrecouped Costs (i.e., (1) the aggregate of all amounts 
chargeable to Costs, minus (2) the aggregate of Gross Receipts, in each case on a continuing and 
cumulative basis) as of the midpoint and end-point of the applicable semi-annual accounting 
period. 
g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Exhibit or in the Agreement: no 
exploitation of any subsequent production(s) based on the Project (each such subsequent 
production a "Derivative Production") (as contrasted with exploitation of the Project) will 
constitute an Ancillary Use unless the Agreement specifically so provides; if the Agreement does 
specifically so provide, then, nonetheless if Participant is engaged to render services and/or is 
entitled to receive contingent compensation in connection with a given Derivative Production then 
revenue from such Derivative Production will not be included in the calculation of Participant's 
Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts participation set forth in the Agreement. 
h) The Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of the foregoing sentence, such subsequent 
productions that are a result of the sale, licensing, or other exploitation of the Project format 
("Format Licensing") do constitute Derivative Productions, but because Format Licensing is an 
exploitation of the Project (and not of a Derivative Production), revenue from Format Licensing 
itself does not constitute Derivative Production revenue; however, license fees and (provided 
Participant is not otherwise receiving any contingent participation from such Format Licensing) 
%WHS.:rift. 
MorASIcnot0•11 rarttrWay Nom earyttrekviao 
EFTA00037039
--- PAGE 26 ---
contingent participation(s) from Format Licensing will be included in the calculation of Gross 
Receipts. 
i) Company shall account to Participant with respect to Participant's share of Modified Adjusted 
Gross Receipts, if any, within 90 days after the end of each semi-annual period in which there are 
payments due Participant, and such statement of accounting will be accompanied by payment of 
Participants share (if any) of any monies payable for such semi-annual period. Participant may, at 
Participants own expense, audit Company's books and records relating to the Project in order to 
verify statements of accounting rendered hereunder. Each such audit will be conducted solely by 
a reputable firm of certified public accountants, upon reasonable advance written notice to 
Company, during reasonable business hours, at Company's offices, and in such manner so as not 
to interfere with Company's normal business activities, and, concurrently with each report such 
firm furnishes to Participant, such firm will furnish a true copy thereof to Company. Such right to 
audit is limited to the Project, and neither Participant nor Participants representative will have the 
right to examine records relating to Company's business generally, or with respect to any other 
projects, for purposes of comparison or otherwise. Participant may so audit once per calendar 
year and each audit may continue for up to 30 consecutive calendar days. The records supporting 
the statements may not be audited more than once. Company's methods of treating any amount 
referred to in this Exhibit for tax or financial purposes will have no bearing on the computation of 
Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts. Each accounting statement furnished by Company pursuant to 
this Exhibit will be deemed conclusive and binding unless Participant objects thereto to Company 
in writing within 12 months after the statement is issued, stating in detail the basis for the 
objection. Participant may not bring any legal proceeding later than the expiration of the period 
of the applicable statute of limitations established by law or 12 months after making such 
objection, whichever occurs first. If Company makes any overpayment to Participant hereunder 
for any reason, Company (a) may deduct and retain for its own account the amount of such 
overpayment from any amounts that thereafter become due or payable by Company to Participant 
or for Participants account, or (b) may demand repayment from Participant, in which event 
Participant shall repay such amount promptly. 
j) Participant acknowledges that Company is part of a diversified, multifaceted, international 
company, the commonly-controlled and third-party "affiliates" of which indude, or may in the 
future include, among others and without limitation, exhibitors; television, online, wireless, 
application, and other "platforms"; networks, stations, programming services, distributors, video 
device distributors, cable and/or satellite operators, record companies, video game companies, 
and publishers (literary and/or electronic); and wholesale and/or retail outlets (individually or 
collectively, "Affiliated Companyfiesr). Participant further acknowledges that Company has the 
right in its sole discretion to make use of Affiliated Companies in connection with the distribution 
and exploitation of the Project as, when, and where Company deems it appropriate to do so. With 
respect to Company's dealings with commonly-controlled Affiliated Companies, Participant 
expressly waives any right to object to such distribution and exploitation of the Project (or aspects 
thereof) or assert any daim that Company should have offered the applicable 
distribution/exploitation rights to third parties (in lieu of, or in addition to, offering the same to 
commonly-controlled Affiliated Companies). In consideration thereof, if Company enters into any 
agreement with a commonly-controlled Affiliated Company with respect to any disposition of 
rights in the Project, the consideration for which falls within the definition of Gross Receipts 
hereunder, then Gross Receipts shall be credited with an amount equal to the reasonable value of 
such rights as determined by Company in its reasonable business judgment. 
Participant 
acknowledges and agrees that Participants sole remedy against Company for any alleged failure 
by Company to comply with the terms of this subparagraph will be money damages, and Participant 
1YIYISic.X.0 
Mor111. knot. •iniee.trissre Nom wort etrI. /co 
EFTA00037040
--- PAGE 27 ---
hereby waives any right to seek or obtain preliminary or permanent equitable relief in connection 
with any such alleged failure. 
k) If any provision(s) (or any portion(s) of any provision(s)) in this Agreement conflicts) or could be 
interpreted to conflict with this paragraph for any reason (including, without limitation, any 
references to court, jurisdiction, judiciary, jury, action-at-law, or any other terms), the terms of this 
paragraph will control. Participant and Company agree that any and all controversies, claims or 
disputes arising out of or relating to this Exhibit and/or the conduct of the Parties hereunder or in 
connection herewith ("Dispute") will be the subject of good faith negotiation. If after good faith 
negotiation the Dispute is not resolved, and either party wishes to pursue the matter further, the 
Parties agree that the Dispute will be submitted to final and binding arbitration at the New York 
City office of JAMS, or its successor ("JAMS"), pursuant to the procedure set forth in subparagraph 
A. below. (A.) The arbitration will be initiated and conducted according to either the JAMS 
Streamlined (for claims under $250,000) or the JAMS Comprehensive (for claims over $250,000) 
Arbitration Rules and Procedures, except as modified herein, in effect at the time the request for 
arbitration is made (the "Arbitration Rules"). The Parties agree that a Dispute will include the 
determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate and the arbitrability of 
the Dispute, including, but not limited to, any claim of waiver. The arbitration will be conducted 
before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Unless the 
Parties agree otherwise, the neutral arbitrator will be a former or retired judge or justice of any 
New York state or federal court with substantial experience in matters involving the entertainment 
industry, who is affiliated with JAMS. The arbitrator will follow New York law in adjudicating the 
Dispute. The arbitrator will provide a detailed written statement of decision which will be part of 
the arbitration award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding except to the extent that 
limited judicial review is permitted by applicable law. The Parties are to share the arbitration costs 
and the arbitrators fees equally. Each party will remain responsible for its own attorneys' fees. The 
Parties waive the right to seek punitive damages and the arbitrator will have no authority to award 
such damages. All arbitration proceedings will be dosed to the public and confidential, and all 
records relating thereto will be permanently sealed. Neither the Parties nor the arbitrator will 
disclose the existence, content, testimony, evidence or results of the arbitration, except as 
necessary to comply with legal, statutory or regulatory requirements. Before making any such 
disclosure, a party will give written notice to all other parties and will afford such parties a 
reasonable opportunity to protect their interests. If either party refuses to perform any or all of its 
obligations under the final arbitration award within thirty (30) days of such award being rendered, 
then the other party may confirm or enforce the final award in any court of competent jurisdiction 
in New York County, New York. All Parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and 
federal courts located in New York County, New York for purposes of confirming or enforcing any 
arbitration award. This clause will not preclude the Parties from seeking provisional remedies in 
aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York. (B.) The 
Parties acknowledge that this provision constitutes a waiver of each party's rights to a civil court 
action or a jury trial concerning matters covered by this provision; only an arbitrator, not a judge 
or jury, will decide the Dispute.

Re: Jane Doe 1 v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-10019 (JSR) 
Dear Ms. 
Thank you for trusting me to evaluate your claims as part of the Epstein Survivors' Settlement 
Fund JPM (the "Epstein JPM Fund"). It has been an honor to be the Claims Administrator in 
this matter. Given the difficult nature of this process, please take care of yourself after reading 
this letter and seek support as needed. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have 
the meaning set forth and defined in the Stipulation of Settlement dated June 22, 2023 (the "JPM 
Stipulation") [ECF No. 181-1]. 
I have fully evaluated all Questionnaires and Releases submitted to me from Participating 
Claimants and this letter ("Determination Notice") constitutes notice of your Allocated Amount. 
After considering your Questionnaire and Release using the guidelines and evaluation factors 
enumerated in Section 5.2 of the JPM Stipulation and the totality of the circumstances, I have 
determined your Allocated Amount is One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00). Massive, LLC has 
advised that there is no withholding required as a result of medical liens and your distribution 
will be made upon receipt of signed payment instructions. Please execute the attached form to 
indicate where your Allocated Amount should be wired. 
Per Section 5.4 of the JPM Stipulation, the Allocated Amount determined for each Participating 
Claimant is final and non-appealable. 
The payment that will be made from the Epstein JPM Fund to you is intended to be for damages 
for personal physical injuries or physical sickness or emotional distress from physical sickness or 
physical injuries. Accordingly, you will not be issued an IRS Form 1099 and recommend that 
you seek advice based on your particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor to 
confirm that the payment is excludable from taxable gross income under 26 U.S.C. § 104(a)(2) 
or, if applicable, under the laws of your home country.

or counsel by phone at 
or email at 
The JPM Stipulation and referenced sections herein can be found at 
www.epsteinSSFJPM.com under the Case Documents tab. 
I also want to take this opportunity to let you know that the U.S. Virgin Islands ("GVI") has 
established a mental health fund (the "Mental Health Fund") to provide a financial resource for 
mental health services for survivors of Jeffrey Epstein that I will be administering. As a Class 
Member of both the Epstein DB Fund and the Epstein JPM Fund, you are eligible to apply for 
approved mental health treatment as recommended by a mental health provider. Information 
about the Mental Health Fund and instructions for submitting an application and treatment plan 
can be found at the dedicated website set up for this fund: www.USVIMentalHealthFund.com.
The Mental Health Fund will launch on January 16, 2024.

Re: 
Your Settlement with Epstein JPM Fund 
Dear 
As you know, we are receiving compensation from the Epstein JPM Fund on your behalf. 
You have asked and authorized us to wire you funds, and you have confirmed receipt of our test 
wire of $1.36, so as soon as feasible we will wire you your settlement disbursement. 
Attached is our invoice detailing the hours, expenses, etc. Summarized as follows: 
Gross Settlement Amount 
$1,000,000.00 
Less Fees and Costs Billed to You 
$75,000.00 
Net Disbursement to You 
$925,000.00 
We are not tax attorneys and therefore cannot advise on tax issues. In the past, we have 
consulted with a New York tax lawyer who advised us that he is of the view that the settlement 
amount should be treated as damages received on account of "personal physical injury" and 
therefore not to be subject to federal income tax. However, the law on this issue is unclear, which 
means we cannot say with certainty whether the Internal Revenue Service will agree that the 
settlement amount is not taxable. We encourage you to discuss any tax issues with your tax 
accountant or tax attorney. You are also welcome to contact the Law Office of Asher Harris 
concerning the taxability of your settlement. If you want to engage with Mr. Harris directly, please 
contact him at 
You will be solely responsible for the costs of any 
consultation with him. 
Our entire team at Marsh Law was honored to represent you in your pursuit of justice and 
accountability in this case. Although no amount of money can ever undo all the harm that was 
caused by Jeffrey Epstein, we sincerely hope that pursuing this matter and receiving this settlement 
can provide some small measure of recompense and resolution. 
EFTA00037088
--- PAGE 2 ---
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about your settlement. 
Otherwise, this concludes our legal representation of you on this matter. We truly wish you the 
best 
Very truly yours, 
MARSH LAW FIRM PLLC

OK, so I've just spoken to our crime correspondent (lovely guy called Martin Evans). 
Told him the basics, and he thinks it's outrageous. 
We'd like to do it up as a story, if that's OK with you. 
Two things -
1) how do you feel about us saying it was you who rang them? Absolutely no pressure - we can withhold your name if you would like us to. 
2) do you mind my forwarding the audio to him? He's very much someone we can trust. 
He will then ask SY why they are so disinterested in a hugely important case. 
Let me know?

No way, I want this on the record! Publish the whole thing if you have to. 
The British public deserve to know the truth and what to do if they are ever raped or trafficked outside the UK or at least should know the procedure.

Claims Administrator and Class Members. It also refers to a conflict with Class Counsel, claiming 
without substantiation that Class Counsel "has maintained personal and professional relationships 
with Epstein's known associates with inadequate disclosure about the nature and scope of those 
relationships including prior law partners." ECF No. 247, at 6. Ms.

Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 248-1 Filed 10/23/23 Page 1 of 5

Hand Delivery 
Honorable Jed S: Rakoff 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse 
500 Pearl Street 
Room 1340 
New York, NY 10007 
Re: Doe v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 1:22-CV-10019 (S.D.N.Y.) 
Dear Judge Rakoff: 
The Attorneys General of New Mexico, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, the 
District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, and Vermont write concerning the proposed settlement in Doe v. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 1:22-CV-10019 (S.D.N.Y.) because it contains language that 
purports to release state Attorney General parens patriae claims under Section 1595(d) of the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act ("TVPA") for damages on behalf of trafficking victims. 
The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 requires that settlement defendants in a class 
action serve notice of the settlement on the appropriate state officials, thereby giving them an 
opportunity to review and respond to the settlement prior to its approval. The legislative history 
of CAFA establishes "that notice of class action settlements be sent to appropriate state and 
federal officials ... so that they may voice concerns if they believe that the class action settlement 
is not in the best interests of their citizens." S. REP. 109-14, 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 6. Case law 
also recognizes this role of state Attorneys General. See, e.g., Figueroa v. Sharper Image Corp., 
517 F. Supp. 2d 1292, 1301 n.9 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (noting role of Attorneys General in class 
settlement approval process); True v. American Honda Motor Co., 749 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1082 
(C.D. Cal. 2010) (discussing views of state Attorneys General with respect to class action 
settlement grounded in products liability claims). Since the passage of the Act, state Attorneys 
General have successfully objected to or brought about the modification of settlements which 
were unfair to its citizens. 
Section 1595(d) gives state Attorneys General authority, as parens patriae, to civilly 
prosecute persons who engage in sex-trafficking as set forth in Section 1591 of the TVPA and 
to obtain appropriate relief. The undersigned have reviewed the proposed settlement agreement 
in this case and have significant concerns about the potentially precedential scope of the release in 
Section 1.25, which the New Mexico Attorney General's Office raised with counsel for JPMorgan. 
While the issue is now mooted as to the U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General by its parallel 
settlement with JPMorgan, allowing such a broad release of claims may have serious implications 
for future cases brought by state law enforcement against perpetrators of sex-trafficking under the 
TVPA. 
Section 1.25 releases claims 
EFTA00037104
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 248-1 Filed 10/23/23 Page 2 of 5 
that could be brought to recover damages from the Released Defendant Parties on 
behalf of a Member of the Class by any other party, including any sovereign or 
government, relating to or arising from any Member of the Class's harm, injury, 
abuse, exploitation, or trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein or by any person who is in any 
way connected to or otherwise associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as well as any right 
to recovery on account thereof. (Emphasis added.) 
The Doe settlement with Deutsche Bank, by contrast, does not contain the same language releasing 
"any sovereign or government" claims.' 
In adding Section 1595(d) to the civil remedy section of the TVPA, which previously only 
explicitly recognized victim suits, Congress intended to "unleash" the power of state law 
enforcement to prosecute these heinous sex-trafficking crimes, recognizing that, in many 
circumstances, victims are unable or unwilling to come forward and "more prosecutors," "more 
investigators," and "more resources" are needed to "address this growing problem throughout our 
country." 164 Cong. Rec. S1849-08, 2018 WL 1415914, at *S1864. "This amendment is needed 
in order to give enhanced powers to State attorneys general that they can provide the extra litigation 
leverage for individuals who are impacted in a devastating manner." 164 Cong. Rec. H1290-02, 
2018 WL 1073890, at *H1303. If broad releases of non-party state Attorneys General law 
enforcement actions under the TVPA seeking victim-specific relief were deemed permissible 
without their express consent, state Attorneys General may be deterred from bringing these 
important civil law enforcement actions in the future — upsetting Congress' very purpose in 
amending the TVPA to add state law enforcement. 
States have frequently been allowed to sue in parens patriae to enforce federal statutes, 
both at common law, see, e.g., Snapp, 458 U.S. 592 (Puerto Rico had standing to sue in parens 
patriae under the Wagner-Peyser Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act on behalf of its

States may seek damages for residents within their authority as parens patriae. See New 
York by Abrams v. General Motors Corp., 547 F Supp at 706-07 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) ("The State's

Courts outside the Second Circuit agree. See Illinois v. AU Optronics Corp., 794 F. Supp. 
2d 845, 853 (ND. 111. 2011) ("As many courts have held, a State is not automatically rendered a 
nominal party when it seeks both broad injunctive relief and monetary damages for injured 
residents") (emphasis in original); id. at 858 (Attorney General enforcement action against 
violators, including "to pursue relief on behalf of aggrieved individuals ...is more analogous to 
the role of the EEOC or other regulator when it brings an action on behalf of a large group of 
employees or a segment of the public"); In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 2011 WL 
560693, at *5 (ND. Cal. Feb. 15, 2011) ("The damages that California seeks, while on behalf of 
its consumers, would first be paid to the State and distributed on an equitable basis. The fact that 
private parties may benefit from the States' actions does not negate the State's substantial interests 
in these cases."); New Mexico by Balderas v. Real Estate Law Ctr., P.C., 430 F. Supp. 3d 761, 875 
(D.N.M. 2019) ("New Mexico has authority to bring the suit parens patriae and to seek restitution 
for [aggrieved individuals]"); West Virginia by McGraw v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 842 F. Supp. 
2d 984, 989 (S.D. W.Va. 2012) ("A state may have a quasi-sovereign interest in bringing an action 
to enforce its laws, disgorge the proceeds of ill-gotten gains, and refund them to its citizens."). 
Federal appeals courts have consistently held that private parties lack the authority to 
release a government's claims for relief to vindicate sovereign or quasi-sovereign interests 
belonging to the state or government. See Sec 'y United States Dept Lab. v. Kwasny, 853 F.3d 87, 
90, 95-96 (3d Cir. 2017) (private judgment does not preclude subsequent enforcement action by 
the Secretary of Labor for recovery of damages implicated in the prior judgment; the government's

than the interests of private litigations"); US. Commodity Future Trading Comm 'n v. Kratville, 
796 F.3d 873, 889 (8th Cir. 2015) ("quite apart from whether the individual victims are satisfied 
with their private settlements, full and ample restitution [and] disgorgement of profits, serve

600); Snapp, 458 U.S. at 602 (distinguishing quasi-sovereign interest from where a State attempts

Kerr-McGee Chem. Corp. v. Hartigan, 816 F.2d 1177, 1181 n.4 (7th Cir. 1989) (state attorney 
general was not bound by private litigation, "to assume that private individuals can be properly 
viewed as representative of a particular government is a ... daring analytical leap"); see also Beck 
v. Levering, 947 F.2d 639, 642 (2d Cir. 1991) (resjudicata does not prohibit Secretary of Labor 
"from recovering monetary relief that duplicates the relief granted in the prior action"). 
In New York by Cuomo v. Coventry First LLC, the court held that the arbitration agreement 
between defendants and their alleged victims "does not bar the [New York] Attorney General from 
pursuing victim-specific judicial relief [including damages] in his enforcement action." 13 N.Y. 
3d 108, 112, 114 (2009). "Like the EEOC, the Attorney General should not be limited, in his duty 
to protect the public interest, by an [] agreement he did not join. Such an arrangement between 
private parties cannot alter the Attorney General's statutory role or the remedies that he is 
empowered to seek." Id. at 14? 
The undersigned do not object to any other aspect of the Doe settlement and believe that 
Jeffrey Epstein's surviving victims should be fully compensated for the profound ham they have 
suffered. However, as it now stands, the settlement agreement improperly seeks to release States' 
parens patriae claims for victim-specific relief and should be amended to make clear that such 
claims are not released. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Ratil Torrez 
New Mexico Attorney General 
Any damages recovered in a state law enforcement case under the TVPA would only add to, not 
undo, any victims' recovery, and would protect absent non-responding class members whose 
claims may otherwise be released by a settlement. Further, to the extent that the state Attorneys 
General obtain victim-specific relief, including damages or restitution, courts can set off the 
amounts paid to class members against any recovery by the state attorneys general. See EEOC v. 
Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 295a96 (2002) (EEOC could not obtain double recovery based 
on prior settlement and acknowledging prior private settlement amounts would be offset from 
government recovery); Beck, 947 F.2d at 642 (same). The possibility of a post-judgment setoff of 
damages in a state's case does not support a wholesale release of the state's claim for that relief.

Consolidated Case No.: 1:22-CV-10019 (JSR) 
CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT 
OBJECTIONS TO PROPOSED SETTLEMENT 
INCLUDING NOTICE OF INTENT TO APPEAR AT FAIRNESS HEARING 
Class Member 
by and through her attorneys of record, Marsh Law Firm 
PLLC, hereby makes the following objections to the Settlement of this Litigation, in accordance 
with the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulation of Settlement dated June 22, 2023 
(the "Stipulation"). The objections stated herein apply to the Objector individually as well as to a 
particular subset of the putative class members.' 
Pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ("FRCP"), the Court may 
approve a proposal only upon a finding that it is "fair, reasonable, and adequate." As set forth 
herein, Objector objects to the terms of the Stipulation as failing to satisfy the requirements of 
FRCP Rule 23 and therefore, the proposed Stipulation should be rejected. In tv Michael Milken 
& Assocs. Sec. Litig., 150 F.R.D. 57, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) ("[t]he ultimate test for the exercise of 
Objector hereby incorporates by reference herein the Objections set forth in Jane Doe #7's 
Objections (Dkt. 218). 
EFTA00037109
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 2 of 9 
the Court's discretion in approving a settlement of a class action pursuant to Rule 23 is whether 
the settlement, taken as a whole, is fair, adequate, and reasonable"). 
OBJECTOR'S STATUS AS A CLASS MEMBER 
Objector is a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") and qualifies as a Class Member of 
the preliminarily certified class with standing to object to the proposed Stipulation as provided in 
the Stipulation and Notice in this case. Before, during, and after the relevant time period defining 
the Class, Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their associates sexually abused and trafficked 
Objector and forced, coerced, and defrauded her into engaging in a myriad of sexually explicit 
acts. As a result, Objector has suffered grievous psychological harm including depression, 
anxiety, fatigue, flashbacks, cold sweats, terror, indescribable pain, and far more. The injuries 
Objector has suffered as a result of the abuse, trafficking, threats, deception, and aftermath will 
last throughout her entire life. 
As detailed in her Declaration, Objector objects to the terms of the Stipulation as being 
unfair, unreasonable, and inadequate to provide the Class Members with relief for the 
inexplicable and irreparable emotional, psychological, physical, and financial harms they have 
suffered. In support of her objections, Objector submits the accompanying Declaration of 
Objector/Class Member 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND RELEVANT FACTS 
On June 29, 2023, this Court granted preliminary approval of the proposed Settlement of 
the Litigation and Stipulation to "resolve the claims of all persons who were harmed, injured, 
exploited, or abused by Jeffrey Epstein, or by any person who is connected to or otherwise 
associated with Jeffrey Epstein or any Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking venture, between January 1, 
1998, and through August 10, 2019, inclusive" in the action entitled Jane Doe 1 v. JPMoigan 
EFTA00037110
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 3 of 9 
Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 1:22-CV-10019 (JSR) ("JPMorgan Action") (Dkt. No. 182). A 
Settlement Hearing was scheduled for November 9, 2023, to "determine whether the proposed 
Settlement of the litigation on the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulation is fair, 
reasonable, and adequate to the Class and should be approved by the Court." (Dkt. No. 182, ¶3). 
The Court further stated that "[a]ny Class Member may appear at the Settlement Hearing and 
object is she has any reason why the proposed Settlement of the Litigation should not be 
approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate...provided that such Class Member" file written 
objections with the Court on or before October 19, 2023. (Dkt. 182, ¶17). Accordingly, Objector 
raises the objections outlined herein as to why the Settlement and Stipulation should be denied. 
Finally, this Court instructed that although attendance at the Settlement Hearing is "not 
necessary," if a Class Member or person wishes "to be heard orally in opposition to the approval 
of the Settlement," they are "required to indicate in their written objection their intention to appear 
at the hearing." (Dkt. 182, ¶17). Objector hereby indicates her intent to appear (virtually) at the 
Settlement Hearing in the JPMorgan Action scheduled for November 9, 2023, and respectfully 
requests that she be heard orally by this Court during the Settlement Hearing on her opposition to 
the Settlement of the Litigation and Stipulation.2
OBJECTIONS 
FRCP Rule 23 "requires judicial approval for any class action settlement." In re GSE 
Bonds Antitrust Litig., 414 F. Supp. 3d 686, 691 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). To approve a settlement, "the 
Court must find that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate." Id.; In /V Initial Pub. Offering Sec. 
Objector requests that she be permitted to (i) attend the Settlement Hearing virtually and (ii) be 
heard orally on her Objections to the Settlement of the Litigation and Stipulation. Objector 
hereby includes a letter from the undersigned to the Honorable Jed R. Rakoff on application to 
appear virtually and be heard orally at the Settlement Hearing. 
EFTA00037111

Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 4 of 9 
Litig., 243 F.R.D. 79, 83 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) ("[u]nlike settlements in ordinary suits, the settlement 
of a class action must be approved by the court. The court owes a duty to class members to 
ensure that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate"). The proposed Settlement 
and Stipulation at issue should be rejected because it fails to meet the requirements of approval 
set forth under Rule 23. 
First, the Plan of Allocation provides insufficient information regarding how the 
settlement funds will be allocated and the size of the potential awards. Geiss v. Weinstein Co. 
Holdings LLC, 474 F. Supp. 3d 628, 637 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (denying the proposed settlement 
because the proposal provided insufficient information as to the "size of the potential awards" 
and "how the funds would be allocated"). For example, the Plan of Allocation provides that 
"[t]he Claims Administrator...shall determine a Class Member's assigned settlement amount (the 
"Allocated Amount"), from the Global Settlement Amount," and shall consider certain factors in 
making her determination including, the Class Members' questionnaires and releases and the 
supporting documentation thereto and the circumstances giving rise to the alleged harms. (Dkt. 
181-2). The Plan of Allocation leaves the determination of individuals' settlement amounts 
entirely up to the Claims Administrator's discretion without providing clear guidelines as to how 
the Claims Administrator's assessment will be carried out or the amounts that will be assigned 
based on injury. Allocating funds in this way is completely arbitrary, unfair, unreasonable, and 
inadequate to benefit the Class Members. 
In Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, the court denied the proposed settlement, in part, 
due to the "underdeveloped guidelines" of the proposal which were "likely to lead to arbitrary 
awards for claimants." 474 F. Supp. 3d 628, 636 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). The court stated that "in 
assessing the adequacy of relief," it must consider "the effectiveness of any proposed method of 
EFTA00037112
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 5 of 9 
distributing relief to the class, including the method of processing class-member claims." Id. 
There, the court found that "critical considerations as to the availability and scope of recovery 
[were] delegated to a non-judicial officer...with insufficient guidelines tested by adversarial 
process and pit-trial discovery." Id. citing Chi v. Univ. of S. Cal., No. 2:18-cv-04258, 2019 WL 
3064457, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2019) (holding that, in a sexual abuse class action, "the 
contemplated authority of the" non-judicial officer "to make all claims determinations in her own 
discretion invites the possibility of arbitrary decision-making and inequitable treatment of class 
members for non-meritorious reasons"). The same holds true here. On that basis, Objector 
objects to the Plan of Allocation. 
Likewise, Objector objects to the Notice of Settlement because it provides insufficient 
information to the Class Members regarding the terms of the proposed settlement and the options 
available to the Class Members. In re PaineWebber Ltd. Partnerships Litig., 171 F.R.D. 104, 124 
(S.D.N.Y.) ("[n]otice of settlement in a class action must fairly apprise the prospective members 
of the class of the terms of the proposed settlement and of the options that are open to them in 
connection with [the] proceedings") (internal quotations omitted). 
Second, the Proposed Cash Award (totaling $290 million) is objected to class wide where 
it does not have any relation to the damages the members of the class have sustained. The 
Proposed Cash Award is insufficient to deter the Defendants from continuing their conduct of 
facilitating crimes that target the class and provides inadequate benefit to the class given the 
severe damages the Class Members have sustained. In re Subway Footlong Sandwich Mktg. & 
Sales Practices Litig., 869 F.3d 551, 556-557 (7th Cir. Aug. 25, 2017); Polar Intl Brokerage 
Corp. v. Reeve, 187 F.R.D. 108, 114 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (finding that the proposed settlement was 
"virtually worthless" because the class members were obtaining nothing more than 
EFTA00037113
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 6 of 9 
"reassurance"). In determining whether to approve a proposed settlement, the Court must "ensure 
that the class gets the best settlement possible" and if the settlement is found unfair because the 
class members will receive nothing of value, then "class members are better off retaining their 
legal rights to maintain suit rather than accepting the settlement." Id. 
The proposed claim values and limitations were apparently devised under an agreement 
that was not based on any reasonable or fair assessment of the individual Class Members' 
damages or class wide expectations of settlement. Accordingly, Objector objects to the Proposed 
Cash Award and requests that she and the other Class Members be afforded the opportunity to 
retain their legal rights to pursue litigation against the Defendants. 
Third, neither Class Counsel nor the Claims Administrator have been questioned about 
potential conflicts of interest with the Class Members and other related individuals and entities. 
In this case, the parties were not afforded the benefit of full and meaningful discovery before a 
proposed settlement was reached. Nor were the Class Members consulted concerning 
appointment of the Claims Administrator. If discovery had been fully conducted and completed, 
any potential relevant conflicts of interest would have become apparent. Class Counsel has 
participated in numerous prior actual or contemplated litigation against Epstein and his 
associates and various past and present claimants some of whom have conflicts of interest 
between and amongst themselves. Similarly, Class Counsel has maintained personal and 
professional relationships with Epstein's known associates with inadequate disclosure about the 
nature and scope of those relationships including prior law partners. Given the foregoing, it is 
debatable whether the proposed Settlement and Stipulation were negotiated and agreed upon 
with the best interests of the Class Members in mind. In class actions such as this one, "a 
searching judicial inquiry is required" prior to approving a proposed settlement "since the 
EFTA00037114
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 7 of 9 
settlement will bind those who had not had their day in court." Han v. BHH, LLC, 334 F.R.D. 74, 
(S.D.N.Y. 2020). 
Objector objects to the Class Counsel and Claims Administrator and respectfully requests 
that the Court deny the proposed Settlement and Stipulation and allow the Class Members to 
proceed with discovery and litigation in pursuit of fair, reasonable, and adequate compensation. 
Reynolds v. Beneficial Nat'l Bank, 288 F.3d 277, 284 (7th Cir. 2002) (declining the proposed 
settlement and disqualifying class counsel because the evidence demonstrated that class counsel 
attempted to settle the action without first undertaking sufficient discovery to estimate class 
damages). To approve the Settlement and Stipulation at this juncture would be in direct 
contravention of the Court's duty to conduct a searching judicial inquiry into the conflict of 
interests that exist in this action. In re Iconix Brand Group, Inc., No. 1:15-CV-04860-PGG, 2020 
WL 6784181, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 18, 2020) (noting that where a conflict of interest exists, the 
Court is under an obligation "to exercise the highest degree of vigilance in scrutinizing proposed 
settlements of class actions"). 
Fourth, the Class Counsel, Claims Administrator, Class Representative fees are excessive 
and should be denied. "In a class-action settlement, courts must carefully scrutinize lead 
counsel's application for attorneys' fees to ensure that the interests of class members are not 
subordinated to the interests of...class counsel." Hart v. Nig LLC, 334 F.R.D. 74, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 
2020). "Attorneys fees' are awarded at the discretion of the court." Id. Similarly, with respect to 
the Class Representative, any proposed settlement should be "commensurate with the work, 
time, and effort the class representative spent on the case including their emotional investment, 
the risk of retaliation, and any strain it may have put on their family or personal life." Ridgeway 
v. Walmart Inc., 269 F. Supp. 3d 975, 1003 (N.D. Cal. 2017). 
EFTA00037115
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 8 of 9 
Here, Class Counsel is requesting thirty percent of the Global Settlement Amount phrs 
costs, charges, and expenses not to exceed $2,500,000, plus interest earned on both amounts. The 
Claims Administrator's fees and the Class Representative's fees will also be deducted from the 
Global Settlement Amount at the discretion of the Court. It is concerning that Class Counsel is 
requesting such a hefty amount of fees without knowing the total recovery for each individual 
class member. Cooks v. TNG GP, No. 2:16-CV-01160-KJM-AC, 2020 WL 5535397, at *8 (E.D. 
Cal. Sept. 15, 2020) ("[a] disproportionate award to counsel is a subtle sign that class counsel 
have allowed pursuit of their own self-interests and that of certain class members to infect the 
negotiations"). 
With respect to the Class Representative, although Objector agrees that the representative 
should be fairly compensated for taking on such an important job, the amount awarded to the 
Class Representative should not be deducted from the Global Settlement. Rather, the amount 
awarded to Jane Doe 1 should be capped and deducted from the attorneys' fees. Here, Jane Doe 1 
is not the only victim that invested substantial time, effort, and emotion into this matter. In order 
to demonstrate she is entitled to receive a portion of the Settlement Fund, the Objector (and 
many other Class Members) are required by the Plan of Allocation to submit a questionnaire and 
release detailing the abuse and trafficking they experienced as part of the Epstein sex trafficking 
enterprise. In doing so, Objector also expended much time and effort and was required to become 
emotionally involved in yet another action against Epstein and re-live the traumatic events giving 
rise to the harms alleged herein. Not only does the foregoing represent a personally challenging 
process "contrived to discourage claims," but it also demonstrates that the Class Representative 
should not be entitled to a fee from the Class Members' Global Settlement. Gascho v. Glob. 
Fitness Holdings, LLC, 822 F.3d 269, 287 (6th Cir. 2016). Objector objects to the Class 
EFTA00037116
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 247 Filed 10/19/23 Page 9 of 9 
Representative's fee because it should not be deducted from the Global Settlement that Objector 
(and so many others) so rightfully deserve. 
Likewise, the Claims Administrator's fee should not be deducted from the Global 
Settlement. The fee for claims administration should be deducted from the attorneys' fees and 
capped at a limited percentage. On this basis, Objector objects to the fees for Class Counsel, 
Class Administrator, and Class Representative. 
CONCLUSION 
Given the foregoing, the Objector objects to the Settlement and Stipulation in its entirety 
as being unfair, unreasonable, and inadequate in direct contravention of FRCP Rule 23 and 
applicable law. Accordingly, the proposed Settlement of the Litigation and Stipulation should be 
denied, and this Court should permit litigation to proceed against the Defendants.

HILLARY M. NAPPI, ESQ. 
Hillary M. Nappi is a Partner at Hach Rose Schirripa & Cheverie LLP and practices in complex 
civil litigation. Ms. Nappi has been selected by Super Lawyers as Metro Rising Star in civil 
litigation from 2018 through 2022. 
Ms. Nappi leads the firm's Victims' Rights practice group and provides a trauma-informed 
approach to all of our clients. She is litigating hundreds of cases on behalf of survivors of 
sexual abuse and assault against several institutions - both public and private - in the wake of 
the passage of New York and New Jersey's revival statutes allowing once time-barred claims to 
be heard. Ms. Nappi has successfully resolved these sexual abuse cases prior to trial, 
resulting in millions of dollars in recovery for survivors. Ms. Nappi is also representing 
plaintiffs across the county in §1983 actions and has secured recoveries as a result of their 
discrimination. 
Prior to joining the Firm, Ms. Nappi spent nine years working at the law offices of Boies 
Schiller & Flexner LLP. While in law school, Ms. Nappi worked as a legal assistant/paralegal to 
the firm's Chairman, David Boies. After her admission to the bar, Ms. Nappi was promoted to 
Staff Attorney. As a Staff Attorney, Ms. Nappi was on the trial team assigned to work on Starr 
International v. The United States, No. 1:11-cv-00779-TCW. At the time, the case was the largest 
ever filed against the United States Government, alleging that the Government's acquisition of 
AIG equity and subsequent actions relating to a reverse stock split were unlawful. Ms. Nappi

I have the right to legal representation to which you are 
denying me. I also have a right to freedom of speech. 
I invoke article 51 and would like to be referred to a human
