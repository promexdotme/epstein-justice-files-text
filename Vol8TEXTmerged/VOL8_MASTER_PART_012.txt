Hey Chiefs, 
They sent us the rest of their redline, if you'd like to take a look. 
I've also attached a partial set of responses. I'll get you the rest ASAP tomorrow, but we're tight on timing, so here's about 
half of it now. Two points about it: 
1. I wasn't sure whether you wanted to see every change, so I've put comment bubbles even where I think we should 
just accept the changes. 
2. In their new redline as of tonight, they are proposing to do each count in order. We won't have time to implement 
that by tomorrow, but we should think about whether to keep it as is or agree to their proposal. 
This is due today (Wednesday), and the defense has significantly blow their deadline to get this to us. If it would help, we 
can seek an extension on that basis. 
Last, as you can see, they insist on putting our victims' names in filings. We are thinking of proposing to the defense that 
they just note in a footnote their continued objection but stop using the names. Otherwise, we'd like to talk about going 
to the Court. Their practice is (1) burdensome to make us redact all their filings, and (2) an invitation for us to miss 
something and out a victim. 
Thanks,

Attached is the full redline of the RTCs. I made some changes to the sections I already sent you. Those are highlighted in 
yellow. I will send you the verdict sheet later tonight. 
Regarding the "Minor-Victim" terminology, I know the redactions are a pain, but it is still our position that there is no 
need to anonymize them and we object to calling them both "minors" and "victims." So I can't agree to that. 
Thanks,

Hi Chris, 
Just checking in on when you think you might have the rest of the RTC over to us. 
Also, do you have any objection if we edit the places where your redline uses victim names to the "Minor Victim-X" 
terminology? Our understanding is that we have to file this on ECF, and we just want to avoid having to redact anything. 
Thanks,

Counsel, 
We're preparing a new version of the proposed redactions to the MILs that withdraw some of our proposals. Please let 
us know which if any of your proposed redactions you would like to withdraw, and whether you would like to see our 
version before we send it to the Court. In particular, please let us know by Thursday at 10 a.m. so we have some time

First, I wanted to send along the defense's expert disclosure for your review. We can discuss tomorrow. 
On travel arrangements, I have consulted with others internally and can approve the purchase of a business class ticket if 
nothing else is available. You should attach this email to your Amtrak tickets when you submit for reimbursement.

Hello 
Thank you - these rates are fine for the hotel, but in order to stay within the rate limit, I need to book a non-
refundable rate. Please confirm the dates you would like me to be in NY next week as well as what dates you 
anticipate working together for trial prep after the hearing (Thurs/Fri vs Fri/Sat). I need to move patients and would 
like to know when to schedule them (either Thursday or Saturday). Finally, I will book myself on Amtrak, but for 
many of the times, the only available options are business class seats - the coach seats are already sold out.

Hi Mark - Thanks for reaching out. We do have an active investigation and would be happy to talk. As you likely know, 
today is a holiday in the US. Is this something we could discuss on Monday or is it more urgent than that? Thanks, Ted

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYC024323 and NYC024324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYC024336 and NYC024337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYC024339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYC024340) 
EFTA00030665
--- PAGE 2 ---
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that 
might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
thanks very much,

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will

Subject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents 
Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Subject: Re: Epstein search warrant documents 
Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing

In terms of data transfer, 
are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on 
our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been 
processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one device to 
make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

Hello

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason.

I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
EFTA00030675
--- PAGE 12 ---
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Michael, 
Thanks for checking in, and we hope you're doing well these days. Given the lack of significant change in terms of health 
and safety issues over the past few months since we last were in touch, we are fine to continue to hold in abeyance our 
discussion with MEN 
We continue to appreciate her willingness to speak with us, and the delay will not prejudice 
her at all. Should it still be impracticable to meet in person in another month or two, we may circle back on the possibility 
of a videoconference or phone discussion, but in the interim we have no issue with remaining on hold. 
Please don't hesitate to be in touch if there are any questions or issues, or if another substantial period of time has gone 
by and we haven't connected, and thanks again for being in touch.

Sure, and given that timing I actually think it would be helpful to schedule two meetings, so we can be on track to get

Michael, 
Wanted to get back to you, as promised — as we indicated previously, the attorney proffers we've received from you 
haven't caused us to change our view of Ms. 
status, and I think you've generally addressed the initial and 
follow-up questions we've had. I think from our perspective the next step would be to have a conversation with 
Ms.= directly, and to cover with her the same topics that we've addressed with you. Ordinarily we would 
approach a discussion like that simply by going chronologically, and asking follow-up questions as appropriate along 
the way, but as I've mentioned to you previously, if it would be useful to proceed in a different format, or to focus 
(or avoid) specific topics in a first meeting, I think we would generally be amenable to that. And of course as we've 
also discussed, any discussion would be completely voluntary—not just the interview overall, but any specific topic 
or question that she wanted to pass on, or discuss with you in the moment, etc., would be totally up to her. Please 
let us know what you think? We're also happy to chat via phone if that would be helpful as well.

Got it -- I had that down as London, rather than Paris, so that's helpful. And I should say, these questions aren't 
immediately time-sensitive, I just didn't want to forget to ask, since I'm reviewing the notes now.

Hi

with her husband on one occasion. I will get back to you on Monday or Tuesday regarding the other

Michael, 
Following up on our meeting, one additional question / clarification we have from reviewing our notes is about 
whether Ms 
ever visited certain Epstein properties other than his New York mansion and the brief visit to 
the Palm Beach residence. I apologize if you addressed that and I missed it, but we wanted to add it to the list of

additional questions — in particular, whether she ever visited the New Mexico ranch, the Little St. James Island, 
the Great St. James island, and/or the Paris residence. Also, is it correct that she just visited the Palm Beach 
residence the one time you referenced? It's not a problem or issue if she visited any of those other locations, we 
just wanted to clarify one way or the other. And happy to discuss via phone if that's useful.

We do understand that your attorney proffer today will be preliminary, and to the best of your client's current 
recollection and to the best of your current understanding, and without, e.g., having been provided documents or 
other materials by the Government. 
We also confirm that your statements will be considered to be made pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 410 and Fed. R. 
Crim. P. 11(f), and therefore under those protections. Regarding Rule 408, we'll just note what we have for other 
counsel in this case and others who have made similar statements or submissions, which is that we don't take any 
position on the effect or application of Rule 408 in a prospective or hypothetical dispute in civil litigation, because 
it doesn't implicate any rights the Government would or would not have, but you can consider us advised that 
your position is that your statements are also covered under 408. (While our Office itself can't guarantee the 
protections of Rule 408 because any dispute on that issue would be beyond our purview, we are also not taking 
the position that we believe it does not apply.)

Case Name: 
USA v. Maxwell 
Case Number: 
I :20-cr-00330-AJN 
Filer: 
Document Number:92 
Docket Text: 
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC 
legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 
letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant responded to the MDC legal 
counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden 
Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's 
conditions of confinement. See Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, 
along with the MDC legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's 
request to summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves 
Dkt. No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall 
continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of 
Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, 
including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The 
updates shall also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. The 
Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 days. 
Furthermore, the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant 
continues to receive adequate access to
. legal materials and her ability to communicate 
with defense counsel. (Signed by Judge

Mr. Bloxsome, 
Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in 
connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to request

Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law enforcement

Jeff, 
Thank you for this — it's extremely thorough and helpful, especially for an initial description, and we appreciate you 
sending it so promptly. We also appreciate Ms. 
willingness to share this information with us, which is 
obviously very personal but which meaningfully assists our investigation. 
In the first instance, on an initial read, I wanted to advise that this information does not alter our view, which I also 
conveyed via email on December 24, that we do not currently have reason to believe Ms. 
has criminal exposure 
based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions with Epstein. Additionally, I do expect we likely will 
have some follow-up queries; we'll circle back with you in more detail next week, but in the interim I wanted to

current perception as to 
The foregoing is a culmination of a series of interviews with my client and I believe that it represents her

My take away is that there is no doubt that

were other people looking to introduce girls to Epstein. This pattern apparently was ongoing for decades. 
introduction involvement was only in New York and not with minors.

Following up on our phone conversation today, I wanted to memorialize that, as discussed, we do not currently have 
reason to believe Ms. 
has criminal exposure based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions 
with Jeffrey Epstein, and your brief attorney proffer regarding the circumstances of those interactions are consistent with 
that view. In your further discussions with Ms. 
in advance of a further attorney proffer to address the general 
nature of her relationship with Mr. Epstein, as well as his employees or relevant close associates, if you have any concerns 
about additional possible exposure you should please feel free to be in touch with us again. As we also discussed, I 
believe any non-federal offenses would be well outside the relevant statute(s) of limitation, but of course if you wish to 
further research that issue, or consult with criminal counsel, we defer to you entirely. 
Please let us know if any other information would be useful at this stage, and hopefully we can be in touch in the coming 
weeks about productive next steps. 
thank you,

To update you on the wire collection, we anticipate making a production next week. We are trying to confirm now, but we 
believe that there are only five JPMC accounts — two for Epstein and three for Maxwell — for which there is wire data. 
Separately, we also anticipate producing wire data for transactions related to Epstein, Maxwell, and 
where JPMC 
acted as a correspondent bank. 
We are also making progress on collecting other information, including account opening documents, KYC documents, and 
account statements. Per our earlier conversations, we are compiling this information to make a single production rather 
than providing it on a rolling basis. 
Finally, we also understand that JPM National Subpoena Processing heard from 
at the FBI. We called him just 
to say that to the extent he has questions, he can direct them to us. 
Thanks, 
Allison

Anjan, 
Thank you for checking in, and we look forward to receiving the update later this week. Regarding the subpoenas, I think 
there was one subpoena served by the FBI just a day or two before we were first in touch, dated September 3, 2019, 
relating to 
and then it appears we did inadvertently let the FBI serve one after we were in touch with 
you, dated October 8, 2019, relating to 
. If you've received any subpoenas addition to those (other than the 
ones we've already previously discussed), please let us know, and otherwise we certainly will send any additional process 
directly to you—apologies for any inconvenience or confusion caused by the separate service. 
Thanks again, and talk soon.

Hope all is well. We expect to have an update for you later this week on the timing of the wire production and our other 
ongoing collection efforts. On a related note, we learned from JPMorgan's National Subpoena Processing that they 
received a couple subpoenas directly from the FBI, which I assume are related to the same investigation we've been 
discussing. For any additional subpoenas in this investigation directed to JPMorgan, could you please direct them to us? 
That will help us get them to the appropriate team more quickly.

I did not see the signed SHU post orders. They should look like a series of rules and regulations for the post that are 
signed by each officer. They are different from the daily rosters. And we should ask for the daily rosters for the time 
period we are missing.

I'm working though the outstanding requests, specifically those that we sent 
last week. 
The 
Commissary Reports are in the shared here: 
\usa.doj.gov\ clouanys \StAndrewASharealnReEpsteinDeath-2019R01059 \ Evidence Epstein General BOP Records 
Additionally, the records for 
M, and 
(no 
or =) 
are here as well (in the same document). 
However, all they entail is a single truview page and nothing else. The actual receipts are only for Epstein, M, 
and 
Ruga rd. 
What I'm not sure on is the signed SHU post order review sheets. I have looked through the files and can't seem to find 
them anywhere. Albeit I don't know what they look like but I do think I would have recognized them. I will keep looking. 
Lastly, are the post orders for SHU the same as the daily assignment roster? I've attached one of them as an example. If 
so, we are missing several from the time period that we requested (7/1 — 8/10). 
I'm going to continue to work through the spreadsheet as well.

Hi Bruce, 
MCC New York has permitted social visits despite disciplinary sanctions when the visit is specifically for mitigation 
purposes. Disciplinary sanctions notwithstanding, all pretrial inmates have the same access to family communications: 
monitored social visiting, monitored social phone calls, and monitored social mail. While I understand your client is a 
death penalty case, there are many inmates at MCC with very complex cases who have legal decisions they need to 
discuss with their families, and the methods available to them are the three methods I just mentioned. If a social 
phone call is insufficient, then we will raise the issue again with administrators to see if they will allow a social visit 
during your client's regular social visiting hours. However, please be advised that once your client returns to general 
population with regular phone access, I do not anticipate administrators will be amenable to social visit requests unless 
they are being used as mitigation evidence. 
I am out of the office starting tomorrow, but Adam will let you know once he discusses it with Exec staff. 
Thanks,

I am sorry, but that won't be sufficient. We had a conversation with

a few weeks back and they 
told us that, in light of the particular needs for preparation for a capital case, MCC would permit periodic social visits 
as needed. I did not raise this issue with the court because of what we were told. Perhaps I misunderstood.

let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your client for a meeting in

Law enforcement personnel (who may include, in addition to law enforcement officers and

authorized to review the ESI contained on the Subject Device for evidence, fruits, and

minors), and 371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
1. 
Evidence concerning the identity or location of the owner(s) or user(s) of the 
Subject Devices 
2. 
Evidence concerning the identity or location of, and communications with, co-

Attachment A 
I. Items Subject to Search and Seizure 
The Subject Items are particularly described as follows': 
a. 
Two blue binders with CDs, which were seized by Special Agent■ 
from a blue suitcase on or about July 11, 2019 ("Subject Item-1"). 
b. 
Three blue binders with various CDs and one clear binder with a green spine 
with various CDs, all four of which were seized by Special Agent 
from a black 
suitcase on or about July 11, 2019 ("Subject Item-2"). 
II. Review of ESI on the Subject Items 
Law enforcement personnel (who may include, in addition to law enforcement officers and 
agents, attorneys for the government, attorney support staff, agency personnel assisting the 
government in this investigation, and outside technical experts under government control) are 
authorized to review the ESI contained on the Subject Items for evidence, fruits, and 
instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of 
minors), and 371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
1. 
Any documents or communications with or regarding victims or potential victims 
of the Subject Offenses; 
2. 
Any photographs of victims or potential victims of the Subject Offenses; 
3. 
Any nude, partially nude, or sexually suggestive photographs of individuals who 
appear to be teenage girls, or younger; 
4. 
Records, data, or other items that evidence ownership, control, or use of, or access 
to the Subject Items, including, but not limited to access history data, historical location data, 
configuration files, saved usemames and passwords, user profiles, e-mail contacts, and 
photographs; 
5. 
Any child erotica, defined as suggestive visual depictions of nude minors that do 
not constitute child pornography as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). 
' To the extent that the Subject Items contain any removable storage media, including CDs, the 
description of each such item encompasses those other media. 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00030743
--- PAGE 4 ---
In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various techniques to 
determine which files or other ESI contain evidence or fruits of the Subject Offenses. Such 
techniques may include, for example: 
• 
surveying directories or folders and the individual files they contain (analogous to 
looking at the outside of a file cabinet for the markings it contains and opening a drawer 
believed to contain pertinent files); 
• 
conducting a file-by-file review by "opening" or reading the first few "pages" of such 
files in order to determine their precise contents (analogous to performing a cursory 
examination of each document in a file cabinet to determine its relevance); 
• 
"scanning" storage areas to discover and possibly recover recently deleted data or 
deliberately hidden files; and 
• 
performing electronic keyword searches through all electronic storage areas to 
determine the existence and location of data potentially related to the subject matter of 
the investigation; and 
• 
reviewing metadata, system information, configuration files, registry data, and any 
other information reflecting how, when, and by whom the computer was used. 
Law enforcement personnel will make reasonable efforts to search only for files, 
documents, or other electronically stored information within the categories identified in Section II 
of this Attachment. However, law enforcement personnel are authorized to conduct a complete 
review of all the ESI from seized devices or storage media if necessary to evaluate its contents and 
to locate all data responsive to the warrant.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and

Notice of Electronic Filing 
The following transaction was entered on 12/8/2020 at 12:02 PM EST and filed on 12/8/2020 
Case Name: 
USA v. Maxwell 
Case Number: 
1:20-cr-00330-AJN 
Filer: 
Document Number: 92 
Docket Text: 
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC 
legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 
letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant responded to the MDC legal 
counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden 
Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's 
conditions of confinement. See Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, 
along with the MDC legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's 
request to summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves 
Dkt. No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall 
continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of 
Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, including 
legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The updates shall 
also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby 
ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the 
Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant continues to receive 
adequate access to her legal materials and her ability to communicate with defense counsel.

We are thinking that photos of GM/JE (the iconic one of them together) and the locations where the abuse happened

From:

Subject: Re: FW: Requests 
All, 
I hope my responses below serve to clear up some of the issues you had with the documentation that was provided. I 
continue to work to obtain the missing items and will send them as I receive any additional documents. Please let me 
know if you have further questions and I'll be happy to address anything that is still unclear. 
Many of the requests made, such as ICT agenda, cellmate policies and SHU policies are not one-stop-shops. 
These issues are covered in a number of different policies, therefore I tried to include all policies that 
reference those topics. 
1. We received unsigned Word versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13. Are there finalized versions? 
Executive Assistant Lee Plourde handles the finalizing of the supplements. He's on leave and will 
address this upon his return on Monday, June 29, 2020. 
2. Why were we given the BOP Correctional Services Procedures Manual? Which of our requests is this responsive 
to? Section 310 of this policy covers inmate accountability in the SHU. You requested 5511.08 and 
this section in the CSPM overlaps some of those same policies. 
3. Why were we given the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Statement? Which of our requests is this responsive to? 
This policy covers staff training requirements for ICT and Quarterly SHU training. I included the 
policy because it directly correlated with other requests. 
4. We were also given a Powerpoint entitled Suicide Prevention for Inmates. Which of our requests is this responsive 
to? When is this document from? The slide show is the Psychology portion of the SHU Training you 
requested. It is dated 1/2/2014. I have requested an updated version that would have been used 
more closely to the time of 
assignment to SHU. I'm just waiting for Psychology staff to 
provide me whatever it is they used at that time. 
5. We were provided a document titled Introduction to Correctional Techniques from January 2020. Which of our 
requests is this responsive to? Is it the MCC institutional familiarization training outline? If so, we would request 
one from a time when the defendants were actively employed at MCC (so before August 2019). This is the 
Institutional Familiarization (IF) outline you requested. It hasn't been called IF for a few years. It 
is now Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT). An earlier version is attached here. 
6. We were provided with an undated slide presentation about the MCC SHU. Which of our requests is this 
responsive to? When is this document from? The slide show was created 1/2/2014 as a part of 
quarterly SHU training. The quarterly SHU training is primarily conducted through the BOP's online 
training platform that is a self-guided course that covers a number of topics related to SHU. The 
official SHU training course is not something I can send or save due to the nature of the course 
being automated by the training platform and not a hard file. 
7. The BOP Code of Ethics is highlighted below. Which document is this? Program Statement 3420.11 is the 
Standards of Employee Conduct, which covers the dos and don'ts of employment in the BOP. I've 
attached the DO) Ethics Handbook here. If there is something specific you're looking for, please let 
me know. 
8. We received digital lieutenant's logs. Is there also a hard copy book? There is no hard copy book of these 
logs. The logs are saved to a shared folder at the end of each shift. Although I have worked at 
EFTA00030777
--- PAGE 2 ---
places that print each log, the Lieutenant's here at NYM reported that that is not the practice here. 
The LTs here email their logs to the executive staff at the conclusion of each 24 hour period for 
review purposes. Thus, eliminating a hard copy record system. 
9. We were provided with a document called "SHU Logs MW" and a document called "SHU Logs." Can we confirm 
what these are? Our requests were for SHU Watch Call Logs and SHU Control Center Logs. Those are the 
digital log books from SHU for the Evening and Morning Watch shifts during the requested time 
period. I am working on obtaining the actual Watch Call tracking sheets from the main Control 
Center at MCC which is something different. However, the officer should be logging their watch 
calls into the digital log book every 30 minutes between 6a — 6p each day. 
10. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on SHU quarterly training, which is highlighted below as 
having been provided? PS 5270.11 as well as the Suicide Prevention policy covers the SHU quarterly 
training requirement. There is not a separate policy for that. 
11. We asked for P.S. 5270.10, but got P.S. 5270.11. Was P.S. 5270.10 provided to us in error? Or was our request 
incorrect? 5270.10 does not exist. 5270.11 is the policy covering SHU. 
12. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on cellmates? I am not aware of any such policy and 
have struggled to find even a mention of it in the policies I've reviewed. I will continue to search 
for a policy that references cellmate assignments. 
13. In the second email, there is a document called "Hot Lists" dated August 30, 2019. Which of our requests is this 
responsive to? The "Hot List" is the high risk list. Any inmate on that list who goes to SHU requires 
immediate notification to Psychology. This is the only "high risk" list the BOP has and I provided it 
in response to your request for "All High Risk Lists reviewed during weekly SHU meetings..." 
14. In the second email, Cody mentioned that most of the control center paperwork was seized by FBI and/or 01G. 
Do you or FBI have that paperwork? Has it been provided to us? 
15. Finally, what is the status of the remaining requests? As I continue to work from home, I have not 
personally been able to physically search for the Watch Call sheets. As I previously mentioned, 
those logs were reportedly seized early on in this investigation. I continue to follow up on this. 
With regard to the SROs, those reviews are only electronically available for inmates who are 
currently in SHU and only for the period of their most recent admission to SHU. SROs, assuming 
they were completed, would then be printed and filed in the inmate's central file. I am currently 
trying to figure out where Epstein's file is to see if any SROs are in it. If you really want ALL SROs 
for the period of 
assignment to SHU, that will be an extremely lengthy process of tracking 
down inmate files, many of whom have released from the BOP or been transferred to any number 
of institutions across the country, and then requesting any SROs from the specified period of time 
that are contained in those files be scanned to us. I'm guessing Epstein's file was taken along with 
all of the other documentation shortly after his death, but I have not confirmed that yet.

Subject: DO.1 ongoing Investigation. 
Dear 
; Jennifer Richardson O; 
We and the Duke of York set out to assist your investigation when the DOJ asked for his help in January 2020. 
However, we regret to say that we have reached the conclusion that the DOJ's dealings with the Duke of York 
have not been designed to seek his assistance in investigating and prosecuting the targets of the investigation but 
instead have been used only to gather publicity for Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York. 
EFTA00030799
--- PAGE 3 ---
It is essential, if justice is to be done for Epstein's victims, that a proper and thorough criminal investigation is 
carried out. Although the public record indicates your office (SDNY) has been actively investigating Mr. Epstein 
and other targets for more than 2 years, the first time you ever attempted to make contact and request The Duke 
of York's help was on 2 January 2020. 
The Duke instructed my firm to make contact with you pertaining to this request. When we made contact, you 
confirmed that the Duke of York was not and is not a target of the US criminal investigation. 
Due to the publicity surrounding the investigation, we asked you to confirm that our discussions and any 
interview arrangements would remain confidential, in accordance with your rules. The Duke did not want to add 
to the media circus that has now surrounded the investigation. On 10 January 2020 you confirmed 
that any arrangements would indeed be kept confidential. 
We indicated that we would refer back to you once we had dealt with the various issues and procedures, which 
would need to be addressed to enable the Duke to cooperate to the fullest extent possible, including the need to 
obtain all the information that you might need to consider. It was at that time that we informed you, by email 
dated 20 January, that such preliminary issues would be dealt with within 14 days. It was also in that email that 
we confirmed that The Duke has a strong desire to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. 
Instead of waiting to hear from us (as you indicated on 22 January 2020), Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, chose to make a public statement about the Duke on 27 
January 2020. This led to press reports that there had been "a wall of silence" and that there had been "zero co-
operation" by the Duke. These statements were not true. They should not have been made. 
Quite apart from your promise of confidentiality, in England it would not be thought to be in the interests of 
justice for any prosecutor or investigator to make public statements about witnesses who may be willing, in 
confidence, to assist their investigation. 
In England, prosecutors and investigators try to make sure that the investigation and trial of serious criminal 
cases take place in court and not in press conferences or publicity battles. 
When we complained about the way the Duke (and we) had been treated by the DOJ, you refused to 
apologise and you have now also gone back on your promise that any arrangements for the interview will be 
confidential. 
We cannot advise the Duke to speak to prosecutors who cannot be trusted to deal with him fairly nor to treat 
what he says or does confidentially. He has reluctantly accepted our advice that, in those circumstances, there is 
no purpose to be served in continuing to try to assist further. 
Finally we have no wish to engage in any further publicity battle about the DOJ's conduct and for that reason we 
ask that you treat this email as private and confidential. 
Regards 
Gary

I am not sure if this would be helpful to you but we just got in a FOIA response request this week and it shows Maxwell on 
a notarized 1994 documents swearing she is a "disinterested" party and issuing an appraisal for certain of Epstein's New

These are great. Keeping in mind that we may have sensitivities about this exact wording, here's a humbly 
suggested pull quote: 
"Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't a bystander. And she wasn't just an enabler. She was a participant." 
I think with the right inflection this could be powerful. Just a thought...

I. 
MS. RICHARDSON'S COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE 
While incarcerated, Ms. Richardson, unsolicited, has provided important assistance to the 
Government on various investigations and prosecutions. Although she herself cannot file a motion 
for a sentencing reduction under Rule 35, all of the Assistant United States Attorneys with whom 
Ms. Richardson has met or to whom she has offered information welcomed her assistance, even 
where her testimony at trial was not ultimately required. 
are described below. 
Examples of Ms. Richardson's assistance 
C. Ms. Richardson Provided Information to the Government Regarding Jeffrey 
Epstein's Death. 
Given that Ms. Richardson has been a prisoner at the MCC since her arrest in 2016, she 
has relationships with guards and inmates who often share invaluable information concerning 
events at the MCC. When Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019, Ms. Richardson heard helpful 
information concerning the circumstances surrounding his death and requested that counsel 
provide such details (such as the names of the guards on duty at his time of death, their actions in 
response to his hanging, and which cameras to check for potentially helpful footage) to the 
Government. The Government expressed appreciation for the information, followed up with Ms. 
Richardson through counsel to confirm additional details and, although it did not request her 
testimony or an in-person proffer, we note that many of the details Ms. Richardson provided were 
reflected in various charging documents.

Attached is a quick (rough!) draft. I didn't really edit the rider, except to add a few bullet points as reminders, because I 
am not sure what the scope of the search we are seeking is. Can you guys review and take a crack at it? FBI has asked us 
to do this quickly, so if we could all focus on this for the moment, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey  Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Pitman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled 
for July 8, 2019, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should 
order that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. 
As set forth below, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is 
alleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years, 
and he now faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted 
evidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government's evidence and the substantial 
incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of 
flight, particularly given the defendant's exorbitant wealth, his ownership of and access to private 
planes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of 
the defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned 
from a multi-week stay abroad. 
Finally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past 
experience with this defendant—that if allowed to remain out on bail, the defendant could attempt 
to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and 
their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger 
to the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight. 
The defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this 
case, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.

BACKGROUND 
A. Overview 
On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed 
indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from 
a years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2002, the 
defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he 
paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. 
He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
"Palm Beach Residence"). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in 
similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with 
victims' genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate 
encounter. 
Moreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional 
girls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying 
these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this 
fashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations 
including New York and Palm Beach. 
The defendant's victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them. Many of his 
victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant 
intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his 
victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused 
them. 
In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant 
worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 
defendant, both in New York and in Florida. 
B. The Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant 
and through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his 
rampant abuse of underage girls.

As has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he owns and 
maintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhattan, New York; 
Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein owns a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary 
residence in the United States. His mansion in Manhattan alone—a multi-story townhouse 
reported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhattan, which previously housed a 
school and which he owns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million. 
Entities controlled by the defendant also own at least two private jets in active service, at least one 
of which is capable of intercontinental travel. 
As described further below, the defendant possesses three active United States passports, 
and his international connections and travels are extensive. 
For example, in addition to 
maintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past 18 months alone, the 
defendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately 
more than 20 occasions. 
C. The Prior Florida Investigation 
In or about 2005, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in 
connection with allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls. The 
investigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") and the FBI's Miami Office, and included interviews 
with victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count 
One of the instant Indictment.' 
In fall 2007, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in 
connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement 
identified as including investigations into the defendant's abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach 
area. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant 
was never charged federally.2 In June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count 
of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation 
of prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with 
registration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. 
The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed below, was entered into at the conclusion of 
the SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida. 
As noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who 
were abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida. 
While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further below, it is well-established in the 
Second Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is 
not bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Attorney's 
Office in another district. See page 6, infra.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) ("no condition or combination of 
conditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community"). 
A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a 
preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); 
United States v. Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must 
be supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 
542 (2d Cir. 1995); Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. In addition, a court may also order detention if 
there is "a serious risk that the [defendant] will. . . attempt to obstruct justice, or . . to threaten, 
injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2)(B); see also United 
States v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988). 
The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character . . . [and] 
financial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v. 
Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (same). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it shall be presumed, 
subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 
U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
Il. 
Discussion 
The defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth below, it is 
difficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released, 
and for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of 
detention in this case.

A. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —
counsel strongly in favor of detention. 
I. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
The "nature and circumstances" of this offense plainly favor detention. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3I42(g)( I ) (specifically enumerating "whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim" as a 
factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a 
defendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the 
community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant's 
conduct was committed serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims. 
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which 
include up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.3 As the Second 
Circuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of 
flight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 618 (10th Cir. 
2003) (defendant was a flight risk because her knowledge of the seriousness of the charges against her 
gave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Townsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 1990) 
("Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even 
greater incentive to consider flight."). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades 
in prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail below, the defendant has 
in abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear. 
It is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real 
prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted. 
The likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is buttressed by the strength of the 
evidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges 
that the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists 
numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the defendant's crimes.4
The current penalties for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 include a 10 year mandatory minimum 
sentence. However, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2006. 
The penalty for a violation of Section 1591 during the period charged in the Indictment, and 
therefore relevant here, was a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment. 
With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the 
Indictment is sufficient, on its own, to establish probable cause that the defendant committed the 
crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. ("Were an 
evidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3142(e) case in 
which an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering 
that which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of 
EFTA00030836
--- PAGE 6 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge

Page 6 
Multiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information 
against the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances, 
by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as 
further detailed below, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the 
defendant's arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude 
young women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials, 
such as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant's residence that include 
names and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and 
his agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply, 
all of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually 
abused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be 
devastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
Finally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant's previous non-
prosecution agreement ("NPA") with a different federal district pose any impediment to his 
conviction. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the 
date of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v. 
Chief 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because Congress extended the statute 
of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still 
running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 
WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). 
Moreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New 
York was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL 
investigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude 
prosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well settled in the Second Circuit 
that "a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind 
another." United States v. Frisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) ("A plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.") (citing United States 
v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the 
agreement purports to bind "the Government." See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This analysis 
similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 
854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) ("Defendant's argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement 
to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States 
Attorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, 
which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can 
affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.") (citing Annabi, 
771 F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely 
the presumptions and the § 3142(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be 
detained."). 
EFTA00030837

United States Magistrate Judge

conduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims 
identified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of 
whom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment. 
Each of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
2. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The 
defendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any attempt 
to flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless. 
As the defendant acknowledged in his most recent New York State sex offender 
registration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own 
private island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and 
Stanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant's New York City mansion 
alone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant's Palm Beach 
estate is more than $12 million. The defendant's primary residence is a private island in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible. 
Moreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration 
documentation of "current vehicles" lists no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven 
Chevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade, 
and a Hummer II. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin 
Islands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets, 
giving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment's notice and to go virtually 
anywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to 
and from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January 1, 2018, and the 
present, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 20 flights in which 
Epstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport 
arriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks 
abroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of 
flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). There can be 
no assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel. 
Finally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The 
defendant has no known immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends 
and associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his 
professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the 
defendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain 
in the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee. 
Nor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the 
defendant's presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would 
EFTA00030838
--- PAGE 8 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 8 
merely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 
2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application 
for bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring "at best . . . limits a fleeing 
defendant's head start"); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, 
at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 
2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
Finally, there can be little doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of 
dollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of 
his life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the 
reach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to 
this District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered 
in conjunction with the strength of the government's case and the lengthy sentence the defendant 
could receive if convicted. 
B. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in 
Obstruction of Justice 
The release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the 
community and to the ongoing investigation. 
As described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has 
committed an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it is presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). Here, not 
only is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already 
previously admitted to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in 
June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under 
classification level three in New York—defined as presenting a "high" risk of committing another 
sex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the 
2008 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released. 
Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant's offense in Florida, 
there were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or 
other obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were 
discussions between prosecutors and the defendant's then-counsel about the possibility of the 
defendant pleading guilty to counts relating to "obstruction," as well as "harassment," with 
reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which criminalizes "[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or 
informant." For example, in a communication from the defendant's then-counsel to prosecutors 
in SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant 
had "attempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to attend an 
official proceeding" and that the defendant "in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both 
[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to 
attempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]" and "further verbally 
EFTA00030839
--- PAGE 9 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 9 
harassed both [redacted] in connection to this attempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process 
all in violation of 18 USC 1512(d)(1)."5 Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts. 
361 at 3-4, 361-7 through 361-11. In addition to 18 U.S.C. § 1512(d), prosecutors also proposed 
that the defendant could plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 403, that is, a knowing or intentional violation 
of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant's then-
counsel replied: "Already thinking about the same statutes." Id. Dkt. 361-11. They also discussed 
a possible obstruction plea that "could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private 
investigators followed [redacted] father, forcing off the road." Id. Dkt. 361-10. 
The defendant's apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or 
tamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that "forc[edl off the road" the father of an 
individual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court's 
consideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even 
being charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government's 
case here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed 
above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so. 
Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage 
victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking 
women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of 
his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers 
discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the 
mansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at 
least hundreds—and perhaps thousands-of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-
nude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some 
of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl 
who, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken. 
Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which 
law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels including the 
following: "Young [Name] + [Name]," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics nude." The defendant, a 
registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;6 rather, he is a 
continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting 
deeply serious charges. 
The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document. 
See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I'm a sex offender, not a predator, 
N.Y. Post (2011) ("I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an "offender," the financier told The Post 
yesterday. `It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.'"); Philip 
Weiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2007) ("`It's the Icarus story, someone who flies too 
close to the sun,' I said. `Did Icarus like massages?' Epstein asked.").

Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019

CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The 
defendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious 
offenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years' imprisonment—even a fraction 
of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In 
sum, the defendant's transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive 
international travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and 
ownership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a 
successful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse 
dozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass, 
intimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his 
dangerousness readily apparent. 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not 
be able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there 
are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in court proceedings in this 
case or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied. 
Very truly yours,

Good morning Bobbi: 
While I understand the mail you have sent is time sensitive, there are 
BOP policies that must be complied with. All mail must be processed in 
a particular manner prior to being provided to an inmate. The legal 
department is not involved in the processing of mail for any inmates in 
Institution. The institution is not allowing visitors, therefore the 
mail may not be hand delivered, but again, the mail must be properly 
processed before provided to the inmate. Unfortunately, this is not 
something I can assist with. 
>>> BOBBI C STERNHEIM <
1/20/2021 1:27 PM >» 
Ms. Maxwell needs to review time-sensitive documents for filing on 
Monday 1/25. 
It appears that overnight express mail is not received next day and 
delivery to Ms.Maxwell is further delayed. 
Please let me know if we can hand-deliver legal mail for Ms. Maxwell to 
the MDC for direct deposit in the legal mail box. 
If so, can delivery to Ms. Maxwell be expedited? 
Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Thanks so much, M, and my apologies for the delayed response. I've been traveling for work and fell behind on emails 
as a result. I will email defense counsel to ask them to send a link where they'd like the materials uploaded.

can upload these files for defense counsel today and will be able to load a disc for Maxwell when I'm back at the office 
tomorrow. I recall that the last time we produced to defense in this manner they preferred to use their FTP site. Would 
you mind asking them to send over a link to where they'd like the materials uploaded? Thanks!

Thanks so much! Once you have the renumbered files, would you please prepare them for production to the defense? 
Ideally, they could go on a disc for Maxwell and USAfx for defense counsel, but let me know if it's too large.

6b and 6c will require us to check the drives that we have at the office. Neither 
nor I will be at the office today or 
tomorrow. I plan on going in on Thursday and will be able to check on those issues that defense points out. Not to jump to 
conclusions but I believe that PAE's .DAT files typically include only the beginning number in a range which would give the 
appearance of gaps in the production. As such there is a decent chance that defense is incorrect about the gaps as they 
list them although we will not know until we actually check the productions. 
Thanks,

We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
convenience. 
EFTA00030862
--- PAGE 3 ---
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
production. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
will be ready? 
2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
require to facilitate this production. 
3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD016." We do 
not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
documents were recovered. 
4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNYGM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
EFTA00030863
--- PAGE 4 ---
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

This delivery should include both the smaller drive you loaded today, and the bigger drive containing a full copy of all

At the request of defense counsel, our office is preparing a new drive with a copy of discovery material that was 
previously produced to Ghislaine Maxwell on a CD, but which she has been unable to view. The drive will be 
ready tomorrow. Today, defense counsel asked that Maxwell be able to review those materials over this coming 
weekend, but no one from our office is available to hand deliver the drive tomorrow, and we understand that 
Maxwell would not receive a FedEx package sent out tomorrow until next week. Defense counsel has offered to 
pick the drive up from our office and hand deliver it to the MDC themselves tomorrow. 
Would that be permissible? 
Thank you,

The MDC computers are not capable of opening discovery documents

Hi all - I just checked PROD011 and it contains all the requisite ranges. I'll go ahead and burn a CD for MDC containing the 
PROD011 and PROD015 .dat files and the re-bates stamped items, and I'll have that sent out today. Thanks!

Thanks so much, MI and my apologies for the delayed response. I've been traveling for work and fell behind on emails 
as a result. I will email defense counsel to ask them to send a link where they'd like the materials uploaded.

I can upload these files for defense counsel today and will be able to load a disc for Maxwell when I'm back at the office 
tomorrow. I recall that the last time we produced to defense in this manner they preferred to use their FTP site. Would 
you mind asking them to send over a link to where they'd like the materials uploaded? Thanks!

Thanks so much! Once you have the renumbered files, would you please prepare them for production to the defense? 
Ideally, they could go on a disc for Maxwell and USAfx for defense counsel, but let me know if E too large.

6b and 6c will require us to check the drives that we have at the office. Neither 
nor I will be at the office today or 
tomorrow. I plan on going in on Thursday and will be able to check on those issues that defense points out. Not to jump to 
conclusions but I believe that 
.DAT files typically include only the beginning number in a range which would give the 
appearance of gaps in the production. As such there is a decent chance that defense is incorrect about the gaps as they 
list them although we will not know until we actually check the productions. 
Thanks,

Subject: Discovery Requests 
and 
-
We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
convenience. 
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
production. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
will be ready? 
2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
require to facilitate this production. 
3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD0167 We do 
not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
documents were recovered. 
4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
EFTA00030890
--- PAGE 4 ---
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. 
cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.comThow-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

you the thumb drive referenced below, which has folders for five devices (NYC024332, NYC024369, NYC024369_1,

Following up on the below, thanks for those responses, that's very useful. In terms of the one outstanding item, in the 
thumb drive I received from 
yesterday with CART materials, NYC027913 is not included, so we are still missing that 
one. 
But I do see that each of the items with the "Included next round" label from the most recent spreadsheet (attached, with 
those items highlighted in red) are included, so that's helpful, thanks. 
In terms of any of the folders that have been produced so far, I know that you've sent supplemental materials on a 
handful of them (approximately seven total, I think) — do you currently expect to send any other supplemental materials 
for any of the devices we've received so far? Or are we fully complete? 
And then assuming those are all fully complete, or once they are, the only items pending will be the devices highlighted in 
gray in the attached, which we understand are being processed for hardware recovery. 
thanks,

She should have them. Reach out to her for delivery. 
The 3 folders you mention contain supplemental files, do not

I am pretty sure NYC027913 is included with the items 
has. If not, please let me know. 
As far as the old questions, you should have everything now. 
The zero byte files are just that. Sometimes the software will recover either file headers, or items off the 
directory listings, but no actual content. It lists them as zero length files. 
Need anything further, let me know.

I know you may still be traveling, but I wanted to check in on a handful of outstanding issues. If you're not available,

can assist? 
1. 
On this past Sunday and Monday, you had said you had you had additional materials you planned to get to us on 
Monday. I don't believe we ever received anything additional this past week. Are those still pending, and if so, 
when can we get those materials? 
2. 
There were three folders that were included in the first disc you provided to us, but then also provided again on 
the most recent disc. Those folders are: NYC024328, NYC024366, and NYC024392. Can you please let us know 
why those were provided twice? In particular, we need to know whether any supplemental information is in the 
new folders with those NYC numbers, or whether we can ignore them on the recent disc because we already 
received them. 
3. 
One item is listed on your spreadsheet as having been provided on 7/23, but it was not on the most recent disc 
you sent. That item is: NYC027913 (row 40 in your spreadsheet). 
In case it's useful, I'm attaching a version of the spreadsheet you put on the disc, but with all the items we received 
folders for on the most recent hard drive highlighted in yellow. 
Separately, we're still waiting on answers to the questions from Thursday and Friday, July 23 and 24. To refresh, those 
questions are:

Comparing your most recent spreadsheet to the prior one, and leaving aside the "Nothing for Southern" 
designations as well as the NYC numbers that look like they're for the desktops that held the actual drives we're 
looking at (such as NYC024385, 387, 389, 391, and 393, and NYC027909), I think there are just three additional

devices listed here that weren't on the spreadsheet you previously sent. I have those as: NYC024328 (row 10), 
NYC024367 (row 62), and NYC027910 (row 96). Please confirm that these were added, and also that we're not 
missing any? I believe those were all provided on the first disc. 
5. 
As previously mentioned, the vendor has advised that in the initial seven devices provided, there were 
approximately 71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files). They are listed in the second attached 
spreadsheet. Is that accurate? Or does that reflect some issue with the extraction process?

I don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find such 
files. I will review Monday to make sure. As to your questions from last night, the sheet should be 
comprehensive. I only recall 1 addition, but I am sure that what I have is reflected in the sheet. As for the items 
in dark grey, there are 2 servers with multiple drives. Some of those drives have physically failed. We have to get 
them to one of our HQ specialists for recovery. Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may not 
be possible. It can be a very long process. We will get that moving ASAP. Need anything else, let me know.

I
agree with this approach, though defer to 
if she's handling, and thanks in advance. On 
the last point: I do think we have a firm view that they should not be filing our discovery materials in civil cases. I don't 
care about the substance of these particular documents, but I think we agree that is an important aspect of the protective 
order to assert, both in this instance and in general, so this issue doesn't continue to crop up.

I think 
is particularly swamped this week —can you please take the lead on whatever we're going to do with this 
(i.e., presumably whatever the chiefs decide)? My personal vote would be to tell them that the protective order explicitly 
precludes the use of criminal grand jury materials in Maxwell's civil cases, and the materials are sealed because they 
relate to an ongoing grand jury investigation and they should feel free to raise the issue with Nathan and we'll respond. 
(And I would think our response could basically be a copy-paste of the letter I wrote to Netburn.) We could also note in 
our response to Jeff and Laura, if we wanted to, that given their awareness of the materials, we assume they will retract 
the obviously false claims about government malfeasance. 
All that said, I also wouldn't object if they just want to allow them to file these materials under seal; I don't think it 
matters hugely. If we could have resolved 
(et al) by now, none of this would be an issue.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Mr. Pagliuca: 
The Government writes in response to your letter dated August 9, 2020 requesting to use 
discovery materials produced by the Government in the above-referenced criminal case bearing 
Bates Nos. SDNY GM _ 00000834 through SDNY_ GM_ 00000962 (the "Unsealing Materials") to 
_ 
litigate a civil lawsuit. 
As an initial matter, the Government notes that it remains unclear whether you make this 
request in your capacity as defense counsel to Ms. Maxwell in the above-referenced criminal case, 
or in your capacity as her attorney in a separate civil matter. If the former, the Government 
maintains that the "Confidential" designation of the Unsealing Materials is appropriate because 
Chief Judge Colleen McMahon and Magistrate Judge Sarah Netbum have ordered that the 
Unsealing Materials remain under seal. The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the 
production of Chief Judge McMahon's April 9, 2019 Order (Bates Nos. SDNY_GM_00000904 
through SDNY_GM_00000905) to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, and production of the entirety 
of the Unsealing Materials to Ms. Maxwell as discovery in the above-referenced criminal case. 
The Unsealing Materials relate to an ongoing criminal investigation, and their public disclosure at 
this stage risks interference with that investigation. Moreover, the Protective Order issued by 
Judge Alison J. Nathan in the above-referenced criminal case expressly provides that any and all 
discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of designation, 
"[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this 
criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this 
action." (Protective Order, ECF No. 36, dated July 30, 2020, ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a)). The 
Government notes that counsel for Ms. Maxwell expressly consented to that limitation when 
negotiating the Protective Order in the criminal case. Accordingly, regardless of designation, the 
Protective Order expressly prohibits use of any discovery materials produced by the Government 
in the above-referenced criminal case in any civil case.

To the extent you make this request in your capacity as counsel to Ms. Maxwell in civil 
litigation, you are welcome to avail yourself of requests for records through the Freedom of 
Information Act or through a Toughy request, in the same manner as any other litigant seeking to 
use records from a federal criminal investigation in a civil case. If you wish to make such a request, 
the undersigned can refer you to the appropriate Assistant United States Attorney in our office's 
Civil Division, who will process your request. 
Very truly yours, 
AUDREY STRAUSS

Can I make a small suggestion on this? Unless and until it gets super inconvenient to do this in terms of upload time, I'd 
suggest putting *all* the current discovery on whatever disk we send to the prison, like USAO_GM_000001 through 
whatever is the latest production, and then having the facility send back whatever is the last disc we sent after the new 
one arrives. 
That way at any time there are only two disks out in the world with her discovery on them (the one she has at any given 
time, and the one that's on its way to replace it), and only one in her possession at all times. Otherwise in two months 
she's going to have a half dozen hard drives sitting in the MDC, with all different stuff on each one. But per usual anybody 
should weigh in if anyone disagrees!

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 81 Filed 12/03/20 Par" 1 rtf 9 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SONY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC  
DATE FILED: 12/3/20 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request 
seeking an in camera conference for the presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and 
a request to seal the November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for 
the sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no longer 
fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and instead proposing 
redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters. The Government has 
indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80. 
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions, which 
are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the three-part test 
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 
2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are 
"judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the 
materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 
119-20. "Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to `the danger of impairing law 
enforcement or judicial efficiency' and `the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.' Id. 
at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Anrodeo II")). 
EFTA00030910
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 81 Filed 12/03/20 Page 2 of 2 
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's letter 
motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 
process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the 
Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo 1"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And 
while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of access attaches, in balancing 
competing considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments 
the Defendant has put forth—including, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals 
referenced in the letters-favor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby 
ORDERED to docket the redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. 
For the reasons outlined in the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, 
the Court DENIES the Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the 
privacy interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit 
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored redactions. 
The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly prepare a briefing 
schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for release on bail. 
SO ORDERED.

Will do on uploading the materials. As for those ranges, we've already produced them twice — once in the third 
production (08-21-2020) and once in the reproduction with shortened file names (09-03-2020). We would not be able to

Chris, 
Following up on point 6 below, our paralegals have re-stamped the materials you identified with a Bates range overlap 
and are prepared to reproduce those materials to you. The materials are small enough to produce via your FTP site. 
Would you like to send us a link to where you would like those materials uploaded? Alternatively, we can load the 
materials to a CD and send it to you. 
We are still waiting to hear back from our vendor about the remaining issues you identified in point 6.

Subject: RE: Discovery Requests 
Chris, 
Below please find our responses. 
1. 
As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has access to the 4TB drive containing a full set of the discovery 
produced to date. It took a significant amount of time to create this copy due to the volume of discovery and 
delays on the part of our vendor, who assisted in creating the copy. 
2. 
As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has a drive containing the contents of the CD produced on 
November 18, 2020. 
3. 
As I conveyed to you over the phone and in a recent email, the materials produced from the Subject Devices all 
contain metadata indicating the "NYC" CART Evidence Number of the device from which each document was 
extracted. In our November 18, 2020 discovery letter, we provided you with a chart setting forth which "NYC" 
CART Evidence Number corresponds with which Subject Device in our warrants. If you still need a detailed index 
of all 1.2 million documents with the specific Subject Device indicated, please let me know, and I will ask one of 
our paralegals to compile one. 
4. 
We produced the FBI report bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 in the form in which it was 
recovered from one of Epstein's devices. In other words, we did not apply any redactions to that document; 
rather, the redactions existed on the document at the time the document was found during the FBI's search of 
Epstein's devices. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for a log of redactions. If you have any 
EFTA00030914
--- PAGE 4 ---
legal authority on that point, we would be happy to consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that our office did not 
apply redactions to any material that was identified responsive during the searches of Epstein's devices. 
5. 
We are aware of our discovery obligations, have complied with them, and will continue to comply with them. We 
are not aware of any legal basis for your request that we inform you of what, if any, documents have been 
withheld or the basis for their withholding. If you have any legal authority on that point, we would be happy to 
consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that we have provided you with all records we received from AT&T and all 
records we received from David Rodgers. As to your inquiry about the Bates ranges on the Rodgers documents 
beginning with Bates number "28", I note that the folder containing the Rodgers subpoena returns in our August 
5, 2020 production included two documents. The first (SDNY_GM_00005532-5649) is the document you 
referenced in your email inquiry. The second (SDNY_GM_00005650-5676) is 27 pages long, accounting for the 
first 27 pages of the production from Rodgers. We produced those two documents in the form in which we 
received them. 
6. 
Our paralegals are working on the issues you identified with Bates ranges and metadata load files. I will reach 
back out to you once I have an update on the status of those issues. 
7. 
We do not have a more detailed index of the November 9 and November 18 productions beyond what we have 
provided to you. 
8. 
We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for copies of grand jury subpoenas. Nor are we aware of any 
legal basis for your request that we identify the date range of documents we requested in each subpoena. If you 
have any legal authority for those requests, we would be happy to consider it. 
9. 
The court filings that appear to be referenced in the Daily Beast article you sent are an application for a search 
warrant and a search warrant filed in the District of New Hampshire. We produced both documents to you in 
discovery on August 5, 2020. The DNH judge issued a sealing order in connection with the warrant and 
application. As you can see at Bates No. SDNY_GM_00000621, the sealing order automatically expired on 
December 30, 2020. Our understanding is that the District of New Hampshire unsealed the filing of its own 
accord in conformity with the clear language of that sealing order. Our office took no affirmative steps to unseal 
or otherwise release these filings.

We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
convenience. 
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
production. We provided you with a 4T8 hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
will be ready? 
2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
require to facilitate this production. 
3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD0167 We do 
not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
documents were recovered. 
4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY GM 00328070-328863). 
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNYGM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena.

There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

Hi all - I just checked PROD011 and it contains all the requisite ranges. I'll go ahead and burn a CD for MDC containing the 
PROD011 and PROD015 .dat files and the re-bates stamped items, and I'll have that sent out today. Thanks!

I can upload these files for defense counsel today and will be able to load a disc for Maxwell when I'm back at the office 
tomorrow. I recall that the last time we produced to defense in this manner they preferred to use their FTP site. Would

Hey 
We will take care of 6a today. 
(USANYS) 
6b and 6c will require us to check the drives that we have at the office. Neither 
nor I will be at the office today or 
tomorrow. I plan on going in on Thursday and will be able to check on those issues that defense points out. Not to jump to 
conclusions but I believe that PAE's .DAT files typically include only the beginning number in a range which would give the 
appearance of gaps in the production. As such there is a decent chance that defense is incorrect about the gaps as they 
list them although we will not know until we actually check the productions.

We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
convenience. 
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
production. We provided you with a 4T8 hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
will be ready? 
2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
EFTA00030920
--- PAGE 4 ---
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
require to facilitate this production. 
3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD0167 We do 
not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
documents were recovered. 
4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.comThow-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

Our paralegals reminded me that we have produced the ranges you included in your most recent email twice: once in the 
third production (08-21-2020) and once in the reproduction with shortened file names (09-03-2020). We can certainly 
produce them a third time, but we would not be able to reproduce them again through your FTP link, as they are too 
large. Please provide us with a 64 GB drive if you would like us to reproduce those ranges.

Following up on point 6 below, our paralegals have re-stamped the materials you identified with a Bates range overlap

Would you like to send us a link to where you would like those materials uploaded? Alternatively, we can load the

Below please find our responses. 
1. 
As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has access to the 4TB drive containing a full set of the discovery 
produced to date. It took a significant amount of time to create this copy due to the volume of discovery and 
delays on the part of our vendor, who assisted in creating the copy. 
2. 
As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has a drive containing the contents of the CD produced on 
November 18, 2020. 
3. 
As I conveyed to you over the phone and in a recent email, the materials produced from the Subject Devices all 
contain metadata indicating the "NYC" CART Evidence Number of the device from which each document was 
extracted. In our November 18, 2020 discovery letter, we provided you with a chart setting forth which "NYC" 
CART Evidence Number corresponds with which Subject Device in our warrants. If you still need a detailed index 
of all 1.2 million documents with the specific Subject Device indicated, please let me know, and I will ask one of 
our paralegals to compile one. 
4. 
We produced the FBI report bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 in the form in which it was 
recovered from one of Epstein's devices. In other words, we did not apply any redactions to that document; 
rather, the redactions existed on the document at the time the document was found during the FBI's search of 
Epstein's devices. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for a log of redactions. If you have any 
legal authority on that point, we would be happy to consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that our office did not 
apply redactions to any material that was identified responsive during the searches of Epstein's devices. 
5. 
We are aware of our discovery obligations, have complied with them, and will continue to comply with them. We 
are not aware of any legal basis for your request that we inform you of what, if any, documents have been 
withheld or the basis for their withholding. If you have any legal authority on that point, we would be happy to 
consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that we have provided you with all records we received from 
and all 
records we received from 
. As to your inquiry about the Bates ranges on the 
documents 
beginning with Bates number "28', I note that the folder containing the 
subpoena returns in our August 
5, 2020 production included two documents. The first (SDNY_GM_00005532-5649) is the document you 
referenced in your email inquiry. The second (SDNY_GM_00005650-5676) is 27 pages long, accounting for the 
first 27 pages of the production from 
. We produced those two documents in the form in which we 
received them. 
6. 
Our paralegals are working on the issues you identified with Bates ranges and metadata load files. I will reach 
back out to you once I have an update on the status of those issues. 
7. 
We do not have a more detailed index of the November 9 and November 18 productions beyond what we have 
provided to you. 
8. 
We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for copies of grand jury subpoenas. Nor are we aware of any 
legal basis for your request that we identify the date range of documents we requested in each subpoena. If you 
have any legal authority for those requests, we would be happy to consider it. 
9. 
The court filings that appear to be referenced in the Daily Beast article you sent are an application for a search 
warrant and a search warrant filed in the District of New Hampshire. We produced both documents to you in 
discovery on August 5, 2020. The DNH judge issued a sealing order in connection with the warrant and 
EFTA00030930
--- PAGE 6 ---
application. As you can see at Bates No. SDNY_GM_00000621, the sealing order automatically expired on 
December 30, 2020. Our understanding is that the District of New Hampshire unsealed the filing of its own 
accord in conformity with the clear language of that sealing order. Our office took no affirmative steps to unseal 
or otherwise release these filings.

5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the 
documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced by 
begin at Bates number 
suggesting that 
were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

Emne: Epstein case 
Dear 
I'm an investigative reporter at The Norwegian Business Daily in Oslo, (Dagens Nwringsliv). We have been 
writing about Jeffrey Epstein's political connections for a year, among them revealing how he managed to get 
Bill Gates through the doors of the Nobel Peace Prize committee's leader in 2013. But our main target has 
EFTA00030938
--- PAGE 2 ---
been the former UN assistant Secretary General, Mr. Terje Rod-Larsen, who resigned as president of the 
International Peace Institute in New York, after we revealed his financial dealings with Epstein. I'm attaching 
our translated articles. 
The reason why I'm writing to You is that I see You were on the team at SDNY prosecuting him. And I've 
heard that You reached out to some of the people who were on Epstein's flight log in recent years. I would be 
grateful if we could exchange background information that might help us in our further investigation. We 
have reason to believe that both Mr. Rod-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul were on his plane one time during 
Christmas to Epstein's island in the years 2010-2015. 
I'm sorry for reaching out to You on this email, but I couldn't find one at the SDNY website. 
Here are some of our 40 articles:

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
We write in response to your letter of December 28, 2020, in which you request a bill of 
particulars in the above-captioned matter. As set forth herein, the Government does not intend to 
provide further particulars because under the well-established law of this Circuit it has no 
obligation to do so. To the contrary, and as you are aware, the Government outlined its charges 
against your client in a detailed speaking superseding indictment (the "Indictment") and has since 
provided considerable additional information through the production of to date of over 2.7 million 
items of discovery, all in electronic form and accompanied by an index. Accordingly, the 
Government has more than provided the defendant with adequate notice of the charges against her, 
and no further particulars are required. 
"A bill of particulars is required only where the charges of the indictment are so general 
that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused." United States v. 
Walsh, 194 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. 1999) (quotations marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g., 
United States v. Mahabub, No. 13 Cr. 908 (MN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 
2014) (same); United States v. Mandell, 710 F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (same). 
"Acquisition of evidentiary details is not the function of the bill of particulars." United States v. 
Torres, 901 F.2d 205, 234 (2d Cir. 1990), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Marcus, 
628 F.3d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 2010) (quotations marks and citation omitted). 
EFTA00030943
--- PAGE 2 ---
Nor may a bill of particulars be used as a general investigative tool. "It is not enough that 
the information would be useful to the defendant; if the defendant has been given adequate notice 
of the charges against him, the government is not required to disclose additional details about its 
case." United States v. Payden, 613 F. Supp. 800, 816 (S.D.N.Y. 1985); see also, e.g., United 
States v. Sindone, No. 01 Cr. 517 (MBM), 2002 WL 48604, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2002) (a 
defendant may not "use a bill of particulars to preview the government's evidence or trial strategy, 
or to require the government to specify the minutiae of how it will prove the charges. The stakes 
in a criminal case are high, and temptations of perjury, subornation and intimidation are ever 
present. Accordingly, the government is not required to turn over information that will permit a 
defendant to preview the government's case and tempt him to tailor proof to explain it away, or 
see to it that the government's proof is not presented." (citations omitted)); United States v. 
Guerrerio, 670 F. Supp. 1215, 1225 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (A bill of particulars "is not a discovery tool 
and is not intended to allow defendants a preview of the evidence or the theory of the government's 
case."). 
A bill of particulars is unwarranted in this case because the Government has more than 
satisfied its obligations to provide the defense with sufficient information to "prepare for trial, to 
prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should [the defendant] be prosecuted 
a second time for the same offense." United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 
1987). The Indictment contains a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offenses 
charged, and it describes the conduct of the defendant that the Government expects to prove at trial 
with respect to three particular victims. The Indictment itself contains a detailed description of the 
accounts these victims have provided law enforcement. In addition to the Indictment, which 
provides more than sufficient information about the charges against your client, you are also in 
possession of, among other things, numerous search warrant affidavits that outline evidence 
revealed during the Government's investigation over time (see, e.g., SDNY_GM_00000423-
SDNY_GM_00000524); documentary evidence, including travel records and contemporaneous 
journal entries that corroborate the victims' accounts; and the Government's letters concerning 
bail and detention. In sum, the Indictment and the materials produced during discovery provide 
you with more than ample information concerning the allegations that the Government intends to 
prove at trial and the supporting evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Reinhold, 994 F. Supp. 194, 
201 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (denying request for bill of particulars where the "indictment is detailed in 
its allegations" and the "defendants have had extensive discovery"). 
To the extent that your requests seek information regarding potential witnesses and/or co-
conspirators or aiders and abettors (Requests 1-20, 22-26), the Government is not required to 
provide such information at this time. See, e.g., United States v. D'Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 321, 
335 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) ("A bill of particulars is not a general investigative tool, a discovery device 
or a means to compel the government to disclose evidence or witnesses to be offered prior to trial." 
(quoting United States v. Gibson, 175 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2001))); United States v. 
Barrera, 950 F. Supp. 2d 461, 478-79 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying motion for bill of particulars as 
to identities of unnamed victims of alleged murder conspiracy); United States v. Castro, No. 08 
Cr. 268 (NRB), 2008 WL 5062724, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2008) ("An indictment need not 
identify all alleged co-conspirators, nor specify the nature, time and place of every overt act the 
defendant or others allegedly took in furtherance of a conspiracy, nor must it set forth all the 
evidence the government intends to introduce."); United States v. Sindone, 2002 WL 48604, at *1 
EFTA00030944
--- PAGE 3 ---
(denying request for bill of particulars that would identify alleged co-conspirators and victims); 
United States v. Trippe, 171 F. Supp. 2d 230, 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) ("[D]emands for particular 
information with respect to where, when, and with whom the Government will charge the 
defendant with conspiring are routinely denied."); United States v. Mitlof, 165 F. Supp. 2d 558, 
569 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) ("What defendant seeks is in the nature of the `wheres, whens and with 
whoms' that [c]ourts have held to be beyond the scope of a bill of particulars." (collecting cases)); 
United States v. Fruchter, 104 F. Supp. 2d 289, 313 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (denying "Defendants' 
request for names of all aiders, abettors, unindicted co-conspirators, and confidential informants" 
as "nothing more than a request for a witness list"); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. As previously 
stated, and as noted in the Government's letter dated October 28, 2020, with regard to your many 
requests for information that fall within the scope of the Government's Giglio and Jencks Act 
obligations, we intend to produce all such material in advance of trial and remain available to 
confer generally regarding a mutual schedule for pretrial and trial-related disclosures, including 
witness statements or Giglio material. 
You seek numerous, specific details which amount to requests for a detailed preview of the 
Government's case and its legal theories (Requests 7, 14, 19, 25, and 29). The Government is not 
required to disclose at this juncture the way in which it expects to prove the charges or the precise 
manner in which the defendant committed the charged crimes, nor must the Government provide 
a preview of the evidence or legal theories it intends to present at trial. See, e.g., United States v. 
Dupigny, 18 Cr. 528 (JMF), 2019 WL 2327697, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 2019) (denying motion 
for bill of particulars and explaining that the defendant "need not be informed of the specific means 
of coercion he is alleged to have employed against the still-unidentified victims in the Superseding 
Indictment. And between the indictment, applications for search warrants, court filings, and 
proffers during bail hearings, the Government has advised Dupigny of the nature and timeframe 
of the conspiracy; the number of victims involved in the substantive trafficking offenses, the ages 
of several of the victims, and the residence from which he recruited them; and the types of physical 
force and coercion he has employed against at least some of them"); United States v. Pierre-Louis, 
Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) ("Defendant's demand that 
the Government provide him with the specifics of how it will prove the `interstate transportation' 
element of its case is an improper attempt to limit the Government's proof at trial and is the type 
of `when, where, and how' bill of particular requests that are 'almost uniformly . . . denied."' 
(citation omitted)); United States v. Monzon-Liana,No. 11 Cr. 722 (RRM), 2014 WL 223100, at 
*4 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2014) (denying request for bill of particulars where defendant was charged 
with, among other things, sex trafficking of minors and a Mann Act violation, and stating that the 
indictment "explains the essential facts constituting each of the crimes charge[d], the time frame 
in which the crime is alleged to have occurred, and the victim involved. This information is 
sufficient to apprise defendant of the charges against him."). For example, with respect to Requests 
7, 14, 19, and 25, the Government directs your attention to the Indictment, at paragraphs 11(b), 13, 
17(b), and 19, which refer to sex acts in violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55. With 
respect to Request 28, the Government refers you to the Indictment, at paragraph 7, which 
describes the conduct of the defendant that the Government expects to prove at trial with respect 
to three particular victims. Based on the foregoing, you are not entitled to the particulars sought 
through your requests, and in any event, much of what you seek is described in the Indictment and 
discovery. If you have authority for your requests, we would be happy to consider it.

Subject: Request re Ghisliane Maxwell 
Date: Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:35:28 +0000 
Good afternoon, 
At the request of defense counsel, our office is preparing a new drive with a copy of discovery material that was 
previously produced to Ghislaine Maxwell on a CD, but which she has been unable to view. The drive will be ready 
tomorrow. Today, defense counsel asked that Maxwell be able to review those materials over this coming weekend, but 
no one from our office is available to hand deliver the drive tomorrow, and we understand that Maxwell would not 
receive a FedEx package sent out tomorrow until next week. Defense counsel has offered to pick the drive up from our 
office and hand deliver it to the MDC themselves tomorrow. Would that be permissible? 
Thank you, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00030949
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00030950
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won't 
repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges 
were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and 
perseverance and creativity by

Subject: Discovery and Disclosure Practices -- Update 
Date: Fri, 04 Dec 2020 16:50:46 +0000 
All: 
Over the last several months, the executive staff has been giving a great deal of thought to ways in which we can enhance 
the Office's effectiveness in satisfying our discovery and disclosure obligations. Although that process is continuing, I want 
to provide you with an update about some measures that we are implementing immediately, based on feedback we 
received from you and your unit chiefs. 
First, I am pleased to announce that we will maintain a standing Disclosure Committee to help the Office navigate our 
discovery and disclosure challenges on an ongoing basis. The Disclosure Committee will be led by co-chair-
and its members will be 
Second, we have enlisted a Technology Working Group to evaluate possible approaches to improving our technological 
and administrative support for your work, in close consultation with 
and our IT staff. That group is led by 
a, 
and its members are 
Third, we recognize that the substantive work of each unit may present particular discovery challenges. To ensure that 
AUSAs are familiar with the particular issues that may arise with respect to the work of a particular unit, unit chiefs will 
provide training for new AUSAs who arrive in their unit as part of the onboarding process, with an emphasis on the 
subject-matter-specific discovery and disclosure issues that they are likely to encounter as part of the unit's work. 
Fourth, in advance of charging senior unit cases, AUSAs will conduct agency case file reviews to ensure we have full 
visibility on material subject to disclosure—and are not relying solely on agents to surface materials subject to disclosure. 
While this will not be required in all junior unit cases, agency file reviews should be conducted in General Crimes and 
Narcotics cases where unit chiefs deem it appropriate. The Disclosure Committee will be overseeing the development of 
agency-specific checklists to help facilitate the review, but in the meantime AUSAs should use their best judgment. 
Fifth, prosecution memos must contain a robust discussion of discovery issues and defense theories as a pre-requisite for 
approval by chiefs in the first instance and ultimately deputy chief signoff. The Disclosure Committee will be developing 
guidance for areas that should be covered—but, in the meantime, AUSAs and chiefs should use their best judgment. 
Sixth, when AUSAs leave senior units they will discuss case transition planning with the unit chiefs and the Criminal Chief, 
and memorialize the case transition planning in a memorandum addressing the status of all of their cases and specifying 
which cases they will be retaining and which will be reassigned. These memos will require approval by both the old and 
new unit chiefs and will be reviewed by the Criminal Chief. 
Seventh, in those rare instances when SAUSAs are approved for a particular case, they will complete all DOJ discovery 
training requirements and SDNY disclosure training as part of their onboarding process before they can begin work as a 
SAUSA. We will require certification of the completion of all required training as part of the SAUSA onboarding process. 
The Criminal Division Manual will be revised to reflect this policy. 
Some of these practices are already being followed by some units and some AUSAs. Going forward, they will be the 
practice of the entire Office. We hope that these practices, amplified by the forthcoming guidance from the Disclosure 
Committee, will provide AUSAs with useful tools and better position us to discharge our disclosure obligations. 
As always, we welcome and appreciate your feedback. If you have thoughts or suggestions about how these practices are 
working, or these issues generally, please share them with your unit chiefs, any member of the Disclosure Committee or 
Technology Working Grouo. or the executive staff.

lists terminated employees for that time (year 2000). Unfortunately, I am unable to 
confirm whether or not this is the same person due to the fact no other information is listed

Subject: Re: RE: 
Governor Bill Richardson offered his assistance in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation through his lawyer, Jeff 
Brown of Dechert LLP, to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In response to this offer, Mr. 
Brown was informed by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither 
a target, subject, nor witness in the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson about 
which the government is seeking a response from Gov. Richardson at this time. 
"It's fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe at this time the 
Governor participated in or witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed," said 
Mr. Brown. 
Furthermore, Governor Richardson has never been contacted by any party to a lawsuit involving Epstein, nor 
by any law enforcement investigating Epstein. Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so 
that Epstein's victims can finally have their day in court and see the justice they deserve.

Admissibility of Sex Game 
Hello and Happy New Year! 
Here's an issue I haven't seen addressed: CP distribution case arising from multiple reports of uploads to Yahoo photo albums. Four 
computers seized from defendant's house. CP-related activity found on all four. Forensics reveal a large compressed file on the root 
of the C drive of the computer most actively used for CP activity. The examiner was able to save and install the file and found it to be 
a virtual reality game call Hizashi no nakano real, in which the player uses the mouse to control a virtual hand that molests an 
animated Asian girl whose age appears to be about 10. The game was accompanied by a detailed "walk through" document telling 
the steps for navigating the game. This document, like the game itself, is very graphic and detailed. The only Local User who has the 
game loaded is our defendant. Forensics show our Local User had gotten to Level 4 of the game, which involves significant and 
sustained affirmative acts against the virtual girl. 
Admissible? 
I'd appreciate your thoughts.

Hey all, below is a summary of the discovery items you've requested. 
Message Pad Scans: The message pads were scanned with the post it notes on them and the very next page is the page 
without the post it note, so the pages are back to back. 
Papers from Miami case file (grand jury testimony): This is a disk — I can copy it and send it over to you. 
Evidence scans: Are you referring to the scans from the FL file? We sent those over with the original message pad scans 
last year. If you need that again, let us know and we can get another copy over to you. As far as paper evidence from 
the NY and VI searches, and the paper provided by Reiter, we can get that over to you by the end of the week. 
FBI file: We have that ready for you. 
CART: There are no 302s regarding the extraction of devices. 
Evidence from disks: This is a large volume and we've been working on this and removing nude/semi nude images. This 
is the only thing that would be difficult to complete by Friday. If we could have a little more time to pull this together, 
that would be very helpful. 
If it's helpful to talk through some of this via phone, we are happy to do that as well.

Hey guys, 
Apologies but today I was out In the field on surveillance and 
was also out of the office so we've not 
been able to connect on these discovery questions. We will be back in the office tomorrow and will dive into 
this as best we can. We have several calls tomorrow, one of which is with Tony Figuero but well do our best to 
get on this list. That being said I don't want to make you any promises that everything will be compiled by 
tomorrow and that we will have an answer to all of your questions but we can jump on a call tomorrow if you 
like to square some of this away. 
I did receive your "pages from Miami_case_docs" PDF.

Hi 
and 
The drive you provided us has some scans on it (looks like they're scans of the message pads). As I recall, there was a 
larger scanning project, during which the FBI scanned all of the paper that was vouchered in evidence. Are you able to 
provide us with all of those scans this week? 
With respect to the message pads in particular, I think you mentioned that they were scanned both with post-it notes on 
them and also without the post-it notes. The version on this drive just looks like it has the post-it note scans. 
Thanks,

Thanks so much for your help with the Maxwell discovery so far. I have some follow-up questions about the most recent 
batch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. 
Below are some questions regarding the discovery 
dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: 
• 
The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it 
contains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? 
• 
The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I think 
mentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—and those 
copies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every "Notebook" pdf you provided in the "Message pad 
scans" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? 
• 
It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. 
Would you please get us copies of those returns? 
Following up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you 
please be able to get us these this week? 
• 
Full FBI sentinel file 
• 
CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation 
• 
All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and 
hard copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. 
• 
Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials 
• 
Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been 
scanned, including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any 
nude or partially nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how 
many such images were scanned, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
• 
Copies of the contents of all the discs that were seized and searched pursuant to search warrants to a platform 
for review. Then please produce to SDNY a copy all of those materials, except any nude or partially nude 
images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such images were 
located, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if it would be useful to hop on a call. 
Thanks very much,

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
This letter provides additional discovery pursuant to Rule 16(a) of the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure ("Fed. R. Crim. P."). Based on your request for discovery in this case, today 
we are producing copies of the materials listed in the below index, which materials are stamped 
with control numbers SDNY_GM_000 165541 through SDNY_GM_ 00174966. A reproduction 
of materials previously produced by the Government on August 12, 2020, which are stamped with 
control 
numbers 
SDNY_GM_00086557 
through 
SDNY_GM_00096055 
and 
SDNY GM 00164920 through SDNY_GM_00165517 is also included. The materials are 
available for pickup at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan.

This production includes certain materials from the files of the Florida office of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). The Government notes that the remainder of the Florida FBI 
Files in PDF format designated as "confidential" under the protective order have been stamped 
"confidential." However, certain files cannot be individually labeled as confidential on the 
documents themselves due to their file format. Such files include in their electronic names the 
word "Confidential."

files are loaded onto an electronic review platform and will be processed and produced on a rolling 
basis as part of electronic discovery. 
Additionally, the Government notes that the physical items referenced in the productions 
to date can be made available for you to review at the FBI New York office, upon request. Those 
physical items include numerous hard copies of photographs and discs containing photographs, 
which were seized during searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences. As a courtesy, the FBI is in 
the process of scanning those hard copy photographs and copying the photographs contained on 
the discs. Once that process is complete, the Government intends to produce electronic copies of 
any such photographs that do not contain highly confidential images. Any photographs among 
those physical items identified as highly confidential will be made available for review at the FBI 
New York office. 
Finally, the Government wishes to inform you, as a courtesy, that it is in possession of a 
copy of the FBI's case file regarding the investigation of a former employee of Jeffre E stein's 
named 
for obstruction of justice (the "=IM 
File"). The 
File is 
maintained under a different FBI case number from the investigation that led to the charges against 
your client. The 
File has no relation to your client and no bearing on the charges in this 
case. Accordingly, the Government does not intend to produce the 
File because it is 
not discoverable in this case. 
Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials or if 
you wish to arrange a time to review physical items in the FBI's custody. 
Very truly yours, 
AUDREY STRAUSS 
Acting United States Attorney 
Assistant United States Attorneys

I hope you're well! I'm helping out with the responsiveness review for WBTW and I've been looking through Steve 
Bannon's iPhone 7 on Cellebrite. As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and 
Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon's phone (see screenshot from Cellebrite, attached). I discussed with Sunny and we wanted 
to flag this for you, in case it was of any importance to you, since you are on both cases. 
Please let me know if you'd like anything further done with this. Thanks so much!

As you may know IG 
was a prosecutor in the SDNY and I believe he wants to know if the BOP disregarded 
requests, directives or court orders from the prosecutors or Judge in the SONY on the underlying case as it related to 
phone use. 
I believe HQ wants to know if the SDNY prosecutors office or Judge had any additional requirements, requests, directives 
or court orders that the BOP needed to comply with that are above standard BOP policy for his phone use. Such as 
specific recording of phone calls made, reporting to the SDNY of when phone calls were made, to whom, discussion 
topics, observing or monitoring phone calls, writing memorandums of what they BOP staff may of heard.

I just received clarification on the question that OIG HQ has regarding the underlying case. The question and 
clarification are below. 
• 
In addition to BOP policies, did SDNY have requirements to memorialize Epstein's phone calls related to the 
underlying case? If so, were they followed? 
• 
Did BOP need to take notes on the conversation (since it's not recorded) or were they just required to keep a 
phone number log?"

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 1 of 7 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY, 
Plaintiff, 
No. 20-CV-833(PAE) 
v. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, 
Defendant. 
SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF RUSSELL CAPONE 
I, Russell Capone, hereby declare as follows: 
I. 
I am Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
New York ("USAO-SDNY"). My prior declaration in this matter dated August 5, 2020, details 
my service in this capacity and prior service in the USAO-SDNY. As noted therein, I am familiar 
with the Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the New York Times Company (the 
"FOIA Requests") that are the subject of this case, which seek records related to the 
incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). I am also 
familiar with the responsive records that defendant the Federal Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") has 
withheld in whole or in part pursuant to various FOIA exemptions, including GOP's 
withholdings from the records provided back to BOP by the Office of the Inspector General of 
the Department of Justice ("OIG") since the submission of my August 5, 2020, declaration. 
2. 
The statements contained in this declaration are based on my personal 
knowledge, documents maintained in the files of the USAO-SDNY, conversations with members 
of the Noel and Tartaglione prosecution teams at the USAO-SDNY, public court filings, and 
conclusions made in accordance therewith. 
EFTA00031018
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 2 of 7 
3. 
I submit this declaration in further support of BOP's motion for summary 
judgment in this case. Specifically, this declaration addresses the bases for the withholding in 
whole or in part of certain records provided back to BOP by OIG pursuant to FOIA Exemption 
7(A). 
Records Withheld in Full or in Part from Disclosure Pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
4. 
U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(A) ("Exemption 7(A)") exempts from disclosure "records 
or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production 
of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere 
with enforcement proceedings ...." 
5. 
I and the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution have reviewed each of 
the records provided back to BOP by CMG that BOP withheld in full or in part under Exemption 
7(A) (the "7(A) Returned Records"), including those reflected as withheld in full at Entries 55-
and 60 on the updated index attached to the Supplemental Declaration of Kara Christenson 
(the "updated BOP index"). The 7(A) Returned Records fall into four categories: documents 
related to counts of inmates, staffing records, psychology records, and entries on certain BOP 
logs for August 9 and 10, 2019. Each of these categories fall within the scope of Exemption 
7(A). 
6. 
Public disclosure of the 7(A) Returned Records could reasonably be expected to 
interfere with the pending Noel prosecutions. These records include information about which 
numerous witnesses are expected to testify at trial, details that are not publicly known or known 
to other witnesses, and information and documents prepared by potential trial witnesses. These 
records also include potential trial exhibits, which some or all potential trial witnesses have not 
seen. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information contained therein could 
EFTA00031019
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 3 of 7 
reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or enable 
witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
7. 
Further, premature public disclosure of any of the 7(A) Returned Records could 
reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and 
impartial jury in Noel. The government anticipates that some of these records will be entered 
into evidence as exhibits at trial, and other records that may not be trial exhibits bear on the 
contents of potential trial exhibits. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information 
contained therein could influence potential jurors' understanding of the evidence at trial and the 
case overall. Similarly, premature disclosure of the records and/or the information contained 
therein could prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
would also impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
In addition, as noted above, these records include specific information about which witnesses are 
expected to testify at trial, as well as information and documents prepared by potential trial 
witnesses, such that premature public disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence 
potential jurors' perception of the witnesses and the evidence to be presented at trial. 
8. 
The risks of interference with the Noel proceedings are heightened by the media 
coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. Many publicly-discussed theories of 
Epstein's death are unfounded. Premature release of the withheld records, particularly if the 
records are released in part or without full context, may influence the perception of jurors who 
have been exposed to such media coverage of speculation and theories. 
9. 
The considerations discussed above apply to each of the categories of 7(A) 
Returned Records. 
10. 
First, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
documents related to counts of inmates, including count slips, associated inmate rosters, and 
EFTA00031020
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 4 of 7 
records of rounds and checks, for dates between and including July 23, 2019, and August 12, 
2019, will be the subject of trial testimony at the Noel trial. 7(A) Returned Records containing 
such documents are noted at Entry 55 of the updated BOP index.' In addition, the government 
anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. Releasing these materials 
prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial, 
allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence, identify potential 
government witnesses at the Noel trial, and/or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness 
testimony or evidence. 
II. 
One subcategory of these documents are records from the Special Housing Unit 
(the "SHU"), specifically rosters of inmates in the SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and SHU 
records showing which BOP employees conducted rounds in the SHU. Although BOP had 
previously withheld six pages of these records in full, included at Entries 22, 34 and 37 of the 
prior index submitted by BOP, the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution and I 
determined that these records could be released in part without interfering with the Noel 
prosecution, provided that information on these records showing details of the occupants of the 
SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and which BOP employees conducted rounds in the SHU was 
redacted. Releasing such information prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence 
witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to 
In reviewing the records returned to BOP by OIG, the prosecutors responsible for the Noel and 
Tartaglione prosecutions and I determined that a one-page attorney visit room inventory log, 
dated July 21, 2019, and an 18-page inmate census roster, dated August 9, 2019, each of which 
BOP had previously withheld in full under Exemption 7(A), could be released without a 
reasonable expectation of interference with the Noel or Tartaglione prosecutions. The attorney 
visit room inventory log was previously listed at Entry 26 of GOP's index, and the census roster 
was previously included among the count documents noted at Entry 24 of GOP's index. 
EFTA00031021
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 5 of 7 
conform to other evidence, identify potential government witnesses at the Noel trial, and/or 
influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
12. 
Second, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
MCC staffing records, including daily assignment rosters for the MCC on July 23, August 9, and 
10, 2019, will be the subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. 7(A) Returned Records 
containing such documents are noted at Entry 56 of the updated BOP index? In addition, the 
government anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. Releasing these 
materials prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony 
at trial, allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence, and/or 
influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
13. 
Third, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
certain psychological notes and records of Epstein prepared by BOP may be trial exhibits, the 
subject of witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. 7(A) 
Returned Records containing such documents are noted at Entry 57 of the updated BOP index. 
Premature disclosure of these records could influence the testimony of potential witnesses, 
including by potentially causing them to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other 
evidence. In addition, premature disclosure of these records could reasonably be expected to 
prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which would impair 
the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
14. 
Fourth, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
entries in certain BOP logs for August 9 and 10, 2019, may be trial exhibits, the subject of 
The daily assignment rosters included in the 7(A) Returned Records appear identical to the 
daily assignment rosters BOP previously located and withheld in response to the FOIA Requests, 
except that they contain a different date stamp, which I understand to indicate when they were 
electronically generated. 
EFTA00031022
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 6 of 7 
witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. 7(A) Returned 
Records containing such documents are noted at Entry 60 of the updated BOP index. Premature 
disclosure of these materials could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential 
testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, and/or 
influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
7(A) Returned Records Withheld in Part from Disclosure Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Tartaglione 
15. 
The release of portions of two 7(A) Returned Records could also be reasonably 
expected to interfere with the Tartaglione prosecution. First, portions of psychological records, 
withheld in full as noted at Entry 57 of the updated BOP index, concerning the circumstances of 
Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, could reasonably be expected to interfere 
with the prosecution of Tartaglione. Second, premature release of one of the entries in a 
lieutenant's log dated July 23, 2019, concerning the circumstances of Epstein's apparent suicide 
attempt on that date, could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of 
Tartaglione. 
16. 
As discussed in my prior declaration, Tartaglione's interactions with Epstein in 
July 2019 have been placed at issue by Tartaglione's defense counsel, specifically in connection 
with the potential penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione. See Letter dated January 13, 
2010, Dkt. No. 186, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK); Letter dated January 
21, 2020, Dkt. No. 193, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK). In light of defense 
counsel's position, the information contained in the psychological records and in the entry in the 
lieutenant's log may be relevant evidence in any possible penalty phase of the case against 
Tartaglione. In that event, premature release of the information could reasonably be expected to 
EFTA00031023
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 7 of 7 
adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential jurors' perceptions of 
Tartaglione, thereby impairing the district court's ability to scat a fair and impartial jury. 
Segregabilitv 
17. 
The 7(A) Returned Records withheld in full are exempt from disclosure in their 
entirety under Exemption 7(A). To the extent the records contain any non-exempt information, 
such information is inextricably intertwined with information that could reasonably be expected 
to interfere with the Noel prosecution for the reasons discussed above. As noted in my previous 
declaration, the media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death makes the 
segregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult because providing 
information pertaining to Epstein without complete context risks contributing to the 
dissemination of speculation and theories about his death. This, in turn, could reasonably be 
expected to interfere with the district court's ability to seat a fair and impartial jury in Noel, for 
the reasons discussed above. 
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true 
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. 
Executed this p2- day of January 2021.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY, 
Plaintiff, 
No. 20-CV-833(PAE) 
v. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, 
Defendant. 
DECLARATION OF RUSSELL CAPONE 
I, Russell Capone, hereby declare as follows: 
1. 
I am Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney in the United States Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of New York ("USAO-SDNY"). I have served in this capacity 
since June 2020. Prior to my current role, I served as Deputy Chief and then Chief of the Public 
Corruption Unit in the USAO-SDNY from July 2017 and as an Assistant United States Attorney 
from January 2011. I supervised the Noel prosecution directly in my prior role as Chief of the 
Public Corruption Unit, and I play a supervisory role over both the Noel and Tartaglione 
prosecutions in my current role as Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney. 
2. 
I am familiar with the Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the New 
York Times Company (the "FOIA Requests") that are the subject of this case, which seek 
records related to the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
("MCC"). I am also familiar with the responsive records that defendant the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons ("BOP") has withheld pursuant to exemptions 5, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(E), and 7(F) of FOIA, 5 
U.S.C. § 552(b)(5)-(7). In addition, I am familiar with the proceedings in United States of

America v. Noel, 19-CR-830 (Al), and United States of America v. Tartaglione, 16-CR-832 
(KMK). True and correct copies of the Indictment filed in Noel on November 19, 2019 (the 
"Noel Indictment"), and the Superseding Indictment filed in Tartaglione on April 16, 2019 (the 
"Tartaglione Indictment"), are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B, respectively. The statements 
contained in this declaration are based on my personal knowledge, documents maintained in the 
files of the USAO-SDNY, conversations with members of the Noel and Tartaglione prosecution 
teams at the USAO-SDNY, public court filings, and conclusions made in accordance therewith. 
3. 
I submit this declaration in support of BOP's motion for summary judgment in 
this case. 
The Prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein 
4. 
On July 2, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was charged with one count of conspiracy to 
commit sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one count of sex trafficking, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and 
thereafter incarcerated at the MCC until his death. 
5. 
On July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the Special Housing Unit ("SHU") at 
the MCC due to, among other things, a risk of suicidality and safety concerns relating to housing 
him with the MCC's general population. On July 18, 2019, a bond hearing as to Epstein was 
held before the Honorable Richard M. Berman, after which the Court granted the government's 
motion for remand and denied Epstein's motion for pretrial release. See Noel Indictment 1 10. 
6. 
On July 23, 2019, MCC officers responded to an emergency call and found 
Epstein on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. See Noel Indictment 
11. Michael Thomas, a correctional officer at the MCC and one of the defendants in the Noel 
case, was one of the MCC officials who responded to this incident. See id. Epstein was 
subsequently transferred out of the SHU, placed on suicide watch for 24 hours, and then 
EFTA00031026
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 3 of 13 
transferred to psychological observation, a different status in a different location within MCC's 
hospital ward, until July 30, 2019. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to the SHU. 
See /dill 11-13. 
7. 
On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found in his cell, not responsive and with a 
noose around his neck. See id.1 26. He was transferred to a local hospital where he was 
declared dead shortly thereafter. See id. 1 27. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the 
City of New York conducted an autopsy and determined that Epstein had committed suicide by 
hanging himself. See id. 
8. 
On August 29, 2019, following a public hearing on August 27, 2019, Judge 
Berman entered an order of nolle prosequi against Epstein. See Nolle Prosequi, Dkt. No. 52, 
United States v. Epstein, No. 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) (S.D.N.Y.). 
The Prosecution of Tova Noel and Michael Thomas 
9. 
As alleged in the Noel Indictment, Thomas and Tova Noel were correctional 
officers on duty at the SHU on August 9-10, 2019, the night of Epstein's death. See Noel 
Indictment 11 3-4. On that night, Noel and Thomas repeatedly failed to perform mandated 
counts of prisoners under their watch, including Epstein. To conceal this failure, they repeatedly 
signed false certifications attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates, when, in 
truth, they had not conducted such counts. See id. 11 15-24. On November 19, 2019, Noel and 
Thomas were charged in the Noel Indictment with one count of conspiring to defraud the United 
States and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title 18, United States 
Code, Section 371; and five counts as to Noel and three counts as to Thomas of making or using 
a false writing or document, in violation of Tide 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(3) and 
(2). Noel Indictment ¶9[ 28-40. The Noel case is pending before the Honorable Analisa Torres. 
Trial has been scheduled to begin on January 4, 2021.

The Prosecution and Incarceration of Nicholas Tartaglione 
10. 
In a superseding indictment filed on April 16, 2019, Nicholas Tartaglione was 
charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics, in violation of Title 21, United 
States Code, Section 846; four counts of intentional killing in furtherance of a drug trafficking 
crime, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 848(e)(1)(A) and Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 2; three counts of murder through the use of a firearm in furtherance of a 
drug trafficking crime, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 924(j) and 2; one 
count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, in violation of Title 18, United State Code, Section 
1201; four counts of kidnapping resulting in death, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
Sections 1201(a)(1) and 2; and four counts of using a facility of interstate commerce to commit a 
crime of violence in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1952 and 2. These 
charges arise from the April 2016 murders of Martin Luna, Miguel Luna, Urbano Santiago, and 
Hector Gutierrez. On April 19, 2019, USAO-SDNY filed a Notice of Intent to Seek the Death 
Penalty against Tartaglione. The Tartaglione case is pending before the Honorable Kenneth M. 
Karns. No trial date has been set. 
II. 
Tartaglione has been detained since he was arrested on December 19, 2016. For 
certain periods of his detention, including in July 2019, Tartaglione was housed at the MCC. In 
early July 2019, Tartaglione was transferred to the MCC's SHU. For a time, including on July 
23, 2019, Tartaglione was housed in the same SHU cell as Jeffrey Epstein. 
Records Withheld from Disclosure Pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
12. 
U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(A) ("Exemption 7(A)") exempts from disclosure "records 
or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production 
EFTA00031028
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 5 of 13 
of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere 
with enforcement proceedings ...." 
13. 
I and the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution have reviewed each of 
the records responsive to the FOIA requests withheld in full or in part under Exemption 7(A), 
including those reflected on the index prepared by BOP and attached to the declaration of Kara 
Christenson (the "BOP index"). All of these records fall within the scope of Exemption 7(A). 
14. 
Public disclosure of the records withheld under Exemption 7(A) could reasonably 
be expected to interfere with the pending prosecutions of Noel and Thomas. These records 
include information about which numerous witnesses are expected to testify at trial, include 
details that are not publicly known or known to other witnesses, and include information and 
documents authored by potential trial witnesses. These records also include potential trial 
exhibits, which some or all potential trial witnesses have not seen, and premature disclosure of 
those materials could influence witness testimony at trial, or enable witnesses to change or shape 
their testimony. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information contained therein 
could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or allow 
witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
15. 
Further, premature public disclosure of the records withheld under Exemption 
7(A) could reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to 
seat a fair and impartial jury in Noel. The government anticipates that some of the records 
withheld under Exemption 7(A) will be entered into evidence as exhibits at trial, and other 
records that may not be trial exhibits bear on the contents of potential trial exhibits. Premature 
disclosure of these records, or the information contained therein, could influence potential jurors' 
understanding of the evidence at trial and the case overall. Similarly, premature disclosure of the 
records could prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
EFTA00031029
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 6 of 13 
would also impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
In addition, as noted above, these records include specific information about which witnesses are 
expected to testify at trial, as well as information and documents authored by potential trial 
witnesses, such that premature public disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence 
potential jurors' perception of the witnesses and the evidence to be presented at trial. 
16. 
The risks of interference with the Noel proceedings are heightened by the media 
coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. Many publicly-discussed theories of 
Epstein's death are unfounded. Premature release of the withheld records, particularly if the 
records are released in part or without full context, may influence the perception of jurors who 
have been exposed to such media coverage of speculation and theories. 
Non-Email Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
17. 
The considerations discussed above apply to each of the categories of responsive 
non-email records withheld in full or in part by BOP under Exemption 7(A). 
18. 
First, the government anticipates that MCC staffing records, including overtime 
logs and daily assignment rosters for the MCC on July 22, July 23 August 9, and 10, 2019 and 
some of the dates in between, will be the subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. In 
addition, the government anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. 
Releasing these materials prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' 
potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, 
or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
19. 
Second, the government anticipates that reports and memoranda prepared by 
BOP, such as the reports, memoranda, photographs, and evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 
apparent suicide attempt; reports, memoranda, and letters concerning Epstein's August 10, 2019 
EFTA00031030
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 7 of 13 
suicide and surrounding events; documents in BOP's possession from the New York City Office 
of Chief Medical Examiner; and reports and letters concerning MCC's and BOP's response to 
Epstein's death, may be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, or were prepared by 
witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these materials could reasonably be 
expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their 
testimony to conform to other evidence, or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness 
testimony or evidence. Alternatively, if evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 suicide attempt or 
August 10, 2019 suicide and surrounding events is excluded from evidence at trial, pre-trial 
publication of these materials would risk exposing potential jurors for or against the defendants 
in the Noel action on the basis of material they would otherwise not be shown during trial, which 
would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
20. 
Third, the government anticipates that certain medical and psychological records 
of Epstein prepared by BOP may be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, and/or were 
prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these records could 
influence the testimony of potential witnesses, including by potentially causing them to alter or 
confirm their testimony. In addition, premature disclosure of these records could reasonably be 
expected to prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
21. 
Fourth, the government anticipates that documents related to counts of inmates, 
including logs, count slips, and rosters, and other entries in BOP logs for August 9 and 10 may 
be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will 
testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these materials could reasonably be expected to influence 
witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to 
other evidence, and/or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
EFTA00031031
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 8 of 13 
22. 
Fifth, the government anticipates that an August 8, 2019, review of inmates in the 
SHU prepared by BOP may be a trial exhibit, the subject of witness testimony, and/or was 
prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of this record could 
reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or allow witnesses 
to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
Email Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
23. 
The considerations discussed above also apply to each of the categories of 
responsive email documents withheld in full or in part by BOP under Exemption 7(A). 
24. 
First, emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, his 
incarceration prior to his suicide, and his mental health, including emails written by BOP's 
Psychology Services, discuss topics and information that the government anticipates may be the 
subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. Their disclosure could influence witness 
testimony, including by allowing witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, 
or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. Alternatively, as 
described above, if evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 suicide attempt or is excluded from 
evidence at trial, pre-trial publication of these materials would risk exposing potential jurors for 
or against the defendants in the Noel action on the basis of material they would otherwise not be 
shown during trial, which would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a 
fair and impartial jury. 
25. 
Second, emails relating to Epstein's death, investigations into Epstein's death, the 
circumstances of his suicide, and the BOP's response to Epstein's death discuss topics and 
information that the government anticipates will be relevant to and/or the subject of witness 
testimony at the Noel trial. Their disclosure could influence witness testimony, including by 
EFTA00031032
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 9 of 13 
allowing witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, or influence potential 
jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. Alternatively, as described above, if 
evidence of Epstein's suicide is excluded from evidence at trial, pre-trial publication of these 
materials would risk exposing potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action on 
the basis of material they would otherwise not be shown during trial, which would impair the 
government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
26. 
Providing more detailed public descriptions of the withheld documents and how 
their release would interfere with the Noel prosecution would itself risk interfering with the Noel 
prosecution. For example, public disclosure of more detailed descriptions of the documents 
anticipated to be proffered as exhibits at trial, or that bear on other trial exhibits, would disclose 
elements of the Government's trial strategy in Noel, including its selection of trial exhibits and 
the anticipated content of witness testimony. More detailed public descriptions could also 
prematurely disclose how the prosecution team expects the trial to proceed. 
Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference With Tartaglione 
27. 
In the course of reviewing the responsive records that BOP has withheld pursuant 
to Exemption 7(A), prosecutors in the Criminal Division of the USAO-SDNY determined that 
certain of the records refer to or discuss Tartaglione (the "Tartaglione Records"). Upon 
determining that some of the records withheld by BOP refer to or discuss Tartaglione, USAO-
SDNY reviewed these records to determine whether their release would interfere with the 
pending criminal action against Tartaglione. USAO-SDNY has concluded that release of certain 
of the withheld records could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of 
Tartaglione. This constitutes a basis to withhold these records under Exemption 7(A), 
independent from the likely interference with the Noel prosecution discussed above. 
EFTA00031033
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 10 of 13 
28. 
The Tartaglione Records fall within several categories of responsive documents 
withheld by BOP and include reports and evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide 
attempt; reports and evidence of Epstein's death on August 10, 2019; email correspondence 
between Tartaglione's attorneys and legal counsel at the MCC; and medical and psychological 
records of Epstein prepared by BOP. The Tartaglione Records also include emails pertaining to 
Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, Epstein's mental and physical health, and 
Epstein's incarceration prior to his suicide. 
29. 
The Tartaglione Records fall within the scope of 7(A) because their disclosure 
could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of Tartaglione. The Tartaglione 
Records contain, among other things, information about Tartaglione's incarceration, including 
the period of time during which Tartaglione was Epstein's cellmate at the MCC, which includes 
the date of Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019. The conditions of Tartaglione's 
confinement at the MCC, as well as his interactions with Epstein in July 2019, have been put 
directly at issue by Tartaglione's defense counsel, specifically in connection with the potential 
penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione. See Letter dated January 13, 2010, Dkt. No. 186, 
United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (ICMK); Letter dated January 21, 2020, Dkt. No. 
193, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK). In light of defense counsel's position, 
information contained in the Tartaglione Records may be relevant evidence in any possible 
penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione, and as a result, premature public disclosure of the 
Tartaglione Records could reasonably be expected to influence witness testimony and/or 
potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
30. 
Moreover, the nature of the charges against Epstein and the circumstances of his 
apparent suicide attempt and death create a risk that premature public disclosure of the 
Tartaglione Records could reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the 
EFTA00031034
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 11 of 13 
defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury in Tartaglione, particularly for purposes of a 
potential penalty-phase hearing required by 18 U.S.C. § 3593, by influencing potential juror 
perceptions of any interactions between Epstein and Tartaglione. 
31. 
The risks of interference with the Tartaglione proceedings are heightened by the 
media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. As noted previously, many 
publicly-discussed theories of Epstein's death are unfounded. The public dissemination of these 
theories increases the risk that premature release of the Tartaglione Records could influence 
witness testimony or jurors' perceptions, if records are released in part or without full context. 
32. 
The Tartaglione Records include several categories of records withheld by BOP. 
Specifically, the government anticipates that premature disclosure of the reports and evidence of 
Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt; an inmate investigative report prepared prior to 
Epstein's death; reports and evidence of Epstein's death on August 10, 2019; email 
correspondence between Tartaglione's attorneys and legal counsel at the MCC; the August 8, 
2019 review of inmates in the SHU at MCC; and the medical and psychological records of 
Epstein prepared by BOP, including documents pertaining to his mental health, could reasonably 
be expected to adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential jurors' 
perceptions of Tartaglione, thereby impairing the district court's ability to seat a fair and 
impartial jury. In addition, emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, 
Epstein's mental health, and Epstein's incarceration prior to his suicide, including emails that 
involve members of the defense or prosecution teams in Tartaglione, discuss topics and 
information that could adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential 
juror's perceptions of Tartaglione. These records likewise could reasonably be expected to 
impair the district court's ability to seat a fair and impartial jury.

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 12 of 13 
33. 
Providing more detailed public descriptions of the withheld documents and how 
their release would affect the Tartaglione prosecution would itself risk interfering with the 
Tartaglione prosecution. For example, public disclosure of more detailed descriptions would 
potentially implicate and publicize associations, interactions, or perceptions of associations or 
interactions between Tartaglione and Epstein, thereby risking influencing potential jurors in 
proceedings against Tartaglione, including for any sentencing hearing required by 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3593. 
Segregability 
34. 
The records withheld in full under Exemption 7(A) are exempt from disclosure in 
their entirety under Exemption 7(A). To the extent the records contain any non-exempt 
information, such information is inextricably intertwined with information that could reasonably 
be expected to interfere with the Noel and/or Tartaglione prosecutions for the reasons discussed 
above. The media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death makes the 
segregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult because providing 
information pertaining to Epstein (or Tartaglione and Epstein) without complete context can 
reasonably be expected to contribute to the dissemination of speculation and theories about his 
death. This, in turn, could reasonably be expected to interfere with the district court's ability to 
seat a fair and impartial jury in proceedings against Noel, Thomas, and/or Tartaglione, including 
for any sentencing hearing required by 18 U.S.C. § 3593, for the reasons discussed above.

TOVA NOEL and

INDICTMENT 
16-(IUM 830 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as 
correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
("MCC"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners 
under their watch in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). 
Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS 
sat at their desk, browsed the Internet, and moved around the 
common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their 
duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications 
attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in 
truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result 
of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU 
were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as 
a result of the defendants' conduct, no correctional officer 
conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 
EFTA00031039
--- PAGE 16 ---
Cagage2D19-698C3830A1E1 ODmcaunmwnt2f2-Fil€dEklagIfl20'a@ageB b021 
p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
which time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body 
of an MCC inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide 
overnight while unobserved. 
RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES 
2. 
The MCC is a federal administrative detention 
facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons ("BOP"). 
The MCC is one of several facilities used to 
house inmates who have been charged with federal crimes in the 
Southern District of New York and are awaiting trial. 
The MCC 
employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the 
care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. 
3. 
TOVA NOEL, the defendant, has been employed as a 
correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016. As of 
August 2019, NOEL's primary assignment was the SHU. On August 9, 
2019, NOEL worked a regular shift from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. in the 
SHU, and then worked an overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
August 10, 2019, also in the SHU. NOEL had also worked a regular 
shift in the SHU the day before, August 8, 2019, from 12 p.m. to 
p.m. 
4. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, has been employed as 
a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2007. 
Beginning in approximately 2013, THOMAS was assigned to work as a 
EFTA00031040

materials handler supervisor, although THOMAS regularly worked 
overtime shifts as a correctional officer, including in the SHU. 
THOMAS worked an overtime shift in the SHU on August 10, 2019, 
from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. THOMAS did not work his regular shift on 
August 8 or August 9, 2019, but did work an overtime shift in the 
SHU on August 9, 2019 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
5. As 
detailed 
herein, 
Jeffrey 
Epstein 
was 
incarcerated at the MCC between his arrest on July 6, 2019, and 
his suicide on August 10, 2019. 
Epstein was detained pending 
trial in the Southern District of New York on sex trafficking 
charges. 
THE MCC AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTS 
6. The MCC, which houses approximately 750 inmates at 
any given time, assigns inmates to various housing units within 
the MCC. The SHU is a housing unit within the MCC where inmates 
are securely separated from the general inmate population to ensure 
their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates. 
The SHU is located on the ninth floor of the MCC, and access to 
that floor is controlled by a locked door that can be opened 
remotely only by an officer in the MCC's centralized control center 
(the "Control Center"), which is located on the first floor of the 
MCC. Access into the SHU is also controlled by a second locked 
door to which only correctional officers assigned to the SHU have 
EFTA00031041
--- PAGE 18 ---
Caeage2DIS-O1:69930933- famaurremtZe-FilaldclagLIS2CPagarii 2,021 
keys while on duty. Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to six 
separate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single 
locked door to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
have keys while on duty. Each tier has eight cells, each of which 
can house either one or two prisoners, and each individual cell - 
which is made of cement and metal - is accessed only through a 
single locked door, to which only correctional officers assigned 
to the SHU have keys while on duty. 
7. 
The BOP requires correctional officers assigned to 
guard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide counts of 
inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate 
is alive and accounted for within the MCC (the "institutional 
count"). On weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts 
at 4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. Performing an 
institutional count is one of the most basic and essential aspects 
of a correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most 
basic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. Two 
officers are required to perform the institutional count for each 
housing unit, including the SHU, and are further required to 
document their performance of the count on an official MCC form 
called a count slip. 
To perform the institutional count in the 
SHU, two officers must walk from tier to tier to observe and count 
each individual inmate. 
EFTA00031042
--- PAGE 19 ---
Cae.age2DI9-698C38304(E IlDoonurreentZe-FilklalagO5120)a@aeci3 b021 
8. On the count slip, both correctional officers are 
required to fill in the date and time the count was performed, 
write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
counted, and then sign the count slip. 
Once the correctional 
officers have completed and signed the count slips, the count slips 
are then collected and delivered to the Control Center, where 
officers within the Control Center are responsible for comparing 
the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate 
roster to ensure that each inmate is accounted for. Only after 
all the count slips are collected from each housing unit, and the 
numbers on the slips are matched to the institution's inmate 
roster, can the institutional count be deemed "cleared" or 
completed. 
If a housing unit's count slip is incorrect or 
incomplete, then the institution cannot "clear" the count. 
Instead, the count must be completely redone in that housing unit 
via a more-intensive version of the institutional count called a 
"bed book count," in which officers must compare every individual 
inmate to the institution's inmate roster. 
Records of each 
institutional count, including the count slips, are provided to a 
supervising official and retained by the MCC. 
9. 
In addition to the institutional count, the BOP 
requires correctional officers assigned to the SHU to walk each of 
the tiers of the SHU - which is called a "round" - every thirty

Cagage21:1419-6933830,413- IIDmoturremt2I2-FilalEklIMS2Pagefeol 2,021 
minutes ("30-minute rounds"). 
Like the institutional counts, 
correctional officers conduct 30-minute rounds to ensure that each 
inmate is alive and accounted for within his cell. Correctional 
officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form, which 
is reviewed and signed by their supervisor, documenting the date 
and time of each 30-minute round in each tier of the SHU. 
EPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT 
10. On July 6, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein was 
arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. On 
July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the SHU due to, among other 
things, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns relating 
to housing him with the MCC's general population. 
11. On July 23, 2019, while Epstein was housed in the 
SHU, MCC officers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein 
on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, was one of the MCC officers who 
responded to the incident. Epstein was subsequently transferred 
out of the SHU and was placed on suicide watch. 
Inmates placed 
on suicide watch are housed in a cell on the hospital wing floor 
of the MCC, and are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff 
member or a specially trained inmate companion. 
12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately 
twenty-four hours, and then was transferred to psychological

cEl 2,021 
observation, until July 30, 2019. 
Psychological observation is 
less restrictive than suicide watch, but inmates are still housed 
in the hospital wing of the MCC and watched twenty-four hours a 
day. 
13. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to 
the SHU, and, at the direction of the MCC's psychological staff, 
was required to have an assigned cellmate. 
Epstein was also 
assigned to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk in 
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately fifteen feet 
from the cell. Conducting the required institutional counts and 
thirty-minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's 
procedures for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
EVENTS OF AUGUST 9-10, 2019 
14. On 
August 
9, 
2019, 
Epstein's 
cellmate 
was 
transferred out of the MCC in a routine, pre-arranged transfer at 
approximately 8 a.m. 
Despite the MCC's psychological staff's 
direction that Epstein have a cellmate, no new cellmat6 was 
assigned to Epstein's cell. 
15. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, was one of the assigned 
officers on duty in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to 8 
a.m. on August 10. 
From 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., two other officers 
were on duty with NOEL in the SHU: one officer was assigned to 
work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. ("Officer-1"), and one officer was 
EFTA00031045
--- PAGE 22 ---
Caeage2D1S-(093C3830 
IlDoonurrentZ12-FilEalalagi151200agagc9 3021 
assigned to work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. ("Officer-2"). MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12 a.m. on 
August 10. From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS 
were the only two officers on duty in the SHU. 
16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to 
a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the SHU, including 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for 
conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 
9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL, THOMAS and 
the other officers on duty were also responsible for completing 
paperwork attesting to each of those counts. While, as detailed 
herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, 
in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 
17. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-1 were 
responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the 
SHU. As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system 
makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip 
that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been 
performed. 
In reliance on that falsified count slip, at 
approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. 
count. 
EFTA00031046
--- PAGE 23 ---

18. That evening, Epstein returned to the SHU from his 
attorney visit and was escorted into his cell by TOVA NOEL, the 
defendant, and another officer at approximately 7:49 p.m. 
NOEL 
and the other officer left the tier in which Epstein was housed 
immediately thereafter. 
19. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were 
locked in their cells for the night. At or around that time, TOVA 
NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting 
the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. However, video from 
the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and 
Officer-2 did not perform the 10 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL 
and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating 
that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been performed. 
In 
reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 10:36 p.m., 
the Control Center cleared the 10 p.m. count. 
20. As reflected on video obtained from the MCC's 
internal video surveillance system, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on 
August 9, 2019 - after TOVA NOEL, the defendant, had signed and 
submitted the 10 p.m. count slip and the institutional count had 
been completed - NOEL briefly walked up to, and then walked back 
from, the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed. 
As 
confirmed by the video obtained from the MCC's internal video 
surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any 
EFTA00031047
--- PAGE 24 ---
Caetaae201-00303319443 flayawnenit22-E ilaleicill8KB720Pagale 318021 
correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only 
entrance to the tier in which Epstein was housed until 
approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
21. Officer-l's shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., 
and at approximately 12 a.m., MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, 
replaced Officer-2, joining TOVA NOEL, the defendant, as the only 
two correctional officers on duty in the SHU. 
NOEL and THOMAS 
were responsible for conducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in 
the SHU. 
As confirmed by video from the MCC's internal video 
surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not perform the 12 a.m. 
count. Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count 
slip for the 12 a.m. count that falsely stated that the 
institutional count had been performed. 
In reliance on that 
falsified count slip, at approximately 12:49 a.m., the Control 
Center cleared the 12 a.m. count. 
22. TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were 
additionally responsible for conducting the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts in the SHU. As confirmed by video from the 
MCC's internal video surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not 
perform either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. counts. NOEL and THOMAS 
nonetheless completed and signed count slips for both counts that 
falsely stated that they had performed the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts. In reliance on those falsified count slips, 
EFTA00031048
--- PAGE 25 ---
Caetale2DISLOGGCB319443 Macturreerit22-FilcaleidiE0312Pagla iff 2,021 
at approximately 3:24 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., the Control Center 
cleared the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts, respectively. 
23. Moreover, despite the requirement that officers on 
duty in the SHU conduct and document regular, 30-minute rounds, 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, did not perform any 
of the required 30-minute rounds during their shift between 
approximately 12 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. 
Nonetheless, NOEL completed 
and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute round entries falsely 
affirming that they had, in fact, conducted such rounds. 
24. During the night, instead of completing the 
required counts and rounds, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the 
defendants, were seated at the correctional officers' desk in the 
SHU common area (as noted above, approximately 15 feet from 
Epstein's cell), used the computers, and moved around the SHU 
common area. 
For a period of approximately two hours, NOEL and 
THOMAS sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been 
asleep. NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the night, 
including to search the Internet for furniture sales and benefit 
websites. THOMAS used the computer briefly around 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 
and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
25. At approximately 4 a.m., the overnight supervisor 
briefly visited NOEL and THOMAS in the SHU, and conferred with 
NOEL and THOMAS, who were seated at and around the officers' desk, 
EFTA00031049
--- PAGE 26 ---
CaCage21112, 003033113AEr IlDactuntertt22-filcd8ida3305i2Pagag2 13 3021 
before leaving. At approximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional 
officer briefly walked through the SHU common area. Aside from 
those two officers, as confirmed by video surveillance, no one 
else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds 
throughout the night, and no one entered the tier in which Epstein 
was housed. 
26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL 
THOMAS and TOVA NOEL, the defendants, received a delivery of 
breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the 
only officers in the SHU. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS 
walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to 
serve breakfast. 
At approximately 6:33 a.m., an alarm was 
activated in the SHU. 
Epstein was alone in his cell and not 
responsive, with a noose around his neck. A supervisor who had 
just started his shift ("Supervisor-1") responded to the alarm 
almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to 
the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 
that "Epstein hung himself." 
After arriving in the SHU, 
Supervisor-1 spoke with THOMAS and NOEL. NOEL told Supervisor-1 
"we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds." THOMAS stated, 
" we messed up," and "I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't do 
any rounds."

27. Epstein was transferred to a local hospital where 
he was declared dead shortly thereafter. The Office of the Chief 
Medical Examiner of the City of New York conducted an autopsy and 
determined that Epstein had committed suicide by hanging himself.

Sasse Statement on Arrests of 
Epstein's Guards 
"These arrests are important, but they're not the end of this: These guards 
aren't the only ones who should stand trial - every one of Jeffrey Epstein's co-
conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars." 
Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who 
warned the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to come to today's oversight hearing prepared to 
give answers, issued the following statement regarding the arrests of two of Jeffrey Epstein's 
EFTA00031081
--- PAGE 2 ---
prison guards. 
"Good. Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died. The Bureau of Prisons and the 
Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are 
important, but they're not the end of this: These guards aren't the only ones who should stand 
trial - every one of Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives 
behind bars." 
Background: 
On November 13 Sasse told the Director of Bureau of Prisons to show up to today's hearing 
prepared to answer questions. 
On August 19, when Attorney General Barr removed the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, 
Sasse praised the move and called for more answers. 
On August 13, Sasse urged Attorney General Barr to rip up the plea deal with Epstein that still 
shields his co-conspirators. That letter is available here. 
On August 10, the day of Epstein's death, Sasse wrote to Attorney General Barr demanding that 
"heads must roll" and asking transparency questions to make sure the DOJ answers for the 
miscarriage of justice. 
In February 2019, at Sasse's insistence the Department of Justice opened an investigation into 
its handling of Epstein, who was charged with running a child sex trafficking ring in New York and 
Florida, among other locations. 
On January 15 2019 during his confirmation hearing, William Barr, the President's nominee for 
Attorney General, publicly committed to making sure that the DOJ responded to Senator Sasse's 
questions into the Epstein case and that they would prioritize the prosecution of sex-trafficking. 
In late 2018, Sasse repeatedly pushed the DOJ to investigate the sweetheart deal 
that Epstein received.

Subject: NY law speech

As a result of this new law, victims of childhood sexual abuse whose voices were never heard and whose stories were 
never told have now been given a new chance to come forward, to share their experiences, and to vindicate their rights, 
all goals wholeheartedly shared by my Office, which is committed to using the federal criminal law to the maximum extent 
possible to investigate and prosecute those who sexually abuse and traffic minors. 
As many of you know, last year, my Office brought criminal sex trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein, a serial predator 
who, over a period of years, abused dozens and potentially hundreds of young girls. To do so, we relied on the courage of 
many young women who were victimized as minors and who were willing -- years after their abuse — to share their 
stories. And while Epstein committed suicide before he could face trial, our investigation into his co-conspirators 
continues. 
As I have said publicly before, we can only do the work we do with the assistance of victims willing to come forward. By 
providing victims of childhood sexual abuse with a new opportunity to be heard, this law marks not only an important 
step for victims' rights but will help facilitate the work of law enforcement in identifying and prosecuting those who prey 
on and seek to do harm to our most vulnerable.

M. 
Following up on our brief discussion of this issue earlier this month, I wanted to see if you had any additional thoughts on 
how to handle requests from counsel for plaintiffs who are suing Epstein and his estate who ask us for information or 
materials in connection with our investigation — I think you had said we should instruct them to submit Touhy Requests, 
and that you would designate a Civil Division person to whom we could have them direct those requests. If that's right, 
could you please let us know who that person will be? So far we've just gotten the request from one plaintiff's counsel, 
Robbie Kaplan at Kaplan Hecker, and her request is very narrow but we want to set up the system in a way that will work if 
we get additional and/or more expansive requests going forward. And we would like to let her know how she should 
proceed relatively soon because that case has a status conference on January 10 and I think they'd like to make the 
request before then. 
Please let us know if any other information would be helpful, and thanks as always.

To the extent anybody in this small group is willing to share, are any of you folks' teams / cases getting significant

memos that are both extremely time-intensive and also couldn't possibly be acted upon for weeks, given the

The PAE issue of case prioritization seems to be getting worse and we wanted to get your thoughts. The-
was put on the priority list back in September but the team is 
unfortunately now back to getting the answer from PAE/database managers that there are only 2 priority cases that is 
taking up all of the PAE resources, Epstein and 377 Union Street. ThE
team sent search warrant returns to PAE on 
9/22 and followed up yesterday to see if there was any ETA on getting them loaded and were told no. I completely 
understand that not all jobs can be a rush job but am hopeful that we can find a way for some of the PAE bandwidth to be 
reserved to load data in the normal course. If there could be a set expectation in terms of a timeline by which PAE is 
expected to load data in the normal course, I think that would be helpful guidance for us to provide to our unit so they 
can plan accordingly. 
Happy to discuss.

Yes, this looks good, thanks — I made one more typo correction in the attached (in the new Trust Two language, "and 
revocations" got repeated in the footnote and the order) but otherwise no changes.

I
made a few small changes (which I highlighted since we've got a fair bit of track already) which 
I think should make this broad enough to cover the Trust II stuff. Can you take a quick look and if everyone is okay with 
this, perhaps we can plan to get this to CM on Monday morning? Thanks

I apologize for the delay on this — I've added the relevant language about revocations to both the application and the 
order, and corrected a stray typo, so that stuff is good to go. But two quick things to note, not to belabor this, but — it 
doesn't look like there's any reference to the Trust Two documents — that may be because they're not referenced in any 
will? At a glance I don't see Trust Two in any of the wills, but I'd want to go back and look more thoroughly unless 
somebody already made the decision on that basis. And second, it references a 2019 Trust but I don't see any documents 
on that? I have to run out tonight but can certainly circle up with El and/or MI tomorrow on any of this, or just ignore 
it if I've misread. 
thanks,

M, is it the intent to share those? If so, I'll just add it to every mention of each document, but if not then it's 
unnecessary. I don't think those are substantive dots but I defer.

Yes, I think this document accurately describes the materials we've received, with just a note that it doesn't appear to 
include revocations, so to the extent those are intended to be shared, I think that word may need to be added.

I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks.

We could also unseal but not have the press office blast it out to the world until tomorrow morning. It's, of course, 
possible word gets out that she's been arrested and folks start asking for it (at which point I assume we could then give it 
to them), although I don't think the Epstein arrest did get out immediately, somewhat surprisingly. 
That said, I also don't have any problem putting out the indictment this afternoon and announcing there will be a press 
conference first thing tomorrow morning. I know Audrey has some concerns about that, but subject to the views of the 
press office, I would think a little delay teased with the details in the indictment would heighten, not diminish, interest in 
the press conference.

We did. The difference is that the courthouse was closed. I think we would do that if it were after business hours. The 
question is whether the same thing applies if she is arrested at 2 p.m. today.

I just looked back at what we did on Epstein, because we obviously dealt with the same issue of him being arrested a 
day or two before the press conference. It looks like we kept it under seal (but gave his lawyers a copy) until Monday 
morning, and did the press conference shortly thereafter. 
That said, I don't feel strongly, particularly if she's arrested late this afternoon, and we plan to do press conference early 
tomorrow morning.

Even 1 pm is sort of late to do a conference today. What are your thoughts about unsealing if she is arrested during 
business hours while our clerk's office is open, but isn't presented until tomorrow?

FYI, the presentment cut off in DNH is 1pm, and if we miss it, she'll get held in a local jail until tomorrow morning. 
Consistent with your views this morning, I might propose that we suggest to Audrey and the press office that if we 
don't have her by 1, we plan to put off the press conference until tomorrow morning, since at that point she won't be 
presented until tomorrow in any event.

Hi M, 
Here's the final version we plan to file in the morning. It's in brief format, at the District of New Hampshire's request. The 
plan is to file it in SDNY and email a copy to the DNH magistrate judge, but let us know if you think we should proceed 
otherwise (the AUSA in DNH didn't seem to have a view on how we should file). We didn't want to file it with New 
Hampshire captions and signature blocks, as much as I would have gotten a kick out of signing as a SAUSA. But let us know 
if you think we should be going about this a different way. 
Thanks!

Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and 
Giglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced 
case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the

These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
these materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it 
has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial.

requesting that they be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged sensitive, 
explicit and personal events concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which they have 
been victims. I believe most, if not all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims 
without their consent, and urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy.

I just had positive conversations with 
and= (and =) -= 
had understood that FBI was getting their own 
hard drive to transfer the data, which obviously makes sense. 
response to 
email was to just have 
order a 12 TB drive, which she expects will get to 
next week. I also think that's a better option than the 2 TB 
drive that I= 
says we have available on short notice, given that we expect the data to be somewhere around 20-40 TB 
(the capacity of the devices we seized is around 40-50 TB). 
I take it from 
email that he's otherwise ready to give us the data, although that certainly would be a new 
development, but we're obviously hopeful that's the case. The key question then will be whether what we get from him 
this time is actually usable. If it's not, I think at that point it will make sense to just have BRG do it — they can physically 
take the devices themselves and do it. We had asked about that possibility from the beginning and CART was resistant, 
but given the past nine months I think we should do it if necessary. But, hopefully the intervention of higher-ups solves 
the problem and we can get the data in the next couple weeks, which would be great.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

Updated item descriptions. Just a side note, many thumb drives and SD cards will not have a serial number 
visible externally, but will report one through our tools. I included those electronically reported serial numbers.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
EFTA00031179
--- PAGE 5 ---
- 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

it would be very helpful for us if you could please use the attached spreadsheet in transmitting that info so we 
make sure we get all the info we need. I think you had previously sent us a list of certain information that unfortunately 
wasn't helpful for us, so we want to make sure we're all on the same page. 
In terms of data transfer, 
are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on 
our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been 
processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one device to 
make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

Subject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents 
Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

I could do Thursday morning, but I think it would be helpful for us to get the accounting in advance of the meeting so we 
can figure out in advance what (if any) additional steps we need — is that possible?

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.) 
many thanks,

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
EFTA00031188
--- PAGE 14 ---
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at 
which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
EFTA00031189
--- PAGE 15 ---
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Hi all, 
Two questions for you. 
1. Do you have 3500 you want to get out tonight? 
2. Khalilah asked me at the end of the day if we could send her a list of all admitted exhibits so far. I've checked my 
notes of what was admitted against the transcript. Does one of you want to send her the attached (and note that 
DXs LV-3A, LV-3B, LV-4, LV-5, and J-3 were also admitted), or would you like me to do so? 
Thanks,

simultaneously? We highlighted some language for your consideration about Judge Nathan's deadlines, happy to discuss.

Guys — I think these are in great shape. The MILs were a major undertaking (on top of intense ongoing witness prep, 
getting 3500 etc. out, and the various miscellaneous issues you've also had to fend off recently). I hope you can all take a 
(brief) breath once this is filed, and relish a bit all you've already accomplished on the road to trial!

Subject: RE: SDNY investigation 
Jill, Kyle, 
Following up on our recent WebEx discussion, and with apologies for the slight delay, we wanted to get you a list of 
initial categories of question that we think might assist in your discussion with your client, with the goal of then doing an 
attorney proffer, or attorney summary, and discussing possible next steps. 
We note that the below questions are simply general thoughts and suggestions—some may not need to be asked at all, 
others may prompt follow-up from you in the moment, etc. In any interviews with us, we ordinarily are guided both by 
the comfort level and the narrative of the witness, but we hope these give you a sense of what we would be interested 
in. We also note that we included questions about sexual contact because it is our very general understanding from you 
that abuse occurred, but we do not make any presumptions about what happened, if anything, separate from what your 
client recalls. On that note, as we've discussed, but to reiterate, if there are any questions or topics your client is 
uncomfortable addressing, there will be no pressure from us to do so, including at this early stage. 
With those caveats, possible questions are below, and please let us know if it would be useful for us to chat again before 
you talk with your client, or otherwise please let us know when it would next be appropriate to check in. 
Questions / topics: 
1) General background queries: Where did you grow up? How far did you go in school? What is your date of birth? 
How generally would you describe your upbringing and early professional life? 
2) How did you initially meet Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and how old were you at that time? What was the 
nature of your work with them, and did the role change over time? How long did you work for Maxwell and/or 
Epstein? 
3) In general, what kinds of tasks did you perform for Maxwell or Epstein, and in what locations? Did you travel with 
either of them? When you weren't traveling with them, where did you reside? Did you ever reside with Maxwell or 
Epstein? If so, where — in what locations and at which properties? 
4) Did there come a time when Epstein and/or Maxwell engaged in sexual contact with you? If so, how did that 
happen the first time? Were there sexualized discussions or was there sexualized conduct leading up to any first 
incident? 
5) Were there other instances when you experienced sexual abuse or sexual contact while working for Maxwell? If so, 
how did those incidents occur? Did they occur with Epstein alone, or was Maxwell ever directly involved in the 
sexual contact? Did Maxwell ever observe, or was she present for, sexual contact that she herself was not 
participating in? Were any other individuals present or participating? 
6) Were you aware of any other girls or women who were subject to sexual abuse or contact by Epstein and/or 
Maxwell, and if so, who? Did you ever see Epstein or Maxwell involved in sexual or other intimate contact with 
other girls you believed or suspected may have been under the age of 18? And if so, under what circumstances 
(when, where, etc.)? 
7) How did your interactions with Epstein and Maxwell end? Did either of them contact you or attempt to contact you 
when Epstein was under investigation in 2006-08? Did either of them contact you or attempt to contact you during 
the New York investigation in 2018-20? If so, what was the nature of that contact? When is the last time you spoke 
with or otherwise interacted with Epstein and/or Maxwell? 
thank you,

I know you're on vacation this week, but wanted to very briefly follow up on the below — I'm going to ask 
to 
mail you the thumb drive referenced below, which has folders for five devices (NYC024332, NYC024369, NYC024369_1, 
NYC024372, and NYC024384) on this coming Monday, so that you'll be around when it arrives (and in case you have to 
sign for it). Per usual, if you could please take a look at it when you receive it, and then send on to PAE for processing 
and upload to Relativity, that would be great. Thank you!!

Following up on the below, thanks for those responses, that's very useful. In terms of the one outstanding item, in the 
thumb drive I received from 
yesterday with CART materials, NYCO27913 is not included, so we are still missing 
that one. 
But I do see that each of the items with the "Included next round" label from the most recent spreadsheet (attached, 
with those items highlighted in red) are included, so that's helpful, thanks. 
In terms of any of the folders that have been produced so far, I know that you've sent supplemental materials on a 
handful of them (approximately seven total, I think) — do you currently expect to send any other supplemental materials 
for any of the devices we've received so far? Or are we fully complete? 
And then assuming those are all fully complete, or once they are, the only items pending will be the devices highlighted 
in gray in the attached, which we understand are being processed for hardware recovery. 
thanks,

The final items were given to 
She should have them. Reach out to her for delivery. 
The 3 folders you mention contain supplemental files, doatirore them. 
I am pretty sure NYC027913 is included with the items 
has. If not, please let me know. 
As far as the old questions, you should have everything now. 
The zero byte files are just that. Sometimes the software will recover either file headers, or items off the 
directory listings, but no actual content. It lists them as zero length files. 
Need anything further, let me know.

1. 
On this past Sunday and Monday, you had said you had you had additional materials you planned to get to us 
on Monday. I don't believe we ever received anything additional this past week. Are those still pending, and if 
so, when can we get those materials?

2. 
There were three folders that were included in the first disc you provided to us, but then also provided again on 
the most recent disc. Those folders are: NYC024328, NYC024366, and NYC024392. Can you please let us know 
why those were provided twice? In particular, we need to know whether any supplemental information is in the 
new folders with those NYC numbers, or whether we can ignore them on the recent disc because we already 
received them. 
3. 
One item is listed on your spreadsheet as having been provided on 7/23, but it was not on the most recent disc 
you sent. That item is: NYC027913 (row 40 in your spreadsheet). 
In case it's useful, I'm attaching a version of the spreadsheet you put on the disc, but with all the items we received 
folders for on the most recent hard drive highlighted in yellow. 
Separately, we're still waiting on answers to the questions from Thursday and Friday, July 23 and 24. To refresh, those 
questions are:

Comparing your most recent spreadsheet to the prior one, and leaving aside the "Nothing for Southern" 
designations as well as the NYC numbers that look like they're for the desktops that held the actual drives we're 
looking at (such as NYC024385, 387, 389, 391, and 393, and NYC027909), I think there are just three additional 
devices listed here that weren't on the spreadsheet you previously sent. I have those as: NYC024328 (row 10), 
NYC024367 (row 62), and NYC027910 (row 96). Please confirm that these were added, and also that we're not 
missing any? I believe those were all provided on the first disc. 
5. 
As previously mentioned, the vendor has advised that in the initial seven devices provided, there were 
approximately 71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files). They are listed in the second attached 
spreadsheet. Is that accurate? Or does that reflect some issue with the extraction process?

I don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find 
such files. I will review Monday to make sure. As to your questions from last night, the sheet should be 
comprehensive. I only recall 1 addition, but I am sure that what I have is reflected in the sheet. As for the items 
in dark grey, there are 2 servers with multiple drives. Some of those drives have physically failed. We have to 
get them to one of our HQ specialists for recovery. Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may 
not be possible. It can be a very long process. We will get that moving ASAP. Need anything else, let me

Subject: GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO 
SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00031227
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00031228
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilitated, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney 
Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
("FBP"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that 
GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to 
commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment unsealed 
today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator Jeffrey 
Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in 
federal court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and participated 
in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them 
into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. All the while, 
she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. Today, after 
many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the most 
EFTA00031232
--- PAGE 2 ---
important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the law 
and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest 
for justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. 
The example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and 
connected, and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the 
bravery exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which 
they've been subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will be 
abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact the FBI at 1-
800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated in 
Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies 
or taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's 
behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to 
accept offers of financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. 
MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, 
encouraging them to massage Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and susceptible 
to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between minor victims 
and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL was present 
for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages during which a 
minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor 
victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching of a 
victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch 
Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and Epstein's 
victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as well as 
MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made false 
statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex 
acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Ablise 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
EFTA00031243
--- PAGE 2 ---
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
EFTA00031244
--- PAGE 3 ---
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Great—two main comments: 
1. A lot of questions about record keeping practices are about present practices, but I would guess things may have 
been different in 1997, so you'll want to navigate that in your meeting with him and adjust the questions 
accordingly. 
2. The closing questions (after the record is in evidence) ask the witness to read out loud on the open record the 
identifying information for MV1, so you'll need to adjust those.

Attached is a draft Paul Kane Q&A. There are a couple questions that may seem weird — basically, since PCS didn't create 
this record, the questions are aimed at a line of Second Circuit cases holding that "Records maintained but not created by 
a company may be admissible as business records of that company if witnesses testify that the records are integrated into 
[the] company's records and relied upon in its day-to-day operations." United States v. Kuthuru, 665 F. App'x 34, 39 (2d Cir. 
2016).

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The Government respectfully submits this memorandum of law in opposition to defendant 
Michael Thomas's motion to compel discovery. (Dkt. No. 33) ("Mot."). Thomas seeks an order 
compelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable 
under any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas's motion is 
entirely without merit and should be denied.' 
Thomas concedes that the Government has produced a "multitude" of discovery directly 
relevant to the charges against him. (Mot. 6). Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the 
Government to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his 
purported defenses, namely, that he committed the offenses because of staffing issues and 
supervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (i) a 
copy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General 
("DOJ-OIG"), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary 
materials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2019 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (ii) reports 
and documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") and other agencies who were not and 
are not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (iii) reports and documents related to "any 
and all [Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC")] employees" who have engaged in "the same 
or similar conduct," including an incident in "2005 or 2006" where officers failed to conduct 
counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and 
documents related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP 
Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas's pretrial 
motions. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(c)(3) ("If a party does not meet the deadline for making a Rule 
12(b)(3) motion, the motion is untimely. But a court may consider the defense, objection, or 
request if the party shows good cause."). 
EFTA00031268
--- PAGE 7 ---
policies which relate to the "much larger context" at the BOP (Mot. 6, 7, 9, 10). 
As an initial matter, the Government has satisfied its Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio obligations 
and is not in possession of the additional materials that Thomas seeks. More importantly, Thomas 
is not entitled to compel the Government to collect the additional records for at least four separate 
reasons. First, the records are not "material" to preparing a defense because they are wholly 
irrelevant to the false statement charges against Thomas and are intended to prompt jurors to 
nullify the charges against him. Second, the BOP records Thomas seeks are not in the "possession" 
of the prosecution team, and there is no legal basis for compelling the Government to collect 
materials from other agencies or components of the Department of Justice who are not and were 
not part of the criminal investigation that led to the charges against Thomas. Third, there is no 
legal basis to require the Government to produce a draft of the report being prepared by the DOJ-
OIG, which is subject to the deliberative process privilege. Fourth, Thomas is not entitled to 
discovery relating to what happened to other MCC employees when they "falsiflied] the same 
documents," (Mot. 6), because he has utterly failed to identify evidence that the decision to 
prosecute him had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. 
Thomas's motion should be denied in all respects. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
I. 
The Indictment 
Indictment 19 Cr. 830 (AT) (the "Indictment") was filed on November 19, 2019, charging 
defendants Tova Noel and Michael Thomas in six counts: (i) conspiring to defraud the United 
States and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
Section 371 (Count One); and (ii) five counts of making or using a false writing or document, in 
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(3) and 3 (Counts Two through Six). 
EFTA00031269
--- PAGE 8 ---
Both defendants are charged in Counts One, Four, Five, and Six; defendant Noel only is charged 
in Counts Two and Three. The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period, 
from approximately 4:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day, 
August 10, 2019, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As 
charged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated 
counts of prisoners housed in MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"), but nevertheless signed false 
certifications attesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the 
SHU were conducted from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 to 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
II. 
Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants' Request for Additional Materials 
A. 
The Government's Discovery Production 
At the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2019, the Court set a discovery deadline 
of December 31, 2019. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the 
Government made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the 
following: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by 
Noel and Thomas from August 9 to 10, 2019; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC 
phone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness 
interviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") and the DOJ-OIG 
who were participating in the investigation? 
Subsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more 
limited in scope. On January 23, 2020, the Government produced additional interview reports and 
The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required 
under Rule 16, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of 
caution. 
EFTA00031270
--- PAGE 9 ---
notes. On January 30, 2020,3 the Government reproduced video surveillance footage with 
timestamps, and on March 16, 2020, the Government produced forensic reports for three electronic 
devices and a photograph of a text message. 
B. 
Defense Requests for Additional Discovery Materials 
The defendants have made a number of requests for additional discovery materials, in 
response to which the Government has provided information in its possession as consistent with 
Rule 16 and its other disclosure obligations, as described below. 
At the initial pretrial conference on November 11, 2019, Thomas, through counsel, raised 
the issue of an "ongoing . . . report" by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the 
"status" of the report and when it would be completed.4 (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2019, at 3-4, 7-9). 
In response, the Government explained that "to the extent counsel's asking for a summary of the 
results of the criminal investigation, obviously we'll be turning over in discovery all of the 
underlying results of the criminal investigation. . . I don't have a time frame on the ['inspector 
[G]eneral report, but the [G]ovemment will produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery 
materials in this matter, which includes the Rule 16 materials relevant to the criminal charges that 
have been brought against the defendants." (Id. at 7-8). As there was no pending issue to resolve, 
the Court declined to rule at that time. 
On January 29, 2020, Thomas and Noel each submitted discovery requests to the 
Government. Thomas's letter reiterated his prior request for "any and all reports, memorandums, 
The January 30, 2020 production was made to Noel's counsel on January 24, 2020, while 
the Government was still waiting for an additional hard drive from Thomas's counsel. 
Based on conversations with attorneys at DOJ-OIG tasked with preparing this report, the 
Government understands that the report will likely focus on the events surrounding the death of 
Jeffrey Epstein and BOP policies and procedures. 
EFTA00031271
--- PAGE 10 ---
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or possessed by the 
United States Inspector General." Noel's January 29 letter sought materials related to the MCC 
video surveillance system and additional surveillance video, as well as assistance locating 
particular information in the surveillance video footage that the Government had previously 
produced in discovery. 
At the pretrial conference the following day, Thomas, through counsel, renewed his request 
for "whatever investigation was done and whatever information there is that is discoverable with 
respect to the Inspector General's report." (Conf. Tr., Jan. 30, 2020, at 6, 9). The Court directed 
Thomas to file a motion formalizing his request. (Id. at 9).5
The Government responded to the defendants' discovery requests by letter dated March 
14, 2020. As for Thomas's request for materials related to any forthcoming Inspector General's 
report, the Government referred Thomas to its prior response as stated at the November 25, 2019 
pretrial conference. With respect to Noel's requests for additional materials related to the MCC 
video surveillance system, the Government explained that to the extent such materials were in the 
Government's possession and currently subject to disclosure, they had already been produced. In 
addition, the Government provided additional information answering certain of Noel's questions, 
including video timestamps to assist with review of the surveillance footage. 
On March 27, 2020, Thomas submitted another discovery request to the Government, 
seeking, among other things, information from the BOP regarding other correctional officers and 
information about the Government's charging decisions. The Government responded by letter 
Thomas, through counsel, previewed that he would also likely file a motion to dismiss 
the indictment based on "selective prosecution." (Conf. Tr., Jan. 30, 2020 at 6). The deadline for 
filing motions, which was extended at counsel's request, has passed, and Thomas has failed to 
timely file a motion to dismiss. 
EFTA00031272
--- PAGE 11 ---
dated April I, 2020, explaining that any responsive information in the Government's possession 
and subject to disclosure had already been produced. The letter further explained that to the extent 
the requests called for items not in the Government's possession or not subject to disclosure, 
Thomas had not identified any legal basis or authority for his requests and the Government was 
not aware of any authority requiring the Government to obtain or produce the requested 
information. 
On April 9, 2020, Thomas filed the instant motion seeking an order from the Court 
compelling the Government to produce the following: 
• 
The Inspector General's report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein 
and BOP policies and procedures (referred to herein as the "Inspector 
General's Report"), as well as all supporting memoranda and other 
documents, (Mot. 4-5); 
• 
Any and all "reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] regarding 
the August 10, 2019 incident" as well as "documents, reports, witness 
statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who 
have engaged in the same or similar conduct," including "results of any 
disciplinary proceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding 
the discipline or administrative adjudication of any other employees who 
have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts," (Mot. 4, 6); 
• 
Any previously undisclosed reports, witness statements, and documents 
created by "any other federal agencies that investigated the circumstances 
surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein," (Mot. 4, 7). 
For the reasons that follow, Thomas is not entitled to the materials he seeks, and his motion 
should be denied. 
EFTA00031273
--- PAGE 12 ---
ARGUMENT 
1. 
Applicable Law 
A. 
Brady & Giglio 
The Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely 
disclosure of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its possession. See 
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972); see also 
United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139-40 (2d Cir. 2001). Evidence is "material" in this sense 
only if "its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of a trial." United States v. Bagley, 
473 U.S. 667, 678 (1985). "The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all 
the evidence in the Government's possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of 
his defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only 
known to the Government." United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 610, 619 (2d Cir. 1982) (citing 
United States v. Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 604 (2d Cir. 1973)). 
Impeachment evidence is material only "where the witness at issue supplied the only 
evidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness's 
credibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution's case." United States v. 
Payne, 63 F.3d 1200, 1210 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
Similarly, "where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to 
challenge a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable or is subject to 
extensive attack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as 
cumulative, and hence not material." United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, 111 (2d Cir. 2011) 
(citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit, 
in Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a 
EFTA00031274
--- PAGE 13 ---
demand for it. 267 F.3d at 146. The court held that as a general rule, Brady and its progeny do 
not require immediate disclosure of all impeachment material upon a defendant's request. Id. It 
found that the time required for its effective use would depend on the materiality of the evidence 
as well as the particular circumstances of the case, and suggested that district courts may order 
disclosure of material it deems material as a matter of case management. Id. As described above, 
the Government disclosed reports and notes of witness statements as part of its discovery 
productions, such that the defendants will have possessed substantial material that may serve as 
potential impeachment evidence for one year in advance of trial. 
B. 
Rule 16 
Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Government to permit the 
defendants to inspect and copy documents and objects within the Government's possession, 
custody, or control if the items are material to preparing the defense, if the Government intends to 
use them in its case-in-chief at trial, or if the items were obtained from or belong to the defendant. 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E). An item is "material to preparing the defense" under Rule 16 "if it 
could be used to counter the Government's case or bolster a defense." United States v. Stevens, 
985 F.2d 1175, 1180-81 (2d Cir. 1993). 
Il. 
Thomas is Not Entitled to Additional Materials 
A. 
The Government Has Satisfied its Discovery and Disclosure Obligations 
As an initial matter, the Government is aware of, has satisfied, and will continue to satisfy 
its discovery and disclosure obligations. 
The Government has met its Rule 16 discovery and disclosure obligations. As set forth 
above, the Government has produced an expansive amount of discovery, which includes among 
other things, hundreds of hours of video surveillance going back to July 5, 2019 (despite the fact 
EFTA00031275
--- PAGE 14 ---
that the Indictment relates to a 14-hour time period); count slips, thirty minute round forms, and 
staffing rosters for the three-week period surrounding Epstein's suicide; internal MCC phone 
records; employee files and staffing history for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of written 
Bureau of prison policies and regulations, among other documents and materials. In addition and 
while not required by Rule 16, the Government produced months in advance of trial (and now, 
approximately a year in advance of trial) statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the 
investigation. While the Government is not aware of any other information that warrants 
disclosure, it will produce any such materials to the extent it becomes aware of them. 
The Government is likewise aware of, and has complied with, its Brady and Giglio 
obligations. The Government has already produced any evidence in its possession that is arguably 
exculpatory or impeaching. To the extent Giglio material exists in notes of witness statements or 
attorney proffers made on behalf of witnesses that have not already been produced, the 
Government intends to comply with its obligations and will make such disclosures sufficiently in 
advance of trial to be effectively used. Based on that representation alone, the defendant's motion 
should be denied. See United States v. Gonzalez, No. 19 Cr. 123-2 (NRB), 2020 WL 1809293, at 
*5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2020) (denying a motion to compel because the government "represented 
that it had complied with and would continue to comply with its Brady and Rule 16 obligations); 
United States v. Undenvood, No. 04 Cr. 424 (RWS), 2005 WL 927012, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21, 
2005) ("The courts of this Circuit repeatedly have denied pretrial requests for discovery orders 
pursuant to Brady where the government has made such good faith representations."); United 
States v. Perez, 940 F. Supp. 540, 553 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (denying defendant's motion to compel 
production of Brady based on Government's representation that it was aware of and had complied 
with Brady). 
EFTA00031276
--- PAGE 15 ---
B. 
The Requested Records Are Not "Material" to Preparing a Defense and Are 
Sought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification 
All of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not "material to preparing a defense" 
under Rule 16, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the 
Government's false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense. Instead, Thomas seeks 
evidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies, 
supervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he 
can engage in attempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions "led" to the criminal 
conduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him. (Mot. 5, 7, 9, 14). Thomas is not 
entitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—
that would aid in that nullification effort because Rule 16 only entitles a defendant to discovery 
for purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government's case in chief, not the merits of the 
decision to prosecute. 
1. 
Applicable Law 
An item or record that the Government does not intend to use in its case-in-chief at trial is 
discoverable under Rule 16(a)(1)(E) only if it "is material to preparing the defense." Fed. R. Crim. 
P. 16(a)(1)(E). "It is [a defendant's] burden to make a prima facie showing that documents sought 
under Rule 16(a)(1)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense." United States v. Rigas, 258 F. 
Supp. 2d 299, 307 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing United States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 894 
(S.D.N.Y. 1991)). As noted above, an item is "material to preparing the defense" under Rule 16 
"if it could be used to counter the Government's case or bolster a defense." Stevens, 985 F.2d at 
1180-81. The defendant must "offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested 
evidence is material." Rigas, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 307 (internal citation omitted). 
As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Armstrong, while Rule 16 authorizes 
EFTA00031277
--- PAGE 16 ---
defendants to examine records "material to the preparation of their defense against the 
Government's case in chief," it does not authorize discovery for defenses that do not rebut the 
"merits to the criminal charge itself." 517 U.S. 456, 462-63 (1996) (holding that Rule 16 does not 
authorize discovery relating to a selective prosecution claim). For that reason, because evidence 
that would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification does not relate to the merits of 
the criminal charges, it is not discoverable under Rule 16. Id.; see also United States v. Defreitas, 
No. 07 Cr. 543 (DLI), 2011 WL 317964, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2011) (rejecting discovery 
request related to something that is "not a defense" and has "nothing to do with the issues of 
whether defendants ... committed the . . . crimes charged"). Since jury nullification is "a practice 
whereby a juror votes in purposeful disregard of the evidence," United States v. Thomas, 116 F.3d 
606, 614 (2d Cir. 1997), or "out of compassion or compromise," Standefer v. United States, 447 
U.S. 10, 22 (1980) (internal citation omitted), it is not error for a court to preclude evidence that is 
"not a valid defense" aimed at nullification, United States v. Edwards, 101 F.3d 17, 19-20 (2d Cir. 
1996). See also United States v. Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d 579, 583-84 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (precluding 
defense arguments or evidence related to "possible consequences for the defendant of conviction, 
jury nullification, and the Government's motive and conduct in prosecuting [defendant]"); United 
States v. Levin, No. 15 Cr. 101 (KBF), 2016 WL 299031, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2016) (barring 
evidence "intended to elicit sympathy" and attempts to "use jury nullification as a defense" as 
"plainly improper"). Indeed, "trial courts have the duty to forestall or prevent jury nullification" 
even where the defendant or the court may "strongly disagree[] with the government's charging 
decisions and the attendant sentencing consequences." United States v. Manzano, 945 F.3d 616, 
626-27 (2d Cir. 2019) (citations & quotation marks omitted).

2. 
Discussion 
Thomas's motion makes clear that he intends for his principal defense at trial to be that—
irrespective of his guilt or innocence of the false statements charges—he should be acquitted 
because the MCC was understaffed, Thomas was overworked, his supervisors did not catch his 
crime in the moment, and falsification of count slips is rampant within the BOP. (See Mot. 3 
("staffing issues, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP 
procedures go to the heart of his defense to the government's criminal allegations"); 9 ("Mr. 
Thomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the MCC in August of 2019 led 
to the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is now criminally charged.")). Thomas has failed to meet 
his burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid 
defense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead 
would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification. 
The purported reasons for Thomas's decision to falsify count slips—being tired, 
overworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those 
issues is not relevant. Put simply, were the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Thomas 
intentionally made materially false statements and also that did so while tired or overworked, it 
would still be required to convict him. See United States v. Carr, 424 F.3d 213,221 (2d Cir. 2005) 
(holding that "it was proper for the district court to instruct the jury that it had a duty to find [the 
defendant] guilty if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense 
with which he was charged" (internal citation omitted)). 
None of Thomas's proffered excuses relate to proving or rebutting the elements of a 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3) as they do not concern whether a writing or entry was false, 
whether it was material to a matter within the jurisdiction of the BOP, or whether he knowingly 
EFTA00031279
--- PAGE 18 ---
and willfully made a false statement. Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a 
criminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant's purportedly 
innocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent. See United States 
v. Washington, 705 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent 
motive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is "knowingly and willfully"); In re Terrorist 
Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, 154 n.49 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Washington, 
705 F.2d at 493, for "the irrelevance of a motive to the question of whether conduct is intentional"); 
United States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. 1992) (rejecting the defendant's "context 
argument" for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged). 
For the same reasons, "other people were doing it" is not a defense to a false statements or 
conspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the 
foregoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees 
falsified records and "their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration," evidence of 
what other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas 
believed falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the 
charges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 760 F.2d 1366, 1372 (2d Cir. 1985) 
("Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action."); United 
States v. Rosenfield, 469 F.2d 598, 601 n.2 (3d Cir. 1972) ("As long as the inexcusable intent is 
present, it is not necessary that the defendant know that his conduct is subject to criminal 
penalties."). And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial, 
for the July to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged 
here, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant. See United States v. Gibbons, 602 F.2d 
1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1979) (approving instruction that jury was not to consider individuals who 
EFTA00031280
--- PAGE 19 ---
were not on trial). 
Thomas's efforts to garner sympathy, put the Government on trial, and deflect blame for 
his own criminal actions plainly sound in nullification. See Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d at 583-84; 
Levitt, 2016 WL 2990831, at *12. Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the 
defendant committed the crimes charged, but rather is intended to elicit sympathy, compassion, or 
compromise from the jury. The records Thomas seeks are no more discoverable than the 
nullification evidence precluded in Armstrong and its progeny. See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 462-
(defendant not entitled to discovery on race of other narcotics defendants to aid in selective 
prosecution claim); United States v. Delacruz, No. 14 Cr. 815 (KBF), 2015 WL 2211943, at *4 
(S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2015) (rejecting defendant's "demands for general information and statistics 
relating to the Government's use of sting operations"); United States v. Floyd, No. 99 Cr. 0234 
(DAB), 1999 WL 476438, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 1999) (rejecting discovery request for 
"background data, records and investigative reports" of the New York City Police Department 
("NYPD") as well as information about NYPD officers' conduct in other cases); Defreitas, 2011 
WL 317964, at *10 (rejecting discovery demands related to a "factual impossibility" defense to a 
conspiracy charge). It is the Court's "duty to forestall or prevent" jury nullification. Manzano, 
945 F.3d at 627 (holding that "District courts have a duty to forestall or prevent [jury nullification 
arguments] and the district court in this case abdicated its duty by ruling that defense counsel could 
argue jury nullification."); see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984) 
(criticizing trial court for inviting nullification by permitting the defendants to mount a "political 
defense" and stating that it was an "erroneous assumption that good motive for committing a crime 
is inconsistent with criminal intent"). 
In sum, much of the additional discovery Thomas seeks in his motion relates to legally 
EFTA00031281
--- PAGE 20 ---
irrelevant matters, such as what "led" him to the criminal conduct or the broader "context" in 
which he committed specific criminal acts. There is no basis to compel production of evidence 
related to those matters under Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio because they are not material and because 
the evidence sought is in furtherance of a transparent attempt at nullification. Thomas's motion 
should be denied on this basis alone. 
C. 
The Government is Not Required to Collect Materials From Agencies Who 
Were Not Part of the Prosecution Team 
Thomas asks the Court to compel the Government to produce "any reports, witness 
statements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the 
BOP," "documents, reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC 
employees who have engaged in the same or similar conduct," and any previously undisclosed 
reports, witness statements, and documents created by "any other federal agencies that investigated 
the circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein." (Mot. 4, 7 (emphasis added)). Even 
if Thomas had satisfied the materiality requirement under Rule 16 or Brady with respect to these 
items—and he has not—Thomas's motion would still fail because the materials he seeks are not 
in the prosecution team's possession. 
The BOP is not, and never has been, part of the prosecution team. Nor did the BOP conduct 
an investigation jointly or in coordination with the prosecution team.° To require the Government 
to obtain and produce any records from the BOP from a separate investigation, as well as evidence 
that would support Thomas's purported (and improper, for the reasons discussed in Part II.B, 
The defendant claims, based on a CNN article, that the U.S. Marshal Service ("USMS") 
conducted an investigation. The Government is unaware of such an investigation, and in any 
event, any such inquiry by the USMS was not conducted jointly or in coordination with the 
prosecution team. 
EFTA00031282
--- PAGE 21 ---
supra) defenses, is not legally required and would impose a nearly insurmountable obligation on 
the Government of marshaling and reviewing information and data in the possession of an entirely 
separate entity. 
1. 
Applicable Law 
As described above, Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio apply to materials in the Government's 
"possession." As a general matter, while lain individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have 
knowledge of all information gathered in connection with his office's investigation of the 
case, ... knowledge on the part of persons employed by a different office of the government does 
not in all instances warrant the imputation of knowledge to the prosecutor." United States v. 
Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). The imposition of such "an 
unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor's office 
on the case in question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic view of government' 
that would 'condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis." Id. (citation & 
quotation marks omitted); see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995) (Government's 
discovery and disclosure obligations extend only to information in the custody of the prosecutor 
or "others acting on the government's behalf in the case"). Thus, discovery and disclosure 
obligations only extend "information known to persons who are a part of the 'prosecution 
team' ... who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of 
the case," including "police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the 
prosecutor and participate in the investigation." United States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App'x 36, 38 (2d 
Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). Brady is not a basis to compel the Government to gather information 
in the possession of third parties on behalf of the defense. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 
EFTA00031283
--- PAGE 22 ---
56, 112 (2d Cir. 2003) (defendants were not deprived of due process by any alleged failure of U.S. 
government to help them obtain cooperation from foreign authorities). 
In considering whether Rule 16 and Brady apply to records in the possession of another 
government agency, a prosecutor's duty extends to reviewing such evidence only where the 
Government conducts a "joint investigation" with that agency or branch of government. See 
United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2009) (affirming district court opinion holding that 
there was "no joint investigation with the [Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")]" and 
therefore the Government did not need to produce documents in the custody of the SEC); United 
States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 3d 736, 742-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that the Government 
was not obligated to review SEC material for Brady where SEC was not involved in grand jury 
presentation, did not attend every interview, did not review documents gathered only by 
prosecution, and did not develop prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 
(JPO), 2018 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) (holding that the Government was 
not required to conduct a search because the [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
("PCAOB")] was not involved in witness interviews or developing prosecutorial strategy, and the 
SEC was not involved in the grand jury presentation, reviewing the fruits of the Government's 
investigation, or developing prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 
241-42 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (no joint investigation between Government and SEC); United States v. 
Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Chin, J.) (no joint investigation between 
Government and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")); United States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 
727, 749-50 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (holding that USAO and Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") 
did not conduct a "joint investigation" even though the FAA provided two inspectors to assist the 
criminal investigation). 
EFTA00031284
--- PAGE 23 ---
Moreover, even where agents from a component of an agency are involved in an 
investigation, that does not render the entirety of an agency part of the prosecution team. See, e.g., 
United States v. Stein, 424 F. Supp. 2d 720, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) ("While the prosecution's [Rule 
16] disclosure obligation in some circumstances may extend to materials beyond the knowledge 
of the individual prosecutors assigned to a case, it does not extend to the collective knowledge of 
the entire United States government or even to the entire government agency concerned."); United 
States v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 218 (3d Cir. 2005) ("[T]hat other agents in the ([Department of 
Labor ("DOL")] participated in this investigation does not mean that the entire DOL is properly 
considered part of the prosecution team."); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 949 (2d 
Cir.1993) (refusing, for Brady purposes, to impute to AUSAs prosecuting that action with the 
assistance of certain FBI agents knowledge of reports prepared by FBI agents who were 
"uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants"); but see United States v. Ghailani, 687 
F. Supp. 2d 365, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that, in the context of a speedy trial motion, other 
members of the Department of Justice who were involved in making decisions about timing and 
progress of the case were part of the "government" for Rule 16 purposes). 
Thus, as the foregoing precedents recognize, the factors relevant in determining whether 
an agency or a component of an agency are part of the prosecution team, and therefore their records 
are in the "possession" of the Government include whether the agency or component: "(1) 
participated in the prosecution's witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to the 
grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, (4) 
played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the prosecution to 
court proceedings." Middendorf, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4. 
EFTA00031285

2. 
Discussion 
As described above, the Government has produced Brady, Giglio, and Rule 16 material in 
the possession of the prosecutors and agents at the United States Attorney's Office, the FBI, and 
the DOJ-OIG who have worked on this investigation and prosecution. Thomas seeks materials 
that are not in the possession of the United States Attorney's Office or the case teams at the FBI 
and DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation. 
Thomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the 
prosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic 
decisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the 
MCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and written 
requests to the MCC's legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any 
internal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's suicide. Notwithstanding 
those facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is "allied with the prosecution" and therefore the 
Government's discovery and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the 
possession of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is settled law in this 
Circuit that a prosecutor's duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or 
control of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a "joint 
investigation" with that agency. None of the indicia of a "joint" or "allied" prosecution, as 
discussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors 
considered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did 
not participate in the prosecution's witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case 
to the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the 
EFTA00031286
--- PAGE 25 ---
Government; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP personnel 
accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings. 
Moreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into 
the events of August 9 and 10, 2019 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe 
that most if not all of the records that he seeks-such as records of other instances of BOP 
employees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP's investigation. There 
is simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the 
possession of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case, 
regarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct 
required rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other 
times also allegedly falsified records. 
The cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result. In United States v. Bryan, the 
Ninth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents 
located in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS 
investigation. 868 F.2d 1032, 1035-37 (9th Cir. 1989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit 
explained that "a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might 
have documents regarding the defendant" and that Rule 16's disclosure requirements are cabined 
to anything in the possession "of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the 
defendant." Id. at 1036 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 
204, 221 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), the court explained, in denying the defendant's discovery motion, that 
"[c]ourts have construed the term `government' . . . narrowly to mean the prosecutors in the 
particular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant, 
and not the 'government' in general." And while the court in United States v. Libby, 429 F. Supp. 
EFTA00031287
--- PAGE 26 ---
2d I, 9 (D.D.C. 2006), required the prosecutors to obtain records from the Office of the Vice 
President and the Central Intelligence Agency, even though those parts of government did not 
participate in the grand jury investigation, that holding was an outlier, which has never been cited 
by another court, and the decision itself has never been cited in this Circuit. 
Finally, even if such materials had any conceivable relevance to the charges at hand (which, 
as discussed above, they do not), asking the Government to conduct a broad canvassing of the 
BOP's records—including searching databases located out of state, reviewing large quantities of 
documents, attempting to pull archived records going back as far as 2005, and parsing through 
attorney work product—would be inordinately time consuming and burdensome for attorneys for 
the Government, which does not have custody of the files, is not familiar with the files, and knows 
of no effective way to search them. It would, as the Circuit warned against in Avellino, "condemn 
the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis." 136 F.3d at 255. Such a result is not 
legally required by Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio, and therefore Thomas's motion should be denied. 
D. 
Any Draft Inspector General Report is Not Subject to Disclosure 
Thomas argues that any report by the Inspector General and related materials must be 
produced because he speculates that such a report will address systemic issues at the BOP, 
including purported staffing shortages at the MCC. (Mot. 5,9-10). For the reasons set forth above, 
any draft Inspector General Report is not discoverable because the issues Thomas believes it will 
discuss are not material to the preparation of a valid defense, see Part II.B, and the draft reports, 
to the extent they exist, are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege. While 
the prosecution team has had no involvement in writing the Inspector General Report, the 
Government understands that those attorneys from DOJ-OIG responsible for writing the Report 
have not yet completed a draft, and do not anticipate completing the Report in the near term. As 
EFTA00031288
--- PAGE 27 ---
such, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas's motion can be denied on that 
reason alone. Moreover, Thomas's request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet 
exist-fails for two additional reasons. 
First, drafts of the Inspector General's Report, which has not been completed and will 
likely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the 
deliberative process privilege, which "covers `documents reflecting advisory opinions, 
recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions 
and policies are formulated.'" Dep't of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass 'n, 532 
U.S. 1, 8 (2001) (quoting N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975)). The 
privilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United 
States v. Fernandez, 231 F.3d 1240, 1246-47 (9th Cir. 2000) (government's death penalty 
evaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative 
process privilege); In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 737-40 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (indicating that the 
privilege applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284 
(S.D.N.Y. 1998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege). "In order for the privilege to apply, 
the agency record at issue must be (1) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter; (2) 
pre-decisional; and (3) deliberative." Nat? Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envd. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d 
150, 155 (2d Cir. 2020). "It is well-settled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically 
pre-decisional and deliberative [because] [t]hey reflect only the tentative view of their authors; 
views that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their 
superiors." Color of Change v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 325 F. Supp. 3d 447, 453 (S.D.N.Y. 
2018) (quoting Amnesty Intl USA v. CIA, 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 518 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)). 
The Inspector General's Report is both pre-decisional and deliberative. A full draft has not 
EFTA00031289
--- PAGE 28 ---
been completed, let alone reached a point where the final version will be disclosed to the public. 
It is also deliberative in that it will likely make recommendations about the BOP, and those 
recommendations will be under discussion within the Office of the Inspector General prior to being 
finalized and publicly announced. Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in 
reaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports. The ability to have these 
discussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues. Here, disclosure 
of any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine 
the DOJ-OIG's ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to 
inmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on 
the issues. Accordingly, Thomas's motion should be denied for the reason that the materials 
sought are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9. 
Second, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector 
General's Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials 
upon which the Report is based—are subject to disclosure. To the extent that the forthcoming 
Inspector General's Report relies on information gathered during the instant investigation and 
prosecution, those underlying materials—which focus primarily on the events of August 9 and 10, 
2019, the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein, and related MCC records—have already been disclosed 
to the defendants. Thomas contends that those tasked with preparing the Report may "possibl[y]" 
have generated additional witness statements and "other information" that has not been produced 
by the Government to date. (Mot. 5). Thomas provides no support for such assertions besides 
mere speculation. The prosecution has inquired of the Washington D.C.-based attorneys who are 
preparing the Inspector General's Report. Based on those conversations, it is the prosecution's 
understanding that those attorneys have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise 
EFTA00031290
--- PAGE 29 ---
discovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced 
in discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG attorneys preparing the Report, the 
underlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants' 
possession. Any analysis of those materials by the attorneys preparing the Inspector General's 
Report is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule 16 and cannot constitute Brady material. See 
United States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d 148, 150 (4th Cir. 1994) (noting generally that "nothing contained 
in [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable"). 
At bottom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft, 
unpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not 
required by Rule 16, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation. 
E. 
Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material 
in Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim 
Thomas seeks "information and statistics that show the conduct in which the defendant is 
being charged with a crime were . . rampant throughout the BOP" and that the application of 
criminal laws to him is "possibl[y] discriminatory." (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a 
demand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only 
for the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite 
showing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas 
has failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or 
discriminatory purpose. 
1. 
Applicable Law 
"A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, 
but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by 
the Constitution." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is "a demanding 
EFTA00031291
--- PAGE 30 ---
one," id., as the defendant must "overcome the strong presumption of regularity on the part of 
federal prosecutors, and `in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they 
have properly discharged their official duties.'" United States v. Sanders, 17 F. Supp. 2d 141, 144 
(E.D.N.Y. 1998) (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464), aff'd, 211 F.3d 711 (2d Cir. 2000). 
A defendant claiming selective prosecution must present "clear evidence" that the decision 
to prosecute not only (1) "had a discriminatory effect" but was also (2) "motivated by a 
discriminatory purpose." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465; United States v. Alameh, 341 F.3d 167, 173 
(2d Cir. 2003); United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1992); United States v. Moon, 718 
F.2d 1210, 1229 (2d Cir. 1983). "The discriminatory effect prong requires a showing that 
`similarly situated individuals of a different [classification] were not prosecuted."' Alameh, 341 
F.3d at 173 (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465). In other words, the defendant must show that 
he has been "singled out" as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon, 
718 F.2d at 1229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must show that the 
Government's discriminatory "selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in 
bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to 
prevent his exercise of constitutional rights." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration 
incorporated). Where a defendant "has not shown that the Government prosecuted him because 
of his protected status or conduct, his claim fails. Id. 
In order to obtain discovery on a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must offer 
"some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements of the defense." 
Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v. Berrios, 501 F.2d 1207, 1211 (2d Cir. 1974)); 
United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 (2002) (per curiam) (to obtain discovery, a defendant 
accordingly first "must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory 
EFTA00031292
--- PAGE 31 ---
intent"); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same). "[T]he showing necessary to obtain discovery should itself 
be a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. 
"Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient" to meet this 
burden. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 470 (affidavits "recotmt[ing] 
hearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence" are not sufficient to 
justify discovery); Berrios, 501 F.2d at 1211 (affidavit from defendant and attorney that they 
"believe[d]" there was improper motive and that "hundreds" of similarly situated individuals went 
unprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 341 F.3d at 174 (defendant's statistical analysis was 
insufficient to merit discovery on selective prosecution claim). 
2. 
Discussion 
Thomas is not entitled to discovery that would relate to a selective procession or 
"discriminatory application" claim. He has not carried his burden through a showing of any 
evidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory. 
As to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any 
evidence that "others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of 
conduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him]." Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). "A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who 
has committed roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom 
the law has not been enforced." United States v. Lewis, 517 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 2008). Thomas 
alleges that there was an "almost identical incident in 2005 or 2006 wherein officers failed to 
conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide," and one of the four 
officers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to 
conduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts. Even assuming 
EFTA00031293
--- PAGE 32 ---
those officers "in 2005 or 2006" did falsify count slips, Thomas has still not put forth any evidence 
that those officers were "outside of the protected class," meaning of a different race, gender, 
nationality, or other protected class than Thomas. In any event, even were the conduct similar, 
that Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally 
prosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness. 
Similarly, Thomas points to the fact that "Officer-1" and "Officer-2" in the Indictment, 
who falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. institutional counts on 
August 9, 2019, respectively, were not prosecuted. (Mot. 10; Ind. ¶' 15, 17, 19). Even assuming 
arguendo that Officer-1 and Officer-2 were similarly situated to Thomas in that they each falsified 
one count slip—while Thomas falsified three—Thomas has failed to put forth any evidence that 
either Officer-1 or Officer-2 were outside of a "protected class" to which Thomas belongs.? Nor 
could he: Officer-1 and Officer-2 are the same race, gender, and nationality as Thomas. Thomas 
also questions why his supervisors or other MCC personnel who received and reviewed Thomas's 
false count slips were not also prosecuted with making false statements, but those supervisors or 
personnel are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false 
statements—Thomas did. In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the "suspicion [and] 
surmise" contained in Thomas's motion simply do not constitute "objective evidence" warranting 
discovery. See United States v. White, 972 F.2d 16, 19 (2d Cir. 1992) (conclusory allegations as to 
timing of indictment, Government's failure to follow internal guidelines, and improprieties of 
In so noting, the Government does not intend to comment on its deliberative process or 
the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. It notes these facts simply in response to Thomas's 
claim that the lack of charges against Officer-1, Officer-2, or Thomas's supervisors is in and of 
itself sufficient to meet the defendant's burden of establishing evidence of a similarly situated 
defendant who was not charged. 
EFTA00031294
--- PAGE 33 ---
prosecutors not "objective evidence" warranting discovery); Moon, 718 F.2d at 1230 ("to engage 
in a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or 
surmise"). Thomas's failure to make an evidentiary showing in support of the first required prong 
means that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g., 
Bass, 536 U.S. at 863. 
As to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that 
the decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a 
showing, a defendant must establish that the Government's "selection of the defendant for 
prosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations 
as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights." Fares, 978 F.2d at 
(internal quotation marks omitted; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any 
evidence whatsoever that the Government's decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything 
other than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government's decision to prosecute him at 
all, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is 
"rampant" within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for 
committing the crime that Thomas committed does not mean that the Government harbored 
discriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.8
Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has 
failed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective 
prosecution before a jury because the "selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather 
than the jury." Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082. The Second Circuit's directive makes sense. A claim of 
improper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, "is not a defense on the merits to 
the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge 
for reasons forbidden by the Constitution." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-
evidently "unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged," which is the sole issue to be 
decided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution. 
Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082; see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984) 
(criticizing admission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution "for turning the trial away 
EFTA00031295
--- PAGE 34 ---
Having failed to meet the "rigorous standard" required to obtain discovery on a selective 
prosecution defense, Thomas's requests for discovery of any materials related to other incidents 
in which officers were not prosecuted for falsifying count slips should be denied. Armstrong, 517 
U.S. at 464. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's motion to compel should be denied.

reasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into matters far beyond the scope of legitimate issues 
in a criminal trial"). Accordingly, courts routinely and correctly preclude defendants from raising 
these arguments at trial. See Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082 ("[W]e agree with the district court's 
decision to resolve for itself whether the government's conduct was lawful and to prevent Regan 
from presenting evidence on that subject."); United States v. Raniere, No. 18 Cr. 204 (NGG), Dkt.

motion to preclude the defendant from "presenting arguments or evidence that would invite the 
jury to question the Government's motives in investigating and indicting" the defendant); United 
States v. Larkin, No. 12-CR-319, 2017 WL 928915, at *3 (D. Nev. Mar. 8, 2017) ("Defendant will

Subject: (EXTERNAL) FBI Still Needing Tips Regarding Jeffrey Epstein / Ghislaine Maxwell? 
Dear Ms. MI 
I feel Jeffrey Epstein &/or Ghislaine Maxwell reached out tome, in July 2019, (around the time he was apprehended) via 
Seeking Arrangements (probably just "Seeking" these days.) It was a brief communication out of Palm Beach, but it was 
right to the point. The person/people wanted me to be a recruiter and they basically wanted to know if it seemed 
appealing to go out partying and "bring home girls to Daddy." This notion seemed wholly cringeworthy with ick-factor 
and I don't think I replied in any fashion. 
It may be worth the while for the FBI to subpoena Seeking Arrangements' records out of Palm Beach. I feel extremely 
confident that Maxwell &/or Epstein were actively using this platform for recruiting. I think they were attracted to me, 
because my profile pics looked like her...we could pass for family. 
From what you know, is this tidbit important? Does the FBI know about the Seeking Arrangement connection? Should I 
be conveying this information to anyone in particular? I'm sort of afraid to become involved, but I also feel everything 
should be done so justice can help the young victims. 
Thank you,

CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS

Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00031323
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00031324
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment.

Laura, 
Below please find responses to the issues you raised: 
• We are confirmed for the review at the Bronx warehouse on April 12, 2021 from 11am to 4:30pm. 
• During the April 12th review, your team can see the evidence for yourselves and let me know if you need any of the 
items you are not permitted to photograph to be brought to 500 Pearl. Depending on the size of the item(s), we 
may need to figure out whether they can be brought later in the week once you have already reviewed several 
boxes, which would free up space in the FBI vehicle for the larger items. I'm confident we will be able to reach a 
reasonable agreement about those items. 
• For the bulky photos, you will not be permitted to photograph any that feature nudity. As referenced above, once 
your team has seen those photos for yourselves, you can let me know if you will need any to be brought to 500 
Pearl. 
• As I mentioned previously and is indicated in the spreadsheet, we are preparing a letter to defense counsel 
explaining why you will not be permitted to review those 16 discs. We expect to send you that letter tomorrow, 
after which I will be happy to discuss the matter further. 
• The blue-ray discs referenced in the spreadsheet are what the FBI burned in order to provide the USAO SDNY with 
a copy of electronic data to produce to you in discovery. The discs are not evidence themselves. The data is the 
evidence, and it was produced to you already. You are correct, however, that the 4/24/07 file is a data file that was 
copied from a VHS tape, which is currently located in the FBI's ELSUR office in Florida. We have asked that the 
original tape be shipped to New York, and it should arrive on Tuesday, April 13th. We will make it available for you 
to review once we have received it. We also plan to produce the digital file of that same recording to you as part of 
our productions of non-testifying witness statements. 
• The shredded paper is currently being analyzed by the FBI lab. We have asked the case agent to inquire with the 
lab regarding its anticipated timeline for analysis and will let you know when we expect it will be possible to have 
the shredded paper returned to New York for you to review. It will not, however, be available next week. 
• The "Missing from Assigned Box" items are items 111130 and 1B110. Those items were migrated within the FBI 
evidence system from the Florida case to the New York case and incorporated into New York evidence item 
numbers 18127, 1B128, & 16137. So these items will be available for your review under those New York evidence 
numbers. 
Best,

My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1B13 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
• Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
EFTA00031333
--- PAGE 3 ---
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura, 
The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
review.

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th• I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
EFTA00031339
--- PAGE 9 ---
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
• The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
EFTA00031340
--- PAGE 10 ---
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
< 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
EFTA00031342
--- PAGE 12 ---
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
EFTA00031344

highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during

Thanks for all your work on this project. I few things from my review, though I'll likely send some additional things 
tomorrow: 
• The 
folder contains just one report, and I think that goes in the 
folder instead. 
Please move it and delete his folder. Same thing for the 
folder. 
• 
are the same person and the folders can be merged under the name

. 
s the same person a 
a potential testifying witness. Could you please move those 
materials and delete the folder? 
. The stuff in the 
folder should actually go in the 
folder, and you can delete 
the one fob once the stuff is moved over. 
. In the 
folder, there's a transcript of a deposition of Mark Epstein. Could you please move that into a 
new, NTW folder for him? 
. 
and 
: could you please 
move these to the not-a-witness folder you created? We'll deal with the contents later, but not in the context of 
the NTW production. 
Thanks!

Hey man I'm really sorry to ask this, but it turns out I have to fly to California for the Epstein case from Sept. 17-19, which 
also happens to be when we have three (I) check-ins with Berman: 
- 
18th, 11:00, 
19th, 10:00, 
19th, 11:30, 
Could I ask you to please cover those? Or if any issues I can also try to move one or more of them, too. And I should be 
able to do 
in October, if that's any consolation. Either way I'll owe you one (or three). Let me know? 
thanks.

I knew Ghislaine Maxwell for over 10 years. It was her calculating 
and sadistic manipulation that anaesthetized me, in order to 
deliver me, with full knowledge of the heinous and 
dehumanizing abuse that awaited me, straight to the hands of 
Jeffrey Epstein. Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey could not have done 
what he did. She was in charge. She egged him on and 
encouraged him. She told me of others she recruited, and she 
thought it was funny. She pretends to care, only to garner 
sympathy and enjoys drawing her victims in with perceived 
caring, only to entrap them and make them feel some sense of 
obligation to her through emotional manipulation. She was the 
predator and a monster. 
The sociopathic manner in which she nurtured our relationship, 
abused my trust and took advantage of my vulnerability, makes 
it clear to me that she would have done anything to get what she 
wanted, to satisfy Mr. Epstein. I have great fear that Ghislaine 
Maxwell will flee, since she has demonstrated, over many years, 
her sole purpose is that of self-preservation. She blatantly 
disregards and disrespects the judicial system, as demonstrated 
by her perjuring herself and bullying anyone who dared accuse 
her. 
I have great fear that she may seek to silence those whose 
testimony is instrumental in her prosecution. In fact, when I was 
listed as a witness in a civil action involving Maxwell, I received a 
phone call in the middle of the night, threatening my then 2-year 
old's life if I testified. 
EFTA00031357
--- PAGE 2 ---
I have fear speaking here today, even anonymously. However, I 
have chosen to implore the court not grant bond for Ms. 
Maxwell because I know the truth. I know what she has done, I 
know how many lives she has ruined and because I know this, I 
know she has nothing to lose, has no remorse and will never 
admit what she has done. 
Please do not let us down by allowing her the opportunity to 
further hurt her victims, or evade the consequences that surely 
await her if justice is served. If she believes she risks prison, she 
will never come back. If she is out, I need to be protected. I 
personally know her international connections, that would allow 
her to go anywhere in the world and disappear at a moment's 
notice, or make others disappear, if she needs to.

None of the 911 calls were relevant. But here are some additional reports I pulled from that DAS search. 
One contains information for an employee of

I just read the attached opinion in a civil case (it came on my radar because Judge Pauley made a comment about 
Epstein's death at MCC) — I was wondering if you knew whether our office ever investigated the guards involved in this. 
This was a 2015 incident, but it's still within the statute of limitations, and seems quite serious.

I will work with any date you have the week of 11/4. I truly apologize. After our conversation I called my client for 10/31. 
He is quite anxious. I did not intend to waste anyone's time or resources.

For the first question, the AUSAs contacted the attorneys we were aware of who represented victims to tell them that 
their clients were welcome to attend and to make a statement. I believe 
also sent out notifications, and hopefully 
she can tell us how many she sent. 
For the second question, based on my review of the transcript (attached), a total of 17 victims were present at the hearing 
and either spoke at the hearing or had someone read a statement for them. An additional 7 did not attend the hearing 
but had someone else speak for them or read a statement from them. It is possible there were others present who were 
not referenced on the record. 
I don't think we can answer the third question. I don't recall anyone off the top of my head who wanted to attend but 
was unable to, but it's possible there were some in that position.

The Petitioner in the Epstein CVRA case has filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit. One of their issues is the 
District Court's refusal to hold a hearing allowing the Epstein victims to "have their day in court." The 
Court's ruling is, in part, on the basis that a hearing held in SDNY satisfied this request. The Petitioner has 
alleged that not all of the Epstein victims who wanted to speak were able to do so at the New York hearing 
because they did not have sufficient notice and were unable to travel to NY.

Can your office provide us some details about the following: 1) how many victims were contacted about 
making a victim impact statement; 2) how many victims were able to travel and make an in-person victim 
impact statement; and 3) how many victims indicated they wanted to make a victim impact statement but 
were unable to do so given the notice/timing of the hearing? 
Please provide as much of this information as possible today. I'm very sorry for the quick turnaround but 
the Department's response to the mandamus petition is due tomorrow 
I really appreciate your assistance.

and I were doing parallel work and she beat me to it, but in case it's helpful, in addition to the individuals who 
spoke or were present for their letters being read (10 identified by name and 7 Jane Does), Brad Edwards stated that he 
had 15 clients present (eight of whom spoke) and "at least 20 more who didn't make this hearing today for a multitude of 
reasons." (Tr. at 29). And I similarly don't recall anyone who expressed directly to us that they wanted to attend but 
couldn't, with the exception of jjj, 
as jj, 
mentioned. 
Also to the extent it's helpful, the Tuesday, August 27 hearing was ordered on Wednesday, August 21, and that day we 
posted the following general notification to the case page on our Office's website: 
August 21, 2019 update: 
On August 21, 2019, a hearing was ordered by the Court in the case of United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 
(RMB). The hearing is in connection with the nolle prosequi order proposed to the Court on August 19, 2019, by the 
United States Attorney, following the death of defendant Jeffrey Epstein. At the hearing, counsel for the victims and 
the victims will be heard, if they wish to be. The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, August 27, 2019, at 10:30 a.m. 
before the Honorable Richard M. Berman, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, New York, in Courtroom 17B.

Hi 
I was just going through all of my emails for the Epstein investigation to make sure everything was in the case file —
realized that I never asked to get access to USAFX in order to see all the subpoenas and returns.... Can you give me access 
and is everything still posted on that site?

Hi, 
Attached is a log of all the subpoenas we've served and what has come back. I've posted the actual subpoenas and 
returns on the USAO's FTP site, called USAFX. Carpenter and Gildea already have access to USAFX. For everyone else, 
you'll need an account which is very easy. Will can help you get an account — I think he'll just need your cellphone 
number. 
Let us know if you have any questions.

I don't think not disclosing the subpoena will be an issue - we are taking that stance with respect to other

I hope you are well and getting some time "off" this summer. I'm reaching out via email as it may be the most efficient 
way to tee-up the inquiry we have received, but we can circulate a dial-in at a convenient time for you if you'd like to 
discuss anything. 
Deutsche Bank has received a third-party subpoena from the Attorney General's Office of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 
connection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and 
others. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a 
copy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and 
our production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with 
contact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request.

Good evening 
Just confirming - did you use FedEx, USPS, or some other carrier to send the discovery here? I have not received it yet but it 
could just be that staff did not notify me a package arrived. Depending on the carrier, it could be in the warehouse or 
mailroom, so I just want to verify so I can find it expeditiously. 
Thanks!

Hard drives should be mailed to the facility to the attention of the legal department. We need to etch the drive with a 
number and provide an authorization memo so she can retain it. Then it will be provided to her. It can be password protected 
so long as you include a cover letter that contains the password for her. 
Hope this helps,

We have a hard drive with loaded discovery that we need to deliver to Ghislaine Maxwell,

please let us know what the current protocol is for that? Also, it's our understanding that ar

See below from Maxwell's attorney. I have no problem with Maxwell being able to read her legal paperwork while she's 
sitting in the cell block if the Marshals are ok with it.

Good evening-
Might you have any sway in persuading the Marshal permit Ms. Maxwell 
to have her legal materials while in the cell block? 
She arrived today at — 5:15 am and remained idle in the cell block 
until — 8:30 am when she was brought to the fifth floor. 
Otherwise, any opposition to me contacting the Court for an order 
(per the Marshal)? 
Enjoy the evening. See you tomorrow.

CAUTION - EXTERNAL: 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
My name is David Oscar Markus, and I am a lawyer in Miami who is representing Ghislaine Maxwell in 
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals regarding bail. I will be present at the arraignment on April 23 and 
look forward to meeting you and your staff in person. 
My understanding is that out of town lawyers need a court order to take their electronics into the 
courthouse. I am writing to ask for permission to bring my cell phone and laptop computer. If the Court is 
agreeable, I am happy to provide a proposed order. 
Thank you for your consideration and understanding. 
Sincerely, 
David Oscar Markus

Do you have a few minutes today or tomorrow to discuss something? Specifically, a good friend of mine is the 
executive producer on a 4-part Netflix series that will come out in a few months on Epstein (they had been working 
on the story for 18 months before we charged). He had spoken ton 
one point (not sure how that 
worked!) and wants to see if anyone from the office would give an interview, all backward looking. I imagine the 
answer is no but they are going with this regardless, so thought I would at least make you and potentially chiefs 
aware of it. Wanted to start with you. I'm free between now and noon or after 6pm tonight, or tomorrow morning 
or after lunch. Thanks!

According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abus

As alleged, minor victims were sub'ected to sexual abuse that included, amon other thins 
MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL'S residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys

CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS

Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls,

--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00031486
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment.

perseverance and creativity by

Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilitated, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney 
Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
("FBP"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that 
GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to 
commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment unsealed 
today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator Jeffrey 
Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in 
federal court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
EFTA00031498

Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and participated 
in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them 
into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. All the while, 
she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. Today, after 
many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the most 
important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the law 
and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest 
for justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. 
The example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and 
connected, and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the 
bravery exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which 
they've been subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will be 
abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact the FBI at I-
800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated in 
Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies 
or taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's 
behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to 
accept offers of financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. 
MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, 
encouraging them to massage Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and susceptible 
to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between minor victims 
and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL was present 
for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages during which a 
minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor 
victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching of a 
victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch 
Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and Epstein's 
victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as well as 
MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made false 
statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex

acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is bein handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys-
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless 
and until proven guilty.

All 
I am guessing everyone is getting inundated with these. If possible, could people reply all with the word version 
of what they've been submitting? I am assuming that the requests fall in the following categories: 
I. Boilerplate request (i.e., pretrial detention and defendant has no risk factors) 
2. Pretrial detention with certain risk factors (heart condition; asthma, etc.) 
3. Post plea, pre-sentence 
4. Post sentence 
I am attaching one I did in a post sentence case. The defendant has to go through BOP process before applying 
to the court for compassionate release. I am also attaching two from a gang case (one defendant had diabetes 
and the other was more general). These were filed before the confirmed MCC case. With respect to the diabetic 
defendant, Judge Daniels just denied the order without an opinion. 
But, as we are handling many of these, it would be helpful to see what others are arguing. 
Hope everyone is doing well!

Attached is an order issued by Judge Engelmayer last week in a bail appeal. To the extent we end up consenting to bail or 
a judge orders bail, this order is a helpful example. 
Also attached is an order from Judge Buchwald denying bail where defense raises the boilerplate COVID-19 argument 
we've been seeing in some cases. This could be helpful as we see more and more of these filed.

Here's a first attempt at a cheat sheet for Wednesday. It currently includes the statute and time period charged in each 
Count; the particular lies underlying each perjury spec; a note on the applicable statute of limitations; and a similar note 
on the sex trafficking statute with which Epstein was charged (and Maxwell is not). 
I can of course reformat, revise, or add anything else that might be helpful.

I think we have to stick with the treaty language. As to whatever we file in the USVI, I'd have to see what it is to 
opine on whether it is directly related to a US criminal matter. As you note, the answer may be no.

On the subject never ends, the State Department would like us to modify our proposed confidentiality language as 
follows: 
Absent a court order directing otherwise, U.S. authorities will not use or disclose the 
content of the witness's statements in an interview with U.S. authorities in any matter 
other than a U.S. criminal investigation or proceeding, and any non-criminal judicial 
or administrative proceeding directly related to a U.S. criminal investigation or 
proceeding, pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty. 
Do you have thoughts on whether that would be broad enough to include any potential civil action we might pursue in 
connection with the Epstein estate in USVI? Not sure we would ever plan to do so, but was trying to preserve the option. 
That said, if this is the language of the treaty, not sure how hard we can push back.

I think that's OK. Note that Touhy is not entirely discretionary—it applies after a subpoena issues, and our denial 
can be reviewed in court. But we can easily insist on a court order. At the beginning of the 302 (and any notes) 
the following should be stated: 
Note that for purposes of any FOIA request, subpoena/Touhy request, Privacy Act routine use 
disclosure, or any other disclosure this document is subject restrictions on disclosure pursuant to 
the MLAT pursuant to which the interview took place. Absent a court order directing otherwise, 
the SDNY or FBI will not use or disclose the content of the witness's statements in an interview 
with law enforcement in any matter other than a criminal investigation, prosecution, or related 
civil action or asset forfeiture action initiated by the United States government. 
The FBI should really understand that any leak of any of this would be pretty terrible.

The UK could impose conditions on any evidence provided under the MLA treaty. Once the evidence 
is provided they typically send a letter to us saying that the evidence is to be used only for the 
purposes specified in the MLA request. Our MLA requests track the language of the Treaty, which 
gives us use in criminal cases and related forfeiture and administrative actions. It doesn't deal with 
FOIA or Touhy. (Since Touhy is discretionary, I assume we would just reject any requests for agent 
testimony on this topic.)

Thanks, John. I appreciate the concern and am open to working to address it, to the extent possible. We, of course, 
would never simply turn this material over to a civil litigant, as you suggest. The problem is, irrespective of our intent, 
this is not Rule 6 material (unless, of course, he testifies before a grand jury), and we are trying to be mindful of not 
simply our criminal case, but obligations we may have under other aspects of U.S. law, FOIA and/or Touhy, spring to 
mind, for example. Again, we never voluntarily turn this stuff over, and we frequently oppose FOIA requests and the like 
to the extent we can under the law. But particularly given the history and concern, we don't want to make promises we 
may not be able to keep. 
Do you by any chance have handy a copy of the MLAT itself (if not, certainly happy to locate myself, just figured you 
might have it already). I'd like to see what, if anything, the treaty says about this subject.

Thanks. This is helpful. One clarification which they will seek - because it seems to loom 
large in their suspicions - is whether his statement will be provided to victims for purposes 
of civil litigation. I know this is not something that ordinarily happens (I don't think I have 
ever done this) - but I think we need to say something about that to move this forward. 
Maybe something like, "Absent a court order directing otherwise, the SDNY will not use or 
disclose the statement in any matter other than a criminal investigation, prosecution, or 
related asset forfeiture action initiated by the United States government."

discussing a confidentiality agreement along the lines you propose, with some revisions. Below is our proposed 
language which we would be comfortable with. Happy to discuss our position further at your convenience. ThanksM 
Prior to the in-person interview: 
- From now until August 14, 2020, neither the witness nor any person representing him will 
make any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about the plans for or terms of the 
interview. Likewise, the SDNY agrees to make no public comment about the matter during 
this period. If an interview has not been concluded by August 14, this confidentiality 
agreement will not bar any further public or private comments on the matter. 
After an in-person interview: 
- 
If the witness completes an interview with U.S. law enforcement, both parties may confirm 
publicly or privately that: "the witness has met with law enforcement authorities in the 
United States and answered questions about matters under investigation. We will not 
comment further." Further comment by the witness or any person representing or speaking 
for him will void this agreement. 
- The content of the witness's statements to law enforcement as part of any interview arranged 
pursuant to the MLA will only be used or disclosed as permitted under U.S. law, including in 
connection with a criminal investigation or proceeding, as ordered or authorized by a court in 
the United States, or as otherwise required by law. 
Nothing in this agreement will bar any party from disclosing to a Court any communications related 
to setting up or executing the interview or the contents of the interview.

Before this weekend's events, I was planning on writing an email proposing that you put together 
some very specific terms for an in-person interview that we can share with the Home Office and the 
police force which makes the first formal approach to the witness's solicitors. Most of the terms are 
already noted in the MLA request: who will be present, where it will take place (UK), whether it will 
be recorded or written, etc. What isn't covered is any kind of a description or agreement about 
confidentiality. Absent this, a MLA police interview will get hung up like your efforts at a voluntary 
interview. 
This weekend's events, which are troubling on many levels, also provide an opportunity in this case. 
Blackfords's and the witness's anger have been focused on your former USA's public statements. 
They may now have some greater confidence that they can rely on any statements of confidentiality. 
Or at least they can now save face by agreeing to an interview. In any event, given the history of 
this, I think absent a mutual agreement on confidentiality, this matter will get mired in litigation, and 
you may never get the interview. 
Here is a rough outline of what might be acceptable on confidentiality. This may give you 
heartburn, but I think it is the most expeditious way forward: 
Prior to the in-person interview: 
- An agreement that for a period lasting no longer than eight (8) weeks, neither the witness nor 
any person representing him will make any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about 
the plans for or terms of the interview. Likewise, the USDOJ agrees to make no public 
comment about the matter during this period. If an interview has not been concluded within 
eight weeks, this confidentiality agreement will not bar any further public or private 
comments on the matter. 
After an in-person interview: 
- If the witness makes a statement, both parties may confirm publicly or privately that: "the 
witness has provided a formal statement to law enforcement authorities in the United States 
EFTA00031516
--- PAGE 6 ---
about matters under investigation. Further comment would not be appropriate." Further 
comment by the witness or any person representing or speaking for him will void this 
agreement. 
The content of witness's statement will be treated in the same manner as testimony taken 
before a Federal Grand Jury under Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). Among other things, unless used in 
connection with a criminal proceeding, required to be disclosed in connection with a criminal 
proceeding, or otherwise ordered disclosed by a court in the United States, the content of the 
statement will not be made public. 
Nothing in this agreement will bar any party from disclosing to a Court any communications related 
to setting up or executing the interview or the contents of the interview. 
Putting something like this together will pave the way for getting the interview done.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
EFTA00031520
--- PAGE 2 ---
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
EFTA00031521
--- PAGE 3 ---
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney
- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The 
Indictment unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-
conspirator Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting 
them for the purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for 
young girls, MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in 
locations including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several 
false statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in 
federal court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
EFTA00031523
--- PAGE 2 ---
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth 
into behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the 
quest for justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is 
traumatic. The example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich 
and connected, and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt 
the bravery exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of 
which they've been subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
participated in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, 
groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims 
were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom 
knew that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor 
victims, MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different 
states, which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual 
abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies 
or taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's 
behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to 
accept offers of financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. 
MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging 
them to massage Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately 
MAXWELL was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized 
massages during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of 
Epstein involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the 
touching of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a 
victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL 
and Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, 
as well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
EFTA00031524
--- PAGE 3 ---
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in 
illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one 
count of transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum 
sentence of 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, 
each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00031533
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a month 
later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their estimate of 
getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an estimate on the USVI 
materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more voluminous than the New York 
devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART will finalize, but I think at this point we 
should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-friendly 
format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very effective and 
efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in less than a 
month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how many

I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
discussions with 
. Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
everything is complete.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
EFTA00031540

The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
EFTA00031541
--- PAGE 8 ---
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Following up on the below, I think you had said you expected to be able to get us a list of the devices seized from the 
search warrants at Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI, as well as from his person upon arrest, in about a 
month (during our conference call a month ago) — so wanted to check if we can still expect that very soon? We're waiting 
on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the current timeline —
and also the current timeline on producing the results from those August and September searches? I think you and 
were going to coordinate on that, and you had mentioned you expected we'd have it a couple months from our call, which 
would be about a month from now. Wanted to make sure we're still on track.

Yes, I can do anytime tomorrow, and 
Rozier can also join anytime tomorrow. So whenever is good on your end. 
Also, we can host a conference call, but only up to six lines at a time — so if FBI has larger capacity than that let us know, 
otherwise I'd propose we do:

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info — 
EFTA00031550
--- PAGE 17 ---
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you know 
(that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences between MCC

Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
All: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a sex 
trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
EFTA00031576
--- PAGE 2 ---
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at the 
MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was originally 
scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had new counsel 
appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which requires 
the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a videoconference order, 
which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing each week, in addition to 
any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time Rivera 
has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, although 
defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a letter last 
night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel cited the 
accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly different and 
far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera was being 
treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that the 
disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us toe lain 
the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before 
our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to the fact that 
Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation being more 
amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to Rivera. 
Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in counsel/discovery 
access are as follows: 
Accommodation 
Maxwell 
Rivera 
Review of electronic 
discovery (NB: each 
defendant has laptop access) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (91 hours total) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (21 hours total) 
Counsel visits (by video) 
hours per day/5 days per 
week (15 hours total) 
Four hours per week (plus an 
additional two hours 
scheduled through the 
Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
total) 
Weekend legal calls 
As needed 
Not available 
The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
you were all aware of this issue. We are also ha 
to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
meantime, we are working with 
to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
explanation for the Court.

United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell. 20 Cr. 330 (AIN): In July 2020, Maxwell was charged in a six-count indictment with 
facilitating the sexual abuse of three minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997. The charges 
resulted from a multi-year investigation by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators, 
including Maxwell. Maxwell played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Epstein. Her presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein's abusive behavior, and she even 
took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
Epstein's residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and intended would result in their grooming for and 
subjection to sexual abuse, resulting in charges related to the enticement and transportation of minors to participate in 
illegal sex acts, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, 2423, and 371. Then, in an effort to cover 
up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with 
minor girls, resulting in two perjury charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. Maxwell has been detained since her arrest, 
and the Court has denied two separate bail motions, most recently as of December 28, 2020. Trial is scheduled for July 
2021, and pretrial motions are due in January 2021. The most recent press release is located here:

This will probably sound ridiculous, but I promised I'd ask (since it's from a credible publication): A reporter has heard 
rumors that Maxwell claims she was in possession of video(s) Epstein captured of Dershowitz and other high-profile 
individuals at the time of her arrest and may be using them to negotiate with you...

All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
EFTA00031589
--- PAGE 2 ---
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet.

As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 1 of 5 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC //: 
DATE FILED: 
3/18/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its omnibus memorandum of law opposing 
Defendants' twelve pre-trial motions. It filed the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, 
under temporary seal pending the Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or 
confidential information. See Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to 
certain of the redactions that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional 
redactions. Having considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the 
Government's requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional 
redaction requests, with the exceptions discussed below. 
To begin with, the Court's reasoning is guided by the three-part test articulated by the 
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under 
this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are "judicial 
documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; 
and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 119-20. 
"Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to `the danger of impairing law 
enforcement or judicial efficiency' and `the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.' Id. at 
120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo IT)). 
I 
EFTA00031598
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 2 of 5 
The proposed redactions mostly satisfy this test. First, the Government's brief in 
opposition to the Defendant's pre-trial motions is a "judicial document" for purposes of the first 
element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 
1995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First Amendment 
presumption of access. Id. at 146; see also Nixon v. Warner Conzmc 'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 
(1978). The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrowly tailored to 
serve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access. 
Like the Government's previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the 
Government bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are necessary to 
protect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties' personal 
privacy interests. As a general matter, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for 
overcoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 
460, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 420, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the 
Government's brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit 1 contains a single redaction—the 
name of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual's personal privacy interests 
outweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The 
proposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only 
the names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety 
and privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that attaches to those 
documents. 
The Court overrules the Defendant's objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5 
of the Government's brief and adopts the Government's proposed redactions. The core of the 
EFTA00031599
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 3 of 5 
Defendant's objections relate to her contention that some of the information contained in the 
redactions has been made public by other means. Notwithstanding this, the redactions to which 
the Defendant objects relate to the privacy interests of third parties, which the Second Circuit has 
admonished "should weigh heavily in a court's balancing equation." United States v. Amodeo 
("Amodeo II"), 71 F.3d 1044,1050 (2d Cir. 1995). At least some of the redactions to which the 
Defendant objects relate to private "family affairs" of a third party, a factor that "weigh[s] more 
heavily against access than conduct affecting a substantial portion of the public." Id. at 1051. 
And though the Defendant contends that some of the information contained in the redactions is 
public, she furnishes no evidence to that effect. As a result, the Court concludes that the 
significant privacy interests at stake justify the limited and narrowly tailored redactions 
contained in Exhibit 5. 
In addition, the Court adopts the Defendant's proposed additional redactions to pages 
129-134 of the Government's brief. Those portions of the transcript, which were redacted in the 
civil matter, concern privacy interests and their disclosure would merely serve to cater to a 
"craving for that which is sensational and impure." Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1051 (citation 
omitted). The Court thus concludes that such redactions are justified. 
On the other hand, the Court agrees with the Defendant's objections to the redactions 
contained in pages 1-128 of the Government's brief. To provide some context, the redacted 
portions of the brief relate to sealed proceedings that took place before different judges relating 
to the issuance of grand jury subpoenas in connection with the present case. See Dkt. No. 51. 
Because the Government's brief is a judicial document and because the presumption of access 
attaches, the Government's redaction requests must be "necessary to preserve higher values and 
only if the sealing order is narrowly tailored to achieve that aim." Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of 
EFTA00031600
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 4 of 5 
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 124 (2d Cir. 2006). Courts have noted that "disclosing the details of 
the Government's efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation, as the 
individuals and entities under investigation would be put on notice." United States v. Madoff, 
626 F. Supp. 2d 420, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). And the Government's interest in protecting an 
ongoing investigation from the "danger of impairing law enforcement" may be a countervailing 
factor that outweighs the presumption of access. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120. But the 
Government advances no non-conclusory basis as to why its investigation at this stage of the 
matter would be imperiled by the disclosure of the information regarding how it obtained the 
information in question, and the requested redactions are far from narrowly tailored. As a result, 
the Court denies the Government's redaction requests in pages 1-128 and denies its request to 
file Exhibits 8 and 9 under seal, since those documents relate to this very issue and the same 
reasoning applies to them. The Court will give the Government an opportunity to seek more 
tailored redactions if it wishes and to specifically justify the ongoing need to redact the requested 
information and documents. By March 22, 2021, the Government may file a letter with the 
Court—under seal, if necessary—justifying the specific redaction and sealing requests. 
Alternatively, by that date the Government can indicate that it will not seek to renew the request. 
Furthermore, the Court agrees with the Defendant's objections to the redactions 
contained in pages 187-188 of the Government's brief. While the Court previously had granted 
the request to redact the same information, see Dkt. No. 99, the Court no longer sees a basis for 
keeping this information under seal in light of the strong presumption of access. The information 
does not in itself contain any personally identifying information, and the Court concludes that 
any minimal threat of interference with the Government's investigation through the disclosure of 
this information is outweighed by the presumption of access that attaches to those portions. As 
EFTA00031601
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 5 of 5 
above, however, the Court will give the Government an opportunity to justify the ongoing need 
to redact this information and these documents; by March 22, 2021, the Government may file a 
letter with the Court—under seal, if necessary—justifying the redaction and sealing requests. 
Finally, the Court denies the Government's request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. 
While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. 
See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 1212-1. In light of this, the Court sees 
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant portions. 
In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket on ECF their 
brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file a letter with the Court 
justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding pages 1-128 and 187-188 and 
Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The parties are further ORDERED to meet, 
confer, and jointly propose redactions to the Defendant's cover letter objecting to the 
Government's proposed redactions by March 22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to 
meet, confer, and propose redactions to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 
22, 2021. 
SO ORDERED.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Mr. Manley: 
The Government writes in response to your letter to the Honorable Alison J. Nathan regarding 
your client 
and your request for assurances regarding ensuring your client's anonymity 
in upcoming criminal proceedings, including in documents or information that identifies your client. 
As an initial matter, the Government notes that to date, there have been no filings on the public 
docket in the above-captioned criminal case that name your client. Second, to the extent the 
Government has produced documents with your client's name to the defense pursuant to its disclosure 
obligations in this criminal case, those materials have been designated as confidential and are 
governed by the Protective Order in this case (Dkt. No. 36). Pursuant to the Protective Order, the 
defense is prohibited from filing publicly any confidential information referenced in the discovery 
materials, unless authorized by the Government in writing or by order of the Court. The defense has 
complied with this requirement of the Protective Order and has indicated that it will continue to do 
SO. 
As to the upcoming criminal trial in this matter, the Government notes that it does not intend 
to call your client as a witness at trial. As a courtesy,' we note that your client's name may arise 
As a general matter, the Government is not obligated to provide a detailed preview to the defense, 
or third parties, about how it expects to prove its case at trial. 
EFTA00031609

during the public testimony of witnesses and may be listed on public exhibits introduced at trial. See 
United States v. Akhavan, 20 Cr. 188 (JSR), 2021 WL 1216909, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. I, 2021) ("[T]he 
public has a similar right to access documents presented to the jury, and in criminal cases, this right 
stems from not only the common law, but also the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a 'public trial.' 
Indeed, the Second Circuit has explained that 'the public has an especially strong right of access to 
evidence introduced in trials."' (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). 
Finally, although the Government is mindful of privacy interests of third parties,' we are not 
aware of any procedure under United States criminal law that allows third parties to exercise input 
regarding whether or not their names or information about them will be mentioned at a criminal trial, 
nor would it be legally permissible to conduct a trial under seal or preclude public access to a criminal 
trial. 
Respectfully submitted, 
AUDREY STRAUSS 
United States Attorney 
By:  
s/
Assistant United States Attorneys 
Cc: The Honorable Alison J. Nathan (By email) 
Defense counsel (By email) 
The Government is not presently aware of any authority under which the privacy laws of the United 
Kingdom would have any force in this jurisdiction, and your letter cites none. In addition, the 
Government respectfully notes that your client is not a victim of child sexual exploitation in 
connection with this case, and thus the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, does not apply.

As you are undoubtedly aware, there has been some press coverage since yesterday about the release pursuant to FOIA of 
some USMS records. I just spoke with the Associate General Counsel at the USMS, who wanted to provide us with the 
actual source materials (USM lls (equivalent of 302s)) that were inadvertently released, because they were not in all 
circumstances accurately reported, and he wanted to make sure that if we are concerned about any harm to our 
investigation from the release, that we have the original materials. He also offered to serve as a POC if we have any 
questions.

Subject: MCC NY Epstein Investigation 
I work at MCC NY. I was working the rear gate area when the gate pass inmate named 
brought 
back to the gate bays of shredded papers to throw out into the dumpster on Thursday and one bag on Friday. He stated 
that members of the BOP after action team that were investigating what happened with the Epstein suicide were 
shredding boxes of paperwork. He stated, "they are shredding everything". He stated that he even was told to help them 
shred paperwork too. I believe that this conduct maybe inappropriate for a investigative team to be shredding 
paperwork related to the investigation and you may want to investigate why BOP employees were destroying records.

Hope everyone is having a nice weekend. Attached is a draft letter, please feel free to edit freely. I tried to capture 
defense counsel's position in this letter, but again, please edit if you think I have missed anything. 
asked to see this 
later tonight or tomorrow morning so would appreciate any edits by tonight if possible (I'll be in NJ for Mother's Day so 
won't be able to turn to it until this evening). Thoughts on responding to 
latest email? Should we just say that the 
November 29 trial start date would permit the entire team to do the trial?

ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On April 21, 2021, the Court's Chambers received a letter from counsel for a non-party 
requesting assurances as to privacy protections for his client in any filings or proceedings in this 
case. The letter requests anonymity on behalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. 
After receiving the letter, the Court forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to 
respond to counsel, which it has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 
21, 2021 letter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non-party asserting 
that interest. 
The Government is requested to forward this order to counsel for the non-party. 
SO ORDERED.

DATE FILED: 
5/3/2I 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
The Court has received an exchange of letters that pertain to an incident that took place 
on April 24, 2021. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258, 259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. 
Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by 
providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-person attorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. 
Maxwell's lawyers categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against 
MDC staff based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates 
no views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either 
side's allegations. This Court's obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the 
defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential attorney-
client communications, and prepare for trial. 
Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After 
receiving the defense's first letter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to show cause 
why the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in 
part defense counsel's original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain 
questions about the April 24, 2021 incident and the procedures in place to ensure the 
confidentiality of Ms. Maxwell's lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense 
EFTA00031685
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 265 Filed 05/03/21 Page 2 of 3 
counsel's current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of 
the in-person attorney-client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of 
defense counsel's preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel 
are entitled to view or receive copies of those materials as a matter of law, they should be 
provided. To the extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this 
Court, that application is denied. 
The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the opportunity 
to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all relevant circumstances 
and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates in BOP custody. The isolated 
incident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the serious allegations leveled by MDC legal 
counsel and defense counsel in no way undermine the Court's conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and 
her lawyers are fully able to prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize 
the importance of this going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial. 
In furtherance of this, counsel for the Government are ORDERED to confer with legal 
counsel for MDC to ensure that Ms. Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney-
client communications as she prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel 
shall promptly confer with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek to 
resolve any such issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails, the parties 
may write to the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and justifying any specific 
application being made. 
SO ORDERED.

Docket Text: 
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court concludes that the interests of justice justify 
granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021 to be 
reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to 
prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while also 
ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary or in 
the interests of justice. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by May 10, 
2021, they shall jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the Clerk's Office 
(as is required by COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to the earliest 
possible date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in order to facilitate an 
early fall trial start date. The parties shall also discuss and propose any adjustments 
necessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt. No. 250. The Government may move in the 
letter for any requested exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act. (Signed by Judge 
J. Nathan on 5/3/2021) (See ORDER set forth) (ap)

All,

--- PAGE 2 ---
I am looking forward to tomorrow's White Collar Crime Committee meeting. Hard to believe it will be our last meeting 
before the summer. 
Upcoming Events 
We'll begin the meeting by discussing two exciting events scheduled for the fall: (1) the International Symposium, which 
will take place on November 29-30, 2021, and (2) the panel event featuring authors of prominent books on white collar 
crime, which is calendared for September 13, 2021. Although these events aren't for a few months, given the summer 
break, we'll spend a few minutes discussing tomorrow. 
Speaker 
During the second half of the meeting, we will be joined by Ken Blanco. Ken served for many years as a Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General in the Criminal Division, after service as an AUSA in the Southern District of Florida. After a stint as 
Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, Ken joined the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as its Director. Ken recently left the government to join Citi as Chief Compliance Officer of 
its newly created financial crimes unit. 
Rule 17 Project 
The bulk of the meeting will involve a continuation of our discussion of the Rule 17 advocacy project. Since our last 
meeting, the working group and I have engaged in productive dialogue with the federal defenders and the federal 
prosecutors on our committee. Based on those conversations, we propose striking the "other than the victim" language 
we had proposed adding to Rule 17(c), which, in our initial proposal read "After a complaint, indictment, or information is 
filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about an individual (non-corporate) 
victim may be served on a third party, other than the victim,_only by court order." Striking the "other than the victim" 
language is intended to address concerns from both the Government (about victim safety) and from the Federal 
Defenders' liaison to the Rules Committee. In addition, we have also tweaked the cover letter to the Rules Committee to 
address these concerns, to emphasize that our proposal is intended to reduce ambiguity in the Rule as currently drafted, 
and to emphasize the fact that, without meaningful subpoena power, many criminal defendants are effectively limited to 
building their defense around information gathered and provided by the Government and are severely constrained in 
building their own affirmative defenses to meet the Government's allegations. 
Both groups provided feedback (all in their individual capacities and not on behalf of their organizations), which we 
summarize below and hope to discuss tomorrow: 
• The proposed revisions actually increase the authority of prosecutors by allowing them to more easily use trial 
subpoenas to obtain documents from third parties in advance of trial. 
• Permitting subpoenas without judicial "gate-keeping" could spark backlash to the proposal. 
• The Committee should consider revisions to Rule 17(b), which requires court approval of subpoenas for "named 
witnesses" where the defendant can't pay witness fees — a requirement that is logistically challenging and only 
applicable to indigent defendants. 
• The letter overstates equity arguments in describing the Government's access to more powerful investigative tools 
because: (i) the Government must satisfy a very high burden and (ii) the Government is constrained by Federal Rule 
of Criminal Procedure 6, the Privacy Act, and Department of Justice Policy with respect to the information it may 
subpoena and how that information may be used. 
• The letter overstates the flaws of the Nixon standard, since the Government's robust discovery obligations 
adequately enable a defendant to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a case against him. 
• Significantly expanding a defendant's Rule 17 subpoena capabilities may negatively influence the willingness of 
victims and witnesses to cooperate, and motions to quash provide an insufficient remedy to address this issue. 
• The letter offers an inadequate rationale for limiting court approval to subpoenas regarding victims. 
We hope to reach consensus on if/how to address the feedback above as well as on any remaining open issues. Ideally, 
the working group—with the Committee's approval—will then finalize and submit the proposal over the coming weeks. I 
have once again attached the latest version of the revised rule proposal (in clean and redlined versions), as well as the 
draft letter to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules that the working group has put together.

My name is Bryan Llenas and I am a National Correspondent at the Fox News Channel. 
Mark Epstein, the brother of Jeffrey Epstein, is telling Fox News Channel that the SDNY is withholding 
Jeffrey's full medical examiner files and that the SDNY continues to cancel meetings on him. 
Does the SDNY have a response to Mark's claims above? 
What does the SDNY have to say about his claims that no one has given him evidence or explained to him why 
they ruled his brother's death a homicide?

Just FYI for everybody, today the Second Circuit has unsealed (and posted) a ton of documents from the 
Ghislaine Maxwell libel lawsuit, so there likely will be a ton of reporting on that. Any reference to those newly-unsealed 
documents are separate from—and do not include—any filings we've made, and are independent of our case. 
(We have been aware of the litigation and generally aware of the filings, though it also won't hurt to have a bunch of 
journalists combing through them and reporting out interesting elements.) 
Anyway just wanted to note that there's likely to be a flood of attention to this development but that it's not anything new 
specifically from our investigation.

Sony to bother you on a Sunday. I'm a journalist with the UK's Daily Telegraph. 
Is it possible to say, on background, whether you want to question Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell [both

There is also a report in the New York Post that Ms Maxwell is "cooperating with authorities". Can you confirm,

USA v. Maxwell 
Case Number:

Document Number: 104 
Docket Text: 
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed 
motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, 
the Court DENIES the Defendant's motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially 
confidential information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 
hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by 
reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 
2006). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court 
will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the 
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pretrial 
detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the parties are ORDERED to 
submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose an redactions and the justification for any such 
proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97. (Signed by Judge 
J. Nathan on 12/28/20)(jw)

cee below — just wanted to loop you into this too, since we've previously talked about the search warrant returns. 
We are now finally starting to get a significant amount into the system, but the problem is we have no idea what it is, 
where it's from, etc. We're just getting huge amounts of documents, but don't know what device they came from, room, 
any identifying info, etc etc. So working on getting that. 
Currently, both 
have access on Relativity to a little over 20,000 documents from the Manhattan 
residence, and I expect that will go up substantially in the next week or so once we get this next set of materials reviewed 
for privilege. 
Happy to chat if that'd be useful, and thanks as always.

Subject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents 
I'm not sure w 
' 
exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive tha 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
EFTA00031712
--- PAGE 2 ---
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, an 
nd I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, an w at as been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have,. 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every evice, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Hi 
It was great chatting with you earlier this morning! Attached you'll find a smaller zip folder containing just the tax returns, 
for each year from 2015 to 2019. You shouldn't need a password to open the folders, but in case it prompts you, the 
password defense counsel provided us is: 
The entirety of the Financial Report Appendices are still loading onto USAFx, and it appears as if there is less than a third 
left to download. I'm estimating it will take about another hour to an hour and a half for everything to finish downloading 
there. Once they've downloaded, I'll share the folder with you. 
Thank you so much for your patience 
and please let me know if you encounter any issues viewing these tax 
returns!

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
In the case of Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom, 
The European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a 
Chamber composed of: 
Lech Garlicki, President, 
David Th6r Bjorgvinsson, 
Nicolas Bratza, 
Paivi Hirvelg, 
George Nicolaou, 
Ledi Bianku, 
Nebojga Vuoinie, judges, 
and Lawrence Early, Section Registrar, 
Having deliberated in private on 20 March 2012, 
Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: 
PROCEDURE 
1. The case originated in five applications (nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 
36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09) against the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 
("the Convention"). 
2. The first application was lodged on 10 June 2007 by two British 
nationals, Mr Babar Ahmad ("the first applicant") and Mr Haroon Rashid 
Aswat ("the second applicant"). They were both born in 1974. 
The second application was lodged on 5 March 2008 by Mr Syed Tahla 
Ahsan ("the third applicant"), who is also a British national. He was born in 
1979. 
The third application was lodged on I August 2008 by Mr Mustafa 
Kamal Mustafa, known more commonly as Abu Hamza ("the fourth 
applicant"). He is a British national, who was born in 1958. 
The fourth application was lodged on 21 December 2009 by Mr Adel 
Abdul Bary ("the fifth applicant"). He is an Egyptian national who was born 
in 1960. 
The fifth application was lodged on 22 December 2009 by Mr Khaled 
Al-Fawwaz ("the sixth applicant"). He is a Saudi Arabian national who was 
born in 1962. 
3. The first, second, third and fifth applicants were represented by 
Ms G. Peirce, a lawyer practising in London with Birnberg Peirce & 
Partners, assisted by Mr B. Cooper, counsel. The fourth applicant was 
represented by Ms M. Arani, a lawyer practising in Middlesex, assisted by 
Mr A. Jones QC and Mr B. Brandon, counsel. The sixth applicant was 
represented by Mr A. Raja, a lawyer practising in London with Quist 
EFTA00031735

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
Solicitors, assisted by Mr J. Jones, counsel. The Government were 
represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office. 
4. The applicants, who are the subject of extradition requests made by 
the United States of America, alleged in particular that, if extradited and 
convicted in the United States, they would be at real risk of ill-treatment 
either as a result of conditions of detention at ADX Florence (which would 
be made worse by the imposition of "special administrative measures") or 
by the length of their possible sentences. 
5. On 6 July 2010 the Court delivered its admissibility decision in 
respect of the first four applicants. 
It declared admissible the first, second and third applicants' complaints 
concerning detention at ADX Florence and the imposition of special 
administrative measures post-trial. It declared the fourth applicant's 
complaint in respect of ADX Florence inadmissible, finding that, as a result 
of his medical conditions (see paragraph 37 below), there was no real risk of 
his spending anything more than a short period of time at ADX Florence. 
The Court also declared admissible all four applicants' complaints 
concerning the length of their possible sentences. It declared inadmissible 
the remainder of the applicants' complaints. 
Finally, the Court decided to continue to indicate to the Government 
under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that it was desirable in the interests of 
the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicants should not be 
extradited until further notice. 
6. On 3 September 2010, the President of the Chamber decided, under 
Rule 54 § 2 (b) of the Rules of Court, that notice of the fifth and sixth 
applicants' cases should be given to the Government of the United 
Kingdom. It was further decided that the Rule 39 indications made in 
respect of these applicants should also remain in place until further notice. 
7. Further to the Court's admissibility decision of 6 July 2010 and the 
President's decision of 3 September 2010, all six applicants and the 
Government filed observations (Rules 54 § 2 (b) and 59 § I). In addition, 
third-party comments 
were 
received 
from 
the 
non-governmental 
organisations the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Litigation 
Project at Yale Law School, Interights and Reprieve, which had been given 
leave by the President of the Chamber to intervene in the written procedure 
(Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2). The parties replied to 
those comments (Rule 44 § 5).

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
THE FACTS 
I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES 
A. The United States indictments 
8. The applicants have been indicted on various charges of terrorism in 
the United States of America. They are the subject of three separate sets of 
criminal proceedings in the United States federal courts. The first set 
concerns the first applicant, Mr Ahmad, and the third applicant, Mr Ahsan. 
The second set of proceedings concerns the second applicant, Mr Aswat, 
and the fourth applicant, Abu Hamza. The third set of proceedings concerns 
the fifth applicant, Mr Bary, and the sixth applicant, Mr Al Fawwaz. 
9. The details of each indictment are set out below. On the basis of each 
indictment, the United States Government requested each applicant's 
extradition from the United Kingdom. Each applicant then contested his 
proposed extradition in separate proceedings in the English courts. 
I. The indictment concerning the first and third applicants 
10. The indictment against the first applicant was returned by a Federal 
Grand Jury sitting in Connecticut on 6 October 2004. It alleges the 
commission of four felonies between 1997 and August 2004: conspiracy to 
provide material support to terrorists; providing material support to 
terrorists; conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage 
property in a foreign country; and money laundering. On 28 June 2006, a 
similar indictment was returned against the third applicant, save that the 
charge of money laundering was not included. For both indictments, the 
material support is alleged to have been provided through a series of 
websites, one of whose servers was based in Connecticut. The charge of 
conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage property in a 
foreign country is based on two allegations: first, that the websites exhorted 
Muslims to travel to Chechnya and Afghanistan to defend those places; and 
second, that classified US Navy plans relating to a US naval battle group 
operating in the Straits of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf had been sent to the 
website. The plans are alleged to have discussed the battle group's 
vulnerability to terrorist attack. 
2. The indictment concerning the second and fourth applicants 
11. The indictment against the fourth applicant was returned on 
April 2004 by a Federal Grand Jury sitting in the Southern District of 
EFTA00031737
--- PAGE 6 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
New York. It charges him with eleven different counts of criminal conduct. 
These cover three sets of facts. 
12. The first group of charges relates to the taking of sixteen hostages in 
Yemen in December 1998, four of whom died during a rescue mission 
conducted by Yemeni forces. The indictment charges the fourth applicant 
with conspiracy to take hostages and hostage taking and relates principally 
to his contact with the leader of the hostage takers, Abu Al-Hassan, before 
and during the events in question. 
13. The second group of charges relates to the conduct of violent jihad 
in Afghanistan in 2001. The indictment alleges that the fourth applicant 
provided material and financial assistance to his followers and arranged for 
them to meet Taliban commanders in Afghanistan. In this respect, four 
counts of the indictment charge him with providing and concealing material 
support and resources to terrorists and a foreign terrorist organisation and 
conspiracy thereto. A further count charges him with conspiracy to supply 
goods and services to the Taliban. 
14. The third group of charges relates to a conspiracy to establish a jihad 
training camp in Bly, Oregon between June 2000 and December 2001. 
Two counts charge the fourth applicant with providing and concealing 
material support and resources to terrorists and providing material support 
and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation (Al Qaeda); a further two 
counts charge him with conspiracy to the main two counts. 
15. On 12 September 2005, a superseding indictment was returned 
which named and indicted the second applicant as the fourth applicant's 
alleged co-conspirator in respect of the Bly, Oregon charges (thus charging 
the second applicant with the same four counts as those faced by the fourth 
applicant in respect of the Bly, Oregon conspiracy). On 6 February 2006 a 
second superseding indictment was returned, which indicted a third man, 
Oussama Abdullah Kassir, as a co-conspirator in respect of the Bly, Oregon 
charges. 
16. Mr Kassir was extradited to the United States from the Czech 
Republic in September 2007. On 12 May 2009, Mr Kassir was convicted on 
five counts relating to the Bly, Oregon jihad camp conspiracy. He was also 
convicted of a further six counts relating to the operation of terrorist 
websites. On 15 September 2009, after submissions from Mr Kassir and his 
defence counsel, the trial judge sentenced Mr Kassir to the maximum 
permissible sentence on each count. As a life sentence was the maximum 
permissible sentence on two of the counts, Mr Kassir had effectively been 
sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. 
3. The indictment concerning the fifth and sixth applicants 
17. In 1999 a Federal Grand Jury sitting in the Southern District of New 
York returned an indictment against Osama bin Laden and twenty other 
individuals, including the applicants, inter alia alleging various degrees of 
EFTA00031738
--- PAGE 7 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
involvement in or support for the bombing of the United States embassies in 
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998. 
18. The fifth applicant is charged with four counts: conspiracy to kill 
United States nationals, conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to destroy 
buildings and property, and conspiracy to attack national defence utilities. 
19. The sixth applicant is charged with two hundred and eighty-five 
counts of criminal conduct, including over two hundred and sixty-nine 
counts of murder. 
B. The applicants' extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom 
I. Extradition proceedings against the first applicant 
20. The first applicant was arrested in London on 5 August 2004. On 
March 2005, the United States Embassy in London issued Diplomatic 
Note No. 25. Where relevant, the note provides: 
"Pursuant to Article IV of the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the 
United States and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland, the Government of the United States hereby assures the Government 
of the United Kingdom that the United States will neither seek the death penalty 
against, nor will the death penalty be carried out, against Babar Ahmad upon his 
extradition to the United States. 
The Government of the United States further assures the Government of the United 
Kingdom that upon extradition to the United States, Babar Ahmad will be prosecuted 
before a Federal Court in accordance with the full panoply of rights and protections 
that would otherwise be provided to a defendant facing similar charges. 
Pursuant to his extradition, Babar Ahmad will not be prosecuted before a military 
commission, as specified in the President's Military Order of November 13, 2001; nor 
will he be criminally prosecuted in any tribunal or court other than a United States 
Federal Court; nor will he be treated or designated as an enemy combatant..." 
21. Similar Diplomatic Notes were provided in respect of the other 
applicants in the course of their respective extradition proceedings. 
22. At the extradition hearing before the Senior District Judge, the first 
applicant argued, inter alia, that, notwithstanding the Diplomatic Note, the 
risk of the death penalty being imposed remained since he could be tried on 
a superseding indictment. He further argued that he remained at risk of 
being designated as an "enemy combatant" pursuant to United States 
Military Order No. 1 and that he remained at risk of extraordinary rendition 
to a third country. He also argued that there was a substantial risk that he 
would be subjected to special administrative measures whilst in detention in 
a federal prison, which could involve, among other measures, solitary 
confinement in violation of Article 3 and restrictions on communication 
with lawyers in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. 
EFTA00031739
--- PAGE 8 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
23. In a decision given on 17 May 2005, the Senior District Judge ruled 
that the extradition could proceed and that, inter alia, the first applicant's 
extradition would not be incompatible with his rights under the Convention. 
The Senior District Judge found that, on the basis of the Diplomatic Note, 
there was no risk that the death penalty would be imposed, that the applicant 
would be designated as an enemy combatant, or subjected to extraordinary 
rendition. The Senior District Judge found the application of special 
administrative measures to be the greatest ground for concern but concluded 
that, having regard to the safeguards accompanying such measures, there 
would be no breach of the applicant's Convention rights. 
24. The Senior District Judge concluded as follows: 
"This is a difficult and troubling case. The [first applicant] is a British subject who is 
alleged to have committed offences which, if the evidence were available, could have 
been prosecuted in this country. Nevertheless the Government of the United States are 
entitled to seek his extradition under the terms of the Treaty and I am satisfied that 
none of the statutory bars [to extradition] apply." 
Accordingly, he sent the case to the Secretary of State for his decision as 
to whether the first applicant should be extradited. 
25. On 15 November 2005, the Secretary of State (Mr Charles Clarke) 
ordered the first applicant's extradition. The first applicant appealed to the 
High Court (see paragraphs 29 et seq. below). 
2. Extradition proceedings against the second applicant 
26. On 7 August 2005 the second applicant was arrested in the United 
Kingdom, also on the basis of an arrest warrant issued under section 73 of 
the Extradition Act 2003, following a request for his provisional arrest by 
the United States. 
27. The Senior District Judge gave his decision in the second applicant's 
case on 5 January 2006. He concluded that none of the bars to extradition 
applied, and sent the case to the Secretary of State for his decision as to 
whether the second applicant should be extradited. 
28. On 1 March 2006, the Secretary of State ordered his extradition. The 
second applicant appealed to the High Court. 
3. The first and second applicants' appeals to the High Court 
29. The first and second applicants' appeals were heard together. In its 
judgment of 30 November 2006, the High Court rejected their appeals. The 
High Court found that, according to the case-law of this Court, solitary 
confinement did not in itself constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. 
Applying that approach, the evidence before it — which included an affidavit 
from a United States Department of Justice official outlining the operation 
of special administrative measures — did not "begin to establish a concrete 
case under Article 3". 
EFTA00031740
--- PAGE 9 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
30. The first and second applicants applied for permission to appeal to 
the House of Lords. This was refused by the House of Lords on 
June 2007. 
4. Extradition proceedings against the third applicant 
31. The United States formally requested the extradition of the third 
applicant on 15 September 2006. The extradition hearing started on 
November 2006 on which date the Senior District Judge determined that 
the third applicant was accused of offences for which he could be 
extradited. The case was then adjourned for evidence and argument, 
inter alia as to whether the third applicant's extradition would be 
compatible with his Convention rights. The hearing resumed on 19 March 
2007. By now bound by the High Court's judgment in respect of the first 
and second applicants, the Senior District Judge found that the third 
applicant's extradition would be compatible with the Convention. 
He accordingly sent the case to the Secretary of State for his decision as to 
whether the third applicant should be extradited. 
32. On 14 June 2007, the Secretary of State (Dr John Reid) ordered that 
the extradition could proceed. The third applicant appealed against this 
decision to the High Court and also sought judicial review of the alleged 
failure of the Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales ("the 
DPP") to consider whether he should instead be tried in the United 
Kingdom. He relied on guidance agreed between the Attorney General of 
the United States and his United Kingdom counterparts for handling 
criminal cases with concurrent jurisdiction between the United Kingdom 
and the United States (see paragraph 63 below). 
33. On 10 April 2008 the High Court dismissed the third applicant's 
human rights appeal, relying on its ruling in respect of the first and second 
applicants. In the same judgment, it also dismissed his application for 
judicial review, finding that the guidance had no application to the third 
applicant's case. The guidance only applied to cases where there had been 
an investigation of the case in the United Kingdom and the DPP had been 
seized of the case as prosecutor. 
34. On 14 May 2008 the High Court refused to certify a point of law of 
general public importance which ought to be considered by the House of 
Lords and also refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. 
5. Extradition proceedings against the fourth applicant 
35. The United States requested the fourth applicant's extradition on 
May 2004. He was arrested in London on 5 August 2004. 
36. The extradition proceedings were adjourned when he was convicted 
of offences in the United Kingdom and sentenced to seven years' 
imprisonment (see Mustafa (Abu Hama) v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) 
EFTA00031741
--- PAGE 10 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
(dec.), no. 31411/07, 18 January 2011). The extradition proceedings 
resumed when the criminal appeals process was concluded. 
a. The District Court proceedings 
37. When the case came before the Senior District Judge for his decision 
as to whether the extradition could proceed, the fourth applicant argued, 
inter alia, that his extradition would give rise to a real risk of a violation of 
Article 3 of the Convention since he would be likely to be detained in a 
"supermax" detention facility such as the United States Penitentiary, 
Administrative Maximum, Florence, Colorado ("ADX Florence"). In this 
connection, he also relied on his poor health, specifically his type-two 
diabetes, his high blood pressure, the loss of sight in his right eye and poor 
vision in his left, the amputation of both his forearms (which frequently led 
to infections through abrasions), psoriasis on much of his body, 
hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating). A violation of Article 3, he claimed, 
would also result from the imposition of special administrative measures. 
38. The Senior District Judge, in his ruling of 15 November 2007, 
rejected all these submissions. In respect of detention at ADX Florence the 
Senior District Judge found that the fourth applicant's poor health and 
disabilities would be considered and, at worst, he would only be detained 
there for a relatively short period of time. The Senior District Judge was 
also not satisfied that special administrative measures would be applied to 
the fourth applicant but even if they were, he was bound by the ruling of the 
High Court in respect of the first and second applicants. Having concluded 
that none of the bars to extradition applied, the Senior District Judge sent 
the case to the Secretary of State (Ms Jacqui Smith) for her decision as to 
whether the fourth applicant should be extradited. She ordered his 
extradition on 7 February 2008. The fourth applicant appealed to the 
High Court against the Secretary of State's decision and against the decision 
of the Senior District Judge. 
b. The High Court proceedings 
39. Before the High Court, the fourth applicant again relied on his 
submission that conditions of detention at ADX Florence would not comply 
with Article 3. He also argued that the length of the possible sentence he 
faced in the United States would be contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. 
40. The High Court gave its judgment on 20 June 2008, dismissing the 
fourth applicant's appeal. In relation to Article 3, the High Court found that, 
if convicted, the fourth applicant would be sentenced to very lengthy terms 
of imprisonment and that, in all likelihood, a life sentence would be 
imposed. It found that this, of itself, would not constitute a breach of Article 
3. On the question of the compatibility of detention at ADX Florence with 
Article 3, the High Court relied in particular on the understanding of the 
prison warden, Mr Robert Wiley, to the effect that if, after a full medical 
EFTA00031742
--- PAGE 11 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
evaluation, it was determined that the fourth applicant could not manage his 
activities of daily living, it would be highly unlikely that he would be placed 
at ADX Florence rather than at a medical centre. Accordingly, there was no 
risk of a violation of Article 3 on this ground. However, the High Court 
added: 
"[T]he constitution of the United States of America guarantees not only 'due 
process', but it also prohibits 'cruel and unusual punishment'. As part of the judicial 
process prisoners, including those incarcerated in Supermax prisons, are entitled to 
challenge the conditions in which they are confined, and these challenges have, on 
occasions, met with success. 
We should add that, subject to detailed argument which may be advanced in another 
case, like Judge Workman [the Senior District Judge], we too are troubled about what 
we have read about the conditions in some of the Supermax prisons in the United 
States. Naturally, the most dangerous criminals should expect to be incarcerated in the 
most secure conditions, but even allowing for a necessarily wide margin of 
appreciation between the views of different civilised countries about the conditions in 
which prisoners should be detained, confinement for years and years in what 
effectively amounts to isolation may well be held to be, if not torture, then ill 
treatment which contravenes Article 3. This problem may fall to be addressed in a 
different case." 
41. The fourth applicant then applied to the High Court for a certificate 
of points of law of general public importance and for leave to appeal to the 
House of Lords. On 23 July 2008, the High Court refused both applications. 
6. Extradition proceedings against the fifth and sixth applicants 
42. The United States Government requested the fifth and sixth 
applicants' extradition from the United Kingdom in July 1999 and 
September 1998 respectively. 
a. The initial extradition proceedings 
43. At his committal hearing before the District Court, the sixth 
applicant contended that extradition was only permitted within the terms of 
the 1972 USA-UK Extradition Treaty for offences committed within the 
jurisdiction of the requesting State, and not when that State exercised 
jurisdiction over extra-territorial offences. He further argued that there was 
"insufficient evidence" to prove a prima facie case, which was a 
requirement for extradition under the Treaty. As part of that submission, he 
sought to have excluded two anonymous witness statements, which had 
been provided by two informants, "CS/1" and "CS/2", and which the United 
States Government relied upon as part of their case against him. It was later 
revealed that CS/1 was a Mr Al-Fadl who had given evidence against the 
certain of the applicants' co-defendants during their trial in the United 
States.

44. In his ruling of 8 September 1999, the District Judge rejected these 
submissions. He considered that the proper construction of the Treaty did 
not prevent the exercise of jurisdiction over extra-territorial offences. The 
District Judge was also satisfied that there were real grounds for fear if the 
identities of CS/1 and CS/2 were revealed. Thus, their anonymous witness 
statements could be admitted as evidence of a prima facie case. He further 
found that there was a case for the sixth applicant to answer. 
45. The sixth applicant appealed to the High Court by way of an 
application for a writ of habeas corpus. The application was dismissed on 
November 2000. The High Court held that it was necessary to show that 
the crime in respect of which extradition was sought was alleged to have 
been committed within the actual territory of the United States. The 
High Court was, however, satisfied that three overt acts alleged by the 
United States of America could be relied on to found territorial jurisdiction 
in the United States, namely (a) the setting up and operating of a secure 
telephone line in the United States by the sixth applicant through an 
organisation called MCI; (b) the purchase by the sixth applicant of a satellite 
phone system in the United States and (c) the issuing, in pursuance of the 
conspiracy of fatwas and jihads, allegedly prepared with the concurrence of 
the sixth applicant in the United States and elsewhere. The High Court also 
found that the District Judge had not erred in admitting the evidence of CS/1 
or in finding that there was a prima facie case against the sixth applicant. It 
did not consider it necessary reach any conclusions in respect of CS/2, 
judging CS/1's evidence to be "far the most significant". 
46. While the sixth applicant's appeal was pending before the 
High Court, a committal hearing before the District Court was held in 
respect of the fifth applicant. The District Judge gave his ruling on 25 April 
2000 in which he reaffirmed the rulings he had made in respect of the sixth 
applicant and found that there was also a prima facie case against the fifth 
applicant. 
47. The fifth applicant also appealed to the High Court and, on 2 May 
2001, a differently constituted court dismissed his appeal. Again the 
High Court found that the District Judge had not erred in admitting the 
anonymous evidence of CS/1; that there was sufficient evidence against the 
fifth applicant for the extradition to proceed, and that the United States had 
jurisdiction to try him. 
48. Both applicants appealed to the House of Lords. Their appeals were 
dismissed on 17 December 2001. The House of Lords found unanimously 
that the High Court had erred in its finding in respect of jurisdiction: it was 
sufficient that the offence for which extradition was sought was triable 
within the United States and an equivalent offence would be triable in the 
United Kingdom. Accordingly, the applicants were liable to extradition to 
the United States if a prima facie case of conspiracy to murder was 
established. This was the case for each applicant.

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
II 
b. The Secretary of State's decision, the United States' assurances, and the 
fifth and sixth applicants' appeal to the High Court 
49. Between November 2001 and December 2005 there then followed 
voluminous representations by the fifth and sixth applicants to the Secretary 
of State as to why they should not be extradited to the United States. 
50. In the course of these exchanges, on 19 April 2002 the President of 
the United States designated the sixth applicant as a "specially designated 
global terrorist", which had the effect of placing him on a list of persons 
maintained by the United States Department of the Treasury and available 
on its website. This was done pursuant to Executive Order 13224 which 
enables the American assets of any person so designated to be blocked. 
51. Subsequently, on 13 April 2004, the United States Embassy in 
London issued Diplomatic Note No. 018, which gave assurances that the 
United States Government would neither seek nor carry out the death 
penalty against the fifth and sixth applicants. It also gave assurances that 
they would be tried before a federal court and that they would not be 
prosecuted by a military commission or designated as enemy combatants. 
On 18 January 2008, the United States Embassy issued Diplomatic Note 
No. 002, which assured the United Kingdom Government that, if either 
applicant were acquitted or completed any sentence imposed or if the 
prosecution against them were discontinued, the United States authorities 
would return the men to the United Kingdom, if they so requested. 
52. The Secretary of State (Ms Jacqui Smith) rejected the fifth and sixth 
applicants' representations on 12 March 2008. She found that assurances 
given by the United States in the Diplomatic Note of 13 April 2004 could be 
relied upon and thus that the fifth and sixth applicants were not at risk of the 
death penalty, indefinite detention or trial by a military commission. 
53. The fifth and sixth applicants also contended that they would not 
receive a fair trial in the United States owing to the unavailability of defence 
witnesses and evidence, adverse publicity, the possible imposition of special 
administrative measures before trial, and the sixth applicant's designation as 
a global terrorist. The Secretary of State found none of these claims 
amounted to a "flagrant denial of justice" such as would act as a bar to 
extradition. 
54. The Secretary of State accepted that there was a real possibility that 
they would be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted but, relying on 
the House of Lords' judgment in R (Wellington) v. Secretary of State for the 
Home Department (see paragraphs 64-72 below), found that this would not 
amount to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. 
55. The Secretary of State also considered that the conditions of the fifth 
and sixth applicants' detention in the United States would not violate Article 
whether they were subjected to "special administrative measures" before 
trial or detained at ADX Florence after trial. In the fifth applicant's case, 
this conclusion was not affected by the fact that he suffered from a recurrent 
EFTA00031745
--- PAGE 14 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
depressive disorder. There was also no risk that either applicant would be 
tortured, that evidence obtained by torture would be adduced at trial, or that 
they would be at real risk of torture as a result of extraordinary rendition or 
refoulement to a third State. 
56. The fifth and sixth applicants sought judicial review of the Secretary 
of State's decision in the High Court. Before the High Court the applicants 
submitted that, if convicted, they would be detained at ADX Florence in 
violation of Article 3 of the Convention. In rejecting that contention, Lord 
Justice Scott Baker, delivering the judgment of the court on 7 August 2009, 
found that the decisions of the United States federal courts in Ajaj, Sattar 
and Wilkinson v. Austin (see paragraphs 109 and 110 below) demonstrated 
that there was effective judicial oversight of "supermax" prisons such as 
ADX. The fifth and sixth applicants would also have the possibility of 
entering ADX's "step down program" (see paragraphs 84-88 below). He 
concluded: 
(1) It is reasonably likely that the claimants will be subjected to [special 
administrative measures] and will be held in ADX Florence following trial. 
(2) Neither [special administrative measures] (see Alunad and Aswat) or life 
without parole (see Wellington) cross the article 3 threshold in the present case. 
Although near to the borderline the prison conditions at ADX Florence, although very 
harsh do not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment either on their own or in 
combination with [special administrative measures] and in the context of a whole life 
sentence. 
(3) Whether the high article 3 threshold for inhuman or degrading treatment is 
crossed depends on the facts of the particular case. There is no common standard for 
what does or does not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment throughout the 
many different countries in the world. The importance of maintaining extradition in a 
case where the fugitive would not otherwise be tried is an important factor in 
identifying the threshold in the present race. 
Had the claimants persuaded me that there was no prospect that they would ever 
enter the step down procedure whatever the circumstances then in my view the article 
threshold would be crossed. But that is not the case. The evidence satisfies me that 
the authorities will faithfully apply the criteria [for entry to the program] and that the 
stringency of the conditions it imposes will continue to be linked to the risk the 
prisoner presents. Further, there is access to the US courts in the event that the 
[Federal Bureau of prisons] acts unlawfully." 
57. In respect of the fifth applicant's submission that his recurrent 
depressive illness would deteriorate if extradited, the High Court considered 
that, to the extent that this affected his fitness to stand trial, this was a matter 
for the United States' authorities and, if he were convicted, the fifth 
applicant's mental health would be an important factor in deciding whether 
he should be sent to ADX Florence. 
58. The High Court also rejected the fifth and sixth applicants' 
submissions that they were at real risk of violations of Articles 3, 6 and 14 
EFTA00031746
--- PAGE 15 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
of the Convention by virtue of the imposition of special administrative 
measures, relying on its previous judgment in respect of the first and second 
applicants (see paragraph 29 above). Having regard to the Diplomatic Note 
of 18 January 2008, the High Court found that there was no real risk of 
refoulement to Egypt or Saudi Arabia by the United States. The High Court 
was also satisfied that the United States would honour the assurances it had 
given in the Diplomatic Note of 13 April 2004. The mere fact that the sixth 
applicant had been designated as a global terrorist by the President of the 
United States did not mean he was at risk of a flagrant denial of justice 
within the meaning of Article 6: the designation added little to what was 
already known about him; it would be made clear to the jury at any trial 
what had to be proved as regards the indictment. 
59. The High Court also rejected the applicants' submission that they 
should be tried in the United Kingdom, finding that this was neither viable 
nor appropriate and that any connection with the United Kingdom was 
"tenuous indeed". 
60. Although the High Court refused leave to appeal to the United 
Kingdom Supreme Court, it certified two questions of general public 
importance. The first question was whether prison conditions at ADX 
Florence were compatible with Article 3; the second question was whether 
the relativist approach to Article 3 adopted by the majority of the House of 
Lords in Wellington should apply where the issue under Article 3 was one 
of the compatibility of prison conditions with Article 3. 
61. On 16 December 2009, the Supreme Court refused permission to 
appeal. 
II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW ON 
ARTICLE 3 AND EXTRADTITION 
A. Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the 
United States 
62. At the material time, the applicable bilateral treaty on extradition 
was the 1972 UK — USA Extradition Treaty (now superseded by a 2003 
treaty). Article IV of the 1972 treaty provided that extradition could be 
refused unless the requesting Party gave assurances satisfactory to the 
requested Party that the death penalty would not be carried out. 
63. Guidance for handling criminal cases with concurrent jurisdiction 
between the United Kingdom and the United States of America was signed 
on 18 January 2007 by the Attorney General of the United States of 
America, Her Majesty's Attorney General and also, for its application to 
Scotland, by the Lord Advocate. It sets out a series of measures that 
prosecutors in each State should take to exchange information and consult 
EFTA00031747
--- PAGE 16 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
each other in such cases and to determine issues which arise from 
concurrent jurisdiction. A case with concurrent jurisdiction is defined as one 
which has the potential to be prosecuted in both the United Kingdom and 
the United States. 
B. Relevant United Kingdom law on Article 3 and extradition: R 
(Wellington) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] 
UKHL 72 
64. The United States requested the extradition of Ralston Wellington 
from the United Kingdom to stand trial in Missouri on two counts of murder 
in the first degree. In his appeal against extradition, Mr Wellington argued 
that his surrender would violate Article 3 of the Convention, on the basis 
that there was a real risk that he would be subjected to inhuman and 
degrading treatment in the form of a sentence of life imprisonment without 
parole. 
65. In giving judgment in the High Court ([2007] EWHC 1109 
(Admin)), Lord Justice Laws found that there were "powerful arguments of 
penal philosophy" which suggested that risk of a whole-life sentence 
without parole intrinsically violated Article 3 of the Convention. He 
observed: 
"The abolition of the death penalty has been lauded, and justified, in many ways; but 
it must have been founded at least on the premise that the life of every person, 
however depraved, has an inalienable value. The destruction of a life may be accepted 
in some special circumstances, such as self-defence or just war; but retributive 
punishment is never enough to justify it. Yet a prisoner's incarceration without hope 
of release is in many respects in like case to a sentence of death. He can never atone 
for his offence. However he may use his incarceration as time for amendment of life, 
his punishment is only exhausted by his last breath. Like the death sentence the 
whole-life tariff is lex talionis. But its notional or actual symmetry with the crime for 
which it is visited on the prisoner (the only virtue of the lex talionis) is a poor 
guarantee of proportionate punishment, for the whole-life tariff is arbitrary: it may be 
measured in days or decades according to how long the prisoner has to live. It is 
therefore liable to be disproportionate — the very vice which is condemned on 
Article 3 grounds — unless, of course, the death penalty's logic applies: the crime is so 
heinous it can never be atoned for. But in that case the supposed inalienable value of 
the prisoner's life is reduced, merely, to his survival: to nothing more than his drawing 
breath and being kept, no doubt, confined in decent circumstances. That is to pay lip-
service to the value of life; not to vouchsafe it." 
However, and "not without misgivings", he considered that the relevant 
authorities, including those of this Court, suggested an irreducible life 
sentence would not always raise an Article 3 issue. 
66. Wellington's appeal from that judgment was heard by the House of 
Lords and dismissed on 10 December 2008. Central to the appeal was 
paragraph 89 of this Court's judgment in Soering v. the United Kingdom, 
EFTA00031748
--- PAGE 17 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
July 1989, § 89, Series A no. 161, where the Court stated that 
considerations in favour of extradition: 
".. must also be included among the factors to be taken into account in the 
interpretation and application of the notions of inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment in extradition cases." 
67. A majority of their Lordships, Lord Hoffmann, Baroness Hale and 
Lord Carswell, found that, on the basis of this paragraph, in the extradition 
context, a distinction had to be drawn between torture and lesser forms of 
ill-treatment. When there was a real risk of torture, the prohibition on 
extradition was absolute and left no room for a balancing exercise. 
However, insofar as Article 3 applied to inhuman and degrading treatment 
and not to torture, it was applicable only in a relativist form to extradition 
cases. 
68. Lord Hoffmann, giving the lead speech, considered the Court's 
judgment in the case of Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, 
§ 81, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, in which the Court 
stated that: 
"It should not be inferred from the Court's remarks tat paragraph 89 of Soeringl that 
there is any room for balancing the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons for 
expulsion in determining whether a State's responsibility under Article 3 (art. 3) is 
engaged." 
Lord Hoffmann stated: 
"In the context of Chahal, I read this remark as affirming that there can be no room 
for a balancing of risk against reasons for expulsion when it comes to subjecting 
someone to the risk of torture. I do not however think that the Court was intending to 
depart from the relativist approach to what counted as inhuman and degrading 
treatment which was laid down in Soering and which is paralleled in the cases on 
other articles of the Convention in a foreign context. If such a radical departure from 
precedent had been intended, I am sure that the Court would have said so." 
For Lord Hoffmann, paragraph 89 of Soering made clear that: 
"...the desirability of extradition is a factor to be taken into account in deciding 
whether the punishment likely to be imposed in the receiving state attains the 
`minimum level of severity' which would make it inhuman and degrading. 
Punishment which counts as inhuman and degrading in the domestic context will not 
necessarily be so regarded when the extradition factor has been taken into account." 
He went on to state: 
"A relativist approach to the scope of article 3 seems to me essential if extradition is 
to continue to function. For example, the Court of Session has decided in Napier v 
Scottish Ministers (2005) SC 229 that in Scotland the practice of 'slopping out' 
(requiring a prisoner to use a chamber pot in his cell and empty it in the morning) may 
cause an infringement of article 3. Whether, even in a domestic context, this attains 
the necessary level of severity is a point on which I would wish to reserve my opinion. 
If, however, it were applied in the context of extradition, it would prevent anyone 
being extradited to many countries, poorer than Scotland, where people who are not in 
prison often have to make do without flush lavatories." 
EFTA00031749
--- PAGE 18 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
69. A minority of their Lordships, Lord Scott and Lord Brown, 
disagreed with these conclusions. They considered that the extradition 
context was irrelevant to the determination of whether a whole life sentence 
amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. They found no basis in the 
text of Article 3 for such a distinction. Lord Brown also considered that the 
Court, in Chahal and again in Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, ECHR 
2008-..., had departed from the previous, relativist approach to inhuman and 
degrading treatment that it had taken in Soering. He stated: 
"Them is, I conclude, no room in the Strasbourg jurisprudence for a concept such as 
the risk of a flagrant violation of article 3's absolute prohibition against inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment (akin to that of the risk of a 'flagrant denial of 
justice'). By the same token that no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk 
of torture, so too no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of treatment or 
punishment which is properly to be characterised as inhuman or degrading. That, of 
course, is not to say that, assuming for example 'slopping out' is degrading treatment 
in Scotland, so too it must necessarily be regarded in all countries (see pare 27 of Lord 
Hoffmann's opinion)... the Strasbourg Court has repeatedly said that the Convention 
does not 'purport to be a means of requiring the contracting states to impose 
Convention standards on other states' (Soering, pan 86) and article 3 does not bar 
removal to non-Convention states (whether by way of extradition or simply for the 
purposes of immigration control) merely because they choose to impose higher levels 
or harsher measures of criminal punishment. 
Nor is it to say that a risk of article 3 ill-treatment, the necessary pre-condition of an 
article 3 bar upon extradition, will readily be established. On the contrary, as the 
Grand Chamber reaffirmed in Saadi at pan 142: 
Thhe Court has frequently indicated that it applies rigorous criteria and exercises 
close scrutiny when assessing the existence of a real risk of ill-treatment . . . in the 
event of a person being removed from the territory of the respondent State by 
extradition, expulsion or any other measure pursuing that aim. Although assessment 
of that risk is to some degree speculative, the Court has always been very cautious, 
examining carefully the material placed before it in the light of the requisite 
standard of proof . . . before . . . finding that the enforcement of removal from the 
territory would be contrary to article 3 of the Convention. As a result, since adopting 
the Chahal judgment it has only rarely reached such a conclusion."' 
Therefore, for Lord Brown, if a mandatory life sentence violated 
Article 3 in a domestic case, the risk of such a sentence would preclude 
extradition to another country. 
70. However, despite these different views, none of the Law Lords 
found that the sentence likely to be imposed on Mr Wellington would be 
irreducible; having regard to the commutation powers of the Governor of 
Missouri, it would be just as reducible as the sentence at issue in Kafkaris 
v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, ECHR 2008-.... All five Law Lords also 
noted that, in Kafkaris, the Court had only said that the imposition of an 
irreducible life sentence may raise an issue under Article 3. They found that 
the imposition of a whole life sentence would not constitute inhuman and 
EFTA00031750
--- PAGE 19 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 per se, unless it were grossly or 
clearly disproportionate. Lord Brown in particular noted: 
"Having puzzled long over this question, I have finally concluded that the majority 
of the Grand Chamber fin Kaficaris] would not regard even an irreducible life 
sentence—by which, as explained, I understand the majority to mean a mandatory life 
sentence to be served in full without there ever being proper consideration of the 
individual circumstances of the defendant's case—as violating article 3 unless and 
until the time comes when further imprisonment would no longer be justified on any 
ground—whether for reasons of punishment, deterrence or public protection. It is for 
that reason that the majority say only that article 3 may be engaged." 
Lord Brown added that this test had not been met in Wellington's case, 
particularly when the facts of the murders for which he was accused, if 
committed in the United Kingdom, could have justified a whole life order. 
However, Lord Brown considered that, in a more compelling case, such as 
the mercy killing of a terminally ill relative, this Court "might well judge 
the risk of ill-treatment to be sufficiently real, clear and imminent to 
conclude that extradition must indeed be barred on article 3 grounds". 
71. Finally, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Scott, Baroness Hale and Lord Brown 
all doubted Lord Justice Laws' view that life imprisonment without parole 
was lex tad ionis. Lord Hoffman, Baroness Hale and Lord Brown did not 
accept his premise that the abolition of the death penalty had been founded 
on the idea that the life of every person had an inalienable value; there were 
other, more pragmatic reasons for abolition such as its irreversibility and 
lack of deterrent effect. Lord Scott rejected the view that an irreducible life 
sentence was inhuman and degrading because it denied a prisoner the 
possibility of atonement; once it was accepted that a whole life sentence 
could be a just punishment, atonement was achieved by the prisoner serving 
his sentence. 
72. Wellington's application to this Court was struck out on 5 October 
2010, the applicant having indicated his wish to withdraw it 
(Wellington v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 60682/08). 
C. Relevant Canadian case-law 
73. Section I of the Canadian Charter of Rights provides that the Charter 
guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it "subject only to such 
reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a 
free and democratic society." Section 7 provides: 
"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to 
be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice." 
Section 12 provides: 
"Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or 
punishment." 
EFTA00031751
--- PAGE 20 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
74. In United States v. Burns [2001] S.C.R. 283, Burns and another (the 
respondents) were to be extradited from Canada to the State of Washington 
to stand trial for murders allegedly committed when they were both 
eighteen. Before making the extradition order the Canadian Minister of 
Justice had not sought assurances that the death penalty would not be 
imposed. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the remoteness between 
the extradition and the potential imposition of capital punishment meant the 
case was not appropriately considered under section 12 but under section 7. 
However, the values underlying section 12 could form part of the balancing 
process engaged under section 7. The extradition of the respondents would, 
if implemented, deprive them of their rights of liberty and security of person 
as guaranteed by section 7. The issue was whether such a deprivation was in 
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. While extradition 
could only be refused if it "shocked the conscience" an extradition that 
violated the principles of fundamental justice would always do so. The court 
balanced the factors that favoured extradition against those that favoured 
seeking assurances that the death penalty would not be sought. The latter 
included the fact that a degree of leniency for youth was an accepted value 
in the administration of justice, even for young offenders over the age of 
eighteen. The court concluded that the objectives sought to be advanced by 
extradition without assurances would be as well served by extradition with 
assurances. The court held therefore that assurances were constitutionally 
required by section 7 in all but exceptional cases. 
75. In United States of America v. Ferras; United States of America v. 
Laity, [2006] 2 SCR 77, the appellants were to be extradited to the United 
States to face charges of fraud (the Ferras case) or trafficking of cocaine 
(the Laity case). The appellants in the Laity case had argued that, if 
extradited and convicted they could receive sentences of ten years to life 
without parole and this would "shock the conscience". In dismissing the 
appeals, the Supreme Court affirmed the balancing approach laid down in 
Burns to determining whether potential sentences in a requesting state 
would "shock the conscience". The harsher sentences the appellants might 
receive if convicted in the United States were among the factors militating 
against their surrender but they had offered no evidence or case-law to back 
up their assertions that the possible sentences would shock the conscience of 
Canadians. The factors favouring extradition far outweighed those that did 
not. 
D. Relevant international law on non-refoulement 
I. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
76. Article 7 of the ICCPR where relevant provides that "no one shall be 
subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
EFTA00031752
--- PAGE 21 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
punishment." The Human Rights Committee's most recent general 
comment on Article 7 (No. 20, of 10 March 1992) states the Committee's 
view that: "States parties must not expose individuals to the danger of 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return 
to another country by way of their extradition, expulsion or refoulement." 
(see also Chitat Ng v. Canada, CCPR/C/49/D/469/I99 1 , 7 January 1994; 
A.J.R. v. Australia, CCPR/C/60/D/692/1996, II August 1997). 
2. The United Nations Convention Against Torture 
77. Article 3 § 1 of the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
("UNCAT") provides: 
"No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to 
another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture?' 
78. Article 16 § 2 provides: 
"The provisions of this Convention are without prejudice to the provisions of any 
other international instrument or national law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment or which relates to extradition or expulsion." 
3. The Council of Europe Guidelines on Human Rights and the fight 
against terrorism 
79. The above guidelines (adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 
July 2002) contain the following provisions on refoulement and 
extradition: 
"XII. Asylum, return (`refoulement') and expulsion 
2. It is the duty of a State that has received a request for asylum to ensure that the 
possible return ("refoulement") of the applicant to his/her country of origin or to 
another country will not expose him/her to the death penalty, to torture or to inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment. The same applies to expulsion. 
XIII. Extradition 
I. Extradition is an essential procedure for effective international co•operation in 
the fight against terrorism. 
3. Extradition may not be granted when there is serious reason to believe that: 
(i) the person whose extradition has been requested will be subjected to torture or to 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment..." 
EFTA00031753

4. The European Union Charter 
80. Article 19 § 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European 
Union provides: 
"No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious 
risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment." 
III. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND 
PRACTICE ON DETENTION AT ADX FLORENCE 
A. Evidence of conditions of detention at ADX Florence 
81. ADX Florence, a so-called "supermax" prison, is one of a number of 
detention facilities at the Federal Correctional Complex, Florence, 
Colorado. The parties have provided a great deal of evidence in respect of 
conditions of detention at ADX and general facilities at FCC Florence. The 
applicants have also submitted general evidence on "supermax" prisons and 
their effects on prisoners. The evidence submitted may be summarised as 
follows. 
I. Evidence submitted by the Government 
82. The Government submitted a series of declarations, which had been 
prepared specifically for the present proceedings by officials at FCC/ADX 
Florence. Thereafter, in reply to a series of questions put by the Court in 
respect of the number of inmates entering ADX's "step down program", two 
further letters were provided by the United States Department of Justice (see 
paragraphs 93-97 below). 
a. The declarations 
83. Mr Louis J. Milusnic, the associate warden of ADX, outlined the 
regime which was in place at the special security unit (H Unit) for inmates 
who were subjected to special administrative measures. All cells were single 
occupancy, had natural light and measured 75.5 square feet (approximately 
square metres). Showers were not in-cell but on a shared range. 
84. Inmates in H Unit were part of the special security unit program, 
which had three phases that inmates could work through. 
In phase one, the "baseline" phase, inmates had two non-legal telephone 
calls per month, five social visits, access to a commissary list and art and 
hobby craft items, and escorted shower time three times a week. They had 
ten hours per week of out-of-cell recreation time (increased from five hours 
EFTA00031754
--- PAGE 23 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
per week in September 2009). As of November 2010, twelve inmates were 
in phase one. 
In phase two, conditions were the same save that three non-legal 
telephone calls per month were permitted, the commissary list was 
expanded and inmates were permitted to go to the shower unescorted, five 
times per week. Eleven inmates were in phase two. 
In phase three, group recreation was permitted five days a week (for a 
minimum of one and a half hours per day, in groups of four) and the number 
of non-legal telephone calls increased to four. Inmates ate one meal together 
and engaged in recreational activities together for one and a half hours per 
day. Access to showers was unrestricted and the commissary list was further 
expanded. Four inmates, who had all been convicted of terrorist activity, 
had progressed to phase three. 
Advancement through the phases was authorised by a Program Screening 
Committee, whose six-monthly reviews the inmate attended. The 
Committee's task was to determine whether an inmate could function with 
additional privileges without posing a security or safety risk. Advancement 
was subject to various factors including good conduct, participation in 
programmes recommended by the Unit, positive behaviour and respectful 
conduct and positive overall institutional adjustment. 
85. Recreation alternated daily between outside and inside recreation. 
Outdoor recreation took place in adjacent individual recreation areas, which 
allow an inmate full visual access to the recreation yard and other inmates. 
Conversations could be carried on in a normal tone of voice and most 
inmates spent the majority of their recreation time talking to other inmates. 
Each individual outdoor area measured 12 feet by 20 feet (approximately 
3.66 metres by 6 metres) and contained pull-up bars and footballs. 
Individual indoor areas measured 14 feet by 10 feet. Recreation had only 
been cancelled once in thirteen months for security reasons. 
86. There was no limit on inmates' correspondence with family 
members and special administrative measures could be modified to allow 
correspondence beyond the immediate family. There were also no limits on 
correspondence with legal representatives and access to a law library for up 
to two hours at a time. Inmates received a free, daily copy of USA Today. 
They had access to fifty television channels and seven FM radio channels. 
They could speak to inmates in adjacent cells using the air ventilation as a 
voice conduit. They had regular contact with prison staff — a member of the 
Unit Team visited every inmate every day — and there were visits from 
medical, education, religious service and psychology staff, including two 
Arabic speakers. Inmates could request to speak with an officer at any time. 
87. Mr Milusnic also outlined the criteria and procedures for placement 
at ADX Florence. An inmate either had to: (i) create a security risk at other 
correctional facilities; or (ii) as a result of his or her status, be unable to be 
safely housed in the general population of another institution. Referral to 
EFTA00031755
--- PAGE 24 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
ADX was initiated by the staff at the inmate's current institution. If the 
warden of that institution, the relevant regional director and the Bureau's 
designation centre all concurred, a hearing took place. The inmate was 
given written notice at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing. After the 
hearing, a report with a recommendation was prepared and given to the 
inmate. The final decision was taken on the basis of the report by an 
Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, with the possibility of 
appeal to the chief of the designation centre and thereafter the Office of the 
General Counsel. 
88. Ms Patricia Rangel is the Unit Manager for the General Population 
Units at ADX. She provided two declarations. 
Her first declaration outlined the Federal Bureau of Prisons procedures 
for review of the status of inmates. There was an initial classification upon 
arrival at a new Bureau institution, which took place at a meeting attended 
by the inmate and which defined, inter alia, the work and educational 
programmes the inmate would follow, his or her release plans, and 
security/custody levels. Thereafter, there were six-monthly program reviews 
(including progress review reports, which were signed by the inmate and the 
Unit Manager) and more detailed, three-yearly progress reports, which were 
also made available to the inmate. 
In her declaration Ms Rangel also outlined the different levels of security 
in ADX units and the step down program. The units followed a "stratified" 
system of housing from General Population Units to the Intermediate, 
Transitional and Pre-Transfer Units. It would take an inmate a minimum of 
thirty-six months to work through the system: the minimum stay in each 
unit was twelve months in a General Population Unit, six months in 
Intermediate, six in Transitional and twelve in Pre-Transfer. Specific 
conditions in each unit were as follows. 
General Population Unit cells were 87 square feet (8 square metres) plus 
a sallyport (exit area) of 17 square feet. Showers were within the cells. 
There was a window with natural lighting and inmates could control the 
lighting in their cell via a dimmer switch. Lights on the range were switched 
off at night, but, as in all federal prisons, were briefly turned on for three 
cell counts during the night. Meals were delivered in-cell. Inmates received 
two fifteen minute telephone calls and up to five social visits per month. It 
was possible and permissible for inmates to talk to each other in their cells 
via the ventilation system or during their out-of-cell recreation. 
Inmates had ten hours out-of-cell exercise each week in single-cell 
recreation areas, some of which were grouped together on large recreation 
yards. Ms Rangel gave the sizes of the two types of outdoor individualised 
recreation areas as 240 square feet and 315 square feet (22 and 29 square 
metres). The size of the indoor areas was 389 square feet (36 square 
metres). Recreation privileges could be restricted for violations of rules and 
regulations. Restrictions on outdoor recreation were in three-month 
EFTA00031756
--- PAGE 25 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
increments (three months for a first offence, six for a second offence and so 
on). 
Intermediate Unit cells were 75.5 square feet and did not have a sallyport 
or shower. There was a window with natural lighting; cell doors faced out 
onto a range. Inmates were assigned to a group of eight inmates with whom 
they recreated. Meals were provided to inmates one group at a time, 
meaning each group was allowed out of their cells to collect their meals in 
the range. Inmates received three fifteen-minute telephone calls and up to 
five social visits per month. Showers stalls were on the range, where 
inmates could shower any time they were out on the range. 
Transitional Units had similar conditions to Intermediate Units save that 
inmates were assigned to groups of sixteen inmates. They received 
twenty-one hours of out-of-cell recreation per week in their assigned group 
on the range or in a large recreation yard. Meals were consumed in groups 
on the range. Inmates were unrestrained when out of their cells. They 
received an extra fifteen-minute telephone call per month and could leave 
the unit unrestrained but escorted to purchase items from the commissary. 
The Pre-Transfer Unit was located at another penitentiary at 
FCC Florence. As in the Intermediate and Transitional Units, inmates ate 
their meals and recreated within their assigned group. They received 
twenty-four and a half hours' out-of-cell recreation time per week, and five 
visits and three hundred minutes of telephone calls per month. 
In the General Population, Intermediate and Transitional Units, access to 
television, radio and books, contact with prison staff and rules on 
correspondence were as outlined by Mr Milusnic. 
The rules governing the step down program were set out in an 
"institution supplement", which had been updated in September 2009. An 
inmate's placement in and advancement through the step down program 
were reviewed every six months, subject to the minimum periods in each 
unit, set out above, and other criteria such as participation in defined 
programmes, positive behaviour and overall institutional adjustment. 
According to the updated supplement, mitigation of the original reason for 
placement at ADX Florence was no longer a factor which was considered, 
but the Step Down Screening Committee, which made decisions on 
advancement, could have regard to the initial reasons for placement at ADX 
and other safety and security factors. The final decision was one for the 
Warden. Any negative decision had to be reasoned (unless providing 
reasons would pose a threat to individual safety or institutional security) and 
was subject to appeal through the Bureau's administrative remedy 
programme. Since the implementation of the updated supplement, there had 
been a 56% increase in movement of inmates from the four General 
Population Units to the Intermediate Unit and a 135% increase in movement 
from the Intermediate to the Transitional Unit. Inmates had also completed 
EFTA00031757
--- PAGE 26 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
the programme and been transferred out of ADX Florence. This included 
Arab-Muslim inmates. 
89. Mr Christopher B. Synsvoll is the Department of Justice Supervising 
Attorney at FCC Florence. His declaration outlined the application of 
special administrative measures. These measures were rare: of 210,307 
Federal Bureau of Prison inmates, forty-one were subjected to them; 
twenty-seven of the forty-one were in H Unit at ADX Florence. Special 
administrative measures could be challenged through the Bureau's 
administrative remedy programme, which led to a review of the need for the 
measures and which involved consultation with other agencies such as the 
FBI. This process had, on occasion, led to the modification of certain 
special administrative measures such as allowing greater communication for 
inmates with the outside world. 
90. The psychologist assigned to ADX Florence, Dr Paul Zohn, outlined 
the psychological and psychiatric care available at the prison. The 
preference was to treat inmates with mental health problems in situ rather 
than in hospitals where this was possible. Care was provided by one 
psychiatrist and two psychologists who made regular rounds through the 
housing units at ADX. Various treatment programs were available and 
inmates who needed psychotropic medication were seen regularly by a 
psychiatrist. Contrary to assertions previously made by the applicants, 
video-conferencing was not ordinarily used to assess an inmate's mental 
health. The main mental health disorders such as bipolar affective disorder, 
depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia would not 
preclude a designation to ADX and could be managed successfully there. 
Conditions of confinement were largely determined by security needs and 
would be modified based on mental illness only if the inmate's mental 
status warranted such a change. However, if necessary, inmates could be 
referred to one of the Bureau's Psychiatric Referral Centers for acute 
psychiatric care. Inmates who would be considered "seriously mentally ill" 
would not be housed at ADX but at a Referral Center. All new inmates at 
ADX received an initial psychological evaluation and, if necessary, follow-
up assessment and treatment planning. Thereafter, the psychological 
department monitored any treatment needs such as medication or 
modification to an inmate's housing, work or program assignment. 
91. The prison chaplain at ADX, Michael S. Merrill, stated that an imam 
was available to inmates four days a month and would speak to inmates at 
their cell door. The chaplain had also significantly expanded the Islamic 
section of the religious library at the prison, which included 158 Arabic 
language books. There were also 320 videos and DVDs on Islam. The 
Religious Services Department provided Islamic-faith programming 
through its closed-circuit television channel, including four to five days of 
Sunni Muslim programming on Friday and recitations of the Qur'an on 
Friday and Saturday evenings. Inmates had access to a halal diet; special 
EFTA00031758
--- PAGE 27 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
arrangements were made for meals during Ramadan. Although there could 
be no formal congregational prayer for any faith group, Muslim inmates 
could perform the Azan (call to prayer) and the Salat (five daily prayers) in 
their cells; they could also have access to prayer rugs, prayer oil, prayer 
beads and religious headgear in their cells. 
92. Ms Roxana Mack, the Assistant Supervisor of Education at ADX, 
stated that H unit inmates had access to approximately 900 books with no 
limit on the number of books an inmate could borrow. They had access to a 
law library for two hours at a time, including access to electronic databases. 
There were also educational courses. 
b. The Department of Justice's letters 
93. In the course of proceedings before the Court, the respondent 
Government were asked to provide information as to: 
(i) how long inmates in the Special Security Unit program had spent at 
ADX and how long they had been in each phase of the program; 
(ii) how many inmates were in each phase of the step down program; 
(iii) how long each inmate had spent at ADX and how long they had 
been in each phase of the program; and 
(iv) how many inmates had completed the program, how long they had 
spent at ADX and how long they had been in each phase of the program 
94. The questions were forwarded to the United States authorities. By 
letter dated 26 September 2011, the Department of Justice stated that there 
were 252 inmates in ADX's General Population Unit. The Special Security 
Unit program could house up to 32 inmates. There were 17 inmates in phase 
I, nine in phase II and six in phase III. For the step down program, 
inmates were in J Unit, 32 in K Unit and 25 in D/B Unit. The 
Department of Justice stated that the Bureau of Prisons obligations under 
United States law prevented disclosure of information as to the length of 
time inmates had spent at each stage of the two programs. 
95. By letters dated 29 September and 7 October 2011, the Section 
Registrar clarified that the questions put by the Court were not intended to 
obtain information on specific inmates but rather to provide meaningful 
assistance as to: the length of time an inmate was likely to spend at ADX 
before being admitted to either program; how long he was likely to spend in 
each phase of either program; and how long he was likely to spend in either 
program before transfer out of ADX. 
96. On 24 October 2011 the Agent of the Government of the United 
Kingdom replied, forwarding a letter of the same date from the Department 
of Justice, which set out the results of a statistical analysis conducted by the 
Bureau of Prisons. The analysis was based on a random sample of thirty 
inmates selected from the General Population at ADX and/or each phase of 
the step down program. On the basis of that sample, an inmate was likely to 
spend three years at ADX before being admitted to the Step Down or 
EFTA00031759
--- PAGE 28 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
Special Security Unit programs. The likely times in each phase were: nine 
months in intermediate, eleven months in transition and nine months in pre-
transfer. Thus, an inmate was likely to spend three years in General 
Population followed by two years and five months progressing through 
either program. 
97. The Department of Justice's letter of 26 September 2011 also 
stressed that, while generally inmates who were subject to special 
administrative measures were housed in the Special Security Unit, it was 
possible for such inmates to be housed at other prisons. Furthermore, if 
special administrative measure were vacated for an inmate at ADX, he 
could be transferred from ADX to other prison. This had occurred for seven 
of the thirteen inmates whose special administrative measures had been 
vacated. 
2. Evidence submitted by the applicants 
98. The applicants submitted general evidence as to the effect of solitary 
confinement on prisoners and specific evidence as to the prison regime at 
ADX Florence. 
99. The applicants also provided a report by a psychiatrist, Dr Terry 
Kupers, which had been prepared specifically for the present proceedings. 
He considered that a supermax prison regime did not amount to sensory 
deprivation but there was an almost total lack of meaningful human 
communication. This tended to induce a range of psychological symptoms 
ranging from panic to psychosis and emotional breakdown. All studies into 
the effects of supermax detention had found such symptoms after sixty 
days' detention. Once such symptoms presented, it was not sufficient to 
return someone to normal prison conditions in order to remedy them. 
If supermax detention were imposed for an indeterminate period it also led 
to chronic despair. Approximately half of suicides in United States prisons 
involved the 6-8% of prisoners held in such conditions. The effects of 
supermax conditions were worse for someone with pre-existing mental 
health problems. There was also evidence of solitary confinement leading to 
a range of physical illnesses. Dr Kuper's conclusions were supported by a 
number of journal articles by psychologists and criminologists, which the 
applicants provided.'

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
100. The specific evidence on ADX Florence included a series of 
statements by Professor Laura Rovner, Director of the Civil Rights Clinic at 
the University of Denver, which had acted for a number of prisoners at 
ADX Florence. Professor Rovner's statements were based on her experience 
of ADX, the evidence of her clients, and various affidavits which had been 
prepared for litigation in the federal courts regarding ADX Florence. Her 
latest statement, of 27 May 2011, responded to the six declarations 
submitted by the Government. Her statement, and the other evidence 
provided by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. 
101. Professor Rovner recalled that one of the former wardens of ADX 
had publicly described the prison as "a clean version of hell". Professor 
Rovner stated that, despite the evidence set out in the six declarations, 
conditions at ADX Florence had not changed significantly in the last two 
years. Solitary confinement for long periods continued. One lawyer, 
Mr Mark H. Donatelli, had conducted a survey which had found that at least 
forty-three inmates of ADX Florence had spent eight years or more in 
"lock-down" conditions there and at previous prisons. 
Contact with staff could be as little as one minute per day. Some 
prisoners were placed on "single recreation status", meaning no one else 
was permitted to be in adjoining recreation cells at the same time. 
Recreation privileges could be terminated for minor infractions: one 
prisoner was denied outdoor exercise for sixty days for trying to feed 
crumbs to birds. When he challenged this sanction through the grievance 
process, it was increased to ninety days. Upon further appeal he was told 
that the decision was not punitive but a managerial strategy to impress upon 
him the importance of adhering to institutional procedures. Indoor 
recreations were little more than cages with a single pull-up bar for exercise. 
There was nothing to do in outdoor recreation cages save to pace up and 
down. There was limited visibility — all that could be seen was the sky 
through chain linking. Recreation was frequently cancelled owing to staff 
shortages. 
The evidence also showed that, despite the consensus in the medical 
profession that prisoners with mental illnesses should not be held in solitary 
confinement, ADX continued to house seriously mentally ill prisoners, 
including those with severe schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Several 
inmates were too sick to communicate properly with their representatives; a 
report had been received of one prisoner who was too ill to write, but was 
living a cell that he had covered in six inches of rubbish and faeces. Several 
prisoners had stated in witness statements prepared for litigation in the 
United States courts, that there were mentally ill prisoners at ADX Florence 
who, because of their conditions, screamed all night, making sleep difficult 
for others. General medical facilities were also inadequate: there were only 
two doctors for 3,200 inmates at FCC Florence, and only basic healthcare 
needs were met. There were also reports from Human Rights Watch which 
EFTA00031761
--- PAGE 30 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
indicated that force feeding of hunger strikers took place in an unnecessarily 
punitive and painful way. 
Religious services were extremely limited — one Muslim inmate had only 
seen an imam three times — and one inmate in a general population unit had 
received an incident report for intoning the Azan. Books and educational 
activities were also limited. 
For inmates, particularly those subjected to special administrative 
measures, telephone calls, and social visits were highly restricted and 
subject to monitoring. Contact with other inmates was generally prohibited 
and, when they were not, communication between cells could only be 
carried out by yelling, which was prohibited. Visits were limited to one 
adult visitor at a time, with no physical contact, and required fourteen days' 
written notice. Evidence in cases brought by inmates who had been 
subjected to special administrative measures indicated that letters could be 
limited to three sheets of paper per week and certain family members could 
be refused clearance to write to or speak with an inmate. Special 
administrative measures could also mean that an inmate was prohibited 
from watching news channels on television, from receiving recent 
newspapers or any Arabic publications whatsoever; one inmate received his 
newspaper with whole sections removed. International telephone calls were 
expensive and liable to disruption. 
Despite the adoption of objective criteria for placement at ADX, it 
remained the case that all those subjected to special administrative measures 
or convicted of terrorism offences were liable for placement, regardless of 
their security risk or their disciplinary record in other institutions. The 
placement hearing was window dressing: one hearing officer had carried out 
one hundred hearings and never found an inmate to be unsuitable for 
placement. There was evidence of hearings taking place post facto, in some 
cases many years after the transfer to ADX had been carried out. Inmates 
also received only twenty-four hours' notice of a hearing and did not have 
the right to legal representation. There was evidence that hearing officers 
did not read all of the evidence submitted and based their decisions on 
unreliable evidence. Inmates did not see all the evidence against them. 
Professor Rovner also provided declarations by Arab Muslim clients, in 
which they stated that they had never been told the reasons for their 
placement at ADX and had been sent there after 9 September 2011, despite 
years of good conduct in other, much less restrictive prisons, both in the 
United States and elsewhere. 
Although there had been an increase in the number of admissions to the 
step down program, the fact remained that many inmates were spending 
significant periods of time in solitary confinement prior to admission, 
despite having met the criteria for admission for years. Four clients of the 
Clinic had only been admitted to the program after periods of between seven 
and thirteen years in solitary confinement and only then after commencing 
EFTA00031762
--- PAGE 31 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
litigation against the Bureau of Prisons. Another two clients had never been 
admitted, despite their clean disciplinary records and despite periods of 
eight to nine years at ADX. Even after the changes to procedures governing 
entry to the program, an inmate's original crime continued to serve as the 
basis for placement at ADX; thus it was possible for an inmate to be unable 
to sufficiently mitigate the original reason for placement and so gain 
admission to the program. Moreover, if an inmate had never been told the 
reasons for his placement, he could not know what he had to do to gain 
admission to the program. The program required three years to complete 
and a prisoner needed one year of clear conduct in general population before 
being eligible for step down. Even eligibility for the program did not mean 
that a prisoner would be allowed into it. 
Conditions in the first phase of the step down program did not differ 
significantly from general population units. According to one inmate, 
Mr Rezaq, lockdowns occurred frequently in J Unit, which meant inmates 
were confined to their cells, and could last days or even weeks. Inmates 
could also be removed from the program at any time without explanation or 
due process, even for the most minor infractions. Some had been removed 
from the program without receiving an incident report or were removed 
after receiving a report for an incident for which they were soon found not 
guilty. Yet, following such removals, they were either denied re-admission 
to the program or forced to spend years going through it again. The Bureau 
itself had estimated that only 5% of inmates progressed though the program 
in the minimum three years. Even successful completion of the step down 
program might only result in a transfer to a "communications management 
unit", such as those housed at USP Terre Haute or USP Marion, where 
conditions remained restrictive. 
According to Professor Rovner, it was difficult to dispute the evidence 
provided by the Government on special administrative measures (owing to 
restrictions contained in the measures themselves) but, on the basis of 
public information, she was able to state that the effect of the measures 
could amount to solitary confinement, even if an inmate was not detained at 
ADX. The indefinite prolongation of special administrative measures meant 
that certain Arab-Muslim inmates had spent between five and thirteen years 
in solitary confinement both before and after trial. Challenging such 
measures was impossible for inmates without access to legal representation. 
Legal aid was not available and, even if pro bono legal representation was 
obtained, the Department of Justice could still refuse to give the lawyers the 
necessary clearance; this had happened to her Clinic. 
102. The applicants also relied on two letters from Human Rights 
Watch. The first, dated 2 May 2007 to the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons, followed a tour the organisation had been given of ADX Florence. 
The letter expressed concerns that a number of prisoners convicted of 
terrorism offences had been sent to the prison based on the nature of their 
EFTA00031763
--- PAGE 32 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
crimes and, despite good conduct since their arrival, had remained in 
general population units and thus outside the step-down programme for up 
to nine years. The letter made suggestions for improvement in respect of 
recreation, mail, telephone use, the library. It also noted that progress was to 
be made on better meeting prisoners' religious needs, such as the provision 
of a full-time imam and commended the educational programmes available 
through the prison's television system. In the letter Human Rights Watch 
expressed serious concerns as to prisoners' inability to do any meaningful 
exercise in the indoor and outdoor recreation areas, owing to the size of 
these areas and the lack of any proper equipment. The letter urged the prison 
authorities to investigate reports of retaliation against prisoners who were on 
hunger strike in the form of transfer to harsher cells. The letter also said that 
Human Rights Watch was extremely concerned about the effects of long-
term isolation and highly limited exercise on the mental health of prisoners 
and criticised reports of rushed consultations between prisoners and 
psychologists, as well as the fact that evaluations were carried out via closed 
circuit television. 
103. The applicants obtained a second letter from Human Rights Watch, 
dated 21 August 2008, which stated that Human Rights Watch considered 
conditions at ADX violated the United States' treaty obligations under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations 
Convention against Torture. It was unremarkable that "minor adjustments" 
had been made to the regime but it remained in essence one of "long-term 
and indefinite incarceration in conditions of extreme social isolation and 
sensory deprivation". 
B. The Eighth Amendment and conditions of detention 
104. The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution provides, inter alia, 
that cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted. 
105. The Eighth Amendment requires prison officials to provide humane 
conditions of confinement, to ensure inmates receive adequate food, 
clothing shelter and medical care, and to take reasonable measures to 
guarantee their safety (Fanner v. Brennan 511 US 825 (1994). Only those 
deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities are 
sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation 
(Wilson v. Seiter 501 U.S. 294, 304 (1991); Rhodes v. Chapman 452 U.S. 
337, 347 (1981)). A serious deprivation is necessary, because routine 
discomfort is part of the penalty inmates pay for their crimes (Hudson v. 
McMillan 503 US I (1992); Sandhi v. Conner 515 US 472 (1995)). Thus, in 
order to establish that a deprivation violates the Eighth Amendment, a 
prisoner must satisfy: (i) an objective test by demonstrating a sufficiently 
serious deprivation; and (ii) a subjective test by showing that the conditions 
EFTA00031764
--- PAGE 33 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
of confinement involve the deliberate imposition of pain or deliberate 
indifference to it (Wilson, cited above). 
106. In Hutto v. Finney 437 US 678 (1978), the Supreme Court upheld a 
lower court order limiting periods of punitive isolated confinement to thirty 
days, in circumstances where the lower court had found that conditions in 
the prison in question amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The court 
recognised that confinement in an isolation cell was a form of punishment 
which was subject to scrutiny under Eighth Amendment standards but 
rejected the submission that indeterminate sentences to punitive isolation 
always constituted cruel and unusual punishment. 
107. Lower federal courts have found that whether an extended term of 
solitary confinement violates the Eighth Amendment will depend on the 
particular facts of each situation, including the circumstances, nature and 
duration of the confinement (DeSpain v. Uphoff 264 F.3d 965 (10th Cir. 
2001)). Although they have recognised that prolonged conditions of solitary 
confinement may cause significant psychological damage (Davenport 
v. DeRobertis 844 F.2d 1310, 1313 (7th Cir. 1988)), the lower COWS have, 
for the most part, rejected Eighth Amendment claims arising either from 
conditions of solitary confinement or from periods of confinement to cells 
for twenty-two or twenty-three hours per day (see, inter alia, Five 
Percenters 174 F.3d 471 (4th Cir. 1999); In re Long Term Admin. 
Segregation 174 F.3d 464 (4th Cir. 1999); Anderson v. County of Kern 
F.3d 1310 (9th Cir. 1995); Peterkin v. Jeffes 855 F.2d. 1021 (3d cir. 
1988); Smith v. Romer 107 F.3d 21 (10th Cir. 1997)). However, in Ruiz v. 
Johnson 37 F. Supp 2d 855 (1999), the highest level of administrative 
segregation in the Texan prison system was found to reach levels of 
psychological deprivation that violated the Eighth Amendment. There, the 
court found there had been deliberate indifference to a systemic pattern of 
extreme social isolation and reduced environmental stimulation. The 
objective test was found to have been met in respect of three prisoners who 
had been in solitary confinement for between twenty-nine and thirty-five 
years: Wilkerson v. Stalder 639 F. Supp. 2d 654 M.D.La., 2007. 
108. Lower courts outside the Tenth Circuit (which has jurisdiction over 
ADX Florence) have ruled that solitary confinement of prisoners with pre-
existing serious mental illness can be sufficiently harmful to violate the 
objective test laid down in Wilson, cited above: see Jones 'El v. Berge 164 
F. Supp. 2d 1096 (2001) (concerning Wisconsin's "supermax" prison) and 
Madrid v. Gomez 889 F. Supp 1146 (1995) (concerning detention at Pelican 
Bay State Prison, California). However, the subjective test laid down in 
Wilson may not be satisfied unless a plaintiff can show that prison officials 
attributed any deterioration in his mental state to the conditions of his 
confinement. Negligence in this respect does not suffice; deliberate 
indifference is required (Scarver v. Litscher 434 F. 3d 972 (7th Cir. 2006)).

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
C. Due process of law 
109. The Fifth Amendment protects against deprivation of life, liberty or 
property without due process of law. In the context of prison discipline, due 
process rights are triggered by an atypical and significant hardship on the 
inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life (Sandin v. Conner, 
cited above). This will include transfer to a "supermax" security prison 
(Wilkinson v. Austin 545 US 209 (2005)). In Wilkinson, the court upheld a 
system which gave notice of the reasons for placement in the supermax 
prison, an opportunity to reply and multiple levels of review. Periodic 
review of administrative segregation is also required to ensure that it is not 
used as a pretext for indefinite confinement (Hewitt v. Helms 459 US 460 
(1983)). 
Sandin has been interpreted by the Tenth Circuit as requiring prisoners to 
show that their conditions of confinement deviate substantially from the 
baseline accepted treatment of prisoners (Estate of DiMarco v. Wyoming 
Department of Corrections 473 F. 3d 1334 (10'h Cir. 2007)). This test was 
found not to be satisfied by fourteen months' solitary confinement in 
DiMarco because the prisoner in question had been provided with the 
ordinary essentials of prison life. 
D. Litigation challenging conditions of detention at ADX Florence 
110. In Sattar v. Gonzales 2009 WL 606115 (D.Colo.2009) the United 
States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed a challenge to 
conditions of detention at ADX Florence and to the imposition of special 
administrative measures. The plaintiff had limited contact with his family 
and attorneys and so the court found that the "severe limitations of ADX 
confinement" did not amount to the necessary deprivation required by the 
objective test. 
A constitutional challenge to the imposition of special administrative 
measures at ADX was also dismissed by the District Court in Al-Owhali 
v. Holder 1011 WL 288523 (D. Colo. 2011); the case is now the subject of 
an appeal. 
In Georgacarakos v. Wiley, 2010 WL 1291833 (D.Colo. 2010) the 
District Court found that detention at ADX for five years did not amount to 
atypical and significant hardship, given the availability of social visits and 
phone calls, the opportunity to converse with other inmates in the recreation 
areas, and the possibility of transfer out of ADX via the step down program. 
Georgacarakos was recently followed in Matthews v. Wiley 744 F. Supp. 2d 
1159 (D. Colo. 2010). 
In Magluta v. United States Federal Bureau of Prisons, 29 May 2009, 
the District Court held that the plaintiff's allegation that detention at ADX 
had led to a significant deterioration of his mental condition failed to satisfy 
EFTA00031766
--- PAGE 35 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
the objective test in Wilson cited above. The plaintiff had not shown that 
conditions at ADX, even if lonely or uncomfortable, failed to provide basic 
human necessities; ADX was a prison and confinement was "intended to 
punish inmates, not coddle them". 
111. In Hill v. Pugh 75 Fed. Appx. 715 (10'h Cir. (2003)) United States 
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected an Eighth Amendment claim 
that ADX conditions were cruel and unusual. The plaintiff was isolated in 
his cell twenty-three hours a day for five days a week and twenty-four hours 
the remaining two days. However, his minimal physical requirements of 
food, shelter, clothing and warmth had been met and so the conditions 
showed neither an "unquestioned and serious deprivation of basic human 
needs" nor "intolerable or shocking conditions". Similar conclusions were 
reached in Jordan v. the Federal Bureau of Prisons 191 Fed. Appx 639 (lir 
Cir. 2006), Ajaj v. United States 293 Fed.Appx. 575 (10th Cir. 2008). 
112. In Rezaq, et at v. Halley, et al, the plaintiffs brought Eighth 
Amendment claims concerning their placements at ADX at various dates 
between 1997 and 2003. The District Court granted the Bureau of Prisons' 
motions for summary judgment: 2010 WL 5157317 (D. Colo. 2010); 2010 
WL 5464294 (D. Colo. 2010). The court, following the recommendations of 
the Magistrate Judge, found that the plaintiff's terrorist backgrounds and 
convictions provided a legitimate penological interest for transferring them 
to ADX, particularly when only thirty-five of the two hundred and six 
inmates in federal prisons with international terrorism convictions had been 
assigned to ADX. The plaintiffs' conditions of confinement there were not 
so extreme as to be atypical and significant. The conditions were also 
different from those in Wilkinson v. Austin (see paragraph 109 above) in that 
ADX offered more opportunities for outdoor exercise, interaction with other 
inmates and educational programmes. There was also insufficient evidence 
of significant mental harm: there was no evidence that one of the plaintiff's 
depression could be attributed to ADX; the remainder of the plaintiffs' 
emotional problems were typically experienced by prisoners. Finally, owing 
to the availability of periodical reviews and the step down program, 
confinement at ADX was not indeterminate. The plaintiffs have appealed to 
the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, though they have all been 
transferred out of ADX. 
113. In Silverstein v. Federal Bureau of Prisons 704 F Supp. 2d 1077 
(2010), before the District Court the plaintiff alleges that he has been held in 
solitary confinement at ADX Florence and other institutions since 1983. 
The Bureau of Prisons has sought summary judgment in its favour in 
respect of the plaintiff's claims. A decision is awaited; a six-day jury trial 
was set to begin on 23 January 2012.

E. Relevant international materials on solitary confinement 
I. Council of Europe 
114. The Council of Europe Guidelines on human rights and the fight 
against terrorism contain the following provision: 
"XI. Detention 
1. A person deprived of his/her liberty for terrorist activities must in all 
circumstances be treated with due respect for human dignity. 
2. The imperatives of the fight against terrorism may nevertheless require that a 
person deprived of his/her liberty for terrorist activities be submitted to more severe 
restrictions than those applied to other prisoners, in particular with regard to: 
(i) the regulations concerning communications and surveillance of correspondence, 
including that between counsel and his/her client; 
(ii) placing persons deprived of their liberty for terrorist activities in specially 
secured quarters; 
(iii) the separation of such persons within a prison or among different prisons, on 
condition that the measure taken is proportionate to the aim to be achieved." 
115. The European Prison Rules (contained in Recommendation 
Rec(2006)2 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to 
Member States) where relevant, provide as follows: 
Security 
"51.1 The security measures applied to individual prisoners shall be the minimum 
necessary to achieve their secure custody. 
51.2 The security which is provided by physical barriers and other technical means 
shall be complemented by the dynamic security provided by an alert staff who know 
the prisoners who are under their control. 
51.3 As soon as possible after admission, prisoners shall be assessed to determine: 
a. the risk that they would present to the community if they were to escape; 
b. the risk that they will try to escape either on their own or with external 
assistance. 
51.4 Each prisoner shall then be held in security conditions appropriate to these 
levels of risk. 
51.5 The level of security necessary shall be reviewed at regular intervals 
throughout a person's imprisonment."

52.1 As soon as possible after admission, prisoners shall be assessed to determine 
whether they pose a safety risk to other prisoners, prison staff or other persons 
working in or visiting prison or whether they are likely to harm themselves. 
52.2 Procedures shall be in place to ensure the safety of prisoners, prison staff and 
all visitors and to reduce to a minimum the risk of violence and other events that 
might threaten safety. 
52.3 Every possible effort shall be made to allow all prisoners to take a full part in

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
116. The 21st General Report of the European Committee for the 
Prevention of Torture, 10 November 2011, addressed solitary confinement, 
which it defined as whenever a prisoner is ordered to be held separately 
from other prisoners or was held together with one or two other prisoners. 
The Committee observed: 
"[Solitary confinement] can have an extremely damaging effect on the mental, 
somatic and social health of those concerned. This damaging effect can be immediate 
and increases the longer the measure lasts and the more indeterminate it is. The most 
significant indicator of the damage which solitary confinement can inflict is the 
considerably higher rate of suicide among prisoners subjected to it than that among 
the general prison population." 
The report therefore urged States to minimise the use of solitary 
confinement. It should be proportionate and, the longer it was used, the 
stronger the reasons for it had to be. It should be lawful and subject to 
accountability, with the fullest possible reasons given and records kept. It 
should be necessary and non-discriminatory. It should never be imposed as 
part of a sentence and, if imposed as a disciplinary sanction, the maximum 
period should be fourteen days. In that period, a prisoner should have at 
least one hour's outdoor exercise per day and other appropriate mental 
stimulation. 
The report also stated that the Committee's recommended procedural 
safeguards should be rigorously followed where administrative solitary 
confinement was used for preventative purposes, including periodical and 
external reviews which considered, among other things, whether some of 
the restrictions imposed were strictly necessary. In such situations, prisoners 
should have an individual regime plan which attempted to maximise contact 
with others. Resources should also be made available to attempt to 
reintegrate the prisoner into the main prison community. 
For material conditions in solitary confinement, the Committee stated 
that the cells used should meet the same minimum standards as those 
applicable to other prisoner accommodation. These included a cell of no less 
than six square metres, proper cell furnishings, adequate natural and 
artificial light, heating and ventilation, and sufficiently large exercise areas 
to allow genuine exertion. 
The Committee also stated that medical personnel should never 
participate in decisions on solitary confinement and should report to the 
prison director whenever a prisoner's health was put seriously at risk by 
solitary confinement. 
2. The Inter-American system 
117. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has found that 
isolation could in itself constitute inhuman treatment, and a more serious 
violation could result for someone with a mental disability (Victor Rosario 
Congo v. Ecuador, case 11.427, 13 April 1999). 
EFTA00031770
--- PAGE 39 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
In Montero Aranguren et al (Detention Center of Catia) v. Venezuela, 
judgment of 5 July 2006, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights stated: 
"...solitary confinement cells must be used as disciplinary measures or for the 
protection of persons only during the time necessary and in strict compliance with the 
criteria of reasonability, necessity and legality. Such places must fulfil the minimum 
standards for proper accommodation, sufficient space and adequate ventilation, and 
they can only be used if a physician certifies that the prisoner is fit to sustain it. 
(footnotes omitted)" 
3. The United Nations 
118. Isolation for twenty-three hours a day in a two by two metres cell 
with ten minutes of sunlight per day was found by the United Nations 
Human Rights Committee to violate Article 7 of the ICCPR in Polay 
Campos v. Peru, CCPWC/61/D/577/1994, 6 November 1997. 
119. In its recommendations to State parties, the United Nations 
Committee against Torture has recommended that: 
- solitary confinement be strictly and specifically regulated by law and 
applied only in severe circumstances, with a view to its abolition 
(Conclusions 
and Recommendations in respect of Luxembourg, 
CAT/C/CR/28/2, at paragraph 6(b)); 
- there should be adequate review mechanisms relating to the 
determination and duration of solitary confinement (Conclusions and 
Recommendations in respect of Denmark, CAT/C/CR/28/1 at paragraph 
7(d)); 
- solitary confinement for long periods of time may constitute inhuman 
treatment (Conclusions and Recommendations in respect of Switzerland, 
A/49/44, paragraph 133). 
120. The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Torture has found that 
isolation for twenty-two to twenty-four hours per day may amount to ill-
treatment and, in certain instances, torture (Interim Report of 28 July 2008, 
A/63/I75, at paragraphs 77-85). The report included a copy of the Istanbul 
statement on the use and effects of solitary confinement, which was adopted 
at the International Psychological Trauma Symposium in December 2007. 
The statement included the following on the effects of solitary confinement: 
"It has been convincingly documented on numerous occasions that solitary 
confinement may cause serious psychological and sometimes physiological ill effects. 
Research suggests that between one third and as many as 90 per cent of prisoners 
experience adverse symptoms in solitary confinement. A long list of symptoms 
ranging from insomnia and confusion to hallucinations and psychosis has been 
documented. Negative health effects can occur after only a few days in solitary 
confinement, and the health risks rise with each additional day spent in such 
conditions. 
Individuals may react to solitary confinement differently. Still, a significant number 
of individuals will experience serious health problems regardless of the specific 
EFTA00031771
--- PAGE 40 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
conditions, regardless of time and place, and regardless of pre-existing personal 
factors. The central harmful feature of solitary confinement is that it reduces 
meaningful social contact to a level of social and psychological stimulus that many 
will experience as insufficient to sustain health and well being." 
121. In his Interim Report of 5 August 2011, A/66/268, the current 
Special Rapporteur for Torture found that where the physical conditions and 
the prison regime of solitary confinement caused severe mental and physical 
pain or suffering, when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, 
indefinitely prolonged, on juveniles or persons with mental disabilities, it 
could amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
even torture. The report highlighted a number of general principles to help 
to guide States to re-evaluate and minimise its use and, in certain cases, 
abolish the practice of solitary confinement. He stated that the practice 
should be used only in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, for 
as short a time as possible. He further emphasised the need for minimum 
procedural safeguards, internal and external, to ensure that all persons 
deprived of their liberty were treated with humanity and respect for the 
inherent dignity of the human person. 
IV. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND 
PRACTICE ON LIFE SENTENCES 
A. The applicants' possible sentences, the federal sentencing system 
and presidential pardons 
I. Evidence from the United States Department of Justice 
122. In a letter dated 26 November 2010 the United States Department 
of Justice set out the maximum sentences each of the six applicants would 
face if convicted. 
123. The first applicant faces four counts of criminal conduct. The first 
count, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, carries a 
maximum sentence of fifteen years in prison. The second count, providing 
material support to terrorists, carries the same maximum sentence. The third 
count, conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage 
property in a foreign country, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
The sentence for the final count, money laundering, is a maximum of twenty 
years. None of the counts contained a mandatory minimum sentence. The 
trial judge would have the discretion to impose a sentence of no 
imprisonment up to the maximum penalties, to run consecutively or 
concurrently. 
124. For the second applicant, the Department of Justice stated that the 
maximum penalty he faced was not fifty years' imprisonment, as previously 
EFTA00031772
--- PAGE 41 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
stated, but thirty-five years' imprisonment. This was because the maximum 
penalties for his offences were lower at the time of the alleged commission 
of the offences than the current sentences. The correct maximum penalties 
on each of the four counts he faced were: five years' imprisonment for the 
count of conspiracy to provide material support and resources to terrorists; 
ten years for providing material support and resources to terrorists; ten years 
for conspiring to provide material support and resources to a designated 
foreign terrorist organisation; and ten years for providing material support 
and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organisation. None of the 
counts carried a mandatory minimum sentence and, as for the first applicant, 
the trial judge would have the discretion to impose a sentence of no 
imprisonment up to the maximum penalties, to run consecutively or 
concurrently. 
125. For the third applicant, as he is charged with the same offences as 
the first applicant (save for the money laundering charge), the possible 
sentences would be the same. 
126. For the fourth applicant, for the Yemen hostage-taking counts, the 
maximum sentences are life imprisonment. For the Bly, Oregon counts, the 
maximum sentences were the same as those for the second applicant. For 
the Afghanistan counts, the maximum sentences are fifteen years' 
imprisonment on each count. None of the counts carried a mandatory 
minimum sentence and the trial judge's discretion in sentencing would be 
the same as for the first three applicants. 
127. For the fifth applicant, the maximum sentences are: 
conspiracy to kill United States nationals - life imprisonment; 
conspiracy to murder — life imprisonment; 
conspiracy to destroy buildings and property — life imprisonment; and 
conspiracy to attack national defence utilities — ten years' imprisonment. 
The third count, conspiracy to destroy buildings and property, has a 
mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years' imprisonment. Therefore, if 
convicted on all four counts, the trial judge's sentencing discretion would 
range from twenty years' imprisonment to life. 
128. For the sixth applicant, each of the two hundred and sixty-nine 
counts of murder with which he is charged carries a mandatory minimum 
sentence of life imprisonment. The remaining counts carry maximum 
penalties of between ten years and life imprisonment. 
129. The Department of Justice's letter also set out the applicable law on 
federal sentencing. In addition to the need to have regard to the purposes of 
sentencing (set out in section 3553(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code), 
a trial judge had to consider the non-binding sentencing guidelines of the 
United States Sentencing Commission, a judicial body. These required the 
trial judge to have regard inter alia to any mitigating or aggravating factors, 
the defendant's criminal history, any credit for a guilty plea, and the effect 
of any assistance given to the United States' authorities. 
EFTA00031773
--- PAGE 42 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
130. The letter further confirmed that, as set out at paragraph 72 of the 
Court's admissibility decision, there were four ways a sentence of life 
imprisonment could be reduced. 
First, it could be reduced by the sentencing court upon the motion of the 
Director of the Bureau of Prisons upon a finding that "extraordinary and 
compelling reasons warrant such a reduction". This generally involved 
inmates with terminal illnesses. 
Second, if a defendant provided substantial assistance in the investigation 
of a third party, the Government could move within one year of sentencing 
for a reduction in the sentence. 
Third, if the defendant had been sentenced on the basis of sentencing 
guidelines which were subsequently lowered by 
the Sentencing 
Commission (the judicial body responsible for promulgating the guidelines) 
then the sentencing court could reduce the term of imprisonment. 
Fourth, the defendant could request commutation by the President. While 
commutation was exercised sparingly, such relief had, on occasion, been 
granted for serious offences involving national security. For example, in 
1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of thirteen members of the 
FALN, a violent Puerto Rican nationalist organisation responsible for 
bombings in the 1970s and 1980s, who had been convicted of conspiracy to 
commit armed robbery, bomb-making, sedition and other offences. 
131. Other reductions were available to those sentenced to less than life 
imprisonment. Fifty-four days' credit was available each year for exemplary 
compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations; this allowed for 
release after 85% of the sentence had been served. Additionally, any 
defendant had a statutory right of appeal against sentence to a federal court 
of appeals and, though rare, to the United States Supreme Court. He could 
also seek review of the sentencing by the trial judge within one year of the 
sentence being passed. 
132. The Department of Justice's letter of 22 September 2011 stated that 
sentences were normally to run concurrently unless the law provided for 
consecutive sentences or the trial judge positively ordered that any 
sentences which were imposed were to run consecutively. In the applicants' 
indictments, the only counts which carried mandatory concurrent sentences 
were three of the counts faced by the sixth applicant (one count of using and 
carrying an explosive, and two counts of using and carrying a dangerous 
device during the bombing of the US Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es 
Salaam). 
The letter also underlined the Department of Justice's view that the 
federal sentencing guidelines gave the trial judge a broad discretion in 
sentencing. 
EFTA00031774
--- PAGE 43 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
2. Evidence submitted by the applicants 
133. The applicants submitted a declaration from Ms Denise Barrett, the 
National Sentencing Resource Counsel for Federal Public and Community 
Defenders. She stated that a trial judge's discretion in sentencing was not as 
broad as the Department of Justice had suggested. It remained subject to 
increases as well as reductions on appeal. The sentencing guidelines 
allowed for significant increases in sentences if the offences involved 
terrorism, such that the recommended guideline sentence was the same as 
the statutory maximum sentence, irrespective of the absence of any prior 
criminal record. Owing to the possibility of consecutive sentences being 
imposed, she therefore assessed the possible sentences as: 
the first applicant, life plus fifty years; 
the second applicant, thirty-five years; 
the third applicant, life plus thirty years; 
the fourth applicant, two life sentences plus ninety-five years; 
the fifth applicant, three consecutive life sentences plus ten years; 
the sixth applicant, numerous consecutive life sentences. 
For the mechanisms for sentence reduction, Ms Barrett noted the 
following. Compassionate release for the terminally ill or disabled was not 
automatic and was assessed with reference to additional factors such as the 
nature of the crime committed and the length of time served. Reduction for 
substantial assistance to the authorities depended on the initiative of the 
Government, not the court. Subsequent lowering of the relevant sentencing 
guidelines could only reduce a sentence if the Sentencing Guidelines 
Commission made the change retroactive and might not reduce the overall 
sentence if the person concerned was convicted of other offences and given 
consecutive sentences. For presidential commutation, the FALN pardons 
had only been for those who had been convicted of non-violent crimes and 
had been offered on the condition that the individuals concerned renounce 
violence. The pardons had nonetheless been very controversial. 
B. Eighth Amendment case-law on "grossly disproportionate" 
sentences 
134. The Eighth Amendment has been interpreted by the Supreme Court 
of the United States as prohibiting extreme sentences that are grossly 
disproportionate to the crime (Graham v. Florida 130 S. Ct. 2011, 2021 
(2010)). There are two categories of cases addressing proportionality of 
sentences. 
The first category is a case-by-case approach, where the court considers 
all the circumstances of the case to determine whether the sentence is 
excessive. This begins with a "threshold comparison" of the gravity of the 
offence and the harshness of the penalty. If this leads to an inference of 
EFTA00031775
--- PAGE 44 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
gross disproportionality, the court compares the sentence in question with 
sentences for the same crime in the same jurisdiction and other jurisdictions. 
If that analysis confirms the initial inference of gross disproportionality, a 
violation of the Eighth Amendment is established. 
In the second category of cases, the Supreme Court has invoked 
proportionality to adopt "categorical rules" prohibiting a particular 
punishment from being applied to certain crimes or certain classes of 
offenders. 
135. Under the first category, the Supreme Court has struck down as 
grossly disproportionate a sentence of life imprisonment without parole 
imposed on a defendant with previous convictions for passing a worthless 
cheque (Solem v. Helm 463 US 277 (1983)). It has upheld the following 
sentences: life with the possibility of parole for obtaining money by false 
pretences (Rummel v. Estelle 445 US 263 (1980)); life imprisonment 
without parole for possessing a large quantity of cocaine (Hamelin 
v. Michigan 501 US 957 (1991)); twenty-five years to life for theft under a 
"three strikes" recidivist sentencing law (Ewing v. California 538 US 11 
(2003)); 
forty 
years' 
imprisonment 
for 
distributing 
marijuana 
(Hutto v. Davis 454 US 370 (1982)). 
136. Examples of cases considered under the second category include 
Coker v. Georgia 433 US 584 (1977) (prohibiting capital punishment for 
rape) and Roper v. Simmons 543 US 551 (2005) (prohibiting capital 
punishment for juveniles under eighteen). In Graham, cited above, the court 
held that the Eighth Amendment also prohibited the imposition of life 
imprisonment without parole on a juvenile offender who did not commit 
homicide. The court found that life imprisonment without parole was an 
especially harsh punishment for a juvenile and that the remote possibility of 
pardon or other executive clemency did not mitigate the harshness of the 
sentence. Although a State was not required to guarantee eventual freedom 
to a juvenile offender convicted of a non-homicide crime, it had to provide 
some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated 
maturity and rehabilitation. The court also held that a sentence lacking in 
legitimate penological justification (such as retribution, deterrence, 
incapacitation and rehabilitation) was, by its nature, disproportionate. Such 
purposes could justify life without parole in other contexts, but not life 
without parole for juvenile non-homicide offenders. 
C. Relevant international and comparative law on life sentences and 
"grossly disproportionate" sentences 
137. The relevant texts of the Council of Europe, the European Union 
and other international legal texts on the imposition and review of sentences

such sentences, are set out in Kafkaris, cited above, at §§ 68-76. Additional 
materials before the Court in the present cases (and those materials in 
Kaf;cads that are expressly relied on by the parties) may be summarised as 
follows. 
I. Life sentences in the Contracting States 
138. In his comparative study entitled "Outlawing Irreducible Life 
Sentences: Europe on the Brink?", 23: I Federal Sentencing Reporter 
Vol 23, No 1 (October 2010), Professor Van Zyl Smit concluded that the 
majority of European countries do not have irreducible life sentences, and 
some, including Portugal, Norway and Spain, do not have life sentences at 
all. In Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, 
Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland 
and Turkey, prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment have fixed periods 
after which release is considered. In France three such prisoners have no 
minimum period but it appears they can be considered for release after 
years. In Switzerland there are provisions for indeterminate sentences for 
dangerous offenders where release can only follow new scientific evidence 
that the prisoner was not dangerous, although the provisions have not been 
used. The study concludes that only the Netherlands and England and Wales 
have irreducible life sentences. 
2. Council of Europe texts 
139. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ("CPT") prepared a report 
on "Actual/Real Life Sentences" dated 27 June 2007 (CPT (2007) 55). The 
report reviewed various Council of Europe texts on life sentences, including 
recommendations (2003) 22 and 23, and stated in terms that: (a) the 
principle of making conditional release available is relevant to all prisoners, 
"even to life prisoners"; and (b) that all Council of Europe member States 
had provision for compassionate release but that this "special form of 
release" was distinct from conditional release. 
It noted the view that discretionary release from imprisonment, as with 
its imposition, was a matter for the courts and not the executive, a view 
which had led to proposed changes in the procedures for reviewing life 
imprisonment in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The report also quoted 
with approval the CPT's report on its 2007 visit to Hungary in which it 
stated: 
"[A]s regards "actual lifers", the CPT has serious reservations about the very 
concept according to which such prisoners, once they are sentenced, are considered 
once and for all as a permanent threat to the community and are deprived of any hope 
to be granted conditional release". 
EFTA00031777
--- PAGE 46 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
The report's conclusion included recommendations that: no category of 
prisoners should be "stamped" as likely to spend their natural life in prison; 
no denial of release should ever be final; and not even recalled prisoners 
should be deprived of hope of release. 
3. The International Criminal Court 
140. Article 77 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
allows for the imposition of a term of life imprisonment when justified by 
the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual circumstances of the 
convicted person. Such a sentence must be reviewed after twenty-five years 
to determine whether it should be reduced (Article 110). 
4. The European Union 
141. Article 5(2) of Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on 
the European arrest warrant provides: 
"if the offence on the basis of which the European arrest warrant has been issued is 
punishable by custodial life sentence or life-time detention order, the execution of the 
said arrest warrant may be subject to the condition that the issuing Member State has 
provisions in its legal system for a review of the penalty or measure imposed, on 
request or at the latest after 20 years, or for the application of measures of clemency to 
which the person is entitled to apply for under the law or practice of the issuing 
Member State, aiming at a non-execution of such penalty or measure..." 
5. The United Kingdom 
142. R. v. Lichniak and R. v. Pyrah [2003) 1 AC 903, the House of 
Lords considered the compatibility of a mandatory life sentence as imposed 
in England and Wales with Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. It found that, 
in its operation, a mandatory life sentence was not incompatible with either 
Article. 
Such a sentence was partly punitive, partly preventative. The punitive 
element was represented by the tariff term, imposed as punishment for the 
serious crime which the convicted murderer had committed. The 
preventative element was represented by the power to continue to detain the 
convicted murderer in prison unless and until the Parole Board, an 
independent body, considered it safe to release him, and also by the power 
to recall to prison a convicted murderer who had been released if it was 
judged necessary to recall him for the protection of the public (Lord 
Bingham of Comhill at § 8 of the judgment). 
The House of Lords therefore held firstly, that the appellant's complaints 
were not of sufficient gravity to engage Article 3 of the Convention and 
secondly, that the life sentence was not arbitrary or otherwise contrary to 
Article 5 § I of the Convention. Lord Bingham added: 
EFTA00031778
--- PAGE 47 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
"If the House had concluded that on imposition of a mandatory life sentence for 
murder the convicted murderer forfeited his liberty to the state for the rest of his days, 
to remain in custody until (if ever) the Home Secretary concluded that the public 
interest would be better served by his release than by his continued detention, I would 
have little doubt that such a sentence would be found to violate articles 3 and 5 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights ... as being arbitrary and disproportionate." 
143. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte 
Hindley [2001] 1 AC 410, HL and R. v. Anderson [2003] 1 AC 837, HL, the 
House of Lords found that, under the tariff system then in operation, there 
was "no reason, in principle, why a crime or crimes, if sufficiently heinous 
should not be regarded as deserving lifelong incarceration for purposes of 
pure punishment" (per Lord Steyn at pp. 416H). Lord Steyn also observed: 
"there is nothing logically inconsistent with the concept of a tariff by saying 
that there are cases were the crimes are so wicked that even if the prisoner is 
detained until he or she dies it will not exhaust the requirements of 
retribution and deterrence" (p. 4I7H). 
144. Under the present statutory framework in England and Wales, 
Chapter 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, a trial judge can impose a whole 
life term or order on a defendant convicted of murder. Such a defendant is 
not eligible for parole and can only be released by the Secretary of State. In 
R v. Bieber [2009] 1 WLR 223 the Court of Appeal considered that such 
whole life terms were compatible with Article 3 of the Convention. 
It found that a whole life order did not contravene Article 3 of the 
Convention because of the possibility of compassionate release by the 
Secretary of State. It also found that the imposition of an irreducible life 
sentence would not itself constitute a violation of Article 3 but rather that a 
potential violation would only occur once the offender had been detained 
beyond the period that could be justified on the ground of punishment and 
deterrence. The court stated: 
"45. While under English law the offence of murder attracts a mandatory life 
sentence, this is not normally an irreducible sentence. The judge specifies the 
minimum term to be served by way of punishment and deterrence before the 
offender's release on licence can be considered. Where a whole life term is specified 
this is because the judge considers that the offence is so serious that, for purposes of 
punishment and deterrence, the offender must remain in prison for the rest of his days. 
For the reasons that we have given, we do not consider that the Strasbourg court has 
ruled that an irreducible life sentence, deliberately imposed by a judge in such 
circumstances, will result in detention that violates article 3. Nor do we consider that 
it will do so. 
46. It may be that the approach of the Strasbourg court will change. There seems to 
be a tide in Europe that is setting against the imposition of very lengthy terms of 
imprisonment that are irreducible. Thus it may become necessary to consider whether 
whole life terms imposed in this jurisdiction are, in fact irreducible. 
EFTA00031779
--- PAGE 48 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
Under the regime that predated the 2003 Act it was the practice of the Secretary of 
State to review the position of prisoners serving a whole life tariff after they had 
served 25 years with a view to reducing the tariff in exceptional circumstances, such 
as where the prisoner had made exceptional progress whilst in custody. No suggestion 
was then made that the imposition of a whole life tariff infringed article 3. 
Under the current regime the Secretary of State has a limited power to release a life 
prisoner under section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. 
At present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this power sparingly, in 
circumstances where, for instance, a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is 
bedridden or similarly incapacitated. If, however, the position is reached where the 
continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading 
treatment, we can see no reason why, having particular regard to the requirement to 
comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not use his statutory power 
to release the prisoner. 
49. For these reasons, applying the approach of the Strasbourg court in Kaficaris v 
Cyprus 12 February 2008, we do not consider that a whole life term should be 
considered as a sentence that is irreducible. Any article 3 challenge where a whole life 
term has been imposed should therefore be made, not at the time of the imposition of 
the sentence, but at the stage when the prisoner contends that, having regard to all the 
material circumstances, including the time that he has served and the progress made in 
prison, any further detention will constitute degrading or inhuman treatment." 
6. Germany 
145. Article I of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany 
provides that human dignity shall be inviolable. Article 2(2) provides: 
"Every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity. Freedom of the 
person shall be inviolable. These rights may be interfered with only pursuant to a 
law." 
The compatibility of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for 
murder with these provisions was considered by the Federal Constitutional 
Court in the Life Imprisonment case of 21 June 1977, 45 BVerfGE 187 (an 
English translation of extracts of the judgment, with commentary, can be 
found in D.P. Kommers, The Constitutional Jurisprudence of the Federal 
Republic of Germany (2nd ed.), Duke University Press, Durham and 
London, 1997 at pp. 306-313). 
The court found that the State could not turn the offender into an object 
of crime prevention to the detriment of his constitutionally protected right to 
social worth. Respect for human dignity and the rule of law meant the 
humane enforcement of life imprisonment was possible only when the 
EFTA00031780
--- PAGE 49 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
prisoner was given "a concrete and realistically attainable chance" to regain 
his freedom at some later point in time. 
The court underlined that prisons also had a duty to strive towards the re-
socialisation of prisoners, to preserve their ability to cope with life and to 
counteract the negative effects of incarceration and the destructive changes 
in personality that accompanied imprisonment. It recognised, however, that, 
for a criminal who remained a threat to society, the goal of rehabilitation 
might never be fulfilled; in that case, it was the particular personal 
circumstances of the criminal which might rule out successful rehabilitation 
rather than the sentence of life imprisonment itself. The court also found 
that, subject to these conclusions, life imprisonment for murder was not a 
senseless or disproportionate punishment. 
146. In the later War Criminal case 72 BVerfGE 105 (1986), where the 
petitioner was eighty-six years of age and had served twenty years of a life 
sentence imposed for sending fifty people to the gas chambers, the court 
considered that the gravity of a person's crime could weigh upon whether he 
or she could be required to serve his or her life sentence. However, a 
judicial balancing of these factors should not place too heavy an emphasis 
on the gravity of the crime as opposed to the personality, state of mind, and 
age of the person. In that case, any subsequent review of the petitioner's 
request for release would be required to weigh more heavily than before the 
petitioner's personality, age and prison record. 
147. In its decision of 16 January 2010, BVerfG, 2 BvR 2299/09, the 
Federal Constitutional Court considered an extradition case where the 
offender faced "aggravated life imprisonment until death" (erschwerte 
lebenslangliche Freiheitsstrafe bis von Tod) in Turkey. The German 
government had sought assurances that he would be considered for release 
and had received the reply that the President of Turkey had the power to 
remit sentences on grounds of chronic illness, disability, or old age. The 
court refused to allow extradition, finding that this power of release offered 
only a vague hope of release and was thus insufficient. Notwithstanding the 
need to respect foreign legal orders, if someone had no practical prospect of 
release such a sentence would be cruel and degrading (grausam and 
erniedrigend) and would infringe the requirements of human dignity 
provided for in Article 1. 
7. Canada 
148. The Supreme Court of Canada has found that a grossly 
disproportionate sentence will amount to cruel and unusual treatment or 
punishment (see, inter alia, R v. Smith (Edward Dewey) [1987] I SCR 
1045). In R v. Litton [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711, the court considered that, for 
first degree murder, a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment 
without eligibility for parole for twenty-five years was not grossly 
disproportionate. Similarly, in R v. Latimer 2001 1 SCR 3, for second 
EFTA00031781
--- PAGE 50 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
degree murder, a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment 
without eligibility for parole for ten years was not grossly disproportionate. 
The court observed that gross disproportionality would only be found on 
"rare and unique occasions" and that the test for determining this issue was 
"very properly stringent and demanding". 
South Africa 
149. In Dodo v. the State (CCT 1/01) [2001] ZACC 16, the South 
African Constitutional Court considered whether a statutory provision 
which required a life sentence for certain offences including murder, was 
compatible with the constitutional principle of the separation of powers, the 
accused's constitutional right to a public trial and the constitutional 
prohibition on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The 
court found none of these constitutionals provisions was infringed, since the 
statute allowed a court to pass a lesser sentence if there were substantial and 
compelling circumstances. The court did, however, observe that the concept 
of proportionality went to the heart of the inquiry as to whether punishment 
was cruel, inhuman or degrading. 
150. In Niemand v. The State (CCT 28/00) [2001] ZACC 11, the court 
found an indeterminate sentence imposed pursuant to a declaration that the 
defendant was a "habitual criminal" to be grossly disproportionate because 
it could amount to life imprisonment for a non-violent offender. The court 
"read in" a maximum sentence of fifteen years to the relevant statute. 
9. Other jurisdictions 
151. In Reyes v. the Queen [2002] UKPC 11 the Judicial Committee of 
the Privy Council considered that a mandatory death penalty for murder by 
shooting was incompatible with section 7 of the Constitution of Belize, 
which prohibits torture and ill-treatment in identical terms to Article 3 of the 
Convention. Lord Bingham observed that to deny the offender the 
opportunity, before sentence is passed, to seek to persuade the court that in 
all the circumstances to condemn him to death would be disproportionate 
and inappropriate was to treat him as no human being should be treated. The 
relevant law was not saved by the powers of pardon and commutation 
vested by the Constitution in the Governor-General, assisted by an Advisory 
Council; in Lord Bingham's words "a non-judicial body cannot not decide 
what is the appropriate measure of punishment to be visited on a defendant 
for the crime he has committed". 
152. In de Boucherville v. the State of Mauritius [2008] UKPC 70 the 
appellant had been sentenced to death. With the abolition of the death 
penalty in Mauritius, his sentence was commuted to a mandatory life 
sentence. The Privy Council considered the Court's judgment in Kafkaris, 
cited above, and found that the safeguards available in Cyprus to prevent 
EFTA00031782
--- PAGE 51 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
Kaficaris from being without hope of release were not available in 
Mauritius. The Mauritian Supreme Court had interpreted such a sentence as 
condemning de Boucherville to penal servitude for the rest of his life and 
the provisions of the relevant legislation on parole and remission did not 
apply. This meant the sentence was manifestly disproportionate and 
arbitrary and so contrary to section 10 of the Mauritian Constitution 
(provisions to secure protection of law, including the right to a fair trial). It 
had also been argued by the appellant that the mandatory nature of the 
sentence violated section 7 of the Constitution (the prohibition of torture, 
inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment). In light of its 
conclusion on section 10, the Committee considered it unnecessary to 
decide that question or to consider the relevance of the possibility of release 
under section 75 (the presidential prerogative of mercy). It did, however, 
find that the safeguards available in Cyprus (in the form of the Attorney-
General's powers to recommend release and the President's powers to 
commute sentences or decree release) were not available in Mauritius. It 
also acknowledged the appellant's argument that, as with the mandatory 
sentence of death it had considered in Reyes, a mandatory sentence of life 
imprisonment did not allow for consideration of the facts of the case. The 
Privy Council also considered any differences between mandatory sentences 
of death and life imprisonment could be exaggerated and, to this end, quoted 
with approval the dicta of Lord Justice Laws in Wellington and Lord 
Bingham in Lichniak (at paragraphs 65 and 142 above). 
153. In State v. Philibert [2007] SCJ 274, the Supreme Court of 
Mauritius held that a mandatory sentence of 45 years' imprisonment for 
murder amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of section 
on the grounds that it was disproportionate. 
154. In State v. Tcoeib [1997] 1 LRC 90 the Namibian Supreme Court 
considered the imposition of a discretionary life sentence to be compatible 
with section 8 of the country's constitution (subsection (c) of which is 
identical to Article 3 of the Convention). Chief Justice Mahomed, for the 
unanimous court, found the relevant statutory release scheme to be 
sufficient but observed that if release depended on the "capricious exercise" 
of the discretion of the prison or executive authorities, the hope of release 
would be "too faint and much too unpredictable" for the prisoner to retain 
the dignity required by section 8. It was also observed that life 
imprisonment could amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment if it 
was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offence. The High Court 
of Namibia found mandatory minimum sentences for robbery and 
possession of firearms to be grossly disproportionate in State v. Vries 1997 
LRC 1 and State v Likuwa [2000] 1 LRC 600. 
155. In Lau Cheong and Another v. HKSAR [2002] 5 HKCFAR 415, 
[2002] 2 HKLRD 612, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal rejected a 
challenge to the mandatory life sentence for murder. It found that the 
EFTA00031783
--- PAGE 52 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
possibility of regular review of the sentence by an independent board meant 
it was neither arbitrary nor grossly disproportionate and thus it did not 
amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. 
156. Section 9 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 also protects 
against disproportionately severe treatment or punishment. 
THE LAW 
I. JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS 
157. Given their similar factual and legal background, the Court decides 
that the applications of the first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants 
should be joined pursuant to Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court. 
Having regard, however, to the nature of the facts and the substantive 
issues raised by the second applicant, particularly in relation to his 
complaint concerning detention at ADX Florence, the Court considers that it 
is not appropriate to join his application but to treat it separately. 
II. ARTICLE 3 AND THE EXTRADITION 
158. The applicants made two complaints in relation to their proposed 
extradition. First, they complained that, if convicted in the United States, 
they would be detained at ADX Florence and, furthermore, would be 
subjected to special administrative measures (SAMS). They submitted that 
conditions of detention at ADX Florence (whether alone or in conjunction 
with SAMS) would violate Article 3 of the Convention. Second, the 
applicants complained that, if convicted, they would face sentences of life 
imprisonment without parole and/or extremely long sentences of 
determinate length in violation of Article 3 of the Convention. 
159. Article 3 provides: 
"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment." 
160. The Government contested each of these arguments. 
161. However, before turning to the merits of each of these complaints, 
it is necessary for the Court to consider the submissions of the parties as to 
the relevance, if any, of the extradition context to complaints made under 
Article 3 of the Convention, as well as the parties' submissions as to the 
appropriate forum for the applicants' prosecution. Those submissions may 
be summarised as follows. 
EFTA00031784
--- PAGE 53 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
A. The Government 
162. The Government relied on the reasoning of the House of Lords in 
Wellington and the Canadian Supreme Court in Bums and Ferras (see 
paragraphs 66-72, 74 and 75 above). On the basis of those cases, the 
Government submitted that, in the extradition context, a distinction had to 
be drawn between torture and other forms of ill-treatment. A real risk of 
torture in the receiving State should be an absolute bar on extradition. 
However, for all other forms of ill-treatment, it was legitimate to consider 
the policy objectives pursued by extradition in determining whether the 
ill-treatment reached the minimum level of severity required by Article 3. 
This was the appropriate means of resolving the tension that existed 
between the Court's judgments in Soering, on the one hand, and Chahal and 
Saadi, on the other. Article 3 could not be interpreted as meaning that any 
form of ill-treatment in a non-Contracting State would be sufficient to 
prevent extradition. Such an absolutist approach to Article 3 would mean, 
for instance, that practices such as head shaving or shackling could act as a 
bar to extradition because the Court had found these forms of ill-treatment 
to be in breach of Article 3 (see Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, §§ 114-
121, ECHR 2003-XII (extracts); and Henaf v. France, no. 65436/01, §§ 45-
89, ECHR 2003-XI). 
163. The Government did not accept the applicants' submission that the 
possibility of prosecution in the United Kingdom was relevant in 
determining whether their extradition was compatible with Article 3. This 
submission appeared to be based on the Court's judgment in Soering, where 
the Court had found that the possibility of trial in the Federal Republic of 
Germany was "a circumstance of relevance" in its overall assessment under 
Article 3 (paragraph 110 of the judgment). However, the facts of Soering 
were wholly exceptional. Both the United States and the Federal Republic 
of Germany had jurisdiction and the Federal Republic itself had submitted 
that extradition to the United States would breach the applicant's 
Convention rights. In any event, there were no domestic proceedings under 
way in the United Kingdom for any of the applicants and they could not be 
prosecuted in the United Kingdom for the full range and gravamen of the 
conduct alleged against them. The prosecutions were more properly brought 
in the United States. In any event, the possibility of prosecution in the 
United Kingdom could only be relevant if the Court were to follow the 
relativist approach of the House of Lords in Wellington, which the 
applicants had urged the Court not to do. 
B. The applicants 
164. The applicants rejected the submission that Article 3 allowed for a 
balancing exercise of any kind. The Court had specifically rejected that 
EFTA00031785
--- PAGE 54 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
submission in Saadi, cited above. Even if, in extradition cases, a relativist 
approach could be taken in respect of ill-treatment which fell short of 
torture, this was irrelevant to their case because, in their submission, years 
of solitary confinement at ADX amounted to torture or, at the very least, 
was at the upper end of the scale of ill-treatment (see further below). 
Furthermore, none of the policy reasons for taking a relativist approach to 
ill-treatment arising from life sentences could apply to ill-treatment arising 
from prison conditions. Detention at ADX was not mandated by United 
States law and the United States could give an undertaking not to detain the 
applicants there. Thus, the alternative to detention at ADX was not that they 
would be fugitives from United States justice, but rather that they would be 
detained in American prisons which were Article 3 compliant. 
165. The United Kingdom was the appropriate forum for prosecution of 
each applicant and it had jurisdiction to try them. For the first and third 
applicants, the link with the United States was that one of the servers for the 
website they had run had been based in Connecticut for eighteen months. 
The case against them was based on material seized in searches of premises 
in the United Kingdom, which the police had immediately handed to the 
United States' authorities. The fourth applicant had been the subject of a 
Metropolitan Police investigation but had never been charged. All the 
evidence against him came from materials seized during that investigation. 
The criminal conduct of the fifth and sixth applicants was alleged to have 
taken place in their London offices. All witnesses were in the United 
Kingdom and, as with the other applicants, all relevant evidence had been 
obtained there. The applicants submitted that the fact that the United 
Kingdom could prosecute them compatibly with Article 3 was a general 
consideration in assessing the proportionality of their extradition and its 
consequences. 
C. The Court's assessment 
166. The Court begins by noting the parties' submissions as to the 
appropriate forum for prosecution. It observes, however, that the 
Government do not intend to prosecute the applicants for any of the 
offences for which their extradition is sought (cf. Soering, § 16, cited above, 
where the Federal Republic of Germany had, by its extradition request to 
the United Kingdom, indicated its intention to prosecute the applicant and, 
in addition, its extradition request had contained proof that German courts 
had jurisdiction to try the applicant). Consequently, the Court considers that 
the question of the appropriate forum for prosecution, and whether this is 
relevant to the Court's assessment under Article 3, does not therefore arise 
for examination in the present case. 
167. The Court further notes that the House of Lords in Wellington has 
identified a tension between Soering and Chahal, both cited above, which 
EFTA00031786
--- PAGE 55 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
calls for clarification of the proper approach to Article 3 in extradition 
cases. It also observes that the conclusions of the majority of the House of 
Lords in that case depended on three distinctions which, in their judgment, 
were to be found in this Court's case-law. The first was between extradition 
cases and other cases of removal from the territory of a Contracting State; 
the second was between torture and other forms of ill-treatment proscribed 
by Article 3; and the third was between the assessment of the minimum 
level of severity required in the domestic context and the same assessment 
in the extra-territorial context. It is appropriate to consider each distinction 
in turn. 
168. For the first distinction, the Court considers that the question 
whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 in another State 
cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State. The Court's own 
case-law has shown that, in practice, there may be little difference between 
extradition and other removals. For example, extradition requests may be 
withdrawn and the Contracting State may nonetheless decide to proceed 
with removal from its territory (see Muminov v. Russia, no. 42502/06, § 14, 
December 2008). Equally, a State may decide to remove someone who 
faces criminal proceedings (or has already been convicted) in another State 
in the absence of an extradition request (see, for example, Saadi v. Italy, 
cited above, and Bader and Kanbor v. Sweden, no. 13284/04, ECHR 
2005-XI). Finally, there may be cases where someone has fled a State 
because he or she fears the implementation of a particular sentence that has 
already been passed upon him or her and is to be returned to that State, not 
under any extradition arrangement, but as a failed asylum seeker (see D. and 
Others v. Turkey, no. 24245/03, 22 June 2006). The Court considers that it 
would not be appropriate for one test to be applied to each of these three 
cases but a different test to be applied to a case in which an extradition 
request is made and complied with. 
169. For the second distinction, between torture and other forms of ill-
treatment, it is true that some support for this distinction and, in turn, the 
approach taken by the majority of the House of Lords in Wellington, can be 
found in the Soering judgment. The Court must therefore examine whether 
that approach has been borne out in its subsequent case-law. 
170. It is correct that the Court has always distinguished between torture 
on the one hand and inhuman or degrading punishment on the other (see, for 
instance, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 167, Series A 
no. 25; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, §§ 95-106, ECHR 1999-V). 
However, the Court considers that this distinction is more easily drawn in 
the domestic context where, in examining complaints made under Article 3, 
the Court is called upon to evaluate or characterise acts which have already 
taken place. Where, as in the extra-territorial context, a prospective 
assessment is required, it is not always possible to determine whether the ill-
treatment which may ensue in the receiving State will be sufficiently severe 
EFTA00031787
--- PAGE 56 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
as to qualify as torture. Moreover, the distinction between torture and other 
forms of ill-treatment can be more easily drawn in cases where the risk of 
the ill-treatment stems from factors which do not engage either directly or 
indirectly the responsibility of the public authorities of the receiving State 
(see, for example, D. v. the United Kingdom, 2 May 1997, Reports of 
Judgments and Decisions 1997-11I, where the Court found that the proposed 
removal of a terminally ill man to St Kitts would be inhuman treatment and 
thus in violation of Article 3). 
171. For this reason, whenever the Court has found that a proposed 
removal would be in violation of Article 3 because of a real risk of ill-
treatment which would be intentionally inflicted in the receiving State, it has 
normally refrained from considering whether the ill-treatment in question 
should be characterised as torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. For example, in Clutha! the Court did not distinguish between 
the various forms of ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3: at paragraph 79 of 
its judgment the Court stated that the "Convention prohibits in absolute 
terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". In 
paragraph 80 the Court went on to state that: 
"The prohibition provided by Article 3 against ill-treatment is equally absolute in 
expulsion cases. Thus, whenever substantial grounds have been shown for believing 
that an individual would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to 
Article 3 if removed to another State, the responsibility of the Contracting State to 
safeguard him or her against such treatment is engaged in the event of expulsion ..." 
Similar passages can be found, for example, in Mcunatladov and Askarov 
v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I and Saadi 
v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, § 125, ECHR 2008-... where, in reaffirming this 
test, no distinction was made between torture and other forms of ill-
treatment. 
172. The Court now turns to whether a distinction can be drawn between 
the assessment of the minimum level of severity required in the domestic 
context and the same assessment in the extra-territorial context. The Court 
recalls its statement in Chahal, cited above, § 81 that it was not to be 
inferred from paragraph 89 of Soering that there was any room for 
balancing the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons for expulsion in 
determining whether a State's responsibility under Article 3 was engaged. It 
also recalls that this statement was reaffirmed in Saadi v. Italy, cited above, 
§ 138, where the Court rejected the argument advanced by the United 
Kingdom Government that the risk of ill-treatment if a person is returned 
should be balanced against the danger he or she posed. In Saadi the Court 
also found that the concepts of risk and dangerousness did not lend 
themselves to a balancing test because they were "notions that [could] only 
be assessed independently of each other" (ibid. § 139). The Court finds that 
the same approach must be taken to the assessment of whether the minimum 
EFTA00031788
--- PAGE 57 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
level of severity has been met for the purposes of Article 3: this too can only 
be assessed independently of the reasons for removal or extradition. 
173. The Court considers that its case-law since Soering confirms this 
approach. Even in extradition cases, such as where there has been an Article 
complaint concerning the risk of life imprisonment without parole, the 
Court has focused on whether that risk was a real one, or whether it was 
alleviated by diplomatic and prosecutorial assurances given by the 
requesting State (see Olaechea Cahuas v. Spain, no. 24668/03, §§ 43 and 
44, 10 August 2006; Youb Saoudi v. Spain (dec.), no. 22871/06, 
September 2006; Salem v. Portugal (dec.), no. 26844/04, 9 May 2006; 
and Nivette v. France (dec.), no. 44190/98, ECHR 2001-VII). In those 
cases, the Court did not seek to determine whether the Article 3 threshold 
has been met with reference to the factors set out in paragraph 89 of the 
Soering judgment. By the same token, in cases where such assurances have 
not been given or have been found to be inadequate, the Court has not had 
recourse to the extradition context to determine whether there would be a 
violation of Article 3 if the surrender were to take place (see, for example, 
Soldatenko v. Ukraine, no. 2440/07, §§ 66-75, 23 October 2008). Indeed in 
the twenty-two years since the Soering judgment, in an Article 3 case the 
Court has never undertaken an examination of the proportionality of a 
proposed extradition or other form of removal from a Contracting State. To 
this extent, the Court must be taken to have departed from the approach 
contemplated by paragraphs 89 and 110 of the Soering judgment. 
174. Finally, the Court considers that, in interpreting Article 3, limited 
assistance can be derived from the approach taken by the Canadian Supreme 
Court in Burns and Ferras (see paragraphs 74 and 75 above). As the 
applicants have observed, those cases were about the provision of the 
Canadian Charter on fundamental justice and not the Charter's prohibition 
on cruel or unusual treatment or punishment. Furthermore, the Charter 
system expressly provides for a balancing test in respect of both of those 
rights, which mirrors that found in Articles 8-11 of the Convention but not 
Article 3 (see paragraph 73 above). 
175. Instead, the Court considers that greater interpretative assistance 
can be derived from the approach the Human Rights Committee has taken to 
the prohibition on torture and ill-treatment contained in Article 7 of the 
ICCPR. The Committee's General Comment No. 20 (see paragraph 76 
above) makes clear that Article 7 prevents refoulement both when there is a 
real risk of torture and when there is a real risk of other forms of ill-
treatment. Further, recent confirmation for the approach taken by the Court 
and by the Human Rights Committee can be found in Article 19 of the 
Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which provides that 
no one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a 
serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or 
other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (see paragraph 80 
EFTA00031789
--- PAGE 58 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
above). The wording of Article 19 makes clear that it applies without 
consideration of the extradition context and without distinction between 
torture and other forms of ill-treatment. In this respect, Article 19 of the 
Charter is fully consistent with the interpretation of Article 3 which the 
Court has set out above. It is also consistent with the Council of Europe 
Guidelines on human rights and the fight against terrorism, quoted at 
paragraph 79 above. Finally, the Court's interpretation of Article 3, the 
Human Rights Committee's interpretation of Article 7 of the ICCPR, and 
the text of Article 19 of the Charter are in accordance with Articles 3 and 
§ 2 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, particularly when 
the latter Article provides that the provisions of the Convention are "without 
prejudice to the provisions of any other international instrument or national 
law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or 
which relates to extradition or expulsion" (see paragraph 78 above). 
176. The Court therefore concludes that the Chahal ruling (as reaffirmed 
in Saadt) should be regarded as applying equally to extradition and other 
types of removal from the territory of a Contracting State and should apply 
without distinction between the various forms of ill-treatment which are 
proscribed by Article 3. 
177. However, in reaching this conclusion, the Court would underline 
that it agrees with Lord Brown's observation in Wellington that the absolute 
nature of Article 3 does not mean that any form of ill-treatment will act as a 
bar to removal from a Contracting State. As Lord Brown observed, this 
Court has repeatedly stated that the Convention does not purport to be a 
means of requiring the Contracting States to impose Convention standards 
on other States (see, as a recent authority, Al-Skeini and Others v. the United 
Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, § 141, 7 July 2011). This being so, treatment 
which might violate Article 3 because of an act or omission of a Contracting 
State might not attain the minimum level of severity which is required for 
there to be a violation of Article 3 in an expulsion or extradition case. For 
example, a Contracting State's negligence in providing appropriate medical 
care within its jurisdiction has, on occasion, led the Court to find a violation 
of Article 3 but such violations have not been so readily established in the 
extra-territorial context (compare the denial of prompt and appropriate 
medical treatment for HIV/AIDS in Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, §§ 
145-158, 22 December 2008 with N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], 
no. 26565/05, 27 May 2008). 
178. Equally, in the context of ill-treatment of prisoners, the following 
factors, among others, have been decisive in the Court's conclusion that 
there has been a violation of Article 3: 
- the presence of premeditation (Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited 
above, § 167); 
EFTA00031790
--- PAGE 59 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
- that the measure may have been calculated to break the applicant's 
resistance or will (ibid, § 167; Ilafcit and Others v. Moldova and Russia 
[GC], no. 48787/99, § 446, ECHR 2004-VH); 
- an intention to debase or humiliate an applicant, or, if there was no such 
intention, the fact that the measure was implemented in a manner which 
nonetheless caused feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority (Jalloh v. 
Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 82, ECHR 2006-IX; Peers v. Greece, no. 
28524/95, § 75, ECHR 2001-III); 
- the absence of any specific justification for the measure imposed (Van 
der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, §§ 61-62, ECHR 2003-II; 
lwaticzuk v. Poland, no. 25196/94, § 58, 15 November 2001); 
- the arbitrary punitive nature of the measure (see Yankov, cited above, 
§ 117); 
- the length of time for which the measure was imposed (Ireland v. the 
United Kingdom, cited above, § 92); and 
- the fact that there has been a degree of distress or hardship of an 
intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention 
(Mathew v. the Netherlands, no. 24919/03, §§ 197-205, ECHR 2005-IX). 
The Court would observe that all of these elements depend closely upon 
the facts of the case and so will not be readily established prospectively in 
an extradition or expulsion context. 
179. Finally, the Court reiterates that, as was observed by Lord Brown, it 
has been very cautious in finding that removal from the territory of a 
Contracting State would be contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. It has 
only rarely reached such a conclusion since adopting the Chahal judgment 
(see Saadi, cited above § 142). The Court would further add that, save for 
cases involving the death penalty, it has even more rarely found that there 
would be a violation of Article 3 if an applicant were to be removed to a 
State which had a long history of respect of democracy, human rights and 
the rule of law. 
III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION 
ARISING FROM CONDITIONS AT ADX FLORENCE 
A. The admissibility of the fifth and sixth applicants' complaints 
180. The Court recalls that, in its admissibility decision of 6 July 2010, it 
declared admissible the first, second and third applicant's complaints 
concerning detention at ADX Florence and the imposition of special 
administrative measures post-trial. It declared inadmissible the fourth 
applicant's similar complaint, on the grounds that his medical condition 
meant he was unlikely to spend any more than a short period of time at 
ADX Florence (see paragraphs 144 and 145 of the decision). 
EFTA00031791
--- PAGE 60 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
181. The Court finds the fifth and sixth applicant's complaints in 
relation to ADX Florence and the imposition of special administrative 
measures post-trial to be indistinguishable from those made by the first and 
third applicants. Therefore, the fifth and sixth applicant's complaints are not 
manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3(a) of the 
Convention. The Court notes that they are not inadmissible on any other 
grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible. 
B. Merits 
I. The parties' submissions 
a. The Government 
182. The Government recalled that the applicants were suspected of 
terrorism and the Council of Europe Guidelines on human rights and the 
fight against terrorism had recognised that such persons could be subjected 
to more severe restrictions than those applied to other prisoners (see 
paragraph 114 above). The Court had also recognised that prohibitions on 
contact and communication for security reasons did not of themselves 
amount to inhuman treatment or punishment. The Government accepted that 
such restrictions could not amount to complete sensory isolation and could 
not be imposed indefinitely. However, in assessing the nature of solitary 
confinement, factors to be taken into account included the physical 
conditions of confinement and the possibility of visits. 
183. On this basis, and in the light of the evidence provided by the ADX 
officials and the Department of Justice (see paragraphs 82-96 above), the 
applicants' complaints were unsustainable. The physical conditions of 
detention at ADX were compatible with Article 3 as interpreted by the 
Court. Even in the highest security units at ADX, there were opportunities 
for communication with other inmates, recreation, education, religious 
expression and engagment with the outside world. The mental and social 
needs of inmates were appropriately catered for and inmates could not be 
described as being detained in conditions that amounted to sensory 
isolation, still less indefinite solitary confinement, whether total or relative. 
The evidence, particularly the Department of Justice's replies to the 
Rapporteur's questions, showed that there were practical and effective 
opportunities to enter the step down and special security unit programs, 
which could ultimately lead to transfer to another prison. Moreover, initial 
placement at ADX was determined by reference to stated, objective criteria, 
with full procedural protections through the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 
Administrative Remedy Program. 
EFTA00031792
--- PAGE 61 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
184. The Bureau of Prisons had shown itself willing and able to respond 
to requests for change in conditions, not least the relaxation of conditions in 
H Unit to allow phase three inmates to eat together, the expansion of Arabic 
language books in the library, and the discontinuation of strip searches 
before inmates could leave their cells. All of these factors meant conditions 
at ADX Florence were distinguishable from C.B. v. Bulgaria, no. 42346/98, 
March 2004 and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, ECHR 2001-1II and, in 
fact, were much less severe than in Ramirez Sanchez v. France [GC], 
no. 59450/00, ECHR 2006-IX, where the Court had found no violation of 
Article 3. 
185. Finally, inmates had recourse to the courts to challenge their 
conditions of detention (see the summary of relevant Eighth Amendment 
jurisprudence set out at paragraph 105-110 above). A detailed examination 
of the federal courts' consideration of the challenges brought by ADX 
inmates, showed that the allegations made in respect of ADX were 
unfounded, and that the United States' courts applied a legal analysis which 
was in reality no different from that applied by this Court. Moreover, these 
decisions showed that the United States were both able and willing to 
protect the interests of ADX inmates, assess their claims and uphold them 
where appopriate. The Government also stated that, within the materials 
provided by the applicants, the Court could only properly place reliance on 
the decisions of the United States courts, rather than the untested statements 
of inmates at ADX or reports based upon them. Among these decisions, the 
Government placed particular emphasis on the conclusions reached by the 
Magistrate Judge in Rezaq (summarised at paragraph 112 above). They also 
continued to rely on the accuracy, fairness and good faith of the declarations 
which had been provided to the Court by the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
officials. 
b. The applicants 
L The first, third, fifth and sixth applicants 
186. The above applicants invited the Court to proceed on the basis that, 
if convicted, they would be detained at ADX Florence and subjected to 
special administrative measures. They also adopted the submissions of the 
third party interveners that the Eighth Amendment did not offer equivalent 
protection to Article 3 (see paragraph 197 below). 
187. The applicants invited the Court to consider that, throughout their 
detention in the United Kingdom, they had never been considered 
physically dangerous and were being held in much less stringent conditions 
than those at ADX. For instance, the first applicant was being held in a unit 
were he was never shackled, spent nine hours outside his cell every day and 
participated in common activities with other prisoners, which included 
educational classes, cooking for themselves and tending a vegetable garden. 
EFTA00031793
--- PAGE 62 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
He also had weekly "open" visits with his family (sitting in a large hall 
without intervening glass screens). Even if he were to be convicted in the 
United Kingdom and classified as a High Risk Category A prisoner (which 
he was not) his conditions of detention would be less restricted and he 
would enjoy access to even more educational, religious, sport and 
recreational facilities than at present. Many of these activities would involve 
association with large groups of prisoners. 
188. In respect of the procedures for placement at ADX, the applicants 
relied on the evidence they had submitted which showed that the criteria for 
placement at ADX Florence was subjective, the transfer hearing was mere 
window dressing, and inmates had great difficulty in challenging the 
imposition of special administrative measures. Even on Mr Synsvoll's 
evidence (see paragraph 89 above) the Bureau of Prisons was at the mercy 
of the wishes of other Department of Justice agencies such as the FBI, 
meaning that the measures could not be challenged through its 
Administrative Remedy Program. In the applicants' submission, these faults 
in the Bureau's procedures meant that the ADX regime did not comply with 
the procedural requirements for solitary confinement which the Court had 
laid down in Onoufriou v. Cyprus, no. 24407/04, § 70, 7 January 2010. 
189. The applicants further submitted that, having regard to the Court's 
case-law and the international materials summarised at paragraphs 114— 121 
above, the conditions of detention at ADX amounted to solitary 
confinement of an indefinite duration and did not comply with the 
substantive requirements of Article 3. 
190. All ADX Florence prisoners who were subjected to special 
administrative measures were detained at H Unit. It was a place of almost 
complete social isolation. Communication between inmates and with the 
outside world was severely curtailed and at the total discretion of the 
authorities. Contact with prison staff was minimal, as was telephone contact 
with the outside world. Educational activities and library access were 
limited and confined to in-cell activity. Recreation alone in an empty cage 
was not recreation in any meaningful sense and recreation periods were 
frequently cancelled. 
191. The very fact of being subjected to special administrative measures 
meant H Unit inmates were not eligible for the step down program. The 
program itself was highly capricious. Admission was at the discretion of 
staff and inmates could be returned to their original unit at any stage for a 
disciplinary violation or other undefined reason without explanation or due 
process. This might include something as minor as a disrespectful attitude to 
staff. As Professor Rovner had observed, despite the increase in the number 
of inmates admitted to the step down program, it remained a minority of 
inmates who progressed through it; significant numbers of inmates spent 
extremely long periods of time at ADX and, in the case of terrorist inmates, 
they could spent up to thirteen years in solitary confinement before being 
EFTA00031794
--- PAGE 63 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
admitted to the program. Other inmates with good conduct records had 
spent years but had never been admitted to the program. 
192. The applicants also submitted that the scientific evidence on the 
detrimental effect of solitary confinement on mental health was unequivocal 
(see paragraph 99 above) and not disputed by the Government, yet the 
solitary confinement regime in place at ADX failed entirely to recognise the 
serious harm it caused to its inmates' mental health. The regime failed to 
provide mental healthcare which was appropriate to the very serious needs 
of the patient-inmates. Even on Dr Zohn's evidence, those with serious 
mental health problems such as schizophrenia were detained at ADX 
Florence. 
193. In this connection, the first, third and fifth applicants provided the 
following information on their mental health. 
The first applicant had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress 
disorder, which had worsened in the prison unit where he was detained. 
The third applicant had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, 
recurrent depressive disorder (with his current episode assessed as "mild" as 
opposed to previous, severe depressive episodes), and obsessive compulsive 
disorder in conjunction with other anxiety symptoms. The latter had 
worsened in detention, though his depressive symptoms had improved. 
Before his Asperger syndrome had been diagnosed in June 2009, a 
psychiatrist had predicted a high risk of serious depression leading to 
suicide if the third applicant were to be extradited and placed in solitary 
confinement for a long period. The third applicant also submitted a 
statement prepared by an American criminologist, detailing the heightened 
difficulties experienced by those with Asperger syndrome in federal prisons 
and the absence of proper facilities within the Bureau of Prisons to treat the 
condition. 
The fifth applicant had a recurrent depressive disorder and had suffered 
several mental breakdowns while in detention in the United Kingdom. His 
most recent psychiatrist's report assessed his current episode as moderate to 
severe. The recommended treatment was medication with psychological 
treatment and support, including productive activity, opportunities for 
interaction with others and exercise. 
ii. The fourth applicant 
194. The fourth applicant asked the Court to reconsider its decision to 
declare his complaint under this heading inadmissible, which it had done on 
the grounds that, as a result of his medical conditions (see paragraph 37 
above), there was no real risk of his spending anything more than a short 
period of time at ADX Florence. The fourth applicant submitted a letter 
from Professor Andrew Coyle of the International Centre for Prison Studies, 
who had given evidence in the fourth applicant's domestic proceedings. The 
letter, dated 1 February 2011, noted that the fourth applicant continued to be 
EFTA00031795
--- PAGE 64 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
detained in the United Kingdom in a non-medical facility, subject to a 
comprehensive health and social care plan and regular daily support. 
Professor Coyle stated that, because the United Kingdom prison authorities 
saw no need to transfer the fourth applicant to a medical setting, the United 
States prison authorities might have regard to this fact and conclude that he 
could be held at ADX Florence rather than a Bureau of Prison's medical 
facility. The fourth applicant also submitted evidence that one Arab Muslim 
who had been convicted of terrorism offences, Omar Abdel Rahman, had 
been detained at ADX Florence, despite severe heart problems, blindness 
and diabetes. When his condition worsened, Abdel Rahman was transferred 
to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, 
Missouri and thereafter to a Federal Medical Centre at Butner, North 
Carolina. He continued to rely on the fact that his disabilities would 
exacerbate any ill-treatment inherent in detention at ADX Florence. 
195. The fourth applicant submitted that, even if he were not detained at 
ADX Florence, if he were subjected to special administrative measures, 
detention at a Bureau of Prisons medical facility could be at least as 
restrictive as detention at ADX and could involve the same degree of 
solitary confinement as at ADX. Thus, even if there were no risk of 
detention at ADX, there was still a real risk of ill-treatment contrary to 
Article 3 at another facility. 
196. The fourth applicant also submitted that the Eighth Amendment did 
not offer equivalent protection to Article 3. The Supreme Court of the 
United States had only recently (and by narrow majorities) decided that it 
was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment on 
minors (Roper and Graham, cited above) and it was clear that, in respect of 
interrogation techniques used at Guantanamo Bay, the United States did not 
adopt the same definitions of torture and other forms of ill-treatment as this 
Court. 
c. The third party interveners 
197. The third party interveners (see paragraph 7 above) submitted that 
there was a substantial gap between the protection offered by Article 3 of 
the Convention and the protection offered by the Eighth Amendment. 
Article 3 did not require an applicant to show deliberate imposition of pain 
or deliberate indifference to it (Alver v. Estonia, no. 64812/01, § 55, 
November 2005; Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, §§ 74-75, ECHR 
2001-III), whereas this was a specific requirement in order to show a 
violation of the Eighth Amendment (the subjective test set out in Wilson: 
see paragraph 105 above). Article 3 also provided much greater protection 
against mental suffering and psychological harm arising from conditions of 
detention (Mathew v. the Netherlands, no. 24919/03, §§ 197-205, ECHR 
2005-IX and Hunimatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, § 121, 
November 2007); the United States courts did not even consider a 
EFTA00031796
--- PAGE 65 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
significant deterioration of a detainee's mental condition to be sufficient for 
an Eighth Amendment violation unless there was also a deprivation of basic 
physical needs such as food, shelter, clothing or warmth (see Hill and 
Magluta, cited at paragraph 110 above). 
198. Limited protection was provided by the due process clause of the 
Fifth Amendment (see paragraph 109 above). Indeed, the Tenth Circuit's 
construction of that clause provided no additional protection to the Eighth 
Amendment. The Wilkinson case (see also paragraph 109 above) only 
required the barest administrative review of the decision to place an inmate 
in a supermax prison and the procedures could be informal and non-
adversarial without any requirement for a judge or neutral arbiter. Prison 
officials could continue to rely on the initial reasons for placement, 
including the crime for which the inmate was in prison. The wide discretion 
afforded to officials, the deference afforded by the courts, and the vague 
criteria for placement at ADX (and for entry to the step down program) 
meant there was no meaningful review at all. 
199. There were also significant procedural obstacles to prisoners 
seeking to vindicate their constitutional rights through the federal courts. 
The Prison Litigation Reform Act 1996 barred prisoners from bringing 
court claims if all administrative remedies had not been exhausted, a rule 
which had been enforced strictly by the courts to prevent otherwise 
compelling cases from proceeding. The Act prevented prisoners from 
receiving compensation for mental and emotional injuries unless they also 
showed physical injury, even in respect of official conduct which was 
deliberately and maliciously intended to harm. The Act further allowed 
prison officials to seek to terminate a court order in favour of a prisoner 
after the order had been in force for two years. 
2. The Court's assessment 
a. General principles 
L Article 3 and detention 
200. As the Court has frequently stated, Article 3 of the Convention 
enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic society. It 
prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim's behaviour 
(see, among other authorities, Lobito v. Italy [GC], no 26772/95, § 119, 
ECHR 2000-IV; A.B. v. Russia, no. 1439/06, § 99, 14 October 2010). 
201. In order to fall under Article 3, ill-treatment must attain a minimum 
level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level is relative; it 
depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the 
treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the state of 
EFTA00031797
--- PAGE 66 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 
162, Series A no. 25, and Gafgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 88, 
ECHR 2010-...). Although the question whether the purpose of the 
treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into 
account, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a 
finding of violation of Article 3 (see Peers, cited above, § 74). 
202. For a violation of Article 3 to arise from an applicant's conditions 
of detention, the suffering and humiliation involved must go beyond that 
inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form 
of legitimate treatment or punishment (see Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, 
§ 56, ECHR 2009-...). Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often 
involve an element of suffering or humiliation. However, the State must 
ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with 
respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution 
of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the 
unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the 
practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are 
adequately secured (see Kudla v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, §§ 92-94158, 
ECHR-XI, and Cenbauer v. Croatia, no. 73786/01, § 44, ECHR 2006-HI; 
A.B. v. Russia, cited above, § 100). 
203. When assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of 
the cumulative effects of these conditions, as well as of specific allegations 
made by the applicant (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, § 46, ECHR 
2001-II). The length of the period during which a person is detained in the 
particular conditions also has to be considered (see, among other authorities, 
Ciorap v. Moldova, no. 12066/02, § 64, 19 June 2007; Alver v. Estonia, no. 
64812/01, 8 November 2005; Ostrovar v. Moldova, no. 35207/03, § 79, 
September 2005). 
204. In addition to these general principles, the following principles are 
relevant to the present case. 
ii. Solitary confinement 
205. The circumstances in which the solitary confinement of prisoners 
will violate Article 3 are now well-established in the Court's case-law. 
206. Complete sensory isolation, coupled with total social isolation, can 
destroy the personality and constitutes a form of inhuman treatment which 
cannot be justified by the requirements of security or any other reason 
(Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, § 51, ECHR 2003-II). 
207. Other forms of solitary confinement which fall short of complete 
sensory isolation may also violate Article 3. Solitary confinement is one of 
the most serious measures which can be imposed within a prison (A.B. v. 
Russia, cited above, § 104) and, as the Committee for the Prevention of 
Torture has stated, all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate 
mental and physical stimulation are likely, in the long term, to have 
EFTA00031798
--- PAGE 67 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
damaging effects, resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and social 
abilities (see lorgov v. Bulgaria, no. 40653/98, § 83, II March 2004) 
Indeed, as the Committee's most recent report makes clear, the damaging 
effect of solitary confinement can be immediate and increases the longer the 
measure lasts and the more indeterminate it is (see the Committee's 21M 
General Report, summarised at paragraph 116 above). 
208. At the same time, however, the Court has found that the prohibition 
of contact with other prisoners for security, disciplinary or protective 
reasons does not in itself amount to inhuman treatment or punishment (see 
Messina v. Italy (no. 2) (dec.), no. 25498/94, ECHR 1999-V, quoted with 
approval by the Grand Chamber in Ramirez Sanchez v. France, cited above, 
§ 12; Ocalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 191, ECHR 2005-IV). In 
many States Parties to the Convention more stringent security measures, 
which are intended to prevent the risk of escape, attack or disturbance of the 
prison community, exist for dangerous prisoners (see, Ramirez Sanchez v. 
France [GC], no. 59450/00, § 138, ECHR 2006-IX; and, as recent 
examples, Alboreo v. France, no. 51019/08, § 110, 20 October 2011 [not 
yet final] and Madonia v. Italy (dec.), no. 1273/06, 22 September 2009). 
209. Thus, whilst prolonged removal from association with others is 
undesirable, whether such a measure falls within the ambit of Article 3 of 
the Convention depends on the particular conditions, the stringency of the 
measure, its duration, the objective pursued and its effects on the person 
concerned (see Rohde v. Denmark, no. 69332/01, § 93, 21 July 2005). 
210. In applying these criteria, the Court has never laid down precise 
rules governing the operation of solitary confinement. For example, it has 
never specified a period of time, beyond which solitary confinement will 
attain the minimum level of severity required for Article 3 (see Madonia, 
cited above). The Court has, however, emphasised that solitary 
confinement, even in cases entailing relative isolation, cannot be imposed 
on a prisoner indefinitely (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, §§ 136 
and 145, where the applicant was held in solitary confinement for eight 
years and two months). 
211. Equally, although it is not for the Court to specify which security 
measures may be applied to prisoners, it has been particularly attentive to 
restrictions which apply to prisoners who are not dangerous or disorderly 
(see, for example, A.B. v. Russia, cited above, § 105 and CsiiHog v. 
Hungary, no. 30042/08, § 36, 7 June 2011); to restrictions which cannot be 
reasonably related to the purported objective of isolation (see Csii1158, cited 
above, § 34,); and to restrictions which remain in place after the applicant 
has been assessed as no longer posing a security risk (see, for example, 
Khider v. France, no. 39364/05, §§ 118 and 119 , 9 July 2009). 
212. Finally, in order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness resulting from a 
decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement, the decision must be 
accompanied by procedural safeguards guaranteeing the prisoner's welfare 
EFTA00031799
--- PAGE 68 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
and the proportionality of the measure. First, solitary confinement measures 
should be ordered only exceptionally and after every precaution has been 
taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules. Second, 
the decision imposing solitary confinement must be based on genuine 
grounds both ab initio as well as when its duration is extended. Third, the 
authorities' decisions should make it possible to establish that they have 
carried out an assessment of the situation that takes into account the 
prisoner's circumstances, situation and behaviour and must provide 
substantive reasons in their support. The statement of reasons should be 
increasingly detailed and compelling as time goes by. Fourth, a system of 
regular monitoring of the prisoner's physical and mental condition should 
also be put in place in order to ensure that the solitary confinement 
measures remain appropriate in the circumstances (Onoufriou, cited above, 
§ 70). Lastly, it is essential that a prisoner should be able to have an 
independent judicial authority review the merits of and reasons for a 
prolonged measure of solitary confinement (Ramirez Sanchez v. France, 
cited above, § 145 above; A.B. v. Russia, cited above, § Ill). 
iii. Recreation and outdoor exercise in prison 
213. Of the elements relevant for the assessment of the conditions of 
detention, special attention must be paid to the availability and duration of 
outdoor exercise and the conditions in which prisoners may take it. The 
Court has frequently observed that a short duration of outdoor exercise 
limited to one hour a day was a factor that further exacerbated the situation 
of the applicant, who was confined to his cell for the rest of the time without 
any kind of freedom of movement (see Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v. Russia, no. 
41833/04, § 88, 27 January 2011; Gladkiy v. Russia, no. 3242/03, § 69, 21 
December 2010, § 69, Skachkov v. Russia, no. 25432/05, § 54, 7 October 
2010). 
214. The physical characteristics of outdoor exercise facilities also 
featured prominently in the Court's analysis. In Moiseyev v. Russia, the 
exercise yards in a Moscow prison were just two square metres larger than 
the cells and hardly afforded any real possibility for exercise. The yards 
were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with an opening to the sky 
protected with metal bars and a thick net. The Court considered that the 
restricted space coupled with the lack of openings undermined the facilities 
available for recreation and recuperation (see Moiseyev v. Russia, 
no. 62936/00, § 125, 9 October 2008). The Court examined the 
characteristics of outdoor exercise in Mandie and Jovio v. Slovenia, nos. 
5774/10 and 5985/10, 20 October 2011. The Court found that the 
applicants' situation (in overcrowded conditions) was further exacerbated 
by the fact that they were confined to their cell day and night, save for two 
hours of daily outdoor exercise, and an additional two hours per week in the 
recreation room. As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it was hard to 
EFTA00031800
--- PAGE 69 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any 
meaningful way. It was true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, 
listen to radio and read books in the cell. The Court found, however, that 
this could not make up for the lack of possibility to exercise or spend time 
outside the overcrowded cell (see paragraph 78 of the judgment). 
iv Detention and mental health 
215. The Court has held on many occasions that the detention of a 
person who is ill may raise issues under Article 3 of the Convention and that 
the lack of appropriate medical care may amount to treatment contrary to 
that provision (see Slawomir Musial v. Poland, no. 28300/06, § 87, 
January 2009 with further references therein). In particular, the 
assessment of whether the particular conditions of detention are 
incompatible with the standards of Article 3 has, in the case of mentally ill 
persons, to take into consideration their vulnerability and their inability, in 
some cases, to complain coherently or at all about how they are being 
affected by any particular treatment. The feeling of inferiority and 
powerlessness which is typical of persons who suffer from a mental disorder 
calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has (or 
will be) complied with. There are three particular elements to be considered 
in relation to the compatibility of an applicant's health with his stay in 
detention: (a) the medical condition of the prisoner, (b) the adequacy of the 
medical assistance and care provided in detention, and (c) the advisability of 
maintaining the detention measure in view of the state of health of an 
applicant (ibid. and Dybeku v. Albania, no. 41153/06, § 41, 18 December 
2007). 
b. Application of the general principles to the facts of the case 
L The case of the fourth applicant 
216. The Court turns first to the case of the fourth applicant, who asks 
the Court to reconsider its decision to declare his complaint in respect of 
ADX inadmissible. The Court will only re-examine complaints which have 
been declared inadmissible in exceptional circumstances where a clear 
mistake has been made either in the establishment of facts that are relevant 
to the admissibility requirements or in the Court's assessment (Ohnez and 
Ohnez v. Turkey (dec.), no. 39464/98, 5 July 2005). 
217. Those circumstances do not obtain in the fourth applicant's case. 
Indeed, as the letter from Professor Coyle recognises, the fourth applicant is 
not detained in a medical facility but is subject to a comprehensive health 
and social care plan and regular daily support. On the basis of the 
information provided by the parties as to the regime at ADX, the Court does 
not consider that it would be possible for such a plan, or such regular 
support, to be provided at ADX. It may well be that, as the fourth applicant 
EFTA00031801
--- PAGE 70 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
submits, Omar Abdel Rahman was detained at ADX Florence, despite 
severe heart problems, blindness and diabetes. However, the fourth 
applicant's disabilities are much more severe, not least the fact that both his 
forearms have been amputated. This fact alone would appear to make 
detention at ADX impossible. The Court therefore refuses the fourth 
applicant's request. 
ii. The cases of the first, third fifth and sixth applicants. 
218. For the above applicants, the Government have accepted that, 
although detention at ADX would not be inevitable if they were extradited 
and convicted in the United States, there is a real risk of detention there. The 
Court will proceed on this basis. 
219. In considering whether detention at ADX would violate Article 3, 
the Court observes that it does not appear to be in dispute that physical 
conditions at ADX Florence — that is, the size of cells, the availability of 
lighting and appropriate sanitary facilities and so on 
— meet the 
requirements of Article 3. Instead, the complaints made by the applicants 
are principally directed first, at the alleged lack of procedural safeguards 
before placement at ADX and second, at ADX's restrictive conditions and 
lack of human contact. 
220. For the first, the Court finds no basis for the applicants' submission 
that placement at ADX would take place without any procedural safeguards. 
The evidence submitted by the United States' authorities shows that not all 
inmates who are convicted of international terrorism offences are housed at 
ADX. Therefore, while it may well be the case that, as Professor Rovner 
states, inmates convicted of terrorism offences were sent to ADX soon after 
September 2001 (despite years of good conduct in other, less secure 
federal prisons), the applicants have not shown that they would be detained 
at ADX merely as a result of conviction for terrorism offences. Instead, it is 
clear from the declarations submitted by the Government, particularly that 
of Mr Milusnic, that the Federal Bureau of Prisons applies accessible and 
rational criteria when deciding whether to transfer an inmate to ADX. 
Placement is accompanied by a high degree of involvement of senior 
officials within the Bureau who are external to the inmate's current 
institution. Their involvement and the requirement that a hearing be held 
before transfer provide an appropriate measure of procedural protection. 
There is no evidence to suggest that such a hearing is merely window 
dressing. Even if the transfer process were unsatisfactory, there would be 
recourse to both the Bureau's administrative remedy programme and the 
federal courts, by bringing a claim under the due process clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment, to cure any defects in the process. Despite the third 
party interveners' submission that recourse to the courts is difficult, the fact 
that Fourteenth Amendment cases have been brought by inmates at ADX 
shows that such difficulties can be overcome. 
EFTA00031802
--- PAGE 71 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
221. For the second complaint, ADX's restrictive conditions, it is true 
that the present applicants are not physically dangerous and that, as the 
Court has observed at paragraph 211 above, it must be particularly attentive 
to any decision to place prisoners who are not dangerous or disorderly in 
solitary confinement. However, as the applicants' current detention in high 
security facilities in the United Kingdom demonstrates, the United States' 
authorities would be justified in considering the applicants, if they are 
convicted, as posing a significant security risk and justifying strict 
limitations on their ability to communicate with the outside world. There is 
nothing to indicate that the United States' authorities would not continually 
review their assessment of the security risk which they considered the 
applicants to pose. As Ms Rangel has indicated, the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons has well-established procedures for reviewing an inmate's security 
classification and carrying out reviews of that classification in six-monthly 
program reviews and three-yearly progress reports. Moreover, as the 
Department of Justice's most recent letters show, the United States' 
authorities have proved themselves willing to revise and to lift the special 
administrative measures which have been imposed on terrorist inmates thus 
enabling their transfer out of ADX to other, less restrictive institutions (see 
paragraph 97 above). 
222. The Court also observes that it is not contested by the Government 
that conditions at ADX Florence are highly restrictive, particularly in the 
General Population Unit and in phase one of the Special Security Unit. 
It is clear from the evidence submitted by both parties that the purpose of 
the regime in those units is to prevent all physical contact between an 
inmate and others, and to minimise social interaction between inmates and 
staff. This does not mean, however, that inmates are kept in complete 
sensory isolation or total social isolation. Although inmates are confined to 
their cells for the vast majority of the time, a great deal of in-cell stimulation 
is provided through television and radio channels, frequent newspapers, 
books, hobby and craft items and educational programming. The range of 
activities and services provided goes beyond what is provided in many 
prisons in Europe. Where there are limitations on the services provided, for 
example restrictions on group prayer, these are necessary and inevitable 
consequences of imprisonment (see, mutatis mutandis, Dickson v. the 
United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, § 68, ECHR 2007-V). The restrictions 
are, for the most part, reasonably related to the purported objectives of the 
ADX regime (cf. CsiiHog, cited above, concerning unnecessary restrictions, 
such as a prohibition on tea-bags and books). 
The Court also observes that the services provided by ADX are 
supplemented by regular telephone calls and social visits and by the ability 
of inmates, even those under special administrative measures, to correspond 
with their families. The extent of those opportunities would be of 
EFTA00031803
--- PAGE 72 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
considerable assistance to the applicants who would, by their extradition, be 
separated from their families in the United Kingdom. 
The Court finds that there are adequate opportunities for interaction 
between inmates. While inmates are in their cells talking to other inmates is 
possible, admittedly only through the ventilation system. During recreation 
periods inmates can communicate without impediment. Indeed, as 
Mr Milusnic indicates, most inmates spend their recreation periods talking 
(see his declaration at paragraph 85 above). 
In addition, although it is of some concern that outdoor recreation can be 
withdrawn for periods of three months for seemingly minor disciplinary 
infractions, the Court places greater emphasis on the fact that, according to 
Mr Milusnic, inmates' recreation has only been cancelled once for security 
reasons and that the periods of recreation have been increased from five to 
ten hours per week. 
All of these factors mean that the isolation experienced by ADX inmates 
is partial and relative (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 135). 
223. The Court would also note that, as it emphasised in Ramirez 
Sanchez, cited above, § 145, solitary confinement, even in cases entailing 
relative isolation, cannot be imposed indefinitely. If an applicant were at 
real risk of being detained indefinitely at ADX, then it would be possible for 
conditions to reach the minimum level of severity required for a violation of 
Article 3. Indeed, this may well be the case for those inmates who have 
spent significant periods of time at ADX. However, the figures provided by 
the United States' authorities, although disputed by the applicants, show 
that there is a real possibility for the applicants to gain entry to the step 
down or special security unit programs. First, the Department of Justice's 
letter of 26 September 2011 shows that while there were 252 inmates in 
ADX's General Population Unit, 89 inmates were in the step down 
program. The figures provided in that letter for the special security unit 
program, when compared with the November 2010 figures given by 
Mr Milusnic, demonstrated that inmates are progressing through that 
program too. Second, Ms Rangel's declarations show that inmates with 
convictions for international terrorism have entered the step down program 
and, in some cases, have completed it and been transferred to other 
institutions. Ms Rangel's declaration is confirmed by the Rezaq et a! v. 
Nalley et a/ judgment of the District Court where the petitioners, all 
convicted international terrorists, had brought proceedings to obtain entry to 
the step down program but, by the time the matter came to judgment, had 
completed the program and been transferred elsewhere (see paragraph 112 
above). 
224. Finally, to the extent that the first, third and fifth applicants rely on 
the fact that they have been diagnosed with various mental health problems, 
the Court notes that those mental health conditions have not prevented their 
being detained in high-security prisons in the United Kingdom. On the basis 
EFTA00031804
--- PAGE 73 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
of Dr Zohn's declaration, it would not appear that the psychiatric services 
which are available at ADX would be unable to treat such conditions. The 
Court accordingly finds that there would not be a violation of Article 3 in 
respect of these applicants in respect of their possible detention at ADX. 
IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 ARISING FROM THE 
APPLICANTS' POSSIBLE SENTENCES 
A. The admissibility of the fifth and sixth applicants' complaints 
225. The first, third and fourth applicants' complaints under this head 
were declared admissible by the Court in its decision of 6 July 2010. The 
fifth and sixth applicants' complaints are indistinguishable from those made 
by the first, third and fourth applicants; those complaints are not, therefore, 
manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3(a) of the 
Convention. The Court notes that they are not inadmissible on any other 
grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible. 
B. Merits 
I. The parties' submissions 
a. The Goverment 
226. The Government relied on the Court's rulings in Kafkaris and 
Liger v. France, no. 19324/02, ECHR 2006-..., and the United Kingdom 
court's rulings in Wellington and Bieber (see paragraphs 64-72 and 144 
above). In particular, they submitted that, in Wellington, the House of Lords 
had been correct to find that, while an irreducible life sentence might raise 
an issue under Article 3, it would not violate Article 3 at the time of its 
imposition unless it was grossly or clearly disproportionate. 
227. The Government further submitted that, unless a life sentence was 
grossly or clearly disproportionate, an irreducible life sentence would only 
violate Article 3 if the prisoner's further imprisonment could no longer be 
justified for the purposes of punishment and deterrence (see Wellington, 
cited above). No court could determine at the outset of the sentence when 
that point would be reached and, in a particular case, it might never be 
reached at all. Therefore, in the extradition context, unless a life sentence 
was grossly or clearly disproportionate, its compatibility with Article 3 
could not be determined in advance of extradition. 
228. In the present cases, none of the six applicants' sentences were 
grossly disproportionate and all the sentences were reducible, as required by 
EFTA00031805
--- PAGE 74 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
Kafkaris.The Government referred to the four mechanisms for sentence 
reduction outlined in the Department of Justice's letter of 26 November 
2010 (see paragraph 130 above): substantial assistance to the authorities in 
the investigation of a third party, recommendation for compassionate release 
by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, commutation of the sentence by 
the President or pardon, reduction of the sentence based on the the 
sentencing guidelines which were subsequently lowered. In 
the 
Government's submission, the first three mechanisms separately and all 
four mechanisms cumulatively, were more than sufficient to establish that 
any life sentence imposed on the applicants would be both de jure and de 
facto reducible. 
229. The Government observed that the first, third, fourth and fifth 
applicants only faced the possibility of discretionary life sentences. In this 
respect, the Court of Appeal in Bieber had correctly concluded that this 
Court would not find a violation of Article 3 if an irreducible life sentence 
was deliberately imposed by a judge, when that judge considered that the 
offence was so serious that punishment and deterrence required the offender 
to spend the rest of his days in prison (see paragraph 45 of Bieber, quoted at 
paragraph 144 above). In the Government's view, this was especially so 
when a discretionary life sentence by its very nature avoided the risk of 
arbitrariness of mandatory life sentences. Accordingly, given the serious 
nature of the allegations made against these applicants, and the full range of 
protections available in the United States (including the Eighth 
Amendment's protection from grossly disproportionate sentences), there 
were no substantial grounds for believing that the imposition of 
discretionary life sentences would violate Article 3. 
230. For the sixth applicant, the Government submitted that, as a general 
principle, a mandatory and irreducible life sentence would not violate 
Article 3, especially if it were imposed on an adult offender following 
conviction for an offence of the utmost severity. Under United States federal 
law a mandatory life sentence was reserved for a narrow category of 
offenders and the most serious criminal conduct. Given, therefore, that any 
mandatory life sentence (even if, for present purposes, it were irreducible) 
would only be imposed on the sixth applicant if he were convicted of 
participation in an act which had caused a massive loss of life, such a 
sentence would not be grossly disproportionate. 
b. The applicants 
231. The applicants submitted that a violation of Article 3 would arise, 
not just because their sentences would in practice be irreducible, but also 
because the sentences were grossly disproportionate. Their likely sentences 
were, in effect, mandatory sentences which left no room for consideration of 
their individual cases. They relied on the views expressed by the House of 
Lords and Privy Council in Lichniak, Reyes, de Boucherville, as well as the 
EFTA00031806
--- PAGE 75 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
rulings in Dodo, Philibert, and Tcoeib (see paragraphs 142, 149 and 151-
154 above). They also relied on academic materials detailing the inhumane 
and degrading effects sentences of life imprisonment without parole had on 
prisoners, particularly in the United States.' In their cases, the effects would 
be exacerbated by the requirement that they serve the sentences at ADX 
Florence and by the already poor mental health of some of the applicants. 
232. It was not correct that, as the Government had suggested, no 
Article 3 issue could arise in respect of discretionary life sentences imposed 
by a judge. As Ms Barrett's evidence showed (see paragraph 133 above), 
United States trial judges had a limited sentencing discretion and the 
sentencing guidelines called for any offence involving terrorism to be 
punished by the available statutory maximum sentence. Therefore, it was 
highly likely that, where applicable, life sentences would be imposed. 
Moreover, it was not necessary for a life sentence to be mandatory for it to 
be disproportionate and thus in violation of Article 3. Several of the 
applicants risked life sentences for non-murder offences; in those 
circumstances, their sentences would be disproportionate because they 
could be imposed for non-murder offences without any real judicial 
discretion. 
233. The applicants did not accept that the four reduction mechanisms 
relied on by the Government meant that their sentences would be de facto 
reducible. Proper regard had to be given to the practical realities of their 
situation. First, they were not in a position to provide "substantial 
assistance" to the authorities. Second, compassionate release would only 
arise if they became terminally ill and, even then, the Bureau might not 
exercise its discretion in favour of release. In any event, hope of release to 
die of a terminal illness outside prison was not real hope of release. Third, 
release as a result of a change in the sentencing guidelines was speculative, 
did not automatically led to reductions, and would not apply if other, 
consecutive sentences were imposed. Finally, there was no record of any 
presidential pardon or commutation for a terrorism offence; the pardons 
issued in respect of the FALN were not comparable. 
234. The extradition context was relevant insofar as any applicant 
sentenced to life imprisonment in a Contracting State could bring repeated 
applications to the Court complaining about his or her continued 
incarceration; by contrast, the present applicants had no means of 
challenging their incarceration once extradited. It was not correct, therefore, 
that an Article 3 issue could only arise after a substantial part of the 
sentence had been served and continued detention served no purpose (cf. 
I. Johnson and McGunigall-Smith, "Life Without Parole, America's Other Penalty: Notes 
on Life Under Sentence of Death by Incarceration" 2008 Prison Journal 88; Appleton and 
Grover, "The Pros and Cons of Life Without Parole" 2007 47:4 British Journal of 
Criminology 597-615; Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch The Rest of their 
Lives: Life without Parole for Child Offenders in the United States, 2005. 
EFTA00031807
--- PAGE 76 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
Bieber and Wellington, cited above); an Article 3 issue could also arise at 
the time when the sentence was imposed. Moreover, it was irrelevant at 
what point a violation of Article 3 would arise in the United States: the 
principled approach which the Court had always taken to Article 3 meant 
that, whenever a risk of ill-treatment in the receiving State was clear and 
foreseeable, there would be a violation of Article 3. 
2. The Court's assessment 
a. General considerations 
235. The Court takes note of the parties' submissions as to whether the 
applicants' likely sentences are irreducible within the meaning of that term 
used in Kaftans. However, given the views expressed by the House of 
Lords in Wellington and the Court of Appeal in Bieber in respect of 
Kaftans (summarised at paragraphs 64-72 and 144 above), the Court 
considers it necessary to consider first whether, in the context of removal to 
another State, a grossly disproportionate sentence would violate Article 3 
and second, at what point in the course of a life or other very long sentence 
an Article 3 issue might arise. 
236. For the first issue, the Court observes that all five Law Lords in 
Wellington found that, in a sufficiently exceptional case, an extradition 
would be in violation of Article 3 if the applicant faced a grossly 
disproportionate sentence in the receiving State. The Government, in their 
submissions to the Court, accepted that proposition. 
Support for this proposition can also be found in the comparative 
materials before the Court. Those materials demonstrate that "gross 
disproportionality" is a widely accepted and applied test for determining 
when a sentence will amount to inhuman or degrading punishment, or 
equivalent constitutional norms (see the Eighth Amendment case-law 
summarised at paragraphs 134-136 above, the judgments of the Supreme 
Court of Canada at paragraph 148 above, and the further comparative 
materials set out at paragraphs 151— 156 above). 
237. Consequently, the Court is prepared to accept that while, in 
principle, matters of appropriate sentencing largely fall outside the scope of 
the Convention (Leger, cited above, § 72), a grossly disproportionate 
sentence could amount to ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 at the moment 
of its imposition. However, the Court also considers that the comparative 
materials set out above demonstrate that "gross disproportionality" is a strict 
test and, as the Supreme Court of Canada observed in Latimer (see 
paragraph 148 above), it will only be on "rare and unique occasions" that 
the test will be met. 
238. The Court also accepts that, in a removal case, a violation would 
arise if the applicant were able to demonstrate that he or she was at a real 
risk of receiving a grossly disproportionate sentence in the receiving State. 
EFTA00031808
--- PAGE 77 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
However, as the Court has recalled at paragraph 177 above, the Convention 
does not purport to be a means of requiring the Contracting States to impose 
Convention standards on other States. Due regard must be had to the fact 
that sentencing practices vary greatly between States and that there will 
often be legitimate and reasonable differences between States as to the 
length of sentences which are imposed, even for similar offences. The Court 
therefore considers that it will only be in very exceptional cases that an 
applicant will be able to demonstrate that the sentence he or she would face 
in a non-Contracting State would be grossly disproportionate and thus 
contrary to Article 3. 
239. The Court now turns to the second issue raised by the Court of 
Appeal and House of Lords. It considers that, subject to the general 
requirement that a sentence should not be grossly disproportionate, for life 
sentences it is necessary to distinguish between three types of sentence: (i) a 
life sentence with eligibility for release after a minimum period has been 
served; (ii) a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment without the 
possibility of parole; and (iii) a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole. 
240. The first sentence is clearly reducible and no issue can therefore 
arise under Article 3. 
241. For the second, a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole, the Court observes that normally such 
sentences are imposed for offences of the utmost severity, such as murder or 
manslaughter. In any legal system, such offences, if they do not attract a life 
sentence, will normally attract a substantial sentence of imprisonment, 
perhaps of several decades. Therefore, any defendant who is convicted of 
such an offence must expect to serve a significant number of years in prison 
before he can realistically have any hope of release, irrespective of whether 
he is given a life sentence or a determinate sentence. It follows, therefore, 
that, if a discretionary life sentence is imposed by a court after due 
consideration of all relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, an Article 3 
issue cannot arise at the moment when it is imposed. Instead, the Court 
agrees with the Court of Appeal in Bieber and the House of Lords in 
Wellington that an Article 3 issue will only arise when it can be shown: 
(i) that the applicant's continued imprisonment can no longer be justified 
on any legitimate penological grounds (such as punishment, deterrence, 
public protection or rehabilitation); and (ii) as the Grand Chamber stated in 
Kaflcaris, cited above, the sentence is irreducible de facto and de lure. 
242. For the third sentence, a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole, the Court considers that greater scrutiny is 
required. The vice of any mandatory sentence is that it deprives the 
defendant of any possibility to put any mitigating factors or special 
circumstances before the sentencing court (see, for instance, Reyes and de 
Boucherville at paragraphs 151 and 152 above). This is no truer than for a 
EFTA00031809
--- PAGE 78 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a 
sentence which, in effect, condemns a defendant to spend the rest of his 
days in prison, irrespective of his level of culpability and irrespective of 
whether the sentencing court considers the sentence to be justified. 
However, in the Court's view, these considerations do not mean that a 
mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is 
per se incompatible with the Convention, although the trend in Europe is 
clearly against such sentences (see, for example, the comparative study 
summarised at paragraph 138 above). Instead, these considerations mean 
that such a sentence is much more likely to be grossly disproportionate than 
any of the other types of life sentence, especially if it requires the sentencing 
court to disregard mitigating factors which are generally understood as 
indicating a significantly lower level of culpability on the part of the 
defendant, such as youth or severe mental health problems (see, for 
instance, Hussain v. the United Kingdom and Prem Singh v. the United 
Kingdom, 
judgments of 
February 
1996, Reports 
1996-I 
at 
paragraphs 53 and 61 respectively and the Canadian case of Bums, at 
paragraph 93, quoted at paragraph 74 above). 
The Court concludes therefore that, in the absence of any such gross 
disproportionality, an Article 3 issue will arise for a mandatory sentence of 
life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in the same way as for a 
discretionary life sentence, that is when it can be shown: (i) that the 
applicant's continued imprisonment can no longer be justified on any 
legitimate penological grounds; and (ii) that the sentence is irreducible de 
facto and de lure (Kafkaris, cited above). 
b. The present cases 
243. The Court now turns to the facts of each case. It is convenient first 
to consider the cases of the first, third, fourth and sixth applicants who face, 
at most, discretionary life sentences. 
First, the Court observes that it is by no means certain that, if extradited, 
these applicants would be convicted of the charges against them. If they are, 
it is also by no means certain that discretionary life sentences would be 
imposed, particularly when none of the charges they face carries a 
mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Nonetheless, the Court 
considers that it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that discretionary life 
sentences are possible. 
Second, it is necessary to consider whether such sentences would be 
grossly disproportionate. In this connection the Court observes that, while 
the offences with which these applicants are charged vary, all of them 
concern involvement in or support for terrorism. Given the seriousness of 
terrorism offences (particularly those carried out or inspired by Al-Qaeda) 
and the fact that the life sentences could only be imposed on these 
applicants after the trial judge considered all relevant aggravating and 
EFTA00031810
--- PAGE 79 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
mitigating factors, the Court considers that discretionary life sentences 
would not be grossly disproportionate in their cases. 
Third, as the Court has observed, in respect of a discretionary life 
sentence, an Article 3 issue will only arise when it can be shown: (i) that the 
applicant's continued incarceration no longer serves any legitimate 
penological purpose; and (ii) the sentence is irreducible de facto and de lure. 
Given that none of these applicants has been convicted, still less has begun 
serving any sentences which might be imposed upon conviction (cf. 
Kafkaris and Leger, cited above, and lorgov v. Bulgaria (no. 2), 
no. 36295/02, 2 September 2010), the Court considers that they have not 
shown that, upon extradition, their incarceration in the United States would 
not serve any legitimate penological purpose. Indeed, if they are convicted 
and given discretionary life sentences, it may well be that, as the 
Government have submitted, the point at which continued incarceration 
would no longer serve any purpose may never arise. It is still less certain 
that, if that point were ever reached, the United States' authorities would 
refuse to avail themselves of the mechanisms which are available to reduce 
their sentences (see paragraph 130 above and Kafkaris, cited above, § 98). 
Accordingly, the Court finds that these applicants have not demonstrated 
that there would be a real risk of treatment reaching the threshold of Article 
as a result of their sentences if they were extradited to the United States. 
The Court therefore finds no violation of Article 3 in their cases. 
244. Finally, the Court turns to the case of the fifth applicant. He faces 
two hundred and sixty-nine counts of murder and thus multiple mandatory 
sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Court 
does not find a mandatory life sentence would be grossly disproportionate 
for such offences, particularly when the fifth applicant has not adduced any 
evidence of exceptional circumstances which would indicate a significantly 
lower level of culpability on his part. Indeed, if he is convicted of these 
charges, it is difficult to conceive of any mitigating factors which would 
lead a court to impose a lesser sentence than life imprisonment without the 
possibility of parole, even if it had the discretion to do so. Moreover, for the 
reasons it has given in respect of the first, third, fourth and sixth applicants, 
the Court considers that he has not shown that incarceration in the United 
States would not serve any legitimate penological purpose. Therefore, he 
too has failed to demonstrate that there would be a real risk of treatment 
reaching the threshold of Article 3 as a result of his sentence if he were 
extradited to the United States. Accordingly, the Court finds that there 
would be no violation of Article 3 in his case.

BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
V. THE 
FIFTH 
AND 
SIXTH 
APPLICANTS' 
REMAINING 
COMPLAINTS 
A. The remaining complaints 
245. In their initial application to the Court, the fifth and sixth applicants 
made ten further complaints. 
246. First, they alleged that the diplomatic assurances provided by the 
United States were not sufficient to remove the risk of their being removed 
from the federal criminal justice system and designated as enemy 
combatants in violation of Articles 3, 5, 6 and 8 of the Convention. In 
particular, they relied on the fact that one of their indicted co-accused, 
Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, was detained and brought before a Military 
Commission at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (where he was allegedly 
tortured) only to be later transferred to stand trial in a Federal District Court 
in New York. 
Second, they complained that the diplomatic assurances were not 
sufficient to remove the risk that they would be subjected to extraordinary 
rendition. 
Third, relying on Article 2 of the Convention the fifth applicant argued 
that, as a result of his recurrent depressive disorder, his extradition would 
carry an extremely high risk that he would commit suicide. 
Fourth, the fifth and sixth applicants complained that there was a real risk 
that they would be subjected to "special administrative measures" pre-trial 
in violation of Articles 3, 6, 8 and 14. 
Fifth, the applicants alleged that there would be a real risk of a flagrant 
denial of justice in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention because the 
extensive publicity which the United States Government's counter-terrorism 
efforts had attracted would prejudice any jury, particularly when they were 
to stand trial in New York. This would be exacerbated by the public 
controversy surrounding the President's decision to transfer other high 
profile terrorist suspects such as Khalik Sheikh Mohammed and Ahmed 
Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, from Guantanamo to New York for trial. 
Sixth, also under Article 6, the applicants argued that the case against 
them had been significantly weakened as new evidence had emerged in the 
course of their extradition proceedings. Notwithstanding this new evidence, 
their trial would be prejudiced by the fact that any jury would hear evidence 
linking them to a conspiracy to murder which involved Osama bin Laden 
and Al Qaeda. 
Seventh, the applicants argued that further prejudice would arise if CS/1, 
Mr Al-Fadl, were to give evidence when it was not clear what pressure had 
been put on him or inducements given to him by the prosecuting authorities 
in order to secure his testimony. 
EFTA00031812
--- PAGE 81 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
Eighth, the sixth applicant alleged that any jury in his case would be 
further prejudiced by the fact that he had been designated as a global 
terrorist by the President of the United States. 
Ninth, under Article 8 the applicants alleged that there would be a 
disproportionate interference with their private and family life in the United 
Kingdom if they were to be extradited. The first applicant relies on the fact 
that his extradition would result in permanent separation from his wife, 
children and grandchildren, who were all British residents. 
Tenth, the applicants alleged that there would be a violation of Article 13 
of the Convention if they were extradited as they would have no effective 
remedy for the violations of the Convention they would suffer in the United 
States. 
247. In making these complaints, the fifth and sixth applicants 
considered that it was of some relevance that, rather than extraditing them to 
the United States in violation of the Convention, it would be possible for 
them to be tried in the United Kingdom. The crimes of which they were 
accused were justiciable in the United Kingdom; the vast bulk of the 
evidence against them had been obtained by the United Kingdom authorities 
and the majority of defence witnesses were in the United Kingdom but 
would not travel to the United States to give evidence for fear of arrest; and, 
despite their representations as to what would happen to the applicants in 
the United States, the United Kingdom Government had failed to give 
proper consideration to prosecuting them in the United Kingdom. 
B. The Court's assessment 
248. The Court observes that the first and second complaints, which 
relate to an alleged risk of designation as enemy combatants and 
extraordinary rendition, are substantially the same as those made by the 
first, third and fourth applicants in their applications to the Court. Those 
complaints were rejected by the Court in its admissibility decision of 6 July 
2010: see paragraphs 104-110 and 113-116 of the decision. Having regard 
to the similar Diplomatic Notes provided by the United States in respect of 
the fifth and sixth applicants there is no basis to reach a different conclusion 
in their case. Accordingly, these complaints must be rejected as manifestly 
ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention. 
249. In respect of the third complaint, the fifth applicant's risk of 
suicide, the Court considers it appropriate to distinguish between the risk 
during pre-trial and post-trial periods of detention. 
In respect of the former, the Court notes that the first and third applicants 
complained that the imposition of special administrative measures pre-trial 
would have an adverse effect on their mental health. Insofar as they related 
to their possible conditions of pre-trial detention, the Court rejected those 
complaints as manifestly ill-founded. It found that it had not been suggested 
EFTA00031813
--- PAGE 82 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
that, prior to extradition, the United Kingdom authorities would not advise 
their United States counterparts of the applicants' mental health conditions 
or that, upon extradition, the United States' authorities would fail to provide 
appropriate psychiatric care to them. The Court also noted that it had not 
been argued that psychiatric care in United States federal prisons was 
substantially different to that provided at HMP Long Lartin (where the first 
and third applicants were being detained). There was also no reason to 
suggest that the United States' authorities would ignore any changes in the 
applicants' conditions or that, if they did present any suicidal tendencies or 
symptoms of self-harm, they would refuse to alter the conditions of their 
detention to alleviate any risk to them. 
The Court finds that similar considerations must apply in respect of the 
fifth applicant's complaint concerning his pre-trial detention. Accordingly, 
insofar as it relates to the risk of suicide before his trial would take place, 
the complaint must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded. Insofar as the 
complaint relates to the risk of suicide in post-trial detention at ADX 
Florence, the Court finds that no separate issue arises from the Article 3 
complaint considered above. 
250. The Court turns to the fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth complaints, 
which relate, respectively, to the imposition of special administrative 
measures pre-trial, the prejudicial effect of extensive pre-trial publicity, the 
prejudice arising from inducements or pressure placed on Mr Al-Fadl to 
testify against them, and the further prejudicial effect of the sixth applicant's 
designation as a global terrorist. The Court notes that similar complaints 
were made by the first, third and fourth applicants and rejected in the 
admissibility decision (paragraphs 125-135, 159-160, 163 and 166). There 
are no grounds to distinguish the fifth and sixth applicants' complaints 
under these headings and, accordingly, these complaints must also be 
rejected as manifestly ill-founded. 
251. As regards the sixth complaint, that the evidence had significantly 
weakened against the fifth and sixth applicants, the Court recalls that it is 
not its task to assess the evidence against an accused, still less, in an 
extradition case, to evaluate the strength of the requesting State's case 
against an applicant. This complaint must also be rejected as manifestly ill-
founded. 
252. For 
the 
ninth 
complaint, 
that 
extradition 
would 
a 
disproportionate inference with their family and private life in the United 
Kingdom, the Court reiterates that it will only be in exceptional 
circumstances that an applicant's private or family life in a Contracting 
State will outweigh the legitimate aim pursued by his or her extradition (see 
King v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 9742/07, 26 January 2010). There 
are no such exceptional circumstances in the fifth and sixth applicants' case, 
particularly given the gravity of the offences with which they are charged. 
This complaint is therefore manifestly ill founded. 
EFTA00031814
--- PAGE 83 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
253. Finally, since none of the above complaints are "arguable", no 
issues arise under Article 13 of the Convention. The tenth complaint is 
therefore also manifestly ill founded. 
254. The Court's conclusion in respect of the fifth and sixth applicant's 
ten further complaints make it unnecessary to consider what relevance, if 
any, should be attached to their submission that they could be prosecuted in 
the United Kingdom. 
VI. THE SECOND APPLICANT 
255. The Court notes that the second applicant has made similar 
submissions under Article 3 as to the length of his likely sentence and 
conditions at ADX Florence. For the latter, he has relied in particular on the 
fact that his schizophrenia necessitated his transfer from high security 
conditions at HMP Long Lartin to Broadmoor Hospital. There he has 
significant freedom within the security of the hospital and has participated 
in group activities as therapeutic measures. He is under the care of a 
consultant psychiatrist, who considers it necessary to continue his 
compulsory hospitalisation. 
256. The Court considers that it is not in a position to rule on the merits 
of the second applicant's complaints, particularly in respect of ADX 
Florence, but requires further submissions from the parties. For that reason, 
it decides to adjourn the examination of the second applicant's complaints. 
Those complaints will now be considered under a new application number, 
no. 17299/12. 
VII. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT 
257. The Court recalls that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the 
Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties 
declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand 
Chamber; or (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if referral of 
the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of 
the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the 
Convention. 
258. It considers that the indications made to the Government under 
Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see above § 4) must continue in force until 
the present judgment becomes final or until the Panel of the Grand Chamber 
of the Court accepts any request by one or both of the parties to refer the 
case to the Grand Chamber under Article 43 of the Convention. 
EFTA00031815
--- PAGE 84 ---
BABAR AHMAD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM JUDGMENT 
FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 
1. Joins the applications brought by the first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth 
applicants; 
2. Adjourns its examination of the application brought by the second 
applicant; 
3. Declares admissible the fifth and sixth applicants' complaints 
concerning detention at ADX Florence, the imposition of special 
administrative measures post-trial, and the length of their possible 
sentences, and the remainder of their applications inadmissible; 
4. Holds that there would be no violation of Article 3 of the Convention as 
a result of conditions at ADX Florence and the imposition of special 
administrative measures post-trial if the first, third, fifth and sixth 
applicants were extradited to the United States; 
5. Holds that there would be no violation of Article 3 of the Convention as 
a result of the length of their possible sentences if the first, third, fourth, 
fifth and sixth applicants were extradited to the United States; 
6. Decides to continue to indicate to the Government under Rule 39 of the 
Rules of Court that it is desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of 
the proceedings that the applicants should not be extradited until further 
notice. 
Done in English, and notified in writing on 10 April 2012, pursuant to 
Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.

Hello 
I hope you are doing great. This is the statement that 
it in? Should it be as a signed declaration? She is comfortable having it attributed to her name. 
"I appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this matter and once more request that 
Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of myself, but all of the other 
girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine Maxwell sexually abused me as a child and 
the government has the responsibility to make sure that she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will 
happen or that any of her victims will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, 
abusing her position of power to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would 
fit with her long history of anti-social behavior. 
would like to submit. What format would you like me to send 
EFTA00031821
--- PAGE 2 ---
Drawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of how she has lived since that time, 
I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children and young women is evidence of 
her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has demonstrated a complete failure to accept to 
responsibility in any way for her actions and demonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in 
procuring victims for Epstein. She was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, 
consistent with what many of her victims have described. She has frequently lied to others, including 
repeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle relying on Epstein 
and others to fund her lavish existence. 
Maxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her own welfare, and that she is willing to 
harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She will not hesitate to leave the 
country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially for her actions because she lacks 
empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others. She would in fact be highly motivated to flee 
in order to reduce the possibility of continued imprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously 
complained. Her actions over the last several years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that 
being comfortable is more important to her than being connected. Even more concerning, is if she is let out she 
has the ability to once again abuse children and the painful consequences of that type of trauma can last a 
lifetime. I implore the Court to make sure that Ghislaine Maxwell does not escape justice by keeping her 
incarcerated until her trial."

Hi 
We officially received the green light from the powers that be to add you as the "law guy" to the Maxwell team. We're 
thrilled to have you and are very excited to work with you! 
To start getting you up to speed, we'd like to schedule a call for this Thursday. I'm generally available from 12pm to 2pm 
and after 3:30pm on Thursday. Are there times in there that would work for you? 
In the meantime, I'll get you added to the share, and I've attached some of the key memos that you should read when you 
have time as an introduction to the case. 
Thanks very much for jumping on board!

Will, 
Apologies for piling on, but if you could please also make slides that have the following excerpts of the attached 
deposition testimony, that would be a huge help as well:

3) 
• 
The cover page of both days of testimony (so the caption and date shows) 
• 
The following five excerpts (I think you should be able to just control-F to locate): 
Q. 
Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls 
for sexual massages? If you know. 
A. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Q. 
List all the people under the age of 18 that you interacted 
with at any of Jeffrey's properties? 
A. 
I'm not aware of anybody that I interacted with, other than 
obviously  
who was 17 at this point. 
Q: Were you aware of the presence of sex toys or devices used in 
sexual activities in Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach house? 
EFTA00031836
--- PAGE 2 ---
A: ice, not that I recall. . . . 
Q. 
Do you know whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or 
devices used in sexual activities? 
A. 
No. 
4) 
Q. 
Other than yourself and the blond and brunette that you have 
identified as having been involved in three-way sexual 
activities, with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual 
activities? 
A. 
I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with 
anyone when I was with him other than myself. 
Q. 
I want to be sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that 
in the 1990s and 2000s, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein 
was having sexual activities with anyone other than yourself 
and the blond and brunette on those few occasions when they 
were involved with you? 
A. 
That is my testimony, that is correct. 
5) 
Q. 
Is it your testimony that you've never given anybody a 
massage? 
A. 
I have not given anyone a massages 
Q. 
You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your 
testimony? 
A. 
That is my testimony. 
Q. 
You never gave [Minor Victim-2] a massage is your testimony? 
A. 
I never gave  [Minor Victim-2]  a massagg, 
Thank you! Very much appreciated.

Fantastic, thanks! Attached is a sample slide for a model. All the slides will be this same format—the document is an 
excerpt from flight records. The records are attached — could you please make slides excerpting the records (and flagging 
the date) for the following flight dates:

November 11, 1996. 
• 
May 9, 1997 
• 
May 3, 1998

January 3, 1995

No need for any introductory material - I'll just drag these slides into my presentation once you prep them. Thanks a ton!

Thanks very much, 
This is persuasive — I read this, and I think we might have a real shot at detention. My 
comments and suggestions in track. Can you take a look, and unless there's stuff to discuss, can you send the next draft 
to the Brass, and feel free to note if you want that it is still rough/in the works, but that in the interests of giving 
everyone a chance to weigh in on the substance, in particular, we wanted to circulate sooner rather than later.

Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00031852
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00031853
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN 
FEDERAL COURT FOR CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilitated, Participated in Acts ofAbuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 
Depositions 
NEW YORK CITY — Audrey Strauss, the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern 
District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director in Charge of 
the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and 
Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), 
announced that Ghislane Maxwell was arrested this morning and charged with 
enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a 
minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to commit 
both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. 
The indictment unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 
through 1997, Maxwell and co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young 
as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the purpose 
of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference 
for young girls, Maxwell played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor 
victims that took place in locations including New York, Florida, and New 
Mexico. In addition, as alleged, Maxwell made several false statements in sworn 
depositions in 2016. Maxwell is expected to be presented this afternoon in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. 
Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell 
facilitated, aided, and participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell 
enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them into the trap 
that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could 
trust. All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, 
in some cases, Maxwell herself. Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell 
finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of 
children is among the most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like 
Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the law and her responsibility 
as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable 
youth into behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the 
potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for justice has been met with great 
disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered 
against the rich and connected, and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a 
subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery exhibited by the 
women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of 
which they've been subjected."

NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges 
allege are, and always will be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on 
victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement partners, for their 
continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, 
everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by 
Jeffrey Epstein, please contact the FBI at i-Soo-CALL FBI, and 
reference this case. 
According to the indictment[i] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, Ghislane Maxwell assisted, facilitated, 
and participated in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, 
helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to 
Maxwell and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14 
years old when they were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of 
whom knew that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of 
their scheme to abuse minor victims, Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused 
minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which Maxwell 
knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual 
abuse. 
As alleged, Maxwell enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple 
ways. For example, Maxwell attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them 
about their lives, taking them to the movies or taking them on shopping trips, and 
encouraging their interactions with Epstein. Maxwell also acclimated victims to 
Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, 
which put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult 
woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. Additionally, to make 
victims feel indebted to Epstein, Maxwell would encourage victims to accept offers 
of financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or 
educational expenses. Maxwell also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by 
discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage Epstein, and 
undressing in front of a victim. 
As Maxwell and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims 
vulnerable and susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. Maxwell was then present 
for certain sexual encounters between minor victims and Epstein, such as 
interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately Maxwell was 
present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included 
sexualized massages during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as 
well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor victim where 
Maxwell was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among 
other things, the touching of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a 
vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he 
masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. Maxwell and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, 
Florida, and New Mexico, as well as Maxwell's residence in London, England. 
EFTA00031865
--- PAGE 4 ---
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, Maxwell 
repeatedly made false statements, including about certain specific acts and events 
alleged in the indictment. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to 
engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in 
prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex 
acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which 
carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to 
transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, 
each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided 
here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be 
determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled b the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the 
prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant 
is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
EFTA00031876
--- PAGE 2 ---
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00031877
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and 
or

but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a

I apologize for the delay on this — I've added the relevant language about revocations to both the application and the 
order, and corrected a stray typo, so that stuff is good to go. But two quick things to note, not to belabor this, but — it 
doesn't look like there's any reference to the Trust Two documents — that may be because they're not referenced in any 
will? At a glance I don't see Trust Two in any of the wills, but I'd want to go back and look more thoroughly unless 
somebody already made the decision on that basis. And second, it references a 2019 Trust but I don't see any documents 
on that? I have to run out tonight but can certainly circle up with El and/or MI tomorrow on any of this, or just ignore 
it if I've misread.

Following up on this, I understand from 
that she was able to provide you with a 12 TB drive last week— could you 
please let us know when we will be able to get the materials? I expect a judge will ask us about discovery as early as this 
week. 
Also, the related critical question that I don't think we have clarity on is whether you're giving us a copy of everything that 
was collected (including reproducing the materials that you previously gave us, but which are not searchable), or have you 
and 
figured out a way to categorize the prior productions so they're useful for us? We would strongly prefer to just 
get everything at once in a usable format, but please let us know if you expect to produce materials differently than that.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong. 
thanks,

Understood, and thanks for letting us know. Let's keep in touch both on timing and also on whether there's a way to 
identify and categorize what's already been produced, or if we'll need to just get all the raw data at this stage and go from 
there.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

Separately, to follow up on a question from the May 15 email below, the list has just five devices as still pending to be

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
EFTA00031893
--- PAGE 6 ---
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
- 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
EFTA00031898
--- PAGE 11 ---
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give I= 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

I can do a call this afternoon. Any time between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. is best. Alternatively, I am available tomorrow 
during the same time period. Let me know which time is more convenient for you and your team. If these times don't 
work, let me know and we will work out an alternate time. 
In the meantime, we have all the materials in a secure room on our second floor in West Palm Beach. There are the case 
files and also boxes of files that were gathered for the OPR inquiry. We have an inventory of our materials and also OPR 
has their own inventory of the materials. 
When OPR was here earlier, we had a scanner on that floor dedicated for their exclusive use. They were able to scan the 
documents that they wanted and have those documents sent directly to their own DOJ accounts. I was overseas at the 
time on detail, but I was told that this worked rather well. 
A copy of our inventory is attached. 
I look forward to assisting you in this matter.

Preliminary Statement 
The issue before the Court, as it has been since Ms. Maxwell's first bail application, 
is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance at trial. 
On her third application (the "Third Bail Motion") (Dkt.I60), Ms. Maxwell has put before 
the Court significant enhancements to the already extraordinary bail package previously 
presented to the Court in her renewed application for bail (the "Second Bail Motion") 
(Dkt. 97),I Together, these two motions present a unique and comprehensive bail package 
with the strictest of conditions known in any bail application: 
• $28.5 million in bonds (including a $IM bond co-signed by a security 
company); 
• $9.5 million in real property; 
• $550,000 in cash; 
• Asset Monitoring by a retired federal district court judge; 
• Renunciation of British and French citizenship; 
• Irrevocable written waivers of the right to contest extradition; 
• Surrender of all travel documents; 
• Nome confinement in Ncw York City; 
• Electronic GPS monitoring; 
• In-residence third-party custodian;2
• On-premises 24/7 private security to prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the 
Ms. Maxwell's present motion (the "Third Bail Motion") (Dkt.160) incorporates her Memorandum in Support of 
Ha Renewed Motion for Bail and accompanying exhibits (Dkt. 97, including Attachments 1-24) and her Reply 
Memorandum in Support of Her Renewed Motion for Bail (Dkt. 103, including Attachments 1-2) (collectively, the 
"Second Bail Motion"). 
To assist Ms. Maxwell in making up for lost time preparing for her upcoming trial, one of her lawyers (not trial 
counsel) has agreed to reside with her and serve as an additional residential custodian. 
EFTA00031919
--- PAGE 3 ---
residence without pre-approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and to 
escort her when authorized to leave the residence; 
■ 
Visitors to be pre-approved by Pretrial Services: 
• Strict supervision by Pretrial Services; 
• Such other terms as the Court deems appropriate. 
The government goes to great lengths to oppose bail arguing technicalities and 
offering unfounded innuendo ripped from the tabloid headlines to avoid addressing the 
merits of Ms. Maxwell's exceptional bail package, which puts at risk everything she has, 
including the assets of her spouse and the financial security of her family and closest 
friends. 
The Court Retains Jurisdiction to Decide Matters Related to Bai( 
The government asserts that the Court should not consider the present bail motion 
because appeal of denial of the Second Bail Motion, not yet briefed, is pending before the 
Second Circuit. (Dkt. 165 at 2-3). It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it 
created this problem by opposing Ms. Maxwell's request for an enlargement of time to file a 
notice of appeal to the Court's denial of her Second Bail Motion. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell sought 
the extension to avoid this very issue. (Dkt. 109). The government should not now be allowed to 
turn that procedural sword into a jurisdictional shield to prevent the Court from considering the 
instant motion. 
Divestiture of jurisdiction in the district court while an appeal is pending is not a per sc 
rule. Rather, it is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial economy that is 
designed to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues before two 
courts at the same time. Divestiture of jurisdiction, therefore, should not be automatic, but 
instead guided by concerns of efficiency. Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a 
EFTA00031920
--- PAGE 4 ---
district court's decision regarding bail "divests the court of its control over aspects of the case 
involved in the appeal." United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996). Were it so, a 
district court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant 
released while the government appeals the grant of bait. Such a rule would detract from, rather 
than promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice. 
Should the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail 
motion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without 
prejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court's jurisdiction over the 
present bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits, 
Ms. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals. 
Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release 
Relying on a letter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the 
Court to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell's agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship. 
But the letter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The letter asserts that the loss of 
French nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have committed 
does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the 
time of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request. As discussed in 
the opinion from William Julie, French legal counsel (attached as Exhibit A), the 
government's assertion is entirely incorrect for the following reasons: 
• The government's argument goes against the letter of the law. 
• The government's argument goes against the spirit of the law. 
• The government's argument is contradicted by precedent and case law. 
(Julie Opinion ¶¶ 6-26). 
EFTA00031921
--- PAGE 5 ---
The language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the 
applicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of 
French citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request. (Id.1 II). 
The provisions on which the government relies were not intended to apply in cases where the 
person whose extradition is sought had lost French citizenship. To the contrary, it was 
designed to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the 
commission of the alleged crime "in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of 
offenders seeking to escape extradition." (Id. TO 15-16). If the person is no longer a French 
national at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites no case 
where the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition, 
and we have found none ourselves. (kill 19-21). By contrast, there are numerous examples 
of French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality following the 
commission of an offense. (Id. ¶ 21). Accordingly, Mr. Julio concludes: "[I]t cannot have been 
the intention of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person 
who has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from extradition." (Id. 
¶ 26). 
Ms. Maxwell's agreement to give up both British and French citizenship and waive 
any and all right to contest extradition is a fonnidable challenge to the assertion that Ms. 
Maxwell would likely flee if released from custody and goes above and beyond the 
"reasonable assurances" that the Bail Reform Act requires to grant bail. While we 
maintain that Ms. Maxwell's written waivers of the right to challenge extradition should 
suffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and 
profoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at 
trial. 
EFTA00031922
--- PAGE 6 ---
Monitoring of Assets is a Valid and Significant Condition of Relestsc 
To address the Court's concern about Ms. Maxwell's access to assets, the bail 
motion proposed another extremely significant and restrictive bail condition — the 
imposition of a monitor to supervise the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse and 
approve expenditures. Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the 
government urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship. 
William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United 
States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by 
the Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring 
funds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of 
the Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court 
and are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and 
approve disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been 
appointed by courts to oversee financial matters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same 
hourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb). 
The proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell's London home will be restrained and 
monitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the 
proceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the 
financial account approved by Judge Duffey. 
The government tries to steer the Court's attention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell's lack 
of candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful 
restraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse. As previously stated, despite being 
questioned by Pretrial Services following a period of solitary confinement, suicide watch, sleep 
EFTA00031923
--- PAGE 7 ---
deprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms. 
Maxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which 
were restricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial documents - collected and 
professionally vetted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submitted to the 
government and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning 
Ms. Maxwell's personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid 
challenge has been made to those submissions. 
The government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if "the only way to keep 
the defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too 
great a risk to release." (Dkt.165 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it 
undermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic 
monitoring — i.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place 
him on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to 
release.3 The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act, 
if there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions 
collectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that 
Ms. Maxwell will be present at trial. 
Moreover, in an effort to further obtliscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell's bail application, the government 
desperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in attorney escrow accounts, would be 
released and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would 
become accomplices to a violation of's court order shows utter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell's defense team. 
In particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district 
and establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government's 
callous assertion.

Conceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government's Case 
As Ms. Maxwell's period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has 
continuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a "plain [ J risk of flight" to a "substantial and 
actual risk of flight" to a "serious flight of risk" and now to an "extreme risk of flight." (Dkt. 
165 at 1.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government's case 
against her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government's case 
in pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has 
persuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in 
2007, which immunizes "any potential co-conspirators of Epstein," bars Ms. Maxwell's 
prosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are 
time-barred. 
The government's response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions shines further light 
of the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that 
either Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-34 to travel while she 
was a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein. 
(See Opp.162-65 & fn. 57-58.)5 Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged 
in the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against 
Ms. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government's response, it 
produced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to 
Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as "Minor Victim-3." 
-Opp." references are to page numbers of the Government's Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's 
Pre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2021 and not yet publicly flied.

obtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that 
undermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire 
prosecution. 
The ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the 
stale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government's concessions reveal that it 
failed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The 
passage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the 
purported strength of the government's case. 
Bail Must Be Granted 
The detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the lowest grade 
misdemeanor under New York Penal Law 130.556 — presented in a sensationalized 
indictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy' — 
is unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media 
coverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution. 
has increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell's continued 
detention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely 
undermine her presumption of innocence. 
In the face of this enhanced bail package, the government's claim that Ms. Maxwell 
poses "an extreme risk of flight" rings hollow. The government urges the Court to apply a 
standard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v. 
Counts Two and Four allege violations of New York Penal Law § 130.55 - sexual abuse in the third degree - a 
class B misdemeanor punishable by maximum penalties of three months in jail or one year probation. 
What other purpose could be served by the inclusion of a picture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein taken over a 
dozen years after the period of the conspiracy alleged and pictures of three high-value residences?

Ona, 760, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legalstandard requiredby the [Bail 
Reform) Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under the Bail 
Reform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are "no conditions" that would 
reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened 
by Ms. Maxwell's agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets 
monitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard. 
To find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old 
woman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made 
America her home for the past 30 years, and who has established strong roots and forged 
important connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The 
concerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say 
that renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal 
district court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by 
real property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic 
monitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms. 
Maxwell remains in custody — her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based 
on allegations that arc inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who 
arc not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength 
and concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her 
confinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for 
trial.s 
" Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing electronic discovery, including discs that can only be 
reviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on 
either the MDC computer or the laptop. Her receipt of legal mail — including pretrial motions, responses and replies 
— are constantly delayed even after tracking information confirms delivery to the MDC. The visiting rooms in the

Conclusion
The Court should grant bail for Ms. Maxwell on the extraordinary conditions 
proposed. Should the Court determine that additional conditions are necessary, Ms. 
Maxwell is willing to satisfy and abide by those terms as well.

East Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal 
Defenders of New York and have been characterized as a "death trap." The MDC claims it is in the process of 
installing HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms 
raised early in the pandemic. The alternative — to meet in the opearea where social visiting had been conducted-
affords no privacy for confidential attomercl lent communication, especially under constant oversight by Ms. 
Maxwell's guards and a hand-held camera focused on both Ms. Maxwell and counsel. Further, confidential 
attomeycl ient communications conducted during video teleconferencing (VTC) arc now further compromised by 
the repositioning of a camera with sensitive audio recording, putting a chill on privileged communication. During 
VTC conferences, counsel can hear conversation among the guards, so it is likely that the guards, who seem to be 
writing during those sessions, are able to hear discussions between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. Last night, prior to the 
filing of defense replies to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions, the MDC refused her request to speak with her lawyers 
to provide information bearing on those filings,. Such denial violates the BOP's Program Statement pertaining to 
providing legal calls upon request of pretrial inmates. See httas:i iwww bon.movicrolicyloroustati713 I 004,pdf at 
par. 24(c). The chronic difficulties related to Ms. Maxwell's review of the millions of documents of electronic 
discovery are continuing to negatively impact her ability to prepare for a trial that is only a few months away.

March 14th 2021 
Re: Additional opinion on the extradition of nationals by the French government 
This memorandum was written pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at 
the French firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as 
counsel for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell. The request was made in the context of ongoing bail 
proceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter "USA"), 
where Ms Maxwell is being detained pre-trial on charges relating to her alleged role in 
sexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from 1994 to 1997. 
2. In a previous opinion, I have outlined why French authorities could decide to execute 
an extradition request against a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between the 
USA and France, without violating any superior norm of French and international law. 
3. As I understand the defendant's French nationality continues to be regarded by the Court 
as a bar to her release pending trial, I am informed that the defendant is prepared to 
renounce French nationality under Article 23-4 of the French Civil Code, if the Court 
so requires. 
4. 
a letter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2021, the Head of the International 
Criminal Assistance Bureau of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe laegle, 
asserts that the loss of French nationality after the criminal act which the person is 
alleged to have committed does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, 
as nationality must be assessed at the time of commission of the offence and not at the 
time of the extradition request. 
5. This report was written to provide a counter opinion on this issue, in support of the 
proposition that the French government would be legally entitled to execute an 
extradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national. 
6. The Ministry of Justice's assertion must be regarded as incorrect for three reasons: 
(i) It is not supported by the letter of the law;

AVOCAT A LA COUR - ATTORNEY AT LAW 
(ii) Nor is it supported by the spirit of the law; 
(iii) Case law and precedents in fact suggest the opposite. 
7. First, the Ministry's interpretation goes against the letter of the law. 
8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty 
between the USA and France of 23 April 1996 ("the Treaty") and the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure for matters not dealt with under the Treaty. 
9. Article 3(1) of the Treaty provides: 
"There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person 
who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United 
States shall have the power to surrender a national of the United States if, in its 
discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be 
the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed". 
10. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule. 
under similar wording: 
"Extradition shall not be granted: 
1° When the person claimed has French nationality, the latter being assessed at the time 
of the offense for which extradition is requested" 
I I. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where 
French authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French 
national at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of 
I Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of 
America and the European Union s ivied in Washington on 25 June 2003, and the Instalment Amending the 
Treaty of 23 Apnl 1996 between the United States of Amok a and France signed in the Hague on 30 September 
2004.

Criminal Procedure use the present tense ("a person who is a national of the Requested 
State"/"the person claimed has French nationality"), which can only mean that the 
extradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national. If the 
person is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not 
apply. 
12. I-lad these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French 
nationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have 
expressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to 
qualify the national affiliation of the requested person. 
13. Furthermore, it is a well-known principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions 
that exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an 
exception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application 
to a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected. 
14. Second, the Ministry's interpretation goes against the spirit of the law 
15. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact 
not intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but 
only in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the 
commission of the alleged crime. 
16. In other words, the rule that "nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for 
which extradition is requested" seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French 
nationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after committing an 
offence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to 
escape extradition.

17. This concern over opportunistic nationality applications is precisely the justification of 
the rule mentioned in academic literature (see for example Repertoire de droll penal et 
de procedure penale Extradition Pa. - Conditions de fond de l'estradition 
Delphine Brach-Thiel-October 2t I 8„f59). 
18. Third, the French Ministry of Justice's interpretation is contradicted by precedents 
and case law 
19. The French Ministry of Justice's interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case 
can be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied 
to protect a formerly French national from extradition. 
20. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,1° of the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against 
an individual who had acquired French nationality after committing an offence, which 
is the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber 
of the French Cow de caseation on 4 January 2006, n°05-86.258). 
21. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the 
extradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where 
French authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French 
nationality. Both extradition and deportation allow for the removal of a person from 
French territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with 
the consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State. 
22. The European Court of Human Rights (the "ECtHR") treats extradition and deportation 
analogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars 
apply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party ("the Court 
considers that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 
in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State. The 
Court's own case-law has shown that, in practice, there may be little difference between

extradition and other removals", ECtHR 12 April 2012, Babar Ahmad and Others v. 
the United Kingdom, no. 24027/07, §168). 
23. France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by 
application of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may 
give rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen 
named Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of 
terrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality'. 
24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of 
prison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used 
to be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtIIR specifically prohibits 
State parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which 
they remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment'. Beghal 
was eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose 
of standing trial. In this case, the French government's decision to deprive Djamel 
Beghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allow for his removal from 
France, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were 
conceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time 
of the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to 
deported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated. 
25. In any case, the deportation of formerly French citizens shows that the loss of French 
nationality prevents any retroactive application of domestic provisions which are 
intended to protect French nationals, be it from deportation or extradition.

Jeffrey Epstein released from jail today: won't have electronic monitoring device during year's 
probation 
By MICHELE DARGAN

Tuesday, July 21, 2009 
liiddated 1:1:30 p.m. Wednesday 
Convicted sex offender Jeff-ey Epstein, released from jail 
shortly after 6 a m. Wednesday, will net be tracked by an 
electronic monitoring device during his one.year 
probation, according to a court order. 
Epstein, who served less than 13 months of his 18-month 
sentence at the Paim Beach County Stockade, will serve 
one year of probation al his El Brillo Way home. He 
already has registered as a sex offender. 
In addition, Epstein. who nas been out of jail on work 
release for 16 hours a day six days a week since 
October, has been going to his Palm Beach home as well 
as his West Palm Beach office for the past two weeks. 
His attorney. Jack Gcildbeiger, as well as Palm Beach 
County Sheriffs Office records confirm that Epstein has 
been to his home on several occasions Goldberger sad 
Epstein was gven PESO permission to be at home for 
specific time periods in order to make the transition from 
jail to his home 
The plea agreement stipulated that Epstein, a billionaire 
financier, would not be placed on electronic monitoring, 
Goldberger said An earlier court order incorrectly had 
him listed as having to be monitored.
"A very difficult part it his life is ending, and he is looking 
forward to moving on." Goldberger said.

"I'm scared to gc to Palm Beach because I'm afraid of seeing him out in public," said Doe No 
3, now 21. "They say, 'once a sex offender, always a sex offender.' What makes them think 
he won't do it again? I'm afraid for future victims I believe every one of his victims is grieving 
and the just ce system did rot do justice for his victims " 
Doe No 5 was 16 at the time of her one encounter She is new 22 and has a young caughter, 
whom she wants to protect 
"It's really upsetting to me," she said. "I'm scared. He's such a powerful man. and I don't know 
what he's capable of. I would have liked to see him get a 'onger jail term. He just got a slap cn 
the wrist and what he has done to all of us is never going to leave us." 
She said that she gets upset when she hears people accuse the victims of being al' about the 
money. 
"It's about getting justice," she said. 'He's acting like he's the victim and he walks away. I 
couldn't talk about it for a long time I have flashbacks. I thought 't was all my fault for a long

'We're outraged that a regste-ec sex offender has such a short sentence," Horowitz said 
"They put people in jail for longer periods of time for much lesser offenses. Through his guilty 
admission he has acknowledged that he's a sex offender Our clients have a life sentence of 
dealing with his abuse anc he gets a slap on the wrist." 
West Palm Beach attorney Spencer Kuvin represented Jane Doe No. 1. who has settled her 
lawsuit. Kuvin said he could not disclose the amount because of a confidentiality agreement. 
But he did say tat she didn't want to be in the public eye anymore.

If you're willing/open, perhaps we could just add her to April 1st, or let us know what you prefer. She is

Hi S 
(USANYS) 
I hope you're doing well. Ghislaine Maxwell is filing a renewed bail application on Monday, and we expect that the 
motion will raise issues relating to the possibility of extradition from France. Are you available for a call on Monday 
for a few questions? I know we discussed this issue over the summer, and it would be very helpful to ask a few 
follow up questions. 
Thanks very much,

Hey. 
As discussed, I reviewed all the travel records you sent. Unfortunately, the outbound travel records were not recorded in 
CBP database during that time (between 1990-2000) as they are today. In short, the TECS travel records you have for 
Maxwell and Epstein are all we have in CBP holdings so there's nothing further I can provide for that date range. However, 
if you want travel records beyond 2000 I can certainly provide that just let me know if you have a specific date range you 
looking for. 
Since 
has two different name variations (with and without the space in her surname) you were 
provided two separate TECS travel records. After reviewing both records, they are accurate and include all her travel 
crossings recorded in CBP holdings. Attached is an excel spreadsheet that includes her full travel crossings in chronological 
order for you to cross reference with the TECS records provided. Hopefully it will make it easier to review her travel rather 
than going back and forth between the two PDFs. 
If you need any additional info (visa/passport applications, travel records, etc.) or have any questions please don't hesitate 
to reach out!

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
DARREN INDYKE, et al., 
Defendants. 
DECLARATION OF 
No. 20 Civ. 484 (JGK) (DCF) 
declares under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1746 as follows: 
I. 
I submit this declaration in response to a subpoena dated June 10, 2020, from the 
plaintiff in this action, directing me to produce documents and appear for a deposition. I 
understand this declaration is being submitted in lieu of appearing for a deposition. 
2. 
Beginning in 1991, I worked as a pilot for Mr. Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") and 
Epstein-affiliated entities. 
3. 
Through flying for Mr. Epstein, I met Ms. 
. I do not recall when or 
where specifically I met Ms. 
for the first time, or the first flight she was on, but it was 
likely in the mid to late 1990s. 
4. 
I have attached as Exhibit A my flight logs from the time period between January 
1, 1994 and December 31, 1997. I made these records at or near the time of the flights reflected 
therein, they reflect my knowledge at that time, and it was my practice to regularly make such 
records during the 1994-1997 time period. With respect to the names in the "Remarks, 
EFTA00031984
--- PAGE 2 ---
Procedures, Maneuvers, Endorsements" column, my general practice during this time was to use 
this column to record the number of passengers on the plane. If I knew the passenger's name or 
had learned that name during the course of the trip, my general practice was to record that name. 
If I did not know or learn the name, I would write down a generic description, for example, 
"Baby," "Nanny," "1 Male," "1 Female." 
5. 
The first time the name M' 
appears in my flight logs between January 1, 
1994 and December 31, 1997 is on November 11, 1996. This entry reflects that a 
no 
last name, was on a flight on that date from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Teterboro Airport in 
New Jersey. 
6. 
also appears in an entry on May 9, 1997. This entry reflects that a 
`=' 
no last name, was on a flight on that date from Teterboro Airport to Santa Fe, New 
Mexico. 
7. 
I have no specific recollection of either of these flights, which occurred over 23 
years ago. In addition to Ms. =, 
I recall one other individual with the first name `=" 
who flew on Mr. Esptein's planes, although my recollection is that this other a 
did not 
begin flying until the early 2000s. 
8. 
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best 
of my recollection. 
Executed on July )1 , 2020

Hi Gloria and Mariann, 
Hope you're both doing well. We wanted to let you know about a recent order from Judge Nathan regarding Local

Hi folks, 
I have a recollection that when we were interviewing employees at the MCC, one or more individuals told us there was a 
sign posted in the SHU that said to do your checks on Epstein. If memory serves, we never recovered the document. But 
last week we got a production of records from the BOP as part of FOIA litigation that included the attached. Can you 
remind us (a) if there was in fact some employee who told us about this sign — I haven't looked at all the 302s and MOls, 
and (b) of anything we did to try to get this sign previously (if we did in fact make inquiries).

— We understand you've been overseeing and handling OPR's review of the 2008 Non-prosecution 
Agreement between SDFL and Jeffrey Epstein. As you likely know, our Office has been conducting its own investigation of 
Epstein and his associates, and we recently charged one of Epstein's co-conspirators, Ghislaine Maxwell. 
We are just beginning the process of producing discovery in that case, and we were hoping to touch base with you on 
document collection. In particular, we understand OPR gathered a significant volume of material, including internal 
emails and the like, regarding the prior SDFL investigation (, 
I think our team may have reached out to you directly at 
various points over the past year on that subject is well). We have not yet decided to what extent we have an obligation 
to gather or review that material in connection this case, but to facilitate our consideration of those issues, it would

Thank you. The record came from Associate Warden 
Will you please reach out to her, give her the 
standard voluntariness warning, and ask her where the sign came from? Can you please ask how she got it, whether she 
took it from the SHU, and when. Can you also ask who created it and hung it up? It is possible she was given this 
document by someone else and won't know the answer to the majority of these questions. If that's the case, we'll want 
to find out who had the sign / who knows the information and interview that person. If, on the other hand, she is 
knowledgeable about the sign (including why it was hung and who took it down and when), 
and I will want to 
interview her by phone. Of course, do a 302/MOI. Thanks very much and let us know if you have any questions.

MEMORANDUM FOR HUGH J. HURWITZ, ASSISISTANT DIRECTOR, 
REENTRY SERVICES DIVISION 
FROM: 
SUBJECT: 
icon-Vitale, Warden, MCC New York 
Institution Response to Psychological Reconstruction 
Inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (76318-054) 
This is the response to the psychological reconstruction of inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (76318-054) dated 
December 27, 2019. 
2. 30 Minute Rounds 
The substance of the two hour Captain video review and six hour 1DO video review is unclear. Please clarify 
the requirement for the Captain and IDO. Additionally, please identify the documentation used to maintain 
accountability of the reviews. 
Institution Response: 
Video review requirements have been instituted by NERO. Specifically, on Tuesday of each week, the 
institution is notified by NERO of the date, time, and SHU range in which to download video. The video is a 
two hour block. The video is to be reviewed by the Captain. During the reviews the Captain is looking for 
strict adherence to the requirements that rounds be conducted at least once during every 30-minute period, not to 
exceed 40 minutes between rounds and that all scheduled counts are being conducted in the SHU. The Captain 
will then submit an assurance memo to the institutional executive staff and Correctional Services Administrator 
(CSA) indicating the designated video footage was reviewed, and corrective actions which were taken for any 
deficiencies noted. This memorandum will be submitted to the Regional Office by COB on Friday of that same 
week. Institutional Duty Officers (IDOs) are required to review 6 hours of SHU video. The surveillance 
footage is downloaded by the institutional SIA and a compact disk is provided to the 1DOs for review. The 
IDOs are reviewing the video for accuracy of the 30 minute rounds. All reviews are documented in the weekly 
113O Report. 
EFTA00031997
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 0685 
Documentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the 
importance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes 
consultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision 
making of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members 
present when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not 
accurately reflect what occurred. 
Institution Response: 
As was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions 
were made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff 
meetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or 
Acting Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on 
housing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate 
presents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a 
sex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates. 
Moving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where 
housing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with 
psychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs. 
Please see the attached checklist. 
4. Documentation Accuracy 
Professional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted 
in your response. However, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in 
documentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions. 
As noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be written within 24 hours of having 
the information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules. An incident report was written for Mr. 
Epstein prior to a determination of whether he engaged in self-directed violence or was assaulted on 
July 23, 2019. Staff had ample time to wait for the outcome of the SIS investigation of this incident. 
The incident report presumed self-directed violence, although SIS was not able to determine whether 
this incident was self-directed violence or an assault. Generating the incident report for self-directed 
violence is evidence of a local bias about the July 23, 2019, incident that still exists amongst some 
staff at MCC New York. Preconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative 
explanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed. 
Please develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for 
writing incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include 
an outline of the training and evidence of staff who attended the training. 
Institution Response: 
Additional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In 
addition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when 
it is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more 
appropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual 
Training began the week of January 6, 2020, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2020. 
EFTA00031998
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 0686 
5. Telephone Calls 
As noted in the response. there is a lack of documentation to substantiate that a lieutenant facilitated two 
telephone calls to Mr. Epstein. However, this does not address the report of two telephone calls being provided. 
This response implies that the reporting of two staff members is inaccurate. 
The response neglects the documented telephone call to Mr. Epstein's deceased mother. 
Institution Response: 
On August 29, 2019, Warden J. Petrucci, signed a referral related to 
failure to follow policy in 
allowing Epstein to complete an unmonitored phone call. The referral was submitted to the Office of Internal 
Affairs on that same date and is pending further action at this time. 
7. Follow-Up 
Please provide documentation for the follow-up training provided to staff detailing the content of the training 
and to whom it was provided. 
Institution Response: 
As recommended by Central Office, the Chief Psychologist has conducted suicide prevention trainings during 
Department Head Meetings, e-mail correspondence, SHU Staff Trainings, and Lieutenant's Trainings. The 
follow-up training sign-in sheets, Department Head Meeting Minutes, and e-mails provided by psychology staff 
regarding PSY ALERT Inmates are attached for your review. 
8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy 
Periodic and unannounced checks are now conducted in SHU to determine pp30 assignments and actual inmate 
placement match. Please provide an operational definition of periodic. Please do the same for routine, as it 
relates Executive Staff bed book counts in all units. Where will the periodic and routine reviews be documented 
and will they include the identity (e.g., name and title) of staff who complete them? 
Institution Response: 
An Executive Staff and Duty Officer schedule has been implemented to conduct daily 4 P.M. and 10 A.M. 
weekend bed book counts. Any discrepancies noted are documented and sent via email to Unit Mangers and 
Captain at the conclusion of each count for corrective action. Please see the attached schedule. 
9. Attorney Log Books 
Please provide a copy of the log book audit. 
Institution Response: 
The audit revealed the Random Visitor Log Book did not reflect visitor pat searches after May 19. 2019. In 
addition, the log book does not offer a column to annotate a staff witness. The ContractorNolunteer Log 
Book was not always filled in properly. The Law Enforcement Log Book was up to date; however, the time of 
departure was not always documented. The Attorney Log was missing inmate register numbers and more often 
than not was legible. There was no Visitor Denial Log created. The audit conducted on September 25, 2019, is 
attached for your review. 
EFTA00031999
--- PAGE 4 ---
Page 0687 
Additional corrective measures will now include the Activities Lieutenant checking all Front Lobby log books. 
The Captain will ensure these checks are included in the Lieutenant's Daily Log for Day Watch and Evening 
Watch. In addition, the Activities Lieutenant will address any discrepancies immediately through on the spot 
training and/or performance log entries. 
13. Sex Offense Risk Factors 
Psychologists are subject matter experts in sex offender risk factors and they play a crucial role in sharing this 
knowledge through traditional settings such as ICT, AT, and institutional meetings. However, Executive Staff 
play a pivotal role in establishing and addressing institutional culture and promoting and participating in 
training. A lack of a broad understanding of sex offender specific risk factors requires an intentional training 
approach led by Executive Staff. They must be out front talking about inmates with a sex offense, expressing an 
understanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency condoned expectations for the understanding and 
treatment of inmates with a sex offenses, and assisting with institutional trainings. These practices encourage a 
broader acceptance by line staff. 
Institution Response: 
The MCC New York Executive Staff are out front talking about inmates with sex offenses, and expressing an 
understanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency expectations for the understanding and treatment of 
inmates with sex offenses. This is done through departmental meetings, trainings, staff recalls and walking and 
talking throughout the institution.

Good morning all, 
Inmate Maxwell stated that the discovery disc sent over that is dated 5/21/21 does not work. Our computer services 
manager looked into the complaints she made, and discovered the disc has a scratch on it. Can you please mail a new 
one? 
Sorry for the hassle!

Subject: Notes from 11/25/20 Call with GM Counsel 
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 2020 18:05:21 +0000 
11/25/20 Call with Chris Everdell and Bobbi Sternheim 
• 
Have call scheduled with MDC legal counsel; hope we can raise with them whatever issues come out of 
conversation 
• 
Most productive to understand what specific asks you have of the Warden so we can convey them and see what 
can be done 
Sternheim 
• 
Think you know how much appreciate you intervening; don't think it necessarily is your job or our job, that's why 
helpful to hear from warden himself 
• 
If warden is one making decision, better if he reports to the court 
• 
Would rather at least try to come up with particular list 
Sternheim 
• 
In history of dealing with MDC/MCC, only time progress made when court makes someone from MDC/MCC go to 
court 
• 
Hope that you made request and judge issued order to meet and confer immediately will be enough to get things 
done 
Sternheim 
• 
Clear that they cannot put her in general population; that is not an unwise decision; will be a problem for her 
personally for a variety of reasons, and I don't just mean physically 
• 
Gap between not being in general population (GP) and being in the situation that she is in; certain things that GP 
inmate is allowed that she is not 
o GP: Lights out at 9:30; GM is locked in at 8 pm 
o GP: not continually searched when moved; GM: searched to the point of invasion; understand she is 
searched every time she goes from one space to another; variety of searches, seems excessive - including 
strip searches after visits, open mouth, fingers through hair, touching her body 
• 
Understand that stopped putting fingers in her mouth 
• 
Routine to do strip search after visit 
Sternheim 
• 
Know they did COVID test and required that move mask to look in her mouth 
• 
Redundancy to over management of GM 
• 
Now she has her cup in her room, successful in getting a toothbrush (before your help she had for one day) 
• 
Entitled to every opportunity barring congregation with other inmates that is afforded to inmates in GP 
• 
b/c of COVID — allowed outside of cell only for 3 hours a day (to shower in shared shower, shared call, computer, 
television) 
EFTA00032004
--- PAGE 2 ---
• 
GM has shower to herself, phone to herself, computer, laptop, TV to herself; in MDC view, client is getting more 
than every other inmate during COVID; she is out of her cell for 13 hours 
Sternheim 
• 
Difficulty with that statement is that flags how deficient treatment of inmates is 
• 
Equal treatment is create situation where put her in a general population 
• 
Given amount of discovery in this case if she had to share computer, would go to trial in 2023 
• 
Got her accommodation b/c she has significant amount of discovery to review 
Sternheim 
• 
Not going to deny that given more time to review than other inmates are 
• 
Understand I can't just say give her everything, make exactly same as GP, but there are clients in GP that have 
own computer, tablets, and allowed to review discovery endless hours a day 
• 
Don't think that's right; understand that 
• 
If 13 hours not enough, then let us know what will be 
Everdell 
• 
Constant surveillance; camera on her all times; woken up every 15 minutes to make sure breathing; treated as if 
on suicide watch; disruptive to her health and to her ability to concentrate on preparing a defense 
• 
Going forward, things to address sounds like normalizing amount of searches to be consistent with what other 
inmates experience and minimizing amount of disruption, particularly to her sleep at night, consistent with what 
other inmates experience 
• 
Surveillance — understanding is that second camera is meant to capture the same area in case there is a 
malfunction in BOP camera system; camera in area outside in wall or ceiling that already captures and records 
same area 
Sternheim 
• 
Why is camera facing me and my client in a visiting room? 
• 
Understand that there are no cameras inside the room, but cameras outside the room showing who goes in and 
out 
Sternheim 
• 
That is a distinction; camera pointed into the room 
• 
Pass up the ask that camera not be pointed anywhere that cameras not already pointed 
Everdell 
• 
Other inmates have handheld camera following them around 24 hours a day? Includes lawyers/legal visits; 
• 
Understanding that there is not another inmate with backup camera system; reason for backup is that sometimes 
BOP camera fails and decision made to have backup camera that covers same area covered by normal area 
• 
Happy to go back to MDC and say should not record anything not recorded by normal cameras 
Sternheim 
• 
officers watching 2 people in room where no one else, and camera pointed on us 
Everdell 
• 
Already in a cage, not particularly pleasant; add stress of having handheld camera pointed directly at you; 
someone has camera up in your face, all the time; very invasive 
• 
If cameras already recording, then why is it needed if just redundant; causes real disruption and distress in some 
ways 
Sternheim 
• 
Invasive, maybe they will read lips; going far in my example; BOP overusing their authority 
EFTA00032005
--- PAGE 3 ---
• 
What I'm taking away from this is that unless MDC stops entirely with second camera, that want warden brought 
before Judge Nathan 
Sternheim 
• 
Want explanation directly from Warden why this is being done and why being done to GM; why degree of 
surveillance and searches on GM 
• 
Any searching and surveillance beyond what is done to other inmates 
• 
Why locked in at 8 pm? 
Sternheim 
• 
Not saying GP is good for her; not using day room which would eliminate a lot of these issues; but have elected 
not to do that 
• 
Let warden explain why 
• 
From MDC perspective, client gets more benefits than many inmates, gets special treatment given all access she 
has 
Sternheim 
• 
Given other treatment, where she is virtually in solitary confinement; don't view giving her more time to review 
discovery that ameliorates fact that she is being treated differently 
• 
Client is first had where did not go to SHU, but went to own wing of jail where has access to computer, TV, etc., 
that would have in GP; treated differently than someone who would ordinarily go to protective custody 
Everdell 
• 
Feel like there has to be some recognition from the Government that GM finds herself in position she is in b/c of 
who she is; 
• 
To hear that getting perks, from defense side, starts b/c she is put in solitary 
• 
Not fair to say she is better off than other inmates 
• 
In solitary, recorded 24 hours a day — b/c of who she is 
• 
Want to make sure she is in her chair at trial b/c of what happened with Epstein 
Sternheim 
• 
Advocates of our client; putting you in role for being lawyer for BOP which is not correct 
• 
Let warden say what he needs to say before the judge 
• 
To recap, areas would like to see improved, surveillance — asking that second camera be removed entirely? Or is 
there any modification that would be acceptable to you? 
Sternheim 
• 
don't have firm answer; don't think when meeting with her or every step of the way 
• 
Will convey to BOP reducing use of camera and certainly not pointing into room where attorney meetings take 
place 
• 
Other issue is amount of searching — reduced to amount of searching that other inmates experience 
• 
Waking her up at night — ask that do nothing differently than what do to check on other inmates at night 
Everdell 
• 
One other point on searches; when moves from isolation cell to day room to do discovery review, etc., that 
involves a bunch of searches too; our understanding was plan was for her to be housed in day room 
• 
Need to keep her in certain room when would limit movement and searches if housed in day room 
• 
Will raise day room again 
Sternheim 
• 
Not allowed to maintain any food that she doesn't eat 
• 
Think same for everyone; so that don't make hooch 
EFTA00032006
--- PAGE 4 ---
• 
How much time she needs to review discovery? We understand a lot of discovery; have been over-inclusive in 
what we have given you; we have given you material that we don't anticipate using at trial, that doesn't relate to 
your client; 1.2 million documents is searchable to help expedite review 
• 
If think client needs more than 13 hours a day, please let me know; when pushed MDC to allow for time to 
review discovery, have been responsive 
Everdell 
• 
Only get extension cord after laptop dies; don't know if has gotten better

Normally I wouldn't send something like this because it seems so unlikely, but just FYI — a reporter who's

Good afternoon-
Despite being subjected to the most unique, restrictive, and invasive conditions 
of pretrial confinement, Ms. Maxwell has and continues to be a compliant detainee. 
She obeys all orders and commands - often muffled by masks, 
uttered behind prison doors, and/or combined with the din of background noise -
as soon as they are audibly discernible. 
Erratic enforcement of inconsistent rules and regulations imposed by 
revolving teams of guards who exert varying degrees of officiousness 
and contempt toward Ms. Maxwell is the fault of the MDC/BOP, 
not Ms. Maxwell.

Bobbi

We are looking into the concerns you have brought to our attention

institution are now being stored in this manner as it is a protective 
barrier for the equipment. With that said, we will be doing test runs 
to investigate concerns you have mentioned. 
Furthermore, Ms. Maxwell must oblige by the orders of the Officers. We 
offer Ms. Maxwell medical care on a daily basis, which she has 
declined. 
Additionally, can you please provide me with a photo of the ear buds 
you are requesting to bring into the institution?

Good morning-
As reported yesterday, the modifications made in the VTC room 
are negatively impacting attorney-client communication. 
The video is blurry; the audio includes distorting noises. 
I am requesting that these problems be remedied immediately. 
Also, I am bringing to your attention the inappropriate behavior of the 
guards presently on Ms. Maxwell's detail: threatening discipline if 
Ms. Maxwell is "off camera" while leaning against a wall to soothe her 
aching 
back; barking orders regarding the noise emanating from the washing 
machine 
and the pace of her gait when walking; laughing amongst themselves as 
if any of this is funny. 
The manner in which some of the guards responded to me on Sunday gives 
me reason to be concerned 
about how they treat Ms. Maxwell when out of public view. 
The courtesy of a response is requested. 
Thank you-

We're working on drafting a letter in response to the attached, and wanted to give you a heads up. We hope to have a 
draft for you this afternoon, in the hopes of sending the draft to defense counsel tonight as part of the meet-and-confer 
directed by Judge Nathan. I think that leaves sufficient time for filing tomorrow. 
Although we're mindful of third party privacy interests, for non-parties who are neither witnesses nor victims in the case, I 
do have concerns about entertaining redaction/intervention requests, given the high volume of people who may ask to be

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
The Government expects to offer testimony from Computer Forensic Examiner Stephen 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ("FBI") Com uter Analysis Response Team 
("CART"). Although the Government believes that Examiner 
testimony will not require 
admission through Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Government nevertheless 
provides notice of Examiner 
anticipated testimony in an abundance of caution. A copy 
of Examiner 
curriculum vitae is being produced to you today bearing Bates number 3503-
001.1
The Government anticipates that, if called as a witness, Examiner 
will testify about 
his extraction of devices seized pursuant to court-authorized search warrants; user information 
associated with certain of those devices; and documents and photographs extracted from certain 
Examiner 
has previously testified regarding similar topics in federal court. As a courtesy, 
the Government notifies you that Examiner MI 
has previously testified in federal court in 
United States v. DiTomasso, 14 Cr. 160 (SAS), United States v. Hirst, 15 Cr. 643 (PKC), United 
States v. Stasiv, 18 Cr. 259 (PKC), and United States v. Kelly, 19 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.). 
EFTA00032021
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
of those devices. The Government further anticipates that Examiner 
will also testify that 
some of the devices on which he performed extractions were clones of device extractions that had 
previously been performed by someone else. 
The Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly 
provide notice if the Government elects to do so. 
Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice 
The Government reiterates its April 23, 2021 request for reciprocal notice under Rule 
16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert witness that the 
defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that the defendant 
intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as well as the 
witness's qualifications. 
Additionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery 
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: 
(1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which 
the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or 
reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in 
connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, 
and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which 
were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior 
statements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 
26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). The Government requests that such material 
be provided on the same basis upon which the Government agrees to supply the defendant with 
3500 material relating to Government witnesses. 
Very truly yours, 
United States Attorney

Subject: Computer Forensics - Budget Estimate 
Date: Tue, 23 Jun 2020 20:29:21 +0000 
Inline-Images: Unage001.png; image002.png 
To follow up on our conversation late last week, here is an estimate that covers the scope of work that we discussed. 
Here is what I would suggest as a statement of work: 
Specific deliverables known at this time include receiving, inventorying and forensically processing approximately 57 
devices (a mix of computer hard drives, mobile devices, and portable media); extracting and parsing relevant data from 
those devices (parsing may involve, for example, review of backups, compressed files or other data that is not initially 
categorized by forensic tools); creating Relativity load files; preparing summaries and analyses of the data; and briefing 
the investigative team on the contractor's findings. 
As to staffing the engagement, I would propose having two junior-level staff members conduct the review, to be 
supervised and assisted as necessary by a senior staff member (a former FBI computer scientist). A managing director 
would have overall responsibility for the project and would coordinate with SDNY. 
As to timing: we are available to start work immediately. Estimated time to complete the engagement would be 30 days 
(or less). 
As to a budget, I would estimate between $85,000 to $135,000 as follows: 
Position 
Rate 
Est. Hours (Lowl Fees 
Est. Hours (High) Est. Fees 
Director 
$ 
603.00 50 
$ 
30,150.00 75 
$ 
45,225.00 
Staff 
$ 
356.00 150 
$ 
53,400.00 250 
$ 
89,000.00 
Total 
$ 
83,550.00 Total 
$ 
134,225.00 
In addition to the foregoing hourly fees, we charge $200 per blank hard drive and $45 per blank thumb drive, to the 
extent they are required; as well as a fixed fee of $500 per device image (basically an equipment and software recovery 
fee for the specialized tools we use for forensics). 
Thank you again for considering us for this important matter. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

cS; 
Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a month 
later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their estimate of 
getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an estimate on the USVI 
materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more voluminous than the New York 
devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART will finalize, but I think at this point 
we should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-friendly 
format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very effective and 
efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in less than a 
month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how many 
items I have to export.

I am in the process ofAtoorting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per 
my discussions with =. 
Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as I 
item in particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has 
provided drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you 
know when everything is complete.

Also, the related critical question that I don't think we have clarity on is whether you're giving us a copy of everything

have you and

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

Separately, to follow up on a question from the May 15 email below, the list has just five devices as still pending to be 
transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in 
searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to match any of the prior productions to 
specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that might work, but otherwise I think it 
makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
And related to that question, are we still on track to get the full range of data in the next week or so? I don't think we've 
gotten any updates on that status in the past few weeks, and we're eager to be able to start reviewing.

Updated item descriptions. Just a side note, many thumb drives and SD cards will not have a serial number 
visible externally, but will report one through our tools. I included those electronically reported serial

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of 
information we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any 
device that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the 
following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
EFTA00032033
--- PAGE 7 ---
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the 
USVI list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

approximate size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I 
put what load file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If 
there is no entry in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't 
have as well as an iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to 
beef them up. I will get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any 
FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which 
both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense 
counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that 
the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process 
—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to 
do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents 
earlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. 
Again, I understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, 
which I understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for usl I was just trying to 
understand the approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what 
was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So 
now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, 
but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume 
that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
- 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
million documents without much rhyme or reason.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points 
of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 
drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All 
the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. 
Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the 
two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed 
and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached 
is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think 
FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to 
be able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only 
local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still 
working on the rest.

Team, 
Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
EFTA00032043
--- PAGE 17 ---
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition 
to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Everything with the exception of a couple of items are ready. I will get you an actual number before I send it over. 
We can send it over tomorrow. There will be ReadMe files included so it will be easy to see where the items came from. I 
am a little worried about how the e-mail will present. While looking through on a spot check, the attachments are not 
connected to the e-mails in the forensic tool. I believe it is a function of the e-mail client they were using to begin with. I 
know that the attachments are a concern of yours. We may have to massage things a bit to get it right. Now that we are 
working every day, and everything has been processed, it shouldn't be too big a deal. So far the export is about 350 GB. It 
copies slowly because it is a ton of pretty small files. You are getting the whole ball of wax, here, Macs, Windows boxes, 
loose media, etc. There will be a few iPhone and iPad reports, but unsure if I can get you those tomorrow as they very 
often take a LONG time to copy. Again, lots of small files. If not tomorrow, the next day. 
Are you around tomorrow? Reach out to me when you get the production so we can correct any problems we might 
encounter. Thanks.

I understand that some number of the devices are ready to come to us as early as today or tomorrow. Could you please 
let us know the following information, so we can figure out who the hard drive should go to in the first instance: 
1. How many total devices are coming to us in this initial production? 
1. What are those devices — i.e., type of device and which ones, from the spreadsheets you've sent? 
2. What's the total volume of data coming in this round of production? 
Once we know that, I can let the agents know where the drive needs to go in the first instance.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how many

I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
discussions with 
. Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
everything is complete.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what

can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing

week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
EFTA00032053
--- PAGE 8 ---
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for usl I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
EFTA00032055
--- PAGE 10 ---
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the current timeline —
and also the current timeline on producing the results from those August and September searches? I think you and =I

would be about a month from now. Wanted to make sure we're still on track.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
EFTA00032060
--- PAGE 15 ---
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
EFTA00032063
--- PAGE 18 ---
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Everything with the exception of a couple of items are ready. I will get you an actual number before I send it over. 
We can send it over tomorrow. There will be ReadMe files included so it will be easy to see where the items came from. I 
am a little worried about how the e-mail will present. While looking through on a spot check, the attachments are not 
connected to the e-mails in the forensic tool. I believe it is a function of the e-mail client they were using to begin with. I 
know that the attachments are a concern of yours. We may have to massage things a bit to get it right. Now that we are 
working every day, and everything has been processed, it shouldn't be too big a deal. So far the export is about 350 GB. It 
copies slowly because it is a ton of pretty small files. You are getting the whole ball of wax, here, Macs, Windows boxes, 
loose media, etc. There will be a few iPhone and iPad reports, but unsure if I can get you those tomorrow as they very 
often take a LONG time to copy. Again, lots of small files. If not tomorrow, the next day. 
Are you around tomorrow? Reach out to me when you get the production so we can correct any problems we might 
encounter. Thanks.

I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my

particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when

can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a

Updated item descriptions. Just a side note, many thumb drives and SD cards will not have a serial number 
visible externally, but will report one through our tools. I included those electronically reported serial numbers.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here— all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for usl I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
EFTA00032073
--- PAGE 10 ---
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Following up on the below, I think you had said you expected to be able to get us a list of the devices seized from the 
search warrants at Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI, as well as from his person upon arrest, in about a 
month (during our conference call a month ago) — so wanted to check if we can still expect that very soon? We're waiting 
on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the current timeline —
and also the current timeline on producing the results from those August and September searches? I think you and =I 
were going to coordinate on that, and you had mentioned you expected we'd have it a couple months from our call, which 
would be about a month from now. Wanted to make sure we're still on track.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
- 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
EFTA00032078
--- PAGE 15 ---
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working

which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time

ss 
I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "IoadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Once you've had the chance to look into this, mind having a call to discuss please? 
Thanks.

Subject: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509 
Good afternoon-
In compliance with the Court's order, dated August 25th (attached), I hereby notify you 
of recent third-party interference with the "secure" Webex line used for confidential/privileged communication 
between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
At the conclusion of yesterday afternoon's VTC session, Ms. Maxwell observed 
suspicious activity on the VTC monitor. 
She alerted MDC staff, and Case Manageretnessed the activity. 
This is contrary to the Court's finding that "according to the Government and MDC Legal [Ms. Maxwell]'s 
difficulties communicating with counsel have been resolved" and contrary to "MDC's Legal assurances that 
[Ms. Maxwell]'s legal communication has not been interfered with..." 
Previously, the MDC has disputed such claims concerning interference with 
VTC communication between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
Now, an MDC insider bears witness to complaint by Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
Please provide explanation for this interference and evidence of remediation 
before I report this latest problem to the Court. 
Thank you-
Bobbi

So the estimate from BRG was for less than 30 days, and that was to do everything - extraction plus processing, and I 
think extraction is the longer part of that. One we get an estimate from PAE, if it's longer than a few weeks to process, we 
can go back to BRG and get an estimate on just processing (without extraction) and see what they say. I would guess it 
would be something like a couple weeks. 
(As you can probably tell, I'm trying to catch up on emails from earlier this week!)

That's partially right but not completely — the BRG estimate is for dumping the devices but *also* processing all the data. 
That is, converting all the Word, Excel, PDF, JPEG, BMP, PPT, etc etc files into a loadable file set for Relativity (specifically, 
converting to TIFF and load files that can be uploaded). 
That intermediate step is something that the FBI had told us they would do, but now are not doing, because they screwed 
it up so badly last time. So ordinarily we have PAE do the processing, but if they say it will take, say, three months, we can 
do it faster through BRG. 
Either way we'll review in Relativity, though.

I thought the role we wanted BRG to play was the dumping of the devices — I had thought, perhaps incorrectly, that we 
always planned to use Relatively to review once we were into them. Is that not the case?

hopefully be able to tell us within a few days whether it's very obviously incorrectly formatted. Then the next 
test will be once it's on Relativity, and that will be an estimate by PAE (or BRG, if they can do it much faster).

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI —they are now well over a month 
later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their estimate of 
getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an estimate on the USVI 
materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more voluminous than the New York 
devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART will finalize, but I think at this point 
we should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-friendly 
format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very effective and 
efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in less than a 
month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how many

I am in the process ofAtoorting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per 
my discussions with =. 
Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 
item in particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has 
provided drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you 
know when everything is complete.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of 
information we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any 
device that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the 
following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the 
USVI list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could 
to convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for 
approximate size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I 
put what load file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If 
there is no entry in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't 
have as well as an iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to 
beef them up. I will get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any 
FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which 
both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense 
counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that 
the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process 
—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to 
do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents 
earlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. 
Again, I understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, 
which I understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to 
understand the approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what 
was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So 
now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
EFTA00032112
--- PAGE 10 ---
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, 
but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume 
that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

In terms of data transfer, 
are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it 
on our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been 
processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one device to 
make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
EFTA00032117
--- PAGE 15 ---
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
- 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the 
SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points 
of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 
drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All 
the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. 
Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the 
two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed 
and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached 
is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think 
FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to 
be able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only 
local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still 
working on the rest.

which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition 
to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

I just learned that he was being ordered onto another tier, where he does not believe he is safe. Worse, he was told that if 
does not enter the tier where he believes he is in danger he will be sent to SHU. This is deeply troubling. MCC has kept 
Mr. Tartaglione in quarantine for more than twice as long as he was supposed to be there and is now giving him the 
Hobson's choice of SHU or risking his safety. And, his most of his property is still in the old cell where you assured us he 
would be returned. 
I am again asking that he be placed on a safe tier, in a safe cell with a cellmate who does not pose a threat to him, 
preferably the cell where he has been detained for well over a year.

Good morning, 
I understand that Mr. Tartaglione is still in quarantine although he was cleared to return to general population. As I wrote 
over the weekend, apparently the MCC refused to place Mr. Tartaglione back in his cell where he has been safe or in a unit 
of people over few years old. He is a retired police officer. As such he has been and is targeted for violence by other 
inmates. Prior to being housed with his current cellmate, Mr. Tartaglione was assaulted resulting in surgery and an 
extended stay in a hospital. For coming up on two years he has lived in a cell with a cellmate and has been relatively safe. 
He was removed—supposedly for 14 days—over a month ago from that cell and is now being forced to either stay in

Hey, just a quick question about this in the CC update memo — "flight records do reflect at least one trip that 
took with Epstein to New Mexico during the general time period in 2002 when 
recalls the assault 
occurring" 
Looking at the records from July 2002 through the end of the year, and looking for either ABQ (Albuquerque) or SAF 
(Santa Fe), I only see the following: 
- 
July 17, SAF to TEB (include= 
- 
August 5, TEB to SAF (includes. and August 17, SAF to TEB (includesM 
says she met Epstein in 2002, so is one (or both) of those trips what we're referring to? I don't see any other records 
of flights to New Mexico in the second half of 2002 at all, and 
doesn't show up by name on the jet until December .. 
. and then I don't see her again until April 2003 (which is consistent with her being in Spain for the beginning of 2003). 
Just wanted to check — extremely possible I'm not seeing something! Or just that the July / Aug. flights are what we're 
referencing. Thanks!

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In

please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for

Would you be able to bring the drive into the courthouse with you, so that we can get it from you in the courtroom? If 
not, would you by any chance be able to put the drive in an envelope marked with my name on it and leave it with

Hey =, 
So far so good here, thanks — just trying to deal with the tech issues of working from home (not to mention the inability to 
interview witnesses!) but really can't complain at all, the girlfriend and I are both healthy and distancing. Hope that's true 
for you and yours too. 
In terms of the issues below, unfortunately there isn't any progress — it's not a delay on our end, we've run the taint 
screen and so the AUSAs and agents all have access on Relativity to the materials that 
sent over in December. We 
also sent the privilege taint terms to the agents a couple weeks ago so they could run the screen on whatever programs 
they may be using — that's attached. We hadn't realized that they were impeded on their review due to any taint issue, 
we just thought they were using Relativity, same as us. 
More generally though, the issue we continue to have is the same one since February. We have absolutely no sense of 
what 
sent to us — it's not organized or identified by device or even by location, the documents aren't joined with 
their attachments (their "families" in the terms of doc review), we can't look at native files, etc. It's all the issues from my 
March 9 email, below, which 
never responded to. And it's only 1.4 million documents out of what are presumably 
tens of millions total — we haven't gotten any version of the rest (and don't know exactly what we're missing, because 
again, we have no way to track what we've been given so far). 
If 
(and/or others at CART) are teleworking, it would be great to get help on this, because obviously weeks are going 
by that we could be using to review. I had been trying to push my chiefs for a meeting in early March but then obviously 
the world imploded! So not sure what can be done currently, but happy to discuss with anybody that would be useful. 
thanks as always,

totally happy to chat, and it's exactly the same issues as we talked about on the phone a couple weeks ago when 
we first raised this -- I wonder if it makes sense to get in a room together? Otherwise it's a lot of games of telephone. 
But basically the way to think about it is, imagine if we had seized papers from approximately 100,000 filings cabinets in 
a dozen different office buildings. And then instead of keeping them organized or labeled by room, or even by office 
building, all 1.3 million documents (so far) just got dumped into one big pile — except before that, any documents that 
had multiple parts stapled together got separated. And then if any of those documents that was larger than about 100 
pages couldn't be opened. That's what we've got, just electronically.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring 
to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just 
partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
EFTA00032142
--- PAGE 3 ---
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only 
is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
record-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points 
of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 
drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All 
the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. 
Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the 
two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed 
and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the 
attached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, 
transferred, and received so far, and what remains.

Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only 
local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that 
all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from 
NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be 
produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been 
produced. Still working on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, 
etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of 
time to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that Mandy dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in 
addition to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really 
need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same 
info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

The National Suicide Prevention Coordinator from Central Office, Dr. Nagle, contacted me today about Epstein. 
He thought that housing him with another sex offender in SHU would be a good idea. I told him I would speak 
with the executive staff about his suggestion. Also,Mahought it wise that we keep him down here for a 
bit (as is the plan already). 
I am heading to the hospital in about a half an hour or so. If you need me for anything, feel free to call my cell

Eons  of Session 
He was seen by writer while he was on Psych Observation. 
Subjective/Objective Presentation 
The "Eating/Shower Chart" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast. He is not in the Psych Observation cell for about 12 
hours per day because of being in Attorney Conference with his Attorneys, so the "Eating/Shower Chart" may not reflect 
all of his meals. He stated he was served one meal in Attorney Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water 
at night. The Psych Observation log noted he talked about life in general population and he slept. 
Earlier he had complained that his right arm was numb and hanging. Nurse Columbo from Medical had se n him for 
this. 
When this writer was interviewing him, he said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cann t make a fist 
with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. This writer notified Nurse 
He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so aversive and 
upsetting that he said he sat in the corner and held his ears. He said because of this he was agitated for hours and was 
not able to sleep. The Lt. will be moving him to a different cell and he was informed of this. He stated the eling he got 
with the noise of the toilet was similar to when he was In SHU. He said he may have something on the Au sm 
spectrum. He said in the movie "Rain Man," the person with Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated h is also 
really good with numbers. 
Current Mental Status: He exhibited a mildly anxious mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and 
coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual 
hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropri ate behavior.

Focus of Session 
Inmate Epstein was seen while on psychological observation today in the hospital area. 
SubJectivelObjectIve Presentation 
Same; presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his neck) may be imp Iced 
because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is aware he will be retu ing to SHU, 
but said he Is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in his arm. He requested to have 0 e good night 
of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow. He then asked if he could remain down here 
where it is "safe" for the entire week. I told him he can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good 
night's sleep, but that he would be returned to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues 
precluding him from returning to SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area because he 
felt safe or more comfortable for him. It was explained to him that he would be placed In a safe situation i the SW. 
According to his log book and eating/shower chart, he has been eating and drinking when not in his legal sits. He has 
also been writing and attending his legal visits. 
InterventinnIt 
Inmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive interventions and psychoeducation regarding additio 
coping 
strategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was somewhat receptive to these interventions, but appears more concerned about getting

Suicide Risk Assessment in PDS-BEMR 
Classification of Suicide Related Behaviors 
Suicide Related Communication: 
Any verbal or non-verbal interpersonal communication of thoughts, 
wishes, or intent for suicide that does NOT produce self-injury. 
Actions do not produce self-injury, although they have that intent. 
Examples may include 
- placing a noose around one's neck in the presence of staff: 
- writing a letter that states. "the world would be better without me': 
- stating, "I'm going to kill myself." 
Suicide Related Behavior: 
A self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior for which there is 
evidence that the person either (a) wished to use the appearance 
of a suicide attempt to attain some other end. or (b) intended. to 
some degree. to kill him/herself. 
Yes 
No 
Undetermined 
Suicide Attempt: 
A non-fatal self-directed potentially injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide 
attempt may or may not result in injury. 
Non-Suicidal Self Directed Violence: 
If there is no evidence, whether implicit or explicit, of suicidal intent it is not an attempt, it is 
This is 
your judgment and includes inmate self-report. Look at the big picture and account for other data that corroborates or 
contradicts self-report. This is a distinction that the executive staff and/or the IDO need to have made for them. 
Yes or No 
Medical interventions are not an injury, but are undertaken to avoid or address an injury. 
Lethality Assessment 
Asphyxiation - Hanging 
Asphyxiation - Other 
Cutting 
Fire 
Ingestion - Prescription Medication 
Ingestion - Non-Prescription Medication 
Ingestion - Other 
Jumping 
Other 
Most of these are self-explanatory. Ingestion — Other is appropriate for swallowing razors and other foreign objects. 
EFTA00032192
--- PAGE 3 ---
Low Lethality: 
- Death is impossible or highly improbable. 
- The individual may receive medical attention. Out it is not required for survival. 
- Frequently. the act is done in a public setting. or is reported by the individual to ensure detection and assistance. 
- Examples placed noose loosely around neck and did not attach the other end to another object: swallowed 10 Tylenol pills in front 
of staff; scratches or superficial cuts on neck or wrist. 
Moderate Lethality: 
- Death is a possible. but not highly probably, outcome of the act, in the opinion of the average person. 
- Opportunity for detection and intervention was not certain. 
- Medical or crisis intervention may be required to reduce the risk of death (e.g.. pumping stomach. suturing cuts). 
- Examples: swallowed 30 Tylenol cut neck and lost significant blood: placed ligature around neck and applied pressure. 
High Lethality: 
• Death is the probable outcome, although immediate and vigorous medical attention may reduce the risk. 
- The individual took measures to avoid detection and intervention. or the method was so lethal that intervention was not likely to 
prevent death. 
- Examples: placed ligature around neck and lost consciousness: attempted to hang self. but stopped when cellmate awoke; took a 
potentially lethal overdose and did not alert staff. 
Examples of Protective Factors (Sanchez, 2001; United States Public Health Service, 1999) 
• Strong connections to family and community support 
• Sense of belonging, sense of identity, and good self-esteem 
• Identification of future goals 
• Support through ongoing medical and mental health care relationships 
• Easy access to a variety of clinical interventions and support for help seeking 
cannot be simply compared on a one to one b 
jive cation 
• Skills in problem solving, coping and conflict resolution 
• Cultural, spiritual, and religious connections and beliefs 
• Constructive use of leisure time (enjoyable activities) 
• Effective clinical care for mental, physical and substance use disorders 
• Restricted access to highly lethal means of suicide 
fact 
factors. 
Low Acute Risk 
Suicidal ideation is absent or is of limited frequency, intensity. duration and specificity. There are NO identifiable plans and NO associated intent. 
There is good self-control based on both self-report and objective assessment. There may be mild symptomatology and morbid rumination may 
be present. Few risk factors are present and protective factors are identified, including available and accessible social support. 
Moderate Acute Risk 
Suicidal ideation is frequent with limited intensity and duration. Suicidal plans have some specificity, but NO associated intent. There is good self-
control. limited to moderate symptomatology. some risk factors are present. and protective factors are identified, including available and accessible 
social support. Denial of ideation and intent may be present. if objective markers. such as suicide threats to others and agitation, contradict the 
self-report 
High Acute Risk 
Frequent. intense, and enduring suicidal ideation. specific plans. Many risk factors are identified. Objective markers of risk are present (e.g.. 
lethal method, rehearsal behaviors. saying "goodbye•): self-report of subjective intent may or may not be present. There is evidence of impaired 
self-control. severe symptomatology. multiple risk factors are present. and few. if any protective factors. 
Present - Chronic Rick is present when there is a history of two or more suicide attempts 
Absent - Chronic Risk is absent when there is a history of one or zero suicide attempts. 
Note: Self-ham behaviors are not counted as suicide attempts. 
EFTA00032193
--- PAGE 4 ---
Recommendations:
If suicide risk is present, consider recommending the following 
interventions: 
- Suicide Watch 
• Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Suicide 
- Positive Reinforcement 
- Safety Plan 
- Psychiatric Referral 
- Reasons for Living Card 
- CBT/DBT Skills Training Groups 
- Coping Cards 
- Recommendation for Double Cell 
- Psychology Alert Code 
- Change Care Level (UPDATE Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation) 
- Property Restriction (If Returning to Restricted Housing) 
- Suicide Risk Management Plan 
- Consult with Unit Team 
- Assign a Mental Health Cadre 
- A suicide watch is not warranted at this time 
- A suicide watch is to be initiated immediately 
- A suicide watch was initiated by non-clinical staff and continues to be warranted 
- A suicide watch was initiated by non-clinical staff and is no longer warranted

Jeff and George,

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for 
any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow and 
will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be able to 
coordinate with you as needed.

Message Pad Scans: The message pads were scanned with the post it notes on them and the very next page is the page 
without the post it note, so the pages are back to back. 
Papers from Miami case file (grand jury testimony): This is a disk — I can copy it and send it over to you. 
Evidence scans: Are you referring to the scans from the FL file? We sent those over with the original message pad scans 
last year. If you need that again, let us know and we can get another copy over to you. As far as paper evidence from the 
NY and VI searches, and the paper provided by Reiter, we can get that over to you by the end of the week. 
FBI file: We have that ready for you. 
CART: There are no 302s regarding the extraction of devices. 
Evidence from disks: This is a large volume and we've been working on this and removing nude/semi nude images. This is 
the only thing that would be difficult to complete by Friday. If we could have a little more time to pull this together, that 
would be very helpful. 
If it's helpful to talk through some of this via phone, we are happy to do that as well.

Hey guys, 
Apologies but today I was out In the field on surveillance and 
was also out of the office so we've not 
been able to connect on these discovery questions. We will be back in the office tomorrow and will dive into 
this as best we can. We have several calls tomorrow, one of which is with Tony Figuero but well do our best to 
get on this list. That being said I don't want to make you any promises that everything will be compiled by 
tomorrow and that we will have an answer to all of your questions but we can jump on a call tomorrow if you 
like to square some of this away. 
I did receive your "pages from Miami_case_docs" PDF.

Hi 
and 
The drive you provided us has some scans on it (looks like they're scans of the message pads). As I recall, there was a 
larger scanning project, during which the FBI scanned all of the paper that was vouchered in evidence. Are you able to 
provide us with all of those scans this week? 
With respect to the message pads in particular, I think you mentioned that they were scanned both with post-it notes on 
them and also without the post-it notes. The version on this drive just looks like it has the post-it note scans. 
Thanks,

Subject: Discovery questions 
and M, 
Thanks so much for your help with the Maxwell discovery so far. I have some follow-up questions about the most recent 
batch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. 
Below are some questions regarding the discovery 
dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: 
• 
The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it 
contains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? 
• 
The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I think 
mentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—and those 
copies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every "Notebook" pdf you provided in the "Message pad 
scans" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? 
• 
It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. Would 
you please get us copies of those returns? 
Following up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you 
please be able to get us these this week? 
• 
Full FBI sentinel file 
• 
CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation 
• 
All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and hard 
copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. 
• 
Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials 
• 
Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been scanned, 
including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any nude or 
partially nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such 
images were scanned, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
• 
Copies of the contents of all the discs that were seized and searched pursuant to search warrants to a platform 
for review. Then please produce to SDNY a copy all of those materials, except any nude or partially nude images. 
For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such images were located, 
where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if it would be useful to hop on a call.

Sure, and given that timing I actually think it would be helpful to schedule two meetings, so we can be on track to get 
all the information we need efficiently, unless you have any objection to that. Can we put meetings on the calendar 
for Tuesday the 31st and Thursday the 2nd, say at 10:30 a.m. each day? Or let us know if she or you prefer different 
timing. 
And I would just add that because we do think she may have useful information for the ongoing investigation, which 
continues to proceed, if her personal issues resolve — or allow for a meeting — sooner than those dates three weeks 
out, we would prefer to meet earlier if that becomes possible. Understand if not, but wanted to note it.

Wanted to get back to you, as promised — as we indicated previously, the attorney proffers we've received from you 
haven't caused us to change our view of Ms. 
status, and I think you've generally addressed the initial and 
follow-up questions we've had. I think from our perspective the next step would be to have a conversation with 
Ms.= directly, and to cover with her the same topics that we've addressed with you. Ordinarily we would 
approach a discussion like that simply by going chronologically, and asking follow-up questions as appropriate along 
the way, but as I've mentioned to you previously, if it would be useful to proceed in a different format, or to focus 
(or avoid) specific topics in a first meeting, I think we would generally be amenable to that. And of course as we've 
also discussed, any discussion would be completely voluntary—not just the interview overall, but any specific topic 
or question that she wanted to pass on, or discuss with you in the moment, etc., would be totally up to her. Please 
let us know what you think? We're also happy to chat via phone if that would be helpful as well.

Michael, 
Following up on our meeting, one additional question / clarification we have from reviewing our notes is about 
whether Ms.= ever visited certain Epstein properties other than his New York mansion and the brief visit to 
the Palm Beach residence. I apologize if you addressed that and I missed it, but we wanted to add it to the list of 
additional questions — in particular, whether she ever visited the New Mexico ranch, the Little St. James Island, 
the Great St. James island, and/or the Paris residence. Also, is it correct that she just visited the Palm Beach 
residence the one time you referenced? It's not a problem or issue if she visited any of those other locations, we 
just wanted to clarify one way or the other. And happy to discuss via phone if that's useful.

We do understand that your attorney proffer today will be preliminary, and to the best of your client's current 
recollection and to the best of your current understanding, and without, e.g., having been provided documents or 
other materials by the Government. 
We also confirm that your statements will be considered to be made pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 410 and Fed. R.

counsel in this case and others who have made similar statements or submissions, which is that we don't take any 
position on the effect or application of Rule 408 in a prospective or hypothetical dispute in civil litigation, because 
it doesn't implicate any rights the Government would or would not have, but you can consider us advised that 
your position is that your statements are also covered under 408. (While our Office itself can't guarantee the 
protections of Rule 408 because any dispute on that issue would be beyond our purview, we are also not taking 
the position that we believe it does not apply.) 
thank you

We are happy to speak with you — we had only followed up because we were under the impression she was interested in 
speaking with us. We certainly can discuss issues of witness safety and confidentiality, but we also are not looking to 
pressure anyone, at all. Please let us know if it makes sense to chat, and if so, what time ranges would work for you later

Mr. 
We wanted to follow up on our prior email and offer to speak with our client, 
As 
stated earlier, 
worked for Ms. Maxwell (and, by extension, Jeffrey Epstein). 
I confirmed with our client that she is willing to speak with you and wants to fully cooperate with the criminal 
investigation/action pending against Ms. Maxwell. She could be a valuable witness for you. 
Please let us know if you would like to speak with our client. We are happy to facilitate this conversation.

Thanks for being in touch. In the first instance, before we would request an interview directly, it 
would be helpful for us to get a full attorney proffer from you about what the client's information is, 
what you expect she would convey in an interview, any relevant documentary or other 
corroborating materials, etc. That way we can make sure we're not re-victimizing any individual 
unnecessarily, and be efficient with any necessary follow-up interview of the individual him- or 
herself. Please let us know when a good time would be for an attorney proffer? And we can figure 
out scheduling.

be a subject, and that with respect to Richardson we didn't currently intend to subpoena or request to speak with him

Richardson has given the following statement to the press, true and accurate?: 
(USANYS) 
Governor Bill Richardson offered his assistance in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation - through his lawyer, Jeff Brown of 
Dechert LLP - to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In response to this offer, Mr. Brown was informed 
EFTA00032235
--- PAGE 2 ---
by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither a target, subject, nor witness in 
the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson that the government is actively investigating. 
"It's fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe the Governor participated in or 
witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed," said Mr. Brown. 
Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so that Epstein's victims can finally have their day in court 
and see the justice they deserve.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Your Honor, we are 
here for a plea conference. 
THE COURT: Raise your right hand. 
THEREUPON: 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
after being called as a witness by the Defense and 
after being first duly sworn by the Court, was 
examined and testified as follows: 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Is this one case or two? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Two. 
THE COURT: May I see the PC 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032239
--- PAGE 3 ---
affidavit in both cases, please? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: There are no PC 
affidavits. There was originally an 
Indictment, the second charge was filed 
arising out of the booking. It was all 
testimony presented to the grand jury. 
THE COURT: Let me see the Indictment 
then? 
I have one Indictment, one 
Information? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: So one case is charged by 
Indictment, one is charged by Information? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: In case 2006036744 you 
are charged with procuring a person under 
for prostitution, a second degree 
felony, maximum penalty of fifteen years 
Department of Corrections; minimum, some 
period of probation. No mandatory minimum 
apply, is that correct, State? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: And in case number 06 
9454CF, you are charged with felony 
solicitation to prostitution, a third 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032240
--- PAGE 4 ---
 
 
degree felony, punishable by a maximum 
penalty of five years in the Department of 
Corrections, and a minimum, probation. No 
mandatory minimums, correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: The defendant has no 
prior criminal record? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: You checked the NCIC as 
well as State records? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
THE COURT: And the guideline score 
sheet I have before me shows 21.5 months in 
the Department of Corrections as the lowest 
permissible prison sentence in months. 
Both sides agree to the preparation of the 
guideline score sheet? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: We so agree, Your 
Honor. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
THE COURT: What is proposed -- it 
goes on for pages. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Your Honor, much of 
the documentation is acknowledgement by my 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032241
--- PAGE 5 ---
client to community control, sex offender 
status. 
THE COURT: I understand. 
Okay. What is proposed -- those 
are the maximums and minimums, Mr. Epstein. 
What is proposed is that you will be 
pleading guilty to felony solicitation to 
prostitution and procuring a person under 
for prosecution. A PSI would be waived, 
you would be adjudicated guilty of both 
felonies, is that correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: And on 06 9454, the 
defendant to be sentenced to 12-months in 
the Palm Beach County -- detention 
facility? He's going to do time in the 
jail? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
THE COURT: With credit for one day 
served. And on 08 9381, he is to be 
sentenced to six months in the Palm Beach 
County jail detention facility, with credit 
for one day served. And the six month 
sentence is to be served consecutive to the 
month sentence? 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032242
--- PAGE 6 ---
Nival 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: Following the six months 
sentence, the defendant will be placed on 
12-months of community control one. The 
conditions of the community control are 
attached hereto and incorporated herein. 
As a special condition of 
community control, he's to have no 
unsupervised contact with minors and the 
supervising adult must be approved -- and I 
would say, pre-approved, approved ahead of 
time, not after the fact by the Department 
of Corrections. And you would mean by that 
his community control officer? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: The defendant is 
designated as a sexual offender pursuant to 
Florida Statute 943.0435 and must abide by 
all the corresponding requirements of the 
statute, a copy of which is attached hereto 
and incorporated herein. The defendant 
must provide a DNA sample in court at the 
time of this plea. Is this the -- and the 
attachments are the terms and conditions of 
community control. There are some 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032243
--- PAGE 7 ---
squiggles on the bottom of the page, what 
would those squiggles be? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Thank you, Your 
Honor, those are my client's signature 
acknowledging that we have gone over all 
the conditions. 
THE COURT: One page after the plea 
sheet that really spells out the terms and 
conditions of community control, Florida 
Statute 948.101, Mr. Epstein, is that 
squiggle at the bottom your squiggle? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Would those be your 
initials? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Did you read all of that 
page? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Can you read? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: How far did you go in 
school? 
THE DEFENDANT: High school. 
THE COURT: That's your highest 
degree? 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032244
--- PAGE 8 ---
J 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE COURT: And is this your 
signature on the plea sheet that recites 
the terms of the plea I just read? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Did you read that 
document as well? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: You understand once you 
do your 12 months followed by your six 
months all in the Palm Beach County jail 
you will then be put on community control 
which involves having an electronic monitor 
attached to you and --
MR. GOLDBERGER: Actually Your Honor, 
the agreement of the parties is to, it's 
community control one which is not monitor. 
THE COURT: Oh, community control 
one, is that spelled out in here? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes, it is, Your 
Honor. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: He does not fall 
under the Jessica Lunsford Act which 
requires the bracelet. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032245
--- PAGE 9 ---
THE COURT: Community control two. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: Community control one --
that would be no electronic monitor? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: That is correct. 
THE COURT: Now which of the terms 
and conditions of community control one are 
you incorporating? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: i can go through 
them with Your Honor. 
THE COURT: None of the them appear 
to be articulated in the plea sheet which 
is why I'm asking. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: These are the 
standard conditions of community control by 
statute would apply to anyone that goes on 
community control and out of an abundance 
of caution, we simply memorialized those 
standard conditions in the plea sheet 
agreement. 
THE COURT: The Court shall require 
intensive supervision and surveillance for 
an offender placed on community control 
which may include but is not limited to 
specified contact with the parole and 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032246
--- PAGE 10 ---
probation officer, specified by who? 
PROBATION OFFICER: Specified by you, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: I don't see that in the 
plea sheet. That's why I'm asking the 
questions. No one has specified how often, 
how frequently he is to have contact with 
his parole and probation officer. 
Confinement to an agreed upon residence 
during the hours away from employment and 
public service activity, has that been 
articulated? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: I believe 
Judge McSorley has a standard order 
somewhere on the bench up there regarding 
this, I'm told by the prosecutor. 
MS. LENHARDT: Judge, usually this is 
the probation sheet she hands out to folks. 
THE COURT: I have seen those 
sheets -- I have seen them incorporated in 
plea agreements which is why I'm asking. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: I see. 
THE COURT: Is there some reason you 
didn't use this particular document in this 
case? 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032247
--- PAGE 11 ---
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
I didn't realize 
until Ms. Lenhardt just told me that Judge 
McSorley has that. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: We'd be happy to 
execute that document, Your Honor. We were 
-- we overreacted by just having him sign 
off on all conditions of community control. 
THE COURT: Well, this is --
MR. GOLDBERGER: Perhaps the better 
practice would be --
THE COURT: This is, the reason 
Judge McSorley does this which makes 
ultimate sense is we're going to be here 
half the morning if we're going to decide 
among ourselves now what the --
MR. GOLDBERGER: That makes sense. 
THE COURT: I'm not going to leave 
this just unspecified. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: We can take care of 
that right now if you could give us a few 
minutes. 
THE COURT: All right. 
These are the standard conditions 
that Judge McSorley normally uses. If you 
like them, you need to circle the ones that 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

vd 
val0 
apply and everyone must initial them. We 
will go over it. If you wish to change 
you understand there is quite a bit of 
latitude given the court in putting 
somebody on community control. If you 
agree to some change, let me know, but 
understand at the outset that I'm a big fan 
of specificity. I want to know what he 
will be doing for employment. I want to 
know exactly where he is going to be living 
and I want it on the record now. It can 
change but it can only change with 
preapproval by DOC. I want it crystal 
clear. I don't want the community control 
officer who gets this case the day he walks 
out the Palm Beach County to have any doubt 
or confusion as to exactly what this 
defendant is supposed to do, where he is 
supposed to be when, exactly what I am 
requesting that officer to supervise. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Absolutely. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: We will work on it. 
Thank you, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: We will recall that case. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032249
--- PAGE 13 ---
(Brief recess.) 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Your Honor, we are 
back on Jeffrey Epstein, actually it 
worked, we had an opportunity to go through 
Judge McSorley's conditions of community 
control and we asked the Department of 
Corrections representative to assist us to 
make sure we did everything properly. 
They were very helpful and we executed the 
document. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes, and Your Honor, 
this defendant doesn't fall under the sex 
offender probation but we have included 
special sex offender conditions as part of 
the community control and they are all 
circled there. 
THE COURT: The plea agreement stated 
the defendant is designated as a sexual 
offender pursuant to Florida Statute 
942.035. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. But the 
sex offender probation, the statute is 
different and only applies to certain 
offenses and this one was not enumerated. 
THE COURT: Okay. I want to make 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032250
--- PAGE 14 ---
sure both I and the defendant are clear. 
The sexual offender statute you are 
referring to in the plea sheet is the one 
that requires registration? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Correct. 
THE COURT: And we will talk about 
that. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. 
THE COURT: But it is not the one 
that requires the special conditions of sex 
offender probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: Now, rather than 948, do 
you want me to disregard 948? He's read 
it? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: He's read it. 
THE COURT: We will leave it in 
there. But these conditions we are going 
to go over right now are going to be viewed 
in my mind, yes, and they have been signed 
by the defendant and we will go over that 
in a second as a part of the whole plea. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: So circled are 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032251
--- PAGE 15 ---
conditions, A, you will remain confined to 
your residence except one half hour before 
and after your approved employment, 
community service work or any other 
activity approved by your probation 
officer. 
B, you will maintain an hourly 
accounting of all your activities on a 
daily log which you will submit to your 
supervising officer upon request. 
My understanding about the daily 
log, maybe I'm just confused from other 
cases I've heard, is the daily log is a 
weekly log, I guess it is submitted ahead 
of time, is that correct? 
PROBATION OFFICER: That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: So part A, where he has 
to stay in his residence except for one 
hour before and after the approved 
employment, community service work and 
other activity. All that's information 
that will be recorded in writing and the 
defendant will have a copy and he will know 
exactly where he is supposed to be when. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032252
--- PAGE 16 ---
a 
PROBATION OFFICER: That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: As will his supervising 
probation officer. And then to document 
that he's supposedly done all that he 
himself will be keeping a daily log? 
PROBATION OFFICER: That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: And the log form will be 
provided by the department and he will be 
turning that in every time he meets with 
the probation officer? 
PROBATION OFFICER: That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. So that applies 
and F applies. Does E apply? No. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Did I circle E? 
THE COURT: No. F -- made one up, 
the defendant will be residing at 358 El 
Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, 33480. He 
knows now that that's where he will be 
living when he is released after his 12 
months and six months. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032253
--- PAGE 17 ---
THE COURT: That's a private 
residence? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: That is his home. 
THE COURT: Does he own the 
residence? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: He does, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Is there any possibility 
that he no longer owns the residence? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Not anticipated, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. Should he not be 
for whatever reason -- 18-months is a long 
time, should he not be owning that 
residence or able to reside there, he will 
have the obligation of notifying his 
probation officer prior, and I emphasize 
this, prior to his release 
assume that the department 
prior to, to his release? 
PROBATION OFFICER: That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: And then you would need 
to send someone to meet with him before he 
walks out of the Palm Beach County jail and 
verify his address and employment 
from 
will 
custody. I 
be notified 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032254
--- PAGE 18 ---
information? 
PROBATION OFFICER: That is correct. 
THE COURT: All address -- I assume 
all of this to and from work and any other 
approved activities restricts him to Palm 
Beach County, is that correct? 
PROBATION OFFICER: That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: So let's be clear, 
everything, from the day he walks out 
occurs in Palm Beach County, is that clear? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: We understand, Your 
Honor. That's correct. 
THE COURT: Then the additional 
condition of his probation, they are not 
sex offender standard conditions, they are 
just conditions that are being imposed 
especially in this case? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: They are as follows, you 
shall submit to a mandatory curfew from 10 
p.m. to 6:00 a.m. regardless of any other 
restrictions regarding work or approved 
activity, there will be no exceptions to 
being at home in house from 10 p.m. to 6 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032255
--- PAGE 19 ---
a.m., is that correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
THE COURT: If the victim was under 
age of 18 years which I gather is the case 
because it's circled, you shall not live 
within 1000 feet of a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place 
where children regularly congregate. 
Has someone verified that 358 El 
Brillo is such a place? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: No, but that will be 
done prior to his release. 
THE COURT: So 358 El Brillo will not 
be approved if it should happen to be one 
thousand feet from a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place --
this is rather open. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Where children 
gather. 
THE COURT: Where children regularly 
congregate. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Right. 
THE COURT: The Court knows 358 El 
Brillo Way is a residential neighborhood, 
are there areas there where children 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032256
--- PAGE 20 ---
regularly congregate? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: I personally do not 
know. 
THE COURT: Neither do I, which is 
why I'm asking. Has that been 
investigated? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: We have done our due 
diligence, for what it's worth, there is a 
residential street. There are not children 
congregating on that street. We think the 
address applies, if it doesn't, we fully 
recognize that he can't live there. 
THE COURT: Okay. D is, you shall 
not have any contact with the victim, are 
there more than one victim? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: There's several. 
THE COURT: Several, all of the 
victims. So this should be plural. I'm 
making that plural. You are not to have 
any contact direct or indirect, and in this 
day and age I find it necessary to go over 
exactly what we mean by indirect. By 
indirect, we mean no text messages, no 
e-mail, no Face Book, no My Space, no 
telephone calls, no voice mails, no 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032257
--- PAGE 21 ---
J 
messages through carrier pigeon, no 
messages through third parties, no hey 
would you tell so and so for me, no having 
a friend, acquaintance or stranger approach 
any of these victims with a message of any 
sort from you, is that clear? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am 
THE COURT: And then it states, 
unless approved by the victim, the 
therapist and the sentencing court. Okay. 
THE DEFENDANT: I understand. 
THE COURT: And the sentencing court. 
So, if there is a desire which, I would 
think would be a bit strange to have 
contact with any of the victims the court 
must approve it. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: If the victim was under 
the age of 18, which was the case, you 
shall not until you have successfully 
attended and completed the sex offender 
program. So, is this sex offender program 
becoming a condition of probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: That is not. I 
don't believe I circled that one. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032258
--- PAGE 22 ---
J 
THE COURT: You did. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: That's a mistake on 
our part. Actually the statute that he is 
pleading guilty to does not require the 
THE COURT: I understand that, but 
you circled it. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: I apologize, that 
B 
one is not. He has already been in 
treatment with a private psychiatrist. 
THE COURT: Which you find to be an 
adequate substitute for sex offender 
program? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: I -- it is not 
required and based upon the evaluation and 
my contact with that doctor, I don't 
believe it's necessary at this point. 
THE COURT: Has that been -- I assume 
you have a law degree and do not have a 
Ph.D in a psychology or MD in psychiatry? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: That is correct, I 
don't. 
THE COURT: So it is just your 
judgement --
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: -- that his treatment 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032259
--- PAGE 23 ---
i 
with some fancy private psychiatrist or 
psychologist in his case is okay? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: That is correct. 
THE COURT: So you are not imposing 
E? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: F, if the victim was 
under the age of 18, you shall not work or 
play or as a volunteer in any school, day 
care center, park, play ground or other 
place where children regularly congregate, 
is that understood? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Children will be defined 
as anyone under the age of 18. There are a 
lot of places where children regularly 
congregate. What kind of work do you do? 
THE DEFENDANT: Banking. 
THE COURT: Here in Palm Beach 
County? 
THE DEFENDANT: Virgin Islands, 
ma'am. 
THE COURT: You understand you will 
not travel from Palm Beach County for the 
duration of this?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Your Honor, I'm 
sorry to interrupt, we do cover the 
employment later in the agreement as to 
what he is going to be doing during the one 
year that he is on community control. 
THE COURT: Okay. And let me --
condition G, which is circled, unless 
otherwise indicated in the treatment plan 
provided by sexual offender treatment 
program. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: That's not in there. 
THE COURT: Is that what you want? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: No. 
THE COURT: But you do want the, you 
will not view, own or possess any obscene 
pornographic --
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: Okay. But are you saying 
that this therapist can okay him to own 
certain pornographic material? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: No, not at all. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: No, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Would be really helpful 
if people read these things before they

signed them thoroughly. 
Unless otherwise indicated in the 
treatment plan. I'm just going to strike 
out, provided by the sexual offender 
treatment program. Is that what you 
intend, that his therapist can 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: No. 
THE COURT: No? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: No. 
THE COURT: Unless otherwise 
indicated. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: The parties have 
agreed that during the period that he is 
cannot be --
THE COURT: Condition G will now 
read, you shall not view, own, possess any 
obscene, pornographic or sexually 
stimulating visual or auditory material 
including telephonic, electronic media, 
computer program or computer services that 
are relevant to your deviant behavior 
pattern. And who is going to enforce that?

control officer.

that? 
PROBATION OFFICER: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Since we have the 
pleasure of having someone from the 
Department of Corrections here. 
Okay. H, you shall submit two 
specimens of blood to the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement to be 
registered in the DNA data bank.

warrantless search by your probation 
officer or community control officer of 
your person, residence or vehicle.

one.

basis with what they have been given money 
to do. 
THE COURT: Who are some recent 
grantees? 
THE DEFENDANT: Harvard University. 
There is a full program of Evolutionary 
Dynamics, Neuro Science Institute of 
California, the Physics Institute, MIT. 
THE COURT: Do you ever have occasion 
to deal with anyone under the age of 
eighteen? 
THE DEFENDANT: Not very often. It 
is, if someone is in college -- sorry. 
THE COURT: Right, that's why I'm 
asking the question. 
THE DEFENDANT: Most of the people I 
fund are all usually professors. 
THE COURT: Thank you. You 
understand that you can't have contact with 
anyone if 
this organization, do they 
ever have any involvement with high 
schools? 
THE DEFENDANT: No, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Students or teachers? 
THE DEFENDANT: No, ma'am.

THE COURT: Okay. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Those are 
duplicates, you will see those are the same 
as the ones on the previous page, however, 
it was reproduced. 
THE COURT: The next condition, you 
shall maintain a driving log. You shall 
not drive a motor vehicle while alone 
without prior approval of your supervising 
officer. 
If there was sexual contact, you 
shall submit to at probationer's or 
community controllee's expense an HIV test 
with results to be released to the victims, 
victim's parent or guardian -- will be 
victims, plural. Has that been done? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Not yet. 
THE COURT: Do we have a time frame 
on that? I would think ASAP might be good 
on something like that. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: I believe they can 
actually do that at the jail. 
THE COURT: At his expense? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
THE COURT: I would request that that

be done within 48 hours? 
You shall not obtain or use a post 
office box without prior approval of the 
supervising officer. 
Okay. Are all those conditions 
you two have agreed to? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes, Your Honor. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: With the court's 
amendments, yes. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, do you 
understand? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: I need the defendant to 
sign number D where I had an s added to 
victim, and G, we struck out the otherwise 
indicated language. Otherwise, it is as 
you agreed. 
Mr. Epstein, do you understand 
this is a somewhat complicated terms of the 
plea that you've agreed to? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am 
THE COURT: Do you have any questions 
about the terms of the plea? 
THE DEFENDANT: No. 
THE COURT: Can I ask the State why 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032268
--- PAGE 32 ---
L_ 
you choose -- or defense and the State 
together, why twelve months in the Palm 
Beach County jail followed by six months? 
Why not just send him to DOC? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: It was the agreement 
of the parties, Your Honor. We just 
decided that was the best way to accomplish 
what needed to be done here and the parties 
agreed that that sentence satisfied 
everyone's requirements. 
THE COURT: The taxpayers of Palm 
Beach County is going to pay 18 months to 
house this guy instead of DOC? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Right. 
THE COURT: You understand we're 
losing positions left and right in county 
government because we haven't got enough 
money but you want -- okay. 
His requirement to register there 
is many, many -- 
there is nine pages 
outlining the sexual offender's requirement 
to register with the department and 
penalty, have you read all those, 
Mr. Epstein? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032269
--- PAGE 33 ---
i 
THE COURT: Do you understand you 
will be required to register and this will 
be an ongoing life long obligation? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: And this registration 
occurs when? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Within 48-hours of 
release. 
THE COURT: So when he gets out of 
the Palm Beach County jail, he needs to 
register? Okay. And the department -- who 
is going to provide him with the form? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: He actually 
registers out at the Sheriff's Office, Your 
Honor, we can do it out there. 
THE COURT: Okay. It has been 
brought to my attention that FDLE is the 
one who is statutorily required to handle 
these registrations but some of our 
municipal jurisdictions have taken it upon 
themselves to impose additional 
requirements, y'all understand that? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Right. 
THE COURT: What you are telling him 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032270
--- PAGE 34 ---
he has to do is the official State of 
Florida registration? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, I need to 
make sure you understand that that's what's 
required by this plea. Anyone on 
probation, community control is required to 
live and abide by the laws. So if a 
jurisdiction you choose to reside in should 
have some additional municipal requirements 
you will be required in order to comply 
with the law of living there, just like you 
can't get a parking ticket or speeding 
ticket, to comply with those regulations 
but I want to make sure you understand 
because I have seen some defendants who 
have been confused about this. If you 
don't, for example, if the Town of Palm 
Beach has you register that does not take 
care of your requirement. Your requirement 
to register with FDLE through the Sheriff's 
office is separate, distinct and must be 
done on their form according to their 
schedule. 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032271
--- PAGE 35 ---
THE COURT: And if my experience the 
last few months is of any value, they are 
very serious about enforcing this. They 
will be tracking you for the rest of your 
life. Do not move. Do not go -- I don't 
care when you are done with community 
control, they need to know exactly where 
you are and if you go anywhere without 
registering, they will find and you will be 
locked up. 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Okay. Any questions 
about that? 
THE DEFENDANT: No, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Did you read the plea in 
the circuit court form that describes all 
the rights you are giving up by entering 
this plea? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: I think I asked you 
before, can you read? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE COURT: Are you under the 
influence of alcohol, drugs or medication 
today? 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032272
--- PAGE 36 ---
THE DEFENDANT: No, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Normally taking any 
prescribed medication? 
THE DEFENDANT: Only for cholesterol. 
THE COURT: Does that interfere with 
your mental ability? 
THE DEFENDANT: No. 
THE COURT: Do you understand you 
have an attorney, you have a right to trial 
by jury, there is not going to be a jury 
trial. There won't be witnesses called. 
That your attorney and you would have a 
right to confront and cross examine, do you 
understand you have a right to call 
witnesses of your own and the court would 
issue subpoenas to compel their attendance 
just like any other witness called by the 
State, that you have the right -- absolute 
right to remain silent and that you would 
not have to say or do anything at the trial 
if there were a trial, do you understand 
those rights? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Do you understand if you 
are not a United States citizen your plea 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032273
--- PAGE 37 ---
could subject you to deportation pursuant 
to the laws and regulations governing the 
United States Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and this court has 
S 
no jurisdiction or authority in such 
matters, do you understand that? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes. 
THE COURT: Has anybody threatened 
you, coerced you or promised you anything 
other than the terms of this plea to get 
you to enter this plea? 
THE DEFENDANT: No. 
THE COURT: Do you understand this is 
a plea in criminal court? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: This has -- in criminal 
court in Palm Beach County, State of 
Florida. I have absolutely nothing to do 
with any civil matters or matters in any 
other jurisdiction, do you understand that? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Is this plea in any way 
tied to any promises or representations by 
any civil attorneys or other jurisdictions? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: May we come sidebar 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032274
--- PAGE 38 ---
on that, Your Honor? 
THE COURT: It is going to be 
recorded. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: That's fine. 
THE COURT: Defendant needs to 
approach as well. 
(Whereupon, there was a conference at 
the bench.) 
MR. GOLDBERGER: The reason why I 
asked to come sidebar, there is a 
nonprosecution agreement with the United 
States Attorney's office that triggers as a 
result of this plea agreement. In other 
words, they have signed off and said they 
will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the 
Southern District of Florida for any 
offense upon his successful taking of this 
plea today. That is a confidential 
document that the parties have agreed to. 
Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted 
to tell the court. 
THE COURT: I understand, that would 
also be invalidated should he violate his 
community control? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Absolutely. That 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032275
--- PAGE 39 ---
a 
a 
nonprosecution agreement --
MS. BELOHLAVEK: They spell all that 
out. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein needs to come 
closer. 
Mr. Epstein, your attorney has 
told me that in addition to everything, we 
talked about another Inducement, shall we 
say, to your taking this plea is that the 
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
the State of Florida, federal prosecutor, 
has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement 
with you, meaning that if you successfully 
complete probation and do everything you're 
supposed to, they have, have agreed not to 
prosecute you federally, did you understand 
that? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: And I would view that as 
a significant inducement in accepting this 
plea. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: They are actually in 
court here today, also. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: And the plea 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032276
--- PAGE 40 ---
agreement very carefully spelled out if 
there was a breach that would violate this 
agreement, so we are well aware of it. 
THE COURT: Okay. I would request 
that a sealed copy of that -- Mr. Epstein 
has signed that document? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes, I would like to 
seal the copy. 
THE COURT: I want a sealed copy of 
that filed in this case. That is the only 
other condition of the agreement that is
influencing this defendant to make this 
decision? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Absolutely. I think 
that's the right idea. 
I 
(Return to open court.)
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, is there 
anything else? 
THE DEFENDANT: No, ma'am. 
THE COURT: Because I don't take 
these pleas unless they are freely and 
voluntarily made. 
THE DEFENDANT: I understand that. 
THE COURT: I also don't want 
somebody or anybody coming back a year,

two years from now saying, oh no, no, they 
beat me over the head or if there is 
anything else that is influencing you to 
make this decision, then I need to know 
about it. 
THE DEFENDANT: I understand that. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Thank you. 
THE DEFENDANT: Thank you very much, 
Your Honor. 
(Return to open court.) 
THE COURT: All right, Mr. Epstein, 
any questions about the rights you are 
giving up by entering this plea? 
THE DEFENDANT: No ma'am. 
THE COURT: State, please give me a 
factual basis. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: In 069454 CF AMB, 
between August 1, 2004 and October 31, 
2005, the defendant in Palm Beach County 
did solicit or procure someone to commit 
prosecution on three or more occasions. 
And in 08 CF 9381 CF AMB between 
August 1, 2004 and October 9, 2005, the 
defendant did procure a minor under the age 
of 18 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032278
--- PAGE 42 ---
a 
County also. 
THE COURT: I find a sufficient 
factual basis to support the pleas. 
Are all of the victims in both of 
these cases in agreement with the terms of 
this plea? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: I have spoken to 
several myself and I have spoken to 
counsel, through counsel as to the other 
victim, and I believe, yes. 
THE COURT: And with regard to the 
victims under age eighteen, is that 
victim's parents or guardian in agreement 
with the plea? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: That victim is not 
under age 18 any more and that's why we 
spoke with her counsel. 
THE COURT: And she is in agreement 
with the plea? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
THE COURT: And community control 
will be given information concerning how to 
contact these victims? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
THE COURT: Confidentially. That

a 
information will not be related to the 
defendant but will be used exclusively for 
purposes of verifying compliance with this 
agreement? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes. 
THE COURT: Is there anything else 
from anybody else before I accept this 
plea? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: No, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Goldberger, if it is 
your desire, you may enter your client's 
plea. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Thank you, Your 
Honor, at this time we would withdraw our 
previously entered pleas of not guilty, 
enter pleas of guilty pursuant to 
negotiations with the State. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, I am going 
to accept those pleas on your behalf. I 
find you are intelligent, alert, you 
understand what is going on here and the 
consequence of entering this plea, you are 
doing it freely and voluntarily. 
Pursuant to the plea, I am waiving 
a PSI, I will sentence you at this time 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032280
--- PAGE 44 ---
pursuant to it. I will adjudicate you 
guilty of felony solicitation of 
prostitution, a third degree felony, case 
number 06 CF 00945A -- 454 AMB, and 
procuring a person under 18 for 
prostitution, a second degree felony 08 CF 
009381AMB. 
With respect to the solicitation 
of prosecution, I will sentence you to 
twelve months in the Palm Beach County 
detention facility with credit for the one 
day served. 
With respect to 08 CF 009381, I 
will sentence you to six months in the Palm 
Beach County detention facility, with 
credit for the one day served. That six 
month sentence is to be served consecutive 
to the twelve month sentence. 
Following the six month sentence 
you will be placed on 12 months of 
community control. That will be on both 
cases, I assume, to run concurrently, 
correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Only on the 08 case. 
THE COURT: Only on the second degree 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 
EFTA00032281

a 
• 
felony? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct, the one 
that designates him a sexual offender. 
THE COURT: Okay. So only on case 
number 08 CF 009381AMB will you be on one 
year community control which would then 
invoke a potential penalty of fifteen years 
were you to violate. 
The special conditions are that 
you are to have no unsupervised contact 
with minors and the supervising adult must 
be approved by the Department of 
Corrections. You are to be designated a 
sexual offender pursuant to Florida Statute 
943.0435 and you must abide by all 
requirements of that statute which I have 
read and we have discussed. 
You will remain confined to your 
residence except one half hour before and 
after your approved employment, community 
service work or other activities approved 
by your probation officer. You will 
maintain an hourly accounting of all your 
activity on a daily log which you submit to 
the supervising officer upon request.

elaborate devices there are to communicate 
electronically these days, okay. Good

Jenna, 
It was very shocking news, particularly given the entirety of the circumstances. And we appreciate the kind words, 
particularly given your experience—that's very kind and it's meaningful to hear. 
In terms of initial substantive questions, unfortunately I think we won't have robust answers quite yet—right now we 
don't have any additional information on civil forfeiture in particular, and I also don't know what if any options there are 
for us in terms of restitution (separate from the civil context). With respect to the investigation, we're not in a position to 
talk about specific possible paths forward, but we can say, consistent with a brief statement our Office put out this 
afternoon, that the investi ation remains ongoing—and in the coming days we can talk with more particularity about 
what that might mean for 
in particular. In the meantime, though, in terms of 
herself, we're continuing to 
try to see if there are imme late options for resources in the next 24 hours, but even if we are not able to do so 
tomorrow, certainly on Monday at the latest you and/or she can be in touch with our Office's specialists and/or the FBI 
folks. We certainly want her to have any support that would be useful, and we are happy to stay in touch about that—
please let us know especially if you think her situation is, or becomes, an emergency. 
Thank you again,

We were certainly saddened to see the news this morning, as I know all of you were. I appreciate that you have more 
EFTA00032290
--- PAGE 2 ---
pressing issues to deal with at the moment, but we are interested in whether you expect any aspect of the SDNY's 
investigation/case to continue, potentially a separate civil forfeiture proceeding, or possible criminal prosecutions against 
other defendants. We also understand that you may not be in a position to tell us anything at the moment, which is fine. 
Just anticipating and preparing for questions we expect to be asked. Separately, having had the experience of a defendant 
in a case I charged commit suicide, I wanted to add that it can be a complicated feeling, and to the extent it is helpful, I 
think you brought a really important case and conducted yourselves in a professional, compassionate and impressive way. 
So despite sad news, and frustrating news after putting so much work into filing a case and preparing to see it through, 
heads should be held high.

Good afternoon a 
I hope all is well. I understand the prosecution team has been walled off from the investigation. Do you have access to his 
records from his prior incarceration? If not do you have a contact for his prior facility or the USAO in Florida? I have been 
asked to track down certain documentation in reference thereto in relation to the various investigations into the incident this 
past weekend. 
Thank you,

Hi 
We are working on the Epstein death investigation and would like to proffer with Efrain Reyes, who was his cellmate up 
until the day he died. Reyes' lawyer is only available to do a proffer this Friday, and given the ongoing investigation, it 
will be difficult to make agents available for a takeout order. Would the USM make an exception and produce Reyes for a 
proffer on Friday? Thanks.

Dear Mr. Sweeney 
Ex UK Metropolitan Police detective, Jon Wedger, knows a lot about juvenile prostitution and child 
sexual abuse in the UK, and the fact that it generates a lot of money for the British establishment. 
He was persecuted by police and the British government because he was doing a good job, exposing 
the racketeering involving children's homes and V.I.P.s very high up in British society. He might be 
useful in your enquiries. 
Jon Wedger email numnut2009@hotmail.co.uk 
Here is an interview that he gave recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9TscJsVKp4
Procurer of children, Jimmy Savile, was on very close terms with royalty and politicians. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65p8J-WQbKI 
The British establishment pushed Chief Constable, Mike Veale, out of his job because he was doing 
an honest investigation into Jimmy Savile and his high level connections. Mr. Veale felt the need to 
make a public statement, but he was still kicked out for doing his job. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtWVtH8AuA4 
Jimmy Savile was protected by the British government for almost 50 years, and was even sent on 
'ambassadorial' missions to Israel. Why? He was a third rate entertainer and no more. He spent 11 
Christmases as the guest of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at her country residence, Chequers. He 
was a frequent guest at Buckingham Palace and, in one public interview, bragged that he had 
smuggled a small female child into the palace. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM RIWkE52w 
Yours sincerely, 
Jean James

The U.S. Supreme Court during oral arguments on Monday will be asked to 
create a clearer path to punitive damages in certain cases involving state 
sponsors of terrorism. It's just the latest chapter in a case that highlights the 
decadeslong legal battles that terrorist victims and their families often face in 
trying to recoup damages.

Coin Toss: Are Risk-Measuring Tools Accurate Enough? 
Most of the algorithms used to assess someone's risk of recidivism before they 
are released on bail are correct about 60 and 70% of the time — better than a 
coin flip, but still prone to misclassification, especially in cases that involve 
people of color. The tools' potential for error has left stakeholders clashing over 
their use.

Justice Denied For A NY Domestic Violence Survivor 
New York's Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act was enacted to reduce

it here raises the question of whether it will be applied at all, say Ross Kramer

A MESSAGE FROM THE EDITOR 
The push to deregulate law firm ownership rules is gaining 
steam. What makes this time around different? And what 
would changes in the rules mean for law firms, ALSPs, the 
Big Four, clients and beyond? With access to justice at its 
core, these efforts have implications for much more, but 
many law firm leaders aren't concerned or don't know what 
they'd do with a cash infusion if they got one. Dan Packel 
and Dylan Jackson dive into all of these angles, with accompanying pieces from our 
global newsroom on what the U.S. can learn from jurisdictions that have 
deregulated and what specific policies are being explored in states across the 
country.

So maybe my trial judge's ears were ringing. I just got a renewed scheduling order giving us March 4th off. So, no issue 
for next week. 
But, I am obviously still curious about your progress. We have deliberately sat on the sidelines since your appointment, 
but have quite a bit of information, documents, emails, est that may be relevant depending on your needs.

Bruce, 
We will be in a better position to answer your question tomorrow and will plan on getting back to you then. Hopefully, 
that does not cause too much of an inconvenience.

Subject: update 
Good afternoon, 
I am writing because my trial which was supposed to begin today has been moved to March 3rd. I asked the Court (EDNY) 
for March 4th off so I would be able to attend the status conference for Mr. Tartaglione and I explained briefly that there 
was a Curcio issue. That application was denied. 
So, I am wondering if you will be requesting more time to continue to review material and presumably get input from our 
firm. If so, then it may make sense to adjourn the conference. If you don't need more time, then I may make another 
EFTA00032314

request or ask Judge Karas to help. I don't think there is much else that will be done next week other than address the 
Curcio issue. 
Thank you.

Gloria, 
We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by 
the FBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing 
who should be able to 
hopefully help coordinate travel. Would you please provide 
with your new client's name as it appears on her

Subject: Priorities webpage -- draft 
Attached for your review is a draft Priorities webpage. There are further edits to be made — some formatting (for 
instance, putting dates in the right order or making sure that fonts and indentations are correct), some stylistic 
(e.g., the Combatting Corruption entries each begin with language akin to a headline while the others do not), 
and some more substantive (do we want to add or delete particular cases?). Also, the visuals that go with each 
subpage have not been completed. In some instances, that's because Nick has not located visuals that he thinks 
are usable or a good fit. In other places, he has identified visuals that he plans to add, but has yet to do so. That 
said, many of the subpages do have visuals. In order to view the visuals for any subpage, you hit the "Ctrl" key 
while clicking on the heading for the subpage — e.g., for Thwarting and Responding to Acts of Terror, you press 
on the "Ctrl" key and click on the heading Thwarting and Responding to Acts of Terror. I've also attached a link 
(below), which is easier to open for that subpage so that you can see how the subpages will look. Please let me 
know if you have questions. Thanks.

A staff member must observe all inmates confined in a continuous locked down status, such as administrative 
detention or disciplinary segregation, at least once in the first 30 minute period of the hour (example, 12:00 
a.m. — 12:30 a.m.) followed by another round in the second 30 minutes period of the same hour (example, 
12:30 am — 1:00 a.m.), thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be 
conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart. All observations must be

More Info for Email Admins 
Status rode: 5505.1.10 
This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by 
Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The 
error is reported by the recipient domain's email servers but most often it must be fixed 
by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above 
don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient try one or more of 
the following: 
The email address exists and is correct - Confirrn that the recipient address exists, is 
correct and is accepting messages. 
Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using 
directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in 
both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory. 
Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. 
EFTA00032370
--- PAGE 2 ---
Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address 
settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature. 
Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license 
assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to 
assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit). 
Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX 
record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make 
sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also. work with your 
domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.
