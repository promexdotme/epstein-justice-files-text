7. 
This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(a) and 1391(b) as a 
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
Factual Allegations 
8. 
At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") was an adult male in his 
early 50's. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
9. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2001, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell into Epstein's trap 
and became one of his victims. 
10. 
Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
11. 
Epstein's scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit underage girls. These 
underage girls were recruited ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2009   Page 3 of 7
in his Palm Beach mansion. Epstein, upon information and belief, generally sought out economically 
disadvantaged underage girls from Palm Beach County who would be enticed by the money being 
offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and who were perceived as less likely to 
complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made. 
12. 
Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. The underage 
victim would be brought or directed to Epstein's mansion, where she would be led up a flight of 
stairs to a room that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings. The girl would then 
find herself alone in the room with Epstein, who would be wearing only a towel. He would then 
remove his towel and lie naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. 
Epstein would then perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts. 
13. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe was recruited by another 
girl, who told her that she could make some money, but did not tell her what was involved. At all 
relevant times, the girl who recruited Jane Doe was acting on behalf of and as agent for Epstein. 
Jane was contacted by this girl by telephone. Jane was then picked up and brought to Epstein's 
mansion in Palm Beach. Once there, she was led up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage 
table. Epstein came into the room and directed Jane to remove her clothes and give him a massage. 
Jane was frightened and felt trapped. As directed by Epstein, Jane removed her clothes. Epstein 
then during the massage touched Jane on her breasts and vagina, and he grabbed her hand and placed 
it on his penis. Epstein masturbated himself during the massage. Epstein then left money for Jane. 
14. 
As a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experienced confusion, shame, 
humiliation and embarrassment, and has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN,

I 
---------------
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), by and through his attorneys, moves 
to dismiss Counts I and Ill of Plaintiff's Complaint as the causes of action are barred by 
the applicable statute of limitations.18nd 2 Rule 12(b)(6); Local Gen. Rule 7.1 (S.D. Fla. 
2009). In support of dismissal, Defendant states: 
Plaintiff's Complaint attempts to allege three Counts; the first two counts are 
pursuant to state common law, and the third count is brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§2255. Civil remedy for personal injuries. Count I attempts to allege a cause of action 
for "Sexual Assault and Battery," Count II for "Intentional Infliction of Emotional 
Plaintiffs Complaint attempts to assert both state common law claims and a claim pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. §2255. Since Jane Doe 8 did not relinquish her state claims and correspondingly did not file her 
complaint relying, exclusively, on 18 USC 2255, she is not entitled to the litigation benefits including 
certain waivers that directly or indirectly accrue to other civil plaintiffs from the defendant's fulfilling 
obligations resulting from his separate confidential agreement with the United Staes Attorney's Office. 
Plaintiff's counsel conceded that the provisions of the NPA are not implicated where a plaintiff brings 
additional causes of action and does not proceed exclusively under §2255. See June 12, 2009, Hearing 
Transcript in Jane Doe, et al v. Epstein, Case No. 08-80119-Civ-Marra, p. 29, line 19-25, p. 30, line 1. 
Undersigned counsel provided the United States Attorneys' Office a copy of this Motion on July 9, 
2009. We requested confirmation that this motion did not involve any aspect of the Non Prosecution 
Agreement and advised of our required filing date. No response was received from the USAO.

Distress;" and Count Ill for "Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in Violation of 
U.S.C. §2422," pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255. 
Pursuant to the allegations on the face of Plaintiff's complaint, Count I, based on 
Florida's common law of assault and battery, and Count Ill, brought pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. §2255, are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Although a statute of 
limitations bar to a claim is an affirmative defense, and a plaintiff is not required to 
negate an affirmative defense in her complaint, a Rule 12(b )(6) dismissal on statute of 
limitations grounds is appropriate where, as here, "it is 'apparent from the face of the 
complaint' that the claim is time-barred." 
See generally, La Grasta v. First Union 
Securities. Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 -846 (11 th Cir. 2004). 
Count I is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
As to Count I, which is plead pursuant to state law, it is well settled that this Court 
is to apply Florida law. 
Erie R.Co. v. Tompkins, 58 S.Ct. 817 (1938). Pursuant to 
Florida law, the statute of limitations for assault and battery is four years, §95.11 (3)(o)., 
Fla. Stat. §95.11 (3)( o ), Fla. Stat., provides -
Actions other than for recovery of real property shall be commenced as 
follows: 
* 
* 
* 
(3) Within four years.-
• . . 
(o) An action for assault, battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, 
malicious interference, false imprisonment, or any other intentional tort, 
except as provided in subsections (4 ), (5), and (7). 
In her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges in relevant part that -
.... In or about 2001, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell 
into Epstein's trap and became one of his victims. 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/14/2009   Page 3 of 6
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 3 
According to the allegations of the Complaint, Jane Doe had one encounter with 
Defendant at his Palm Beach mansion in or about 2001 when Jane was approximately 
years old. See Complaint, ,J13, endnote 1 hereto.1 Based on the allegations of the 
Complaint, it has been at least 8 years since the alleged conduct by EPSTEIN, well past 
the four year statute of limitations, thus requiring dismissal of Count I. Based on the 
allegations, Plaintiff is now at least 24 years old. 
Subsections (4) and (5) referenced in §95.11 (3)(o) are not applicable. Plaintiff 
may attempt to argue that subsection (7) of §95.11, Fla. Stat. applies. See endnote 2 
hereto for statutory text of subsection (7), including statutes referenced therein.2 
However, a review of Plaintiff's allegations in Count I establish that Plaintiff is attempting 
to assert a cause of action based on the elements of Florida's common law assault and 
battery to which a four year statute of limitation applies. 
(Compare Count II, ,J24, 
wherein Plaintiff tracks the language §39.01 (2), Fla. Stat. (2001 ), pertaining to "abuse."). 
Pursuant to Florida law, although the term "assault and battery" is most 
commonly referred to as if it were a legal unit, or a single concept, "assault and battery 
are separate and distinct legal concepts, assault being the beginning of an act which, if 
consummated, constitutes battery." 3A Fla.Jur.2d Assault §1. An assault and battery 
are intentional acts. See generally, Spivey v. Battaglia, 258 So.2d 815 (Fla. 1972); and 
Travelers lndem. Co. v. PCR. Inc., 889 So.2d 779 (Fla. 2004). 
On the face of the Complaint, the applicable four year statute of limitations has 
expired, and accordingly, Count I is barred an required to be dismissed. 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/14/2009   Page 4 of 6
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page4 
Count 111-18 U.S.C. §2255 
As to the applicable statute of limitations for Count Ill which is brought pursuant to 
U.S.C. §2255, §2255(b), (both the 2001 version, which Defendant asserts is the 
applicable statute, and the amended version, effective July 27, 2006), provides: 
(b) Statute of limitations.-Any action commenced under this section 
shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right 
of action first accrues or in the case of a person under a legal disability, 
not later than three years after the disability. 
As noted above, according to the allegations of the Complaint, Jane Doe had one 
encounter with Defendant at his Palm Beach mansion in or about 2001 when Jane was 
approximately 16 years old. See Complaint, ,J13, endnote 1 hereto. Based on the 
allegations of the Complaint, it has been at least 8 years since the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN, well past the six year statute of limitations, thus requiring dismissal of Count 
Ill. Based on the allegations, Plaintiff is now at least 24 years old, well pass the age of 
majority. (The age of majority under both federal and state law is 18 years old. See 18 
U.S.C. §2256(1), defining a "minor" as "any person under the age of eighteen years;" 
and §1.01, Definitions, Fla. Stat., defining "minor" to include "any person who has not 
attained the age of 18 years."). Thus, on the face of the Complaint, Count Ill is timed 
barred and required to be dismissed. 
Conclusion 
Accordingly, Counts I and Ill of Plaintiff's Complaint are subject to dismissal. On 
the face of the Complaint, the causes of action which Plaintiff attempts to allege are 
barred by the applicable statute of limitations of 4 and 6 years, respectively.

recruited Jane Doe was acting on behalf of and as an agent for Epstein. Jane was 
contacted by this girl by telephone. Jane was then picked up and brought to 
Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach. Once there, she was lead up a flight of stairs to 
the room with the massage table. Epstein came into the room and directed Jane 
to remove her clothes and give him a massage. Jane was frightened and felt 
trapped. As directed by Epstein, Jane removed her clothes. Epstein then during 
the massage touched Jane on her breasts and vagina, and he grabbed her hand 
and placed it on his penis. Epstein masturbated himself during the massage. 
Epstein then left money for Jane.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CV-80802-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE NO. 8,  
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,  
Defendant. 
____________________________________/ 
PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO. 8’s MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN  
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 8, submits this Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion to 
Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint, pursuant to S.D.Fla.L.R. 7.1(C), as follows:  
INTRODUCTION 
As with the related cases in this Court against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, Plaintiff Jane Doe 
No. 8 alleges that she was the victim of a plan and scheme by Defendant Epstein to lure her to his 
Palm Beach mansion, where he sexually molested her.  The Complaint in this case sets forth state 
law claims and a federal law claim under 18 U.S.C. §§2422 and 2255.  Defendant relies exclusively 
on the statute of limitations as grounds for dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).   
With respect to Plaintiff’s state law causes of action for assault and battery, Defendant 
incorrectly applies a four-year statute of limitations.  Florida Statute §95.11 is clear that a seven-year 
statute of limitations applies to the state law claims alleged by Plaintiff.  As a result, the state law 
cause of action for assault and battery is timely.   
In contending that Plaintiff’s federal claim should be dismissed based on the statute of 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 1 of 10

- 2 - 
limitations, Defendant wrongly assumes that this claim accrued on the date when Defendant’s 
wrongful conduct occurred.  Defendant’s argument fails to recognize that the “discovery rule” is 
applicable, which provides that an action does not accrue until the Plaintiff knew or should have 
known of both her injuries and their cause.  Given the nature of the discovery rule and the factual 
inquiry it necessitates in the context of childhood sexual abuse, Plaintiff’s federal claim is not 
susceptible to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss should be denied in its entirety.  
ARGUMENT 
I. 
DISMISSAL IS NOT WARRANTED UNDER  
FED.R.CIV.P. 12(b)(6) AS TO ANY OF PLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS 
Defendant moves for dismissal of Counts I and III of the Complaint exclusively on grounds 
of statute of limitations, which is an affirmative defense.  Such a dismissal “is appropriate only if its 
is apparent from the face of the complaint that the claim is time barred.”  Tello v Dean Witter 
Reynolds, Inc., 410 F.3d 1275, 1288 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).  “This standard for dismissal 
can be met only if the complaint shows the date on which the time-barred claim accrued.”  Durden v. 
Citicorp Trust Bank, 2008 WL 2098040 *3 (M.D.Fla. 2008) (citing Avco Corp. v. Precision Air 
Parts, Inc., 676 F.2d 494, 495-96 (11th Cir. 1982)) (emphasis supplied).  Accord Del Monte Fresh 
Produce Co. v. Dole Food Co., 136 F.Supp. 2d 1271, 1294 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (Gold, J.) (“[t]he 
absence of an indication of the date on which Del Monte discovered the alleged misappropriations 
prevents the Court from determining from the face of the complaint at what time Del Monte’s 
actions accrued.”).  It is not apparent  from the Complaint in this case that any of Plaintiff’s claims 
are time barred.   In particular, nowhere does the Complaint allege the date on which any of her 
claims accrued.  Therefore, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss must be denied in its entirety.

II. 
COUNT I OF COMPLAINT IS NOT TIME BARRED UNDER THE 
SEVEN-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, FLA. STAT. §95.11(7) 
Count I (assault and battery) and Count II (intentional infliction of emotional distress) allege 
claims under state law. 1
The Complaint in this case alleges “abuse” under the broad definition of §39.01.  Specifically, Count 
I alleges willful acts (Complaint ¶¶ 8-13, 18-19); resulting in physical, mental or sexual injury 
(Complaint ¶¶ 13,17); that cause or are likely to cause the child’s physical, mental or emotional 
   Defendant asserts that Count I should be dismissed because a four-year 
statute of limitations applies to that claim, and it is apparent from the face of the Complaint that 
Plaintiff filed her claim past this limitations period.   Defendant recognizes that, for this argument to 
succeed, he must establish that Fla.Stat. §95.11(7), providing a seven-year limitations period after the 
Plaintiff reaches the age of majority for claims based on abuse, is inapplicable in this case.  A review 
of the language of the Statute, however, and applying basic tenets of statutory construction, reveal 
that §95.11(7) is clearly the statute of limitations pertinent to Plaintiff’s state law claims.   
Section 95.11(7) provides a seven-year limitations period, as follows:  
(7) For intentional torts based on abuse. – An action founded on 
alleged abuse, as defined in s. 39.01, . . . may be commenced at any 
time within 7 years after the age of majority, or within 4 years after 
the injured person leaves the dependency of the abuser, or within 4 
years from the time of discovery by the injured party of both the 
injury and the causal relationship between the injury and the abuse, 
whichever occurs later.  
The term “abuse” is defined in Fla.Stat. §39.01(2) as follows:  
“Abuse” means any willful act or threatened act that results in any 
physical, mental or sexual injury or harm that causes or is likely to 
cause the child’s physical, mental, or emotional health to be 
significantly impaired.  
Defendant did not move for dismissal of Count II. 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 3 of 10

- 4 - 
health to be significantly impaired (Complaint ¶¶ 14, 20).  Under §95.11(7), therefore, the Plaintiff 
has until seven years after she reaches the age of majority to bring suit (i.e. until she is 25 years old), 
or within four years from the time she discovers both the injury and the causal relationship between 
the injury and abuse, whichever occurs later.  Accordingly, the statute of limitations cannot expire 
before the Plaintiff’s 25th birthday, and her Count I claim is timely under §95.11(7). 
Defendant nonetheless asserts that the pertinent limitations provision is §95.11(3)(o), 
providing a four-year limitation period, not §95.11(7).  Section 95.11(3)(o), lists causes of action 
subject to a four-year limitations period, as follows:  
An action for assault, battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, 
malicious interference, false imprisonment, or any other intentional 
tort, except as provided in subsections (4), (5), and (7). 
(Emphasis supplied).  Section 95.11(3)(o), by its express terms, is subject to an exception, as 
provided in § 95.11(7).  The plain meaning of this language is that an intentional tort claim alleging 
“abuse” against a child, as described in Fla.Stat. §39.01, is controlled by §95.11(7), which trumps 
§95.11(3)(o).  The seven-year limitations period (or four years after discovery) thus applies in this 
case.  See H.T.E. v. Tyler Technologies, Inc., 217 F.Supp. 2d 1255, 1259 (M.D. Fla. 2002) (where 
language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute must be given its plain and obvious 
meaning).  
Defendant nonetheless seems to argue that §95.11(3)(o) applies because it expressly 
references the intentional torts of assault and battery, ignoring that the Complaint at issue alleges 
“abuse” as defined in Florida Statute §§95.11(7) and 39.01(2).  This is a strained and plainly 
incorrect construction of the language in §§95.11(3)(o) and 95.11(7).  Defendant essentially contends 
that only a claim of “abuse” would be controlled by §95.11(7), while other intentional torts would 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 4 of 10

- 5 - 
necessarily fall under §95.11(3)(o).  However, as one Court has recognized, there is no Florida cause 
of action for abuse, and §95.11(7) did not create one.  Zlotogura v. Geller, 681 So.2d 778 (Fla. 3d 
DCA 1996).  Accordingly, if §95.11(7) is to have any meaning, it necessarily must encompass claims 
of assault and battery and other intentional torts involving “abuse” upon a child as defined in 
§39.01(2).  
Even assuming that §§95.11(3)(o) and 95.11(7) were ambiguous, it is a basic rule of statutory 
construction that two sections are to be read in para materia, such that all sections are given effect 
and are read as a consistent whole.  H.T.E., 217 F.Supp. 2d at 1259.  Doing so in this case compels 
the conclusion that the seven-year limitation of §95.11(7) applies to Plaintiff’s Count I claim.  
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count I must accordingly be denied.  
III. 
THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT SHOW ON ITS FACE  
THAT PLAINTIFF’S COUNT III CLAIM IS TIME BARRED 
Count III of the Complaint alleges a claim of coercion and enticement to sexual activity 
against a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422.  A victim who suffers personal injuries as a result of 
a violation of this statutory provision is granted a private right of action under 18 U.S.C. §2255.  A 
limitations provision is included on this statute at subsection (b), which provides that a claim is 
barred unless it is brought “within six years after the rights of action first accrues or in the case of a 
person under a legal disability, not later than three years after disability.”2
Under Florida law, a person is under a disability as a minor until age 18.  See Fla. Stat. §743.07. 
  The pertinent issue, then, 
for purposes of this statute of limitations, where the victim is over the age of 21, is when the action 
accrued.  Defendant Epstein assumes in his Motion to Dismiss that the action accrued on the date 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 5 of 10

- 6 - 
when Epstein’s sexual misconduct occurred.3
A claim does not necessarily accrue when the wrongful conduct occurs.  Rather, the 
“discovery rule” applies to accrual of federal causes of action.  See White v. Mercury Marine, 129 
F.3d 1428, 1435 (11th Cir. 1997) (noting that use of word “accrue” indicated approval of discovery 
rule in statute of limitations in accordance with federal precedents adopting discovery rule).  Under 
this rule, an action accrues “when the plaintiff knew or should have known of his injury and its 
cause.”
  That assumption is incorrect under federal law and the 
allegations of the Complaint.  
The Motion to Dismiss asserts that “it has been at least 8 years since the alleged conduct by 
EPSTEIN, well past the six year statute of limitations, thus requiring dismissal of Count III.”  
(Motion to Dismiss, p. 4).  
The case of Smith v. Husband, 376 F.Supp. 2d 603 (E.D.Va. 2005) is inapposite.  While that case 
was brought under 18 U.S.C. §2255 for a violation of 18 U.S.C. §2251, alleging sexual exploitation 
of a minor for the purpose of producing a sexually explicit videotape, the plaintiff did not argue the 
discovery rule.  Rather, the plaintiff contended that the continuing violation rule applied to toll the 
statute of limitations, which the Court rejected.  As a result, the Court never considered application 
of the discovery rule.  
  Id. (emphasis supplied).  See also Lavellee v. Listi, 611 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir. 1980) (in 
a case analyzing accrual under federal law for a civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983, noting 
that the Supreme Court in United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 100 S.Ct. 352 (1979), “has 
rejected the standard which would allow the statute of limitations to commence running before the 
plaintiff was or should have been aware of the causal connection between his injury and the acts of 
defendants”) (emphasis supplied).  Accord Diaz v. United States, 165 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir. 
1999) (in wrongful death case under Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), holding that claim accrues 
when the plaintiff knows or should have known both of the decedent’s death and its causal 
connection to the government); Stoleson v. United States, 629 F.2d 1265, 1270-71(7th Cir. 1980) 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 6 of 10

- 7 - 
(holding that claim under FTCA did not accrue until the plaintiff had knowledge of a causal 
connection “to tie together” the breach of duty and her injury); Skwira v. United States, 344 F.3d 64, 
76-83 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 903 (2004) (holding that discovery rule, requiring that 
accrual does not occur before the plaintiff knew or should have known of injury and its causal 
connection to the defendant, applies outside the medical malpractice context).  
In  a case where a minor is sexually abused, or wrongfully enticed or coerced into sexual 
activity by an adult, the victim is unlikely in the exercise of reasonable diligence to be (i) 
immediately aware of her injuries given the subtle and pernicious effects of childhood sexual abuse; 
or (ii) able to connect those injuries to the defendant’s misconduct.  See Doe v. Paukstat, 863 
F.Supp. 884, 890-91 (E.D. Wis. 1994) (noting that application of discovery rule in case of childhood 
sexual abuse is “amorphous”, and holding that when cause of action for abuse accrues is a question 
for the trier-of-fact); cf. R.L. v. Voytac, 971 A.2d 1074 (N.J. 2009) (holding that “it is necessary to 
consider all relevant facts and circumstances”, including expert psychological testimony, in applying 
discovery rule to claim of childhood sexual abuse, and that the issue is “when the injured party in 
fact discovered, or when a reasonable person subjected to child sexual abuse should have discovered, 
that the claimed injury was causally related to the asserted child abuse by the defendant”).  The 
determination of when the limitations period accrues under the discovery rule, in a case involving the 
defendant’s sexual misconduct with a minor, therefore, requires a detailed and complex factual 
inquiry.  The date of accrual certainly is not obvious nor is it otherwise alleged in the Plaintiff’s 
Complaint.5
As discussed in §I above, dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on statute of limitations grounds is 
only appropriate when the date of accrual is alleged in the complaint itself.  
   As a result, Count III cannot be dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on the basis of 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2009   Page 7 of 10

It would also be inappropriate to dismiss this case on limitations grounds because Defendant has 
argued in one of the related cases that 18 U.S.C. §2255 requires a prior federal conviction.  (See Jane 
Doe 101 v. Epstein, case no. 09-CV-80591, Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint, p. 15, 
§II(A), DE 29).  If that argument were correct then the Plaintiff’s claim in Count III has not yet 
accrued.  Defendant should not be heard to whipsaw the Plaintiffs and take such inconsistent 
positions in these related cases.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CV-80802-MARRA-JOHNSON 
JANE DOE NO. 8 
Plaintiff, 
V. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
------------~! 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S REPLY TO PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN 
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT. dated 08/12/09 
Defendant EPSTEIN, by and through his attorneys, replies to Plaintiff JANE DOE 
No. 8's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint, 
("memorandum"), dated August 12, 2009. In support of dismissal of Count I - "Sexual 
Assault and Battery" and Count Ill - "Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in 
Violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422," based on the statute of limitations, Defendant replies: 
Introduction 
Defendant's position is that Counts I and Ill are each barred by the applicable 
statute of limitations. 
Since the issues in parts I and II of Plaintiff's memorandum 
overlap, Defendant will address those parts together in I and II herein. 
Part Ill 
addresses the statute of limitations for Count Ill, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. §2255{b). 
I. 
Plaintiff's Complaint on its face does show the date that her claims accrued. 
II. 
Based on the Complaint allegations. §95.11 (7). Fla. Stat .• does not apply to 
Count I - Assault and Battery; thus, such claim is time barred. 
Pursuant to the allegations on the face of Plaintiff's complaint, Count I, based on 
Florida's common law of assault and battery, and Count Ill, brought pursuant to 18 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 2 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page2 
U.S.C. §2255, are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
Plaintiff and 
Defendant are in agreement that a Rule 12(b}(6) dismissal on statute of limitations 
grounds is appropriate where "it is 'apparent from the face of the complaint' that the 
claim is time-barred." See generally, La Grasta v. First Union Securities, Inc., 358 F.3d 
840, 845 -846 (11 th Cir. 2004). 
However, contrary to Plaintiff's assertion in section I, p. 2, of her memorandum, 
based on the allegations of the Complaint, Plaintiff's claims alleged in Count I and Ill are 
time barred. Plaintiff now attempts to rely on the "discovery rule" in an effort to argue 
that the cause of action accrued at some later date; however, and significantly, there 
are no allegations in Count I that implicate application of the discovery rule which is 
codified in Florida Statute §95.11 (7). 
Hearndon v. Graham, 767 So.2d 1179 (Fla. 
2000). Hearndon dealt with the accrual of a cause of action where a plaintiff alleges 
that she suffered from traumatic amnesia caused by childhood sexual abuse. The 
Florida Supreme Court answered the following question in the affirmative: 
Where a plaintiff in a tort action based on childhood sexual abuse alleges that 
she suffered from traumatic amnesia caused by the abuse, does the delayed 
discovery doctrine postpone accrual of the cause of action? 
The Hearndon plaintiff filed her complaint in 1991 against her stepfather for 
injuries from alleged sexual abuse committed upon her beginning in 1968 when she 
was 8, and continuing until 1975 when she turned 15. She further alleged that she 
suffered from "'traumatic amnesia,' or a related syndrome [until approximately 1988], 
caused by the abuses allegedly perpetrated by [the defendant], thereby explaining why 
earlier commencement of the action had not been possible." Id, at 1181. The plaintiff 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 3 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page3 
claimed the sexual abuse caused her to suppress or lose her memory for several years. 
The Supreme Court noted that in reaching its decision allowing the accrual of the action 
to be delayed, it was not passing on the merits of whether she actually lost and then 
retrieved her memory, or on the reliability of any of the psychological techniques used to 
bring back the memories of the abuse. 
As noted in Hearndon, the Florida Legislature codified the discovery rule 
in intentional abuse cases when it enacted §95.11 (7), Fla.Statutes. 
§95.11 (7) was 
found not to apply in Hearndon because the alleged sexual abuse occurred from 1968 
to 1975, and the abuse was not recalled until 1988. The plaintiff filed her complaint in 
1991. 
The statute became effective in 1992. 
See endnote 1 herein; Davis v. 
Monhanan, 832 So.2d 708, 709-10 (Fla. 2002)(The Florida Legislature has imposed a 
delayed discovery rule in cases of professional malpractice, medical malpractice, and 
intentional torts based on abuse, there is no other statutory basis for application of the 
delayed discovery rule to delay the accrual of a cause of action). The discussion in 
Hearndon remains relevant as it explains how and when the statutory discovery rule 
applies, and its effect on the accrual of a cause of action. 
The Hearndon decision should be read in conjunction with Davis v. Monahan, 832 
So.2d 708 (Fla. 2002). 
In Davis, the Florida Supreme Court made clear that the 
statutory codification of the delayed discovery rule only applies to those causes of 
actions enumerated in §95.11, Fla.Stat., and refused to extend the ruling in Hearndon to 
causes of action not based on the statutory enumerated exceptions or to causes of 
actions not based on allegations of childhood sexual abuse where a plaintiff has 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 4 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page4 
traumatic amnesia or a repressed memory type condition. In refusing to broaden the 
ruling in Hearndon and apply the delayed discovery doctrine to claims for breach of 
fiduciary duty, conversion, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment, the Florida Supreme 
Court, Davis, supra at 712, stated: 
While we applied the delayed discovery doctrine to causes of action arising 
out of childhood sexual abuse and repressed memory in Hearndon, we did so 
only after considering the unique and sinister nature of childhood sexual abuse, 
as well as the fact that the doctrine is applicable to similar cases where the 
tortious acts cause the delay in discovery. We also considered the Legislature's 
endorsement in amending section 95.11 (7), Florida Statutes (1999), to include 
intentional torts based on abuse and the fact that the application of the doctrine 
among the states is both the majority rule and modern trend. In this case, there 
is no modern trend or statutory endorsement, and Monahan did not allege 
fraud, so there was no specific allegation that Davis or Kish's actions caused 
Monahan's delayed discovery. 
Plaintiff is correct that part of the analysis as to whether a particular claim is time 
barred involves an analysis as to when a particular cause of action has accrued. Under 
Florida law, a statute of limitations "runs from the time the cause of action accrues" 
which, in turn, is generally determined by the date "when the last element constituting 
the cause of action occurs." § 95.031, Fla. Stat.1 See generally State Farm Mut. Auto. 
Ins. Co. v. Lee, 678 So.2d 818, 821 (Fla.1996)("[A] cause of action cannot be said to 
have accrued, within the meaning of the statute of limitations, until an action may be 
brought."); and Florida Power & Light Co. v. Allis Chalmers Corp., 85 F.3d 1514, 
§95.031, Fla.Stat., provides in relevant part : 
... the time within which an action shall be begun under any statute of limitations runs from 
the time the cause of action accrues. 
(1) A cause of action accrues when the last element constituting the cause of action occurs. 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 5 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page5 
rehearing denied (11 th Cir. 1996)(Cause of action accrues for limitations purposes when 
last element constituting cause of action occurs and plaintiff knew or should have 
discovered injury). Further, and significantly, the fact that a plaintiff does not know the 
full extent of his or her injury and that the most substantial damages do not occur until 
later date does not postpone running of limitations periods. Id. See also Penthouse 
North Ass'n, Inc. v. Lombardi, 461 So.2d 1350, 1352 (Fla. 1984)("A statute of limitation 
does not commence to run until the cause of action accrues. A cause of action does 
not accrue until someone has been damaged by the acts complained of."). 
As alleged in the Complaint, JANE DOE NO. 8 had one "encounter with Epstein" 
at his Palm Beach mansion "in or about 2001" when she was "then approximately 16 
years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one of his victims." Comp. 1]9, 13-14. 
She further alleges that at the time of the one encounter, she "was frightened and felt 
trapped," and "as a result of this encounter with Epstein, [she] experienced confusion, 
shame, humiliation and embarrassment, and has suffered severe psychological and 
emotional injuries." Comp. 1]13-14. On the face of the Complaint, Plaintiff was aware 
that she was damaged at the time of the encounter complained. 
Because Plaintiff was allegedly a minor at the time, under Florida law, Plaintiff 
could not have brought the action in her own right. Both Plaintiff and Defendant are in 
agreement that the legal disability based on one being a minor is generally removed 
once a person turns 18 years of age. 
(JDS memorandum, fn. 2). 
Based on the 
allegations, it has been at least 8 years since Plaintiff "fell into Epstein's trap and 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 6 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page6 
became one of his victims; and Plaintiff is now at least 24 years old; Plaintiff turned 18 
at least 6 years ago, well pass the applicable 4 year statute of limitations. 
Under Florida law, the statute of limitations for assault and battery is 4 years, 
§95.11 (3)(o). See Defendant's Motion To Dismiss Complaint, dated July 14, 2009, [DE 
8], for discussion as to why §95.11 (7), Fla. Stat., does not apply to Plaintiff's Count I for 
"sexual assault and battery." See endnote 1 hereto for statutory text of subsection (7), 
including statutes referenced therein.1 
In her memorandum, Plaintiff attempts to rely on the statutory definition of 
"abuse" as set forth in §39.01 (2), Fla. Stat., and claims that she has "until 7 years after 
she reaches the age of majority to bring suit (i.e. until she is 25 years old), or within 4 
years from the time she discovers both the injury and the causal relationship between 
the injury and abuse, whichever occurs later." As noted above, there are no allegations 
of repressed memory or similar type traumatic amnesia. In fact, the allegations reveal 
that after the alleged one encounter, Plaintiff knew immediately that she suffered 
damage in or about 2001, when she was 16. She could have brought the action in 2003 
in her own right when she turned 18. She is now at least 24 years old. 
A review of the Count I allegations establish that Plaintiff is attempting to assert a 
claim for Florida's common law assault and battery to which a 4 year statute of limitation 
applies. See Defendant's motion to dismiss. As noted in fn. 1 of her memorandum, 
Defendant is not seeking dismissal of Count II as in i]24, Plaintiff tracks the language of 
§39.01 (2), Fla. Stat., pertaining to "abuse." 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 7 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page? 
If this Court were to agree with Plaintiff's position that she has adequately pied a 
claim based on sex abuse in Count I, (which she has not), then either Count I or Count 
II - Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress is required to be dismissed as neither is "a 
free-standing tort" because both counts reallege the same underlying facts and 
damages. See Tobin v. Damian, 772 So.2d 13, fn. 1 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000). In discussing 
plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress the Court determined that it 
was "not a free-standing tort" because it "realleges the same facts mentioned in 
appellant's sexual abuse claims and fails to provide any additional facts." Citing to 
Fridovich v. Fridovich, 598 So.2d 65, 69-70 (Fla. 1992)(holding that no separate cause 
of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress existed where plaintiff merely 
renamed the initial cause of action and repled the same facts). 
Accordingly, Count I is required to be dismissed as the applicable statute of 
limitations has expired. In the alternative, either Count I or Count II is required to be 
dismissed as they are duplicative claims as opposed to free-standing torts. 
Ill. 
The Complaint on its face shows that Count Ill is time barred. 
Count Ill is brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, which contains its own statute of 
limitations in subsection (b). The language of §2255(b) is clear and unambiguous -
"Any action commenced under this section shall be barred unless the complaint is filed 
within six years after the right of action first accrues or in the case of a person under a 
legal disability, not later than three years after the disability."2 Plaintiff now attempts to 
"The primary principle of statutory construction requires courts to give effect to the plain 
meaning of the words used "in their ordinary and usual sense." Caminetti v. U.S., 242 U.S. 470 
(1917). To the extent possible, the rules of statutory construction require courts to give meaning 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/20/2009   Page 8 of 10
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page8 
argue that the delayed discovery doctrine applies although there are no allegations in 
the Complaint which implicate its application. 
The "delayed discovery" doctrine generally provides that a cause of action does not 
accrue until the plaintiff either knows or reasonably should know of the tortious act 
giving rise to the cause of action. 
The United States Supreme Court applied the 
"blameless ignorance" doctrine in Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 170, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 
L.Ed. 1282 (1949), thereby delaying the accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff 
reasonably discovered the right of action, reasoning that "the traditional purposes of 
statutes of limitations ... require the assertion of claims within a specified period of time 
after notice of the invasion of legal rights." Id. 
Again, the Complaint allegations are clear that Plaintiff was aware that she was an 
alleged "victim" as a result of the alleged one encounter with EPSTEIN in 2001, and that 
she allegedly suffered damages therefrom. By her own allegations she felt "frightened 
and trapped" at the time. There are no allegations of repressed memory or traumatic 
amnesia or other allegations which would delay the accrual of the cause of action. 
Based on the allegations of the Complaint, Plaintiff turned 18 in 2003 and, thus, she 
was no longer under the legal disability of being a minor. Approximately 8 years have 
passed since the alleged one time encounter -
well pass the 6 year statute of 
to every word and clause in a statute. U.S. v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-39 (1955); TRW 
Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001 ). Additionally, courts must reject statutory interpretations 
that would render portions of a statute surplusage. TRW, 534 at 31." Brotherhood of Loe. 
Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. v. CSX Transp., Inc., 522 F.3d 1190, 1194 -1195 (11 th 
Cir. 2008).

limitations; and approximately 6 years have passed since the legal disability of being a 
minor was removed - well passed the 3 year period. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court dismiss Counts I and Ill of 
Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice. 
In the alternative, Defendant requests that this 
Court dismiss either Count I or II with prejudice, along with Count Ill wi 
rejudice.

THIRD PARTY WITNESS, IGOR ZINOVIEW'S, 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LA ,v 
Third Paiiy Witness, Igor Zinoview's, ("Mr. Zinoview") by and through his 
undersigned attorney, moves this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) for a protective 
order regarding his deposition and as grounds therefore would state: 
1. 
As reflected on the affidavit of Igor Zinoview, attached as Exhibit A, he 
works for Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Mr. Epstein") as a driver and bodyguard. He did 
not know Mr. Epstein before November of 2005. He first became employed by Mr. 
Epstein in November of 2005. 
2. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview would testify as set forth on his affidavit, that 
at no time has he discussed with Mr. Epstein any issues involving Mr. Epstein's criminal 
case nor any of the cases or issues involved with civil plaintiffs. 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 2 of 26
3. 
In many of the depositions, counsel for L.M. and E.W., has asked them as 
witnesses to assume ce1iain facts about which they have no knowledge, and he then asks 
their opinions about certain facts. See Exhibit B ~Epstein's Motion for Protective Order 
to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions. 
4. 
There is no information which Mr. Zinoview has relating to the facts and 
circumstances surrounding any of the pending civil cases, in that none of their allegations 
directed to Mr. Epstein extend beyond September of 2005. 
Therefore whatever 
information Mr. Zinoview may have, postdates that time. 
5. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order (DE #377), "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, it 
is not without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 
1570 (11th Cir. 1992). . .. Cou1is have long held that ' [ w]hile the standard of relevancy 
[in discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear ge1111ane 
on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food & 
Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) (string 
cite omitted)." 
6. 
Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that, "[a] party or 
any person from whomn discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court 
where the action is pending.... The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect 
a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or 
expense, including one or more of the following: (A) forbidding the disclosure or 
discovery;". 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 3 of 26
7. 
As set forth in his affidavit, Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action. Accordingly, the 
Court should enter a protective order prohibiting his deposition. 
WHEREFORE, third~paity witness moves this comt for a protective order 
pursuant to Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that his deposition not take 
place or the questioning be limited.

CASE NO. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
____________ ____;/ 
EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER TO 
PROHIBIT INAPPROPRIATE DEPOSITION QUESTIONS 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), pursuant to Rule 1.280(c), Florida 
Rules of Civil Procedure, moves for a protective order to prohibit argumentative, 
harassing and inappropriate questions in depositions, and states: 
1. 
At numerous depositions, Plaintiff's counsel has repeatedly asked 
argumentative and harassing questions that are irrelevant and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
2. 
In particular, Plc;iintiff's counsel has asked questions that improperly 
sought to illicit lay opinions from fact witnesses, asked questions regarding witnesses' 
feelings towards Mr. Epstein and their beliefs regarding media reports of this case, 
asked whether they would leave their children with Mr. Epstein and asked whether they 
would go back to work for Mr. Epstein assuming the media reports were accurate, 
among other things. 
These questions and the responses thereto will never be 
admissible. 
They are argumentative, irrelevant and seek speculative answers and 
inadmissible lay opinions.

Epstein's Motion for Protective Order to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions 
Page 2 of 9 
3. 
For example, in the deposition of Larry Visoski, one of Mr. Epstein's pilots, 
Plaintiff's counsel asked the following questions seeking to obtain Mr. Visoski's beliefs 
and opinions on Plaintiff's allegations: 
Q. 
All right. 
When you read in the newspapers 
the 
allegations that Mr. Epstein was involved with 
numerous 
underage girls for sexual reasons, were you surprised? 
A. I didn't believe it. 
Q. Do you believe it today? 
A. I don't believe it. 
Q. You don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was involved with 
underage girls in a sexual way? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: You're asking for my opinion, and I don't 
think my opinion is relevant in that matter. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I think it's relevant. Can you just tell me whether today 
you believe that Jeffrey Epstein has engag.ed in sex with 
underage girls? 
• 
• 
• 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation, irrelevant, always. 
THE WITNESS: It's irrelevant. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. I need an answer. 
A. I don't believe he had sex with underage women. 
Q. Or engaged in any· sexual acts with underage women? 
MR. CRITTON: Form.

Page 3 of 9 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
You think that this ls just a story that a bunch of 
underage women have made up? 
A. 
Speculatlon. 
* * * * 
Q. 
Then we'll handle the question this way: If you were to 
believe based on information and evidence that Mr. Epstein 
engaged in sex or some form of sex acts with people of the 
age range of 12, 13, 14, 15 years old, would you continue 
your employment with Mr. Epstein? 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation. 
THE 
WITNESS: 
I would 
certainly 
speculating 
and I have to discuss it with my wife long and hard. I don't 
think I could give you a correct and honest answer at this 
time. 
See Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Visokski at 66-67; 181-82 (attached as 
composite Exhibit A). Other examples of similar improper questions are included in 
Exhibit A. 
4. 
Not only do these questions seek improper lay opinions, Plaintiff's counsel 
asked Mr. Visoski his belief as to the truth of hearsay newspaper articles. 
The 
foregoing questions are obviously irrelevant, argumentative and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
5. 
Moreover, whether Mr. Visoski would continue working for Mr. Epstein if 
Plaintiff's allegations are true has absolutely no relevance to any claim or defense in this 
case. 
The questions are simply improper and meant to harass and embarrass the

witness. 
6. 
Mr. Visoski was questioned for over four hou'.s and much of the time was 
wasted on irrelevant and harassing questions. 
7. 
Plaintiff's counsel asked similar questions at the deposition of Larry 
Eugene Morrison, another one of Mr. Epstein's pilots: 
Q. 
Certainly you've read certain newspaper articles about 
the allegations, police reports, otherwise, the allegations that 
occurred or have been alleged to have occurred at his Palm 
Beach mansion, correct? 
A. 
Uh-huh. 
Q. 
Correct? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Given the nature of those allegations, would you leave 
your daughter of 17, 16, 15 years old with Mr. Epstein 
alone? 
MR PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. 
* * * * 
Q. 
And despite pleading guilty to procuring underage girls 
for the purposes of sex, you still feel comfortable leaving a 
13, 14, 15-year-old girl around him? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. I mean, with my daughter, yes. I don't know how 
he behaves around anybody else. 
I just know that the 
respect that he showed me, I feel safe with my daughter. 
Q. 
And have you read in detail the reports as to what 
happened at his house with the girls?

LM V. Epstein 
Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMBAB 
Epstein's Motion for Protective Order to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions 
Page 5 of 9 
A. 
Only --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
-- what's been in the newspapers and published. 
Q. 
If you read and hear testimony given - well, I can tell 
you now - testimony has been given in this case that what 
happens is: A 13 or 14 year old is led upstairs by herself, 
told to get naked, he lays down on his back, there is a brief 
massage before he turns over, exposes himself erect, 
masturbates while he tells this 13 or 14 year old to pinch his 
nipples as hard as she can while he inserts his fingers into 
their vagina and ejaculates all over them before saying, 
"Take your money and leave." 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Okay? Then, 
11You can continue to come back for $200 
every time or every girl you bring me within your age group 
and I get to do this again, I pay you $200 per person." If that 
is the testimony --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
Q. 
-- that what happens behind closed doors with him, do 
you still feel comfortable leaving a 13 or 14 year old in a 
room with Jeffrey Epstein? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
If that, in fact, is what actually happened, no. 
* * * * 
Q. 
[Would you] go back - considering what you've read and 
what you may or may not believe - would you go back to 
working for Jeffrey Epstein? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
I can't say. I still work for him on a maintenance - to

Page 6 of9 
maintain the airplanes and stuff like that, so. 
§ee Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Eugene Morrison at 135-36; 175-76; 184 
(attached as composite Exhibit B). 
8. 
Again, whether Mr. Morrison would work for Mr. Epstein "considering what 
[he has] read and what [he] may or may not believe" (i.e. considering hearsay media 
accounts and inadmissible lay opinion) has no bearing on the instant case. 
9. 
ln addition, questions regarding whether Mr. Morrison would leave his 
children alone with Mr. Epstein could have only been meant to harass and embarrass 
Mr. Morrison. Nevertheless, Mr. Morrison testified that he would leave his children with 
Mr. Epstein. As Plaintiffs counsel was obviously not happy with the answer to this 
question, he proceeded to press Mr. Morrison with inflammatory statements until he got 
the answer he wanted. 
10. 
Plaintiff's counsel has also asked the same improper line of questions in 
other witnesses' depositions. 
11. 
The above-cited questions exceed the bounds of permissible discovery; 
they have absolutely no relevance to this case. Accordingly, the Court should enter a 
protective order prohibiting such questions and should sanction Plaintiff's counsel if 
such inappropriate questions are asked at future depositions. 
12. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order, 1 "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, lt is not 
The Omnibus Order (DE #377) was entered in the federal companion case Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, 
Case No. 08-CIV-80119 MARRNJOH NSON in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida.

without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 1570 (11th 
Cir. 1992). ... 
Courts have long held that '[w]hile the standard of relevancy [in 
discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear 
germane on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United 
Food & Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) 
(string .cite omitted)." §ee also Capco Properties, LLC v. Monterry Gardens of Pinecrest 
Condo., 982 So. 2d 1211, (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (holding that discovery in civil cases must 
be relevant to the subject matter of the case and must be admissible or reasonably 
calculated to lead to admissible evidence); Morton Plant Hospital Ass'n, lnc. v. 
Shahbas, 960 So. 2d 820, 824 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007) (holding that ''discovery should be 
denied when it has been established that the information requested is neither relevant 
F 
to any pending claim or defense nor will it lead to the discovery of admissible evidence," 
citing Tanchel v. Shoemaker, 928 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006)). 
13. 
As illustrated above, the questions are simply not germane to any pending 
'--.. 
claim or defense nor will they lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Whether 
Mr. Visoski believes or disbelieves the media accounts of this case, or whether Mr. 
Morrison would leave his children with Mr. Epstein is not relevant and cannot 
conceivably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
14. 
The Court should curtail these inappropriate lines of questions and enter a 
protective order prohibiting them. 
15. 
Rule 1.280(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides the Court with 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 15 of 26
LM v. Epstein 
Case No, 502008CA028051 XXXXMBAB

the power to "make any order to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense that justice requires including 
... (4) that certain matter not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be 
limited to certain matters." 
16. 
Accordingly, Epstein requests the Court enter a protective order 
prohibiting Plaintiff's counsel from asking witnesses' questions regarding opinions and 
beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case and whether they would 
leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar nature, and limiting the scope 
to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters relevant to the claims and 
defenses in this case. See Shahbas, 960 So. 2d at 824. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, respectfully requests the Court 
enter a protective order prohibiting Plaintiffs counsel from asking witnesses' questions 
regarding opinions and beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case 
and whether they would leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar 
nature, and limiting the scope to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters 
relevant to the claims and defenses in this case and grant any additional relief the Court 
deems just and proper.

a subpoena duces tecum for this witness, as well as 
the previous witness, which was another pilot, Dave 
Rogers, and that duces teoum was to bring the 
flight logs related from 1998 through 2005. What 
was produced at the previous deposition were flight 
logs from 2002 through 2005, ancl now Mr. Reinhart 
has agreed to produce the remainder of the flight 
logs requested, those going from 1998 t11rough 2002. 
MR. REINHART; Correct. They're pilot logs, 
not night logs. There are other records we 
indicated are corporate records, and with those you

Q. All right. When you read in the newspapers

numerous underage girls for sexual reasons, were you 
surprised?

'MR. EDWARDS: I'm going·to--put on the record 
right now that it is -- we are allowed discovery 
into a RICO count. We are also allowed discovery 
into the intent of Mr. Epstein In developing a 
criminal enterprise designed to sexually exploit 
and sexually abuse underage girls. We believe that 
in doing so, he associated intentionally with 
people of similar beliefs that sex with underage 
girls is okay, and that there have been rnany 
discussions with this witness, as well as many 
other witnesses with -- to Ins lire his protection 
from law enforcement that they not answer these 
specific questions. And thus, the opinions and

REPLY TO ROTHSTEIN ROSENFELDT ADLER'S P.A.'S 
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S EMERGENCY MOTION FOR ORDER 
FOR THE PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE (DE 4051 
(AS TO JANE DOE v. EPSTEIN CASE NO.: 08-CIV- 80893) 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"), by and through his undersigned attorneys, 
hereby files his Reply to Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler P.A.' s ("RRA") Response to 
Defendant's Emergency Motion for Order for the Preservation of Evidence [DE 405], 
and states: 
1. 
It now appears that the Honorable Herbert Stettin ("Mr. Stettin") is the 
sole individual, as the Chief Restructuring Officer, in charge of RRA assets, including 
electronic and paper records. There also appears to be no objection to the entry of the 
preservation order consistent with his fiduciary/trustee duties for RRA, although certain 
documents may no longer exist within his possession. 
2. 
Par. 4 of the response reflects that some 40 plus boxes of documents were 
obtained by the Department of Justice from search warrants served on the offices of 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 17   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 2 of 5
RRA; "it is believed that the Department of Justice also sequestered about (13) boxes of 
documents related to this [Epstein] case." In fact there are three Epstein cases which 
have been brought by the RRA firm, one being in federal court, two in state court. Mr. 
Stettin confirms Defendant's belief that there are serious ethical and potentially criminal 
issues that may impact Plaintiffs' ability to pursue their cases. 
3. 
Unfortunately, time is critical with regard to this case in that there are 
deadlines to Disclose Experts and Exchange Reports by October 29, 2009 (but Plaintiff 
has not seen her expert, has no report and only made herself available for the Defendant's 
exam on November 13, 2009), deposition discovery deadline is November 28, 2009 and 
a calendar call of February 19, 2010 for the February 22, 2010 trial docket. While the 
undersigned understands that Mr. Stettin may be working expeditiously to deal with 
critical and pressing needs of stabilizing the firm, a delay of 45 days for his deposition 
(which has been set in the state court case in the 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach 
County, State of Florida, L.M. v. Epstein, Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB, 
not the case sub-judice) will place his deposition sometime during the first 15 days of 
January, after every pre-trial deadline has expired. 
4. 
If in fact there has been inappropriate and/or illegal conduct associated 
with the prosecution of this case by RRA or any of its attorneys or by the Plaintff herself, 
which might result in sanctions, dismissal or other remedy, Defendant Epstein will be 
severely prejudiced. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant Epstein request that the court's preservation order be 
made permanent, which does not seem inconsistent with Mr. Stettin's position as 
expressed by his lawyers but deny the relief sought for delaying the deposition unless the 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 17   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 3 of 5
court is disposed to modify the current scheduling deadlines and trial date that exist in 
this case.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO. 09-80802-CIV-MARRA
JANE DOE NO. 8,
Plaintiff,
vs.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,
Defendant.
_______________________________/
OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendant Jeffrey Epstein’s (“Defendant”)
Motion to Dismiss (DE 8).  Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 8 (“Plaintiff”) filed a response to the motion
(DE 13) and Defendant filed a Reply (DE 15).  The Court has carefully reviewed the motion,
response, and reply, and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.   
Background
On May 28, 2009, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against Defendant (DE 1).  Plaintiff
brings suit alleging Count I - Sexual Assault and Battery; Count II - Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress; and Count III - Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in Violation of
U.S.C. § 2422.  
The facts, as alleged in the Complaint, are as follows:  Defendant, an adult male, has a
sexual preference and obsession for underage minor girls. Compl. ¶¶ 8, 9.  Defendant engaged in
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 1 of 9

a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily economically disadvantaged minor
girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. Compl. ¶ 9.  In or
about 2001, Plaintiff, then approximately 16 years old, became one of Defendant’s victims.
Compl. ¶ 9. 
Defendant’s scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit underage, ostensibly to
give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Compl. ¶
11.  The underage victim would be brought or directed to Defendant’s mansion, where she would
be led up a flight of stairs to a room that contained a massage table in addition to other
furnishings.  Id.  The girl would then find herself alone in the room with Defendant, who would
be wearing only a towel. Id.  Defendant would then remove his towel and lie naked on the
massage table, and then direct the girl to remove her clothes. Id.  Defendant would then perform
one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts. Id.
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Plaintiff was recruited by another girl,
who told her that she could make some money, but did not tell her what was involved. Compl. ¶
13.  Plaintiff was picked up and brought to Defendant’s mansion in Palm Beach. Id.  Once there,
she was led up a flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. Id.  Defendant came into the
room and directed Plaintiff to remove her clothes and give him a massage.  Id.  Plaintiff was
frightened and felt trapped.  Id.  During the massage, Defendant touched Plaintiff’s breasts and
vagina, and grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis. Id.  Defendant masturbated himself
during the massage.  Id. Defendant then left money for Plaintiff. Id.  As a result of this encounter
with Defendant, Plaintiff experienced confusion, shame, humiliation, and embarrassment, and
has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries. Compl. ¶ 14.
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 2 of 9

Under Count I - Sexual Assault and Battery, the Complaint alleges as follows: Defendant
made an intentional, unlawful offer of offensive sexual contact toward Plaintiff, creating a
reasonable fear of imminent peril and sexual assault. Compl. ¶ 16.  Defendant intentionally
inflicted harmful or offensive contact on the person of Plaintiff. Compl. ¶ 17.  Defendant
tortiously committed a sexual assault and battery on Plaintiff.  Compl. ¶ 18.  Defendant’s acts
were intentional, unlawful, offensive and harmful. Id.  Defendant’s plan and scheme in which he
committed such acts upon Plaintiff were done willfully and maliciously. Compl. ¶ 19.  Plaintiff
has suffered and will continue to suffer severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including
mental, psychological and emotional damages and loss of enjoyment of life.   Compl. ¶ 20.
Under Count III, Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in Violation of 18 U.S.C. §
2422, the Complaint alleges as follows:  Defendant used a facility or means of interstate
commerce to knowingly persuade, induce or entice Plaintiff, when she was under the age of 18
years, to engage in prostitution or sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a
criminal offense. Compl. ¶ 28.  On June 30, 2008, Defendant entered a plea of guilty to
violations of Florida §§ 796,07 and 796.03 in the 15  Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach
th
County (Case nos. 2008-cf-009381AXXXMB and 2006-cf-009454AXXXMB), for conduct
involving the same plan and scheme as alleged herein. Comp. ¶ 29.  As to Plaintiff, Defendant
could have been charged with criminal violations of Florida Statute § 796.07(2) (including
subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) thereof), and other criminal offenses including violations
of Florida Statutes §§ 798.02 and 800.04 (including subsections (5), (6), and (7) thereof). Comp.
¶ 30.  As a result of Defendant’s violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, Plaintiff has suffered personal
injury, including mental, psychological and emotional damages. Compl. ¶ 31.

--

 Defendant’s Motion does not move for dismissal of Count II. 
Defendant argues in his motion to dismiss that Counts I and III of the Complaint must be
dismissed as time-barred by the applicable statutes of limitations on the face of the Complaint.  
Plaintiff responds that the Court should deny the motion because it is not apparent from the
Complaint that Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred because the Complaint does not allege the date
on which her claims accrued.  Additionally, Plaintiff argues that Count I is not time-barred
because Plaintiff had until seven years after she reached the age of majority to file her claim.
Standard of Review
In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a
court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most
favorable to the plaintiff.  See Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007).  To satisfy the
pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, a complaint must contain a short and
plain statement showing an entitlement to relief, and the statement must “give the defendant fair
notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Swierkiewicz v.
Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512 (2002) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8); see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964 (2007); Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 346 (2005). 
This is a liberal pleading requirement, one that does not require a plaintiff to plead with
particularity every element of a cause of action. Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for Choice, Inc., 253
F.3d 678, 683 (11th Cir. 2001).  Instead, the complaint need only “contain either direct or
inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under
some viable legal theory.” Id. (internal citation and quotation omitted).  “A complaint need not
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 4 of 9

specify in detail the precise theory giving rise to recovery.  All that is required is that the
defendant be on notice as to the claim being asserted against him and the grounds on which it
rests.”  Sams v. United Food and Comm'l Workers Int'l Union, 866 F.2d 1380, 1384 (11th Cir.
1989).
“While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed
factual allegations, [ ] a plaintiff's obligation to provide the ‘grounds' of his ‘entitlement to relief’
requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause
of action will not do.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65 (citations omitted). 
“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the
assumption that all of the complaint's allegations are true.”  Id. at 1965.  Plaintiff must plead
enough facts to state a plausible basis for the claim.  Id.
Discussion
Count I alleges a claim for sexual assault and battery.  Defendant asserts that Count I
should be dismissed because a four-year statute of limitations applies to that claim, and it is
apparent from the face of the Complaint that Plaintiff filed her claim past this limitations period.
A statute of limitations bar is "an affirmative defense, and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not
required to negate an affirmative defense in [their] complaint."  LaGrasta v. First Union
Securities, Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11  Cir. 2004) (citing Tregenza v. Great American
th
Communications Co., 12 F.3d 717, 718 (7  Cir. 1993)).  A Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on statute of
th
limitations grounds is appropriate only if it is "apparent from the face of the complaint" that the
claim is time-barred.  Id.; Omar v. Lindsey, 334 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11  Cir. 2003); Carmichael v.
th
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 5 of 9

 The Complaint states that “In or about 2001, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old,
fell into Epstein’s trap and became one of his victims.” Comp. ¶ 9.
Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp., 291 F.3d 1278, 1279 (11  Cir. 2002).
th
Defendant argues that, pursuant to Florida law, the statute of limitations for assault and
battery is four years.  Defendant relies upon Fla. Stat. § 95.11(3)(o), which provides: 
Actions other than for recovery of real property shall be commenced as follows:
(3) Within four years.--
(o) An action for assault, battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, malicious
interference, false imprisonment, or any other intentional tort, except as provided
in subsections (4), (5), and (7).
Defendant asserts that, based upon the allegations in the Complaint , it was approximately eight
(8) years between the alleged conduct by Defendant and the filing of the Complaint.  Thus,
Defendant argues, on the face of the Complaint, the four year statute of limitations has expired
and, accordingly, Court I should be dismissed as time-barred.  
In response, Plaintiff argues that Defendant is relying on the wrong limitations period. 
Section 95.11(3)(o), upon which Defendant relies, provides as follows:  “An action for assault,
battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, malicious interference, false imprisonment, or any
other intentional tort, except as provided in subsections (4), (5), and (7).”  (emphasis added). 
Thus, Section 95.11(3)(o) is not applicable to causes of action falling within the purview of §
95.11(7).  Section 95.11(7) provides as follows:  
(7) For intentional torts based on abuse. – An action founded on alleged abuse, as
defined in s. 39.01, . . . may be commenced at any time within 7 years after the
age of majority, or within 4 years after the injured person leaves the dependency
of the abuser, or within 4 years from the time of discovery by the injured party of
both the injury and the causal relationship between the injury and the abuse,
whichever occurs later.
 Accordingly, an intentional tort claim alleging “abuse” against a child, as described in Fla. Stat.
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 6 of 9

§39.01, is controlled by §95.11(7), as an exception to the four-year limitations period provided
for in §95.11(3)(o).  See H.T.E. v. Tyler Technologies, Inc., 217 F.Supp. 2d 1255, 1259 (M.D.
Fla. 2002) (where language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute must be given its
plain and obvious meaning).  
The term “abuse” is defined in Fla. Stat. §39.01(2) as follows: “ ‘Abuse’ means any
willful act or threatened act that results in any physical, mental or sexual injury or harm that
causes or is likely to cause the child’s physical, mental, or emotional health to be significantly
impaired.”  The Complaint in this case alleges “abuse” under the broad definition of §39.01.
Specifically, Count I alleges willful acts (Complaint ¶¶ 8-13, 16-19); resulting in physical, mental
or sexual injury (Complaint ¶¶ 13,17, 20); that cause or are likely to cause the child’s physical,
mental or emotional health to be significantly impaired.  Thus, the seven-year limitations period
after the Plaintiff reaches the age of majority applies to Plaintiff’s claims in Count I.  According
to the allegations in the Complaint, Plaintiff was approximately 16 years old in 2001.  Comp. ¶ 9. 
It follows that Plaintiff was approximately 24 years old (and approximately six years past the age
of majority) when she filed her Complaint.   Therefore, Count I is not time-barred pursuant to the
applicable statute of limitations. 
Counts III alleges a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a) based upon an alleged violation of
U.S.C. § 2422.  That statute states, in pertinent part,
(b) Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign
commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United
States knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has
not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for
which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so,
shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years or for life.
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 7 of 9

U.S.C. § 2422(b).  
Defendant argues that, on the face of the Complaint, Count III is barred by the statute of
limitations contained in 18 U.S.C. § 2255(b).  That statute provides: “Any action commenced
under this section shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of
action first accrues or in the case of a person under a legal disability, not later than three years
after the disability.”  Defendant states that, based on the allegations of the Complaint, it has been
eight (8) years since the alleged conduct by Defendant occurred, well past the six-year statute of
limitations.  Additionally, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff is now at least 24 years old, well past
the age of majority under both federal and state law.  See 18 U.S.C. § 2256(1); Fla. Stat. § 1.01.
Plaintiff responds that Defendant’s motion assumes that the action accrued on the date
when Defendant’s alleged sexual misconduct occurred, but that the determination of when the
limitations period accrues under the discovery rule in a case involving sexual misconduct with a
minor requires a detailed and complex factual inquiry regarding when Plaintiff became aware of
her injuries and was able to connect those injuries to the Defendant’s conduct. (Resp. at 5-7). 
While ordinarily a Plaintiff need not negate the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations, 
LaGrasta, 358 F.3d at 845, when on the face of the complaint it appears that the limitations
period has run, Plaintiff must allege facts which, if proven true, would avoid the limitations
period. See Hughes v. Lott, 350 F.3d 1157, 1163 (11  Cir. 2003) (to dismiss a claim as time-
th
barred it must appear beyond a doubt from the complaint itself that the plaintiff can prove no set
of facts which would avoid a statute of limitations bar); Berkson v. Del Monte Corp., 743 F.2d
53, 55 (1  Cir. 1984); see, e.g., Autry Petroleum Co. v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2006
st
WL 1174443, * 4 (M.D. Ga. 2006) (“Plaintiffs' Complaint may be dismissed only if, from the
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/18/2009   Page 8 of 9

face of the Complaint, it is apparent (1) that the statute of limitations has run and (2) that there
are no facts that Plaintiffs could prove that would support a finding that BP has committed a
fraud which prevented Plaintiffs from bringing the action at an earlier time.”)  A review of the
Complaint, however, reveals no allegations which implicate the doctrine of delayed discovery, or
would avoid the running of the limitations period.  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss Count III
without prejudice for Plaintiff to amend to add allegations which implicate the doctrine of
delayed discovery, if she can do so in good faith.  
Conclusion
For the reasons stated herein, Defendant’s  Motion to Dismiss (DE 8) is GRANTED IN
PART AND DENIED IN PART as follows:  Defendant’s motion to dismiss Count I is denied.
Defendant’s motion to dismiss Count III is granted.  Count III is hereby dismissed without
prejudice, with leave to amend in accordance with this Order.  
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 18  day of November, 2009.

PLAINTIFF, CAROLYN M. ANDRIANO’S, RESPONSE TO THIRD PARTY WITNESS, 
IGOR ZINOVIEW’S, MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND INCORPORATED 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, Carolyn M. Andriano, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby 
files her Response Third Party Witness, Igor Zinoview’s, Motion For Protective Order 
and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (D.E. 402), and in support thereof states as 
follows: 
1. 
Third party witness, Igor Zinoview, seeks to have this Court enter an order 
preventing his deposition from going forward at all, or, in the alternative, limiting the 
scope of permissible questioning during same.  Mr. Zinoview’s deposition is presently 
scheduled to be taken on December 18, 2009. 
2. 
Mr. Zinoview has been employed by Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” since November of 2005.  See Affidavit of Igor Zinoview 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 1 of 8

(D.E. 402) dated November 9, 2009.  Mr. Zinoview argues that his deposition should not 
go forward as scheduled because Defendant Epstein has never discussed nor 
attempted to discuss with him “any facts or information related to any legal matters in 
which he [Jeffrey Epstein] is involved.” Id.  From Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion springs 
the bold yet erroneous argument that “Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action.” 
3. 
It should initially be noted that a “complete prohibition of a deposition is an 
extraordinary measure which should be resorted to only in rare occasions.” Jennings v. 
Family Management, 201 F.R.D. 272 (D.D.C. 2001); See also, Salter v. Upjohn Co., 
593 F.2d 649, 651 (5th Circ. 1979)(It is very unusual for trial court to prohibit the taking 
of a deposition altogether, and absent extraordinary circumstances, such order would 
likely be in error.); Inv. Properties Intern., Ltd. v. IOS, Ltd., 459 F.2d. 705, 708 (2d Circ. 
1972)(“an order to vacate a notice of taking deposition is generally regarded as both 
unusual and unfavorable . . . “).  Neither Mr. Zinoview’s conclusory affidavit nor his 
Motion provide anything even approaching the “extraordinary circumstances” necessary 
to justify the entry of order precluding his deposition from going forward at all. 
4. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion that he and Defendant 
Epstein have never discussed any facts or information related to any legal matters that 
Mr. Epstein is involved in does not give rise to requisite “extraordinary circumstances” 
either. Detweiler Bros, Inc. v John Graham and Company, 412 F.Supp. 416 (E.D. Wash, 
1976)(Plaintiff could not properly seek to prohibit defendant from deposing plaintiff’s 
employee via a protective order on grounds that employee had no knowledge of matters 
at issue.) See also, 8 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. §2037, Wright and Miller(“A witness 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 2 of 8

ordinarily cannot escape examination by denying knowledge of any relevant facts, since 
the party seeking to take the deposition is entitled to test the witness’s lack of 
knowledge.”)  
5. 
The undersigned, as well as counsel for all of the other victims of Jeffrey 
Epstein, are entitled to question and challenge Mr. Zinoview on his purported lack of 
knowledge.  Mr. Zinoview and plaintiffs’ counsel very well might have a difference of 
opinion on what constitutes “facts and information related to any legal matters” in which 
Defendant Epstein is involved.  The victims of Jeffrey Epstein ought not to be forced to 
accept Mr. Zinoview’s opinion as to what constitutes “facts and information related to 
any legal matters” involving Jeffrey Epstein.  Instead, plaintiffs should be able to explore 
these relevant matters directly with Mr. Zinoview, rather than being forced to rely on his 
twenty seven (27) word claim of lacking any knowledge. 
6. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview worked for Defendant Epstein during portions of 
the Palm Beach Police Department’s months’ long investigation which spanned from 
March 15, 2005 through February 2006 into the illegal sexual contact committed by 
Defendant Epstein against these minor plaintiffs.  Accordingly, Mr. Zinoview certainly 
might have direct knowledge about what was going on in and around the Epstein 
residence during the time period in which he was employed by Defendant Epstein as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” while his employer was being investigated by law 
enforcement.  Given the Defendant’s voracious invocation of his Fifth Amendment 
privilege, the plaintiffs have consistently been denied the opportunity to seek any 
relevant information directly from Defendant Epstein himself.  Rather, plaintiffs have 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 3 of 8

been forced to build their cases against Mr. Epstein by other discovery methods, 
including deposing his employees who may have relevant information.  
7. 
Third party witness Igor Zinoview has failed to meet his very high burden 
of establishing “extraordinary circumstances.”  Mr. Zinoview has failed to demonstrate 
the “good cause” required by Rule 26(c) to protect a person from “annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” to overcome the liberal 
scope of permissible discovery.  The above proposed lines of inquiry of Mr. Zinoview 
are certainly reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  
Accordingly, to the extent that it seeks to preclude his deposition from going forward at 
all, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion should be denied 
8. 
Next, Mr. Zinoview also seeks to prevent questions being posed to him 
wherein he is first asked to “assume certain facts about which he has no knowledge,” 
and then be asked about his “opinions about certain facts.”  First, it remains to be seen 
exactly what facts about which Mr. Zinoview has no knowledge.  Second, Mr. Zinoview’s 
opinions and beliefs about the factual matters surrounding plaintiffs’ claims are relevant 
to exploring any potential bias and prejudice in favor of his employer and against 
Defendant Epstein’s victims.  For example, if Mr. Zinoview believes that these plaintiffs 
are simply inventing their claims against his employer that they were sexually victimized 
by Defendant Epstein while they were minor children, it very well might impact his 
impartiality as a witness.  Third, the undersigned has no present intention of engaging in 
this line of questioning unless the proverbial “door” has been opened by Mr. Zinoview 
first.  Lastly, counsel for Mr. Zinoview is certainly free to invoke the privileges afforded to 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 4 of 8

him by the applicable procedural rules should he feel that his client is being asked 
inappropriate questions during the deposition. 
9. 
In conclusion and for the reasons cited above, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion For 
Protective Order should be denied in its entirety. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Carolyn Margaret Andriano, respectfully requests that 
this Court deny Third Party Igor Zinoview’s Motion For Protective Order.

Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 8, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby files this

1. 
On November 18, 2009, this Court entered an Opinion and Order on 
Defendant Epstein’s Motion to Dismiss (DE 18), dismissing Count III of Plaintiff’s 
Complaint without prejudice, with leave to amend the Complaint in compliance with the

Plaintiffs’ counsel has conferred with Defendant’s counsel regarding this 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/03/2009   Page 1 of 4

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CV-80802-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE NO. 8,  
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,  
Defendant. 
____________________________________/ 
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 8 (“Jane” or “Jane Doe”), files and serves this Amended Complaint 
against Jeffrey Epstein, as follows:  
Parties, Jurisdiction and Venue 
1. 
Jane Doe No. 8 (“Jane Doe”) is a citizen and resident of the State of Florida, and is 
sui juris. 
2. 
This Complaint is brought under a fictitious name to protect the identity of the 
Plaintiff because this Complaint makes sensitive allegations of sexual assault and abuse upon a 
minor.  
3. 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State of New York, and 
presently serving a prison sentence in Palm Beach County, Florida for, inter alia, solicitation of 
prostitution and solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution. . 
4. 
This is an action for damages in excess of $50 million.  
5. 
This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. §1332(a), as the matter in controversy (i) exceeds $75,000, exclusive of  interest and costs; 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/14/2009   Page 1 of 8

- 2 - 
and (ii) is between citizens of different states. 
6. 
Additionally, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331 because  
Plaintiff alleges a claim under the laws of the United States.  This Court has supplemental 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1367(a) over all other claims set forth herein which form part of 
the same case or controversy.  
7. 
This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§1391(a) and 1391(b) as a 
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District.  
Factual Allegations 
8. 
At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”) was an adult male in his 
early 50’s.  Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires.  He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence.  He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL.  The allegations herein concern Epstein’s conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach.  
9. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls.  He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money.  In or about  2001, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell into Epstein’s trap 
and became one of his victims.  
10. 
Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas.  
11. 
Epstein’s scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit underage girls.  These 
underage girls were recruited ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/14/2009   Page 2 of 8

- 3 - 
in his Palm Beach mansion. Epstein, upon information and belief, generally sought out economically 
disadvantaged underage girls from Palm Beach County who would be enticed by the money being 
offered - generally $200 to $300 per “massage” session - and who were perceived as less likely to 
complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made.    
12. 
Epstein’s plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method.  The underage 
victim would be brought or directed to Epstein’s mansion, where she would be led up a flight of 
stairs to a room that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings.   The girl would then 
find herself alone in the room with Epstein, who would be wearing only a towel.  He would then 
remove his towel and lie naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes.  
Epstein would then perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts.  
13. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe was recruited by another 
girl, who told her that she could make some money, but did not tell her what was involved.  At all 
relevant times, the girl who recruited Jane Doe was acting on behalf of and as agent for Epstein.  
Jane was contacted by this girl by telephone.  Jane was then picked up and brought to Epstein’s 
mansion in Palm Beach.   Once there, she was led up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage 
table.  Epstein came into the room and directed Jane to remove her clothes and give him a massage.  
Jane was frightened and felt trapped.  As directed by Epstein, Jane removed her clothes.  Epstein 
then during the massage touched Jane on her breasts and vagina, and he grabbed her hand and placed 
it on his penis.  Epstein masturbated himself during the massage.   Epstein then left money for Jane.   
14. 
As a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experienced confusion, shame, 
humiliation and embarrassment, and has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries.  
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/14/2009   Page 3 of 8

COUNT I 
Sexual Assault and Battery 
15. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 above.  
16. 
Epstein made an intentional, unlawful offer of offensive sexual contact toward Jane 
Doe, creating a reasonable fear of imminent peril and sexual assault.  
17. 
Epstein intentionally inflicted harmful or offensive sexual contact on the person of 
Jane Doe.  
18. 
Epstein tortiously committed a sexual assault and battery on Jane Doe.  Epstein’s acts 
were intentional, unlawful, offensive and harmful. 
19. 
Epstein’s plan and scheme in which he committed such acts upon Jane Doe were done 
willfully and maliciously. 
20. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s assault on Jane, she has suffered and will 
continue to suffer severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological and 
emotional damages and loss of enjoyment of life. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 8 demands judgment against Defendant Jeffrey 
Epstein for compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs, and such other and further relief as this 
Court deems just and proper.  
COUNT II 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
21. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 above.  
22. 
Epstein’s conduct was intentional or reckless.  
23. 
Epstein's conduct with a minor was extreme and outrageous, going beyond all bounds 
of decency.  
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/14/2009   Page 4 of 8

- 5 - 
24. 
Epstein committed willful acts of child sexual abuse on Jane Doe.  These acts resulted 
in mental or sexual injury that caused or were likely to cause Jane Doe’s mental or emotional health 
to be significantly impaired.  
25. 
Epstein’s conduct caused severe emotional distress to Jane Doe.  Epstein knew or had 
reason to know that his intentional and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress and 
damage to Jane Doe, or Epstein acted with reckless disregard of the high probability of causing 
severe emotional distress to Jane Doe.   
26. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s intentional or reckless conduct, Jane Doe 
has suffered and will continue to suffer severe mental anguish and pain, psychological and emotional 
injuries and los of enjoyment of life. .  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 8 demands judgment against Defendant Jeffrey 
Epstein for compensatory damages, costs, punitive damages, and such other and further relief as this 
Court deems just and proper.  
COUNT III 
Coercion and Enticement to Sexual Activity in Violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422 
27. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 14 above.  
28. 
Epstein used a facility or means of interstate commerce to knowingly persuade, 
induce or entice Jane Doe, when she was under the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or 
sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. 
29. 
On June 30, 2008, Epstein entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida §§ 796.07 
and 796.03, in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Case nos. 2008-cf-
009381AXXXMB and 2006-cf-009454AXXXMB), for conduct involving the same plan and 
scheme as alleged herein. 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/14/2009   Page 5 of 8

- 6 - 
30. 
As to Plaintiff Jane Doe, Epstein could have been charged with criminal violations of 
Florida Statute §796.07(2) (including subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) thereof), and other 
criminal offenses including violations of Florida Statutes §§798.02 and 800.04 (including 
subsections (5), (6) and (7) thereof). 
31. 
Epstein’s acts and conduct are in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422.  
32. 
As a result of Epstein’s violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422, Plaintiff has suffered 
psychological and physical injuries.  
33. 
Although Epstein’s acts of inducement and enticement to sexual activity occurred in 
or about 2001, when Jane Doe was minor, she was not immediately aware of her injuries.  
Specifically, she did not become aware that she had suffered psychological and emotional effects 
from the acts and conduct of Epstein until no earlier than calendar year 2008.  
34. 
Jane Doe did not (and due to various coping mechanisms, was unable to) make a 
causal connection between her injuries and the sexual acts and other misconduct of Epstein until 
2008.  Jane Doe did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that she had 
been injured and that Epstein had caused her injuries until calendar year 2008.  
35. 
Plaintiff retained Mermelstein & Horowitz, P.A. (f/k/a Herman & Mermelstein, P.A.), 
 as her attorneys in this matter and agreed to pay them a reasonable attorneys’ fee.  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 8 demands judgment against Defendant Jeffrey 
Epstein for all damages available under 18 U.S.C. §2255(a), including without limitation, actual and 
compensatory damages, costs of suit, and attorneys’ fees, and such other and further relief as this 
Court deems just and proper.

6. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Plaintiff's 
claims as alleged in Counts I, II, and Ill of the Amended Complaint arose in 2001. 
Plaintiff did not file suit until 2009 - approximately 8 years later - and, thus, her claims 
are time barred. 
7. As to Count I, Plaintiff's claim for assault and battery is time barred under 
§95.11 (3)(o), Fla. Stat., as Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege "abuse" under §39.01, 
Fla. Stat., and thus, §95.11 (7), Fla. Stat., is inapplicable. 
8. As to Count I and Count II, the Counts are duplicative of each other and thus, 
Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action in one or the other. 
9. As to Count Ill, such claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, 18 
U.S.C. §2255(b). 
10. As to Count 111, such claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, 18 
U.S.C. §2255(b). Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege and cannot allege and facts 
that would implicate the doctrine of delayed discovery. 
11.As to Count 111, Plaintiff has failed to and cannot state a cause of action under 18 
U.S.C. §2255, as she has failed to sufficiently and cannot allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§2422, as the requisite predicate act.

Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 8 
12. As to Count 111, Plaintiff has failed to and cannot state a cause of action under 
U.S.C. §2255, as she has failed to sufficiently and cannot allege a violation of 18 
U.S.C. §2422. Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege and cannot allege - "using the 
mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knowingly persuade, 
induce or entice ... " JANE DOE NO. 8 in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422(b). 
13.As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault & 
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," such claims are 
subject to the limitations as set forth in §768.72, et seq., Florida Statutes. 
14.As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault & 
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," such claims are 
subject to the constitutional limitations and guideposts as set forth in BMW of North 
America v. Gore, 116 S.Ct 1589 (1996); Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 127 S.Ct. 1057 
(2007); State Farm v. Campbell, 123 S.Ct 1513 (2003); Engle v. Ligget Group, Inc., 945 
So.2d 1246 (Fla. 2006). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the 
United States Constitution and Florida's Constitution, Art. I, §§2 and 9, prohibit the 
imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments 
15.As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault & 
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," the determination of 
whether or not Defendant is liable for punitive damages is required to be bifurcated from 
a determination of the amount to be imposed. 
16. Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for sexual assault and/or battery 
under Count I.

Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 9 
17.As to Count Ill, Plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action as she does not and 
can not show a violation of a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005). 
18.As to Count Ill, the version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect at the time of the alleged 
conduct applies, and, thus, the presumptive minimum damages amount should Plaintiff 
prove the elements of such claim is $50,000, and not subject to any multiplier. 
19.As to Count Ill, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, effective 
July 27, 2006, would be in violation of the legal axiom against retroactive application of 
an amended statute, and also in violation of such constitutional principles, including but 
not limited to, the "Ex Post Facto" Clause, U.S. Const. Article I, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1, and 
procedural and substantive due process, U.S. Const. 14th Amend., 5th Amend. The 
statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct applies. 
20.As to Count Ill, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, effective 
July 27, 2006, is prohibited pursuant to the vagueness doctrine and the Rule of Lenity. 
A criminal statute is required to give " 'fair warning ... in language that the common 
world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make 
the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.' " United States v. Lanier, 
520 U.S. 259,265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quoting McBoyle v. United 
States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931)) (omission in original). The 
"three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement" are: (1) the vagueness 
doctrine bars enforcement of a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an 
act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its 
meaning and differ as to its application; (2) the canon of strict construction of criminal 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/17/2009   Page 10 of 11
Jane Doe No. 8 v. Epstein 
Page 10 
statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal 
statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered; (3) due process bars courts from 
applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor 
any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope. 
21. The applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 creates a cause of action on behalf of 
a "minor." Plaintiff had attained the age of majority at the time of filing this action, and 
accordingly, her cause of action is barred. 
22. Because Plaintiff has no claim under 18 U.S.C. §2255, this Court is without 
subject matter jurisdiction as to all claims asserted. 
23.Application of the 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 2006, is in 
violation of the constitutional principles of due process, the "Ex Post Facto" clause, and 
the Rule of Lenity, in that in amending the term "minor" to "person" as to those who may 
bring a cause of action impermissibly and unconstitutionally broadened the scope of 
persons able to bring a §2255 claim. 
24. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment 
under the U.S. Constitution, and thus Plaintiff's claim thereunder is barred. 
25. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the constitutional guarantees of procedural and 
substantive due process. Procedural due process guarantees that a person will not be 
deprived of life, liberty or property without notice and opportunity to be heard. 
Substantive due process protects fundamental rights. Accordingly, Plaintiff's cause of 
action thereunder is barred.

AO 88A (Rev. 01/09) Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition or to Produce Documents in a Civi! Action (Page 3) 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 (c), (d), and (e) (Effective 12/1/07) 
(c) Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena. 
(])Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or 
attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take 
reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a 
person subject to the subpoena. The issuing court must enforce this 
duty and impose an appropriate sanction -
which may include lost 
earnings and reasonable attorney's fees -
on a party or attorney 
who fails to comply. 
(2) Command to Produce Materials or Perl1Ut Inspection. 
(A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce 
documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or 
to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the 
place of production or inspection unless also commanded to appear 
for a deposition, hearing, or trial. 
(B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or 
tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or 
attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to 
inspecting, copying, testing or sampling any or all of the materials or 
to inspecting the premises -
or to producing electronically stored 
information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be 
served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 
days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the 
following rules apply: 
(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving 
party may move the issuing comt for an order compelling production 
or inspection. 
(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and 
the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's 
officer from significant expense resulting from compliance. 
(3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena. 
(A) When Required. On timely motion, the issuing court must 
quash or modify a subpoena that: 
(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; 
(ii) requires a person ·.vho is neither a party nor a party's officer 
to travel more than I 00 miles from where that person resides, is 
employed, or regularly transacts business in person -
except that, 
subject to Rule 45(c)(3)(B)(iii), the person may be commanded to 
attend a trial by traveling from any such place within the state where 
the trial is held; 
(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if 
no exception or waiver applies; or 
(iv) subjects a person to undue burden. 
(B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by 
a subpoena, the issuing court may, on motion, quash or modify the 
subpoena if it requires: 
(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, 
development, or commercial infonnation; 
(ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or information that 
does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from 
the expert's study that was not requested by a party; or 
(iii) a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer to incur 
substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial. 
(C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circumstances 
described in Rule 45(c)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or 
modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under 
specified conditions if the serving party: 
(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that 
cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and 
(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably 
compensated. 
(d) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena. 
(1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. 
These procedures apply 10 producing documents or electronically 
stored information: 
(A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce 
documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary 
course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to 
the categories in the demand. 
(B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not 
Specified. If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing 
electronically stored information, the person responding must 
produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or 
in a reasonably usable form or forms. 
(C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One 
Form. The person responding need not produce the same 
electronically stored information in more than one form. 
(D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information. The person 
responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored 
information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably 
accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel 
discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show 
that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue 
burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless 
order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows 
good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The 
court may specify conditions for the discovery. 
(2) Claiming Privilege or Protection. 
(A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed 
information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to 
protection as trial-preparation material must 
(i) expressly make the claim; and 
(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, 
communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without 
revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the 
parties to assess the claim. 
(B) Information Produced. If information produced in response to a 
subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-
preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any 
party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. 
After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or 
destroy the specified infonnation and any copies it has; must not use 
or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take 
reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it 
before being notified; and may promptly present the information to 
the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The person 
who produced the information must preserve the information until 
the claim is resolved. 
(e) Contempt. The issuing court may hold in contempt a person 
who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the 
subpoena. A nonparty's failure to obey must be excused if the 
subpoena purports to require the nonparty to attend or produce at a 
place outside the limits ofRule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii).

NON-PARTY, JEAN LUC BRUHNEL’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF 
JANE DOE’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND FOR 
AN ORDER TO COMPEL AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Non-party Jean Luc Bruhnel hereby files his Response to Plaintiff, Jane Doe’s Motion
for an Order to Show Cause and for an Order to Compel and Incorporated Memorandum of Law
which was filed on March 10, 2010. (DE#483).  Plaintiff’s counsel seeks to compel Mr. Bruhnel,
a french citizen who is not a party to the instant action, to sit for a deposition that was canceled
and for which he has never been re-noticed.  This motion is premature at best, and frivolous. 
 While visiting New York, Mr. Bruhnel was served with a Subpoena and Notice of
Videotape Deposition in this matter.1  As a courtesy, undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 27   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 1 of 6

Please see Exhibit B, annexed hereto and incorporated by reference.
-2-
agreed to produce Mr. Bruhnel for deposition in Florida on November 3, 2010 for the
convenience of the parties because Mr. Bruhnel had plans to travel to Florida at that time.  The
videotape deposition was accordingly canceled.  Two new deposition notices were then e-mailed
to counsel for Bruhnel, both of which emanated from related cases in Florida Circuit Court, with
no additional notice emanating from the instant matter before this Court. 2  That scheduled
deposition was then canceled by agreement of the parties, who mutually agreed that plaintiff’s
counsel’s secretary would call counsel for Mr. Bruhnel to reset the deposition. 
Neither plaintiff’s counsel nor his secretary called to reschedule the deposition until
January, 2010.  In the intervening time, all depositions in the myriad related matters had been
canceled, upon information and belief, due to the scandal involving plaintiff’s counsel’s previous
law partner.  Further, Mr. Bruhnel had left the United States with no firm plan to return, which
was conveyed to plaintiff’s counsel during a telephone conversation in January.  
Mr. Bruhnel’s counsel attempted to secure firm dates on which Mr. Bruhnel would be
traveling to the United States, but was unable to do so. Undersigned counsel accordingly
informed planitiff’s counsel that she could not secure any firm dates.  When plaintiff’s counsel
insisted that Mr. Bruhnel provide deposition dates, plaintiff’s counsel was informed that Mr.
Bruhnel could not be compelled to return to the United States.  Undersigned counsel told
plaintiff’s counsel that there were appropriate mechanisms through which he could secure Mr.
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 27   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 2 of 6

-3-
Bruhnel’s testimony abroad pursuant to Florida, Federal and International law.  Indeed,
undersigned counsel directed plaintiff’s counsel to the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and the
Hague Convention, each of which provide specific mechanisms for the securing of testimony
abroad.  
Plaintiff’s counsel has never served Mr. Bruhnel or undersigned counsel with a re-notice
for deposition since the cancellation of the prior scheduled depositions, and has never attempted
to avail himself of proper legal procedures to secure Mr. Bruhnel’s testimony abroad.  Further,
contrary to plaintiff’s counsel’s Certification to this court, plaintiff’s counsel never conferred
with undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel regarding the instant Order to Show Cause and for an
Order to Compel.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
As stated above, the previously scheduled depositions were canceled by agreement of the
parties herein and Mr. Bruhnel has never been re-noticed for deposition.  The motion currently
before the court is therefore premature and frivolous.  Regardless, it is respectfully noted that the
Court lacks authority to compel Mr. Bruhnel to return to the United States for deposition. 
Indeed, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure specifically decline to confer upon the Court the
power to compel foreign nationals to appear before it. See Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. Rule 45, 28 USC
§ 1783.
The Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and the Hague Convention, however, have each
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 27   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 3 of 6

-4-
adopted procedural rules to facilitate the deposition of a non-party foreign national.  Indeed,  The
Uniform Foreign Depositions Act,  as adopted by Florida in section 92.251 (“UFDL”) provides
a road map for litigants seeking to secure evidence from foreign non-party witnesses, stating:
(2) Whenever any mandate, writ or commission is issued out of any court of record in any
other state, territory, district, or foreign jurisdiction, or whenever upon notice or
agreement it is required to take the testimony of a witness or witnesses in this state,
witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify in the same manner and by the same
process and proceeding as may be employed for the purposes of taking testimony in
proceedings pending in this state.
§ 92.251 Florida statutes.
Thus, whenever a Florida litigant desires to depose a witness residing in another state,
that litigant must first secure the appointment of a commissioner from the court where the
litigation originates. See Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 507 So.2d 1180 (Fla 2d DCA 1987), at 1183.
The foreign litigant may then apply to the court having personal jurisdiction over the witness for
the process necessary to secure the attendance of the witness. Id. (citing Travelers Indem. Co. v.
Hill, 388 So.2d 648 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980)).  See Greenlight Financial Services, Inc. v. Union
America Mortg., Inc., 971 So.2d 983 (Fla. 3d DCA 2008). This may be done through mechanisms
provided via The Hague Convention, to which France is a signatory.  Given that several cases are
currently pending in Florida Circuit Court that are related to the instant matter, plaintiff may
avail herself of this mechanism to secure Mr. Bruhnel’s testimony, but has chosen not to. 
Accordingly, there has been no malfeasance herein by Mr. Bruhnel or his counsel, only
nonfeasance by plaintiff’s counsel.
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 27   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 4 of 6

-5-
Plaintiff’s counsel has misrepresented to this court that he spoke to Mr. Bruhnel’s
counsel about this motion prior to filing it with the Court. Undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel
was never notified in any manner that any such motion was being prepared or filed.
Plaintiff’s counsel has further misrepresented to this Court that undersigned counsel for
Mr. Bruhnel stated that Mr. Bruhnel, “has been out of this country since prior to the New Year
with no plans to return.”   In fact, undersigned counsel has consistently told Plaintiff’s counsel
that she was unaware of Mr. Bruhnel’s travel schedule and that she did not know when Mr.
Bruhnel planned to return to this country. 
WHEREFORE, JEAN LUC BRUHNEL, a non-party to the instant matter, and
undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel, respectfully request that the Court DENY plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order to Show Cause and an Order to Compel in its entirety.  Mr. Bruhnel and
undersigned counsel further respectfully request that the Court impose sanctions and attorney’s
fees incurred in the defense of Plaintiff’s frivolous motion, and for whatever further relief this
Court deems appropriate.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES 2-8’ MEMORANDUM IN  
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S RULE 4 APPEAL  
Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-8 (“Plaintiffs”), by and through undersigned counsel, file this 
Memorandum in Response to Defendant’s Rule 4 Appeal of the Magistrate Judge’s Orders (DE 
480 and DE 513) directing Defendant to produce his income tax returns, as follows:  
Introduction 
Defendant appeals the Magistrate Judge’s Orders (DE 480 and DE 513) compelling 
Defendant to produce income tax returns and related forms and schedules.  He fails, however, to 
demonstrate that the Magistrate Judge’s decision as to tax returns is clearly erroneous or contrary 
to law.  The applicable case law establishes that the tax returns are not protected from discovery 
by the Fifth Amendment privilege under the act of production doctrine, or alternatively, that they 
fall within the “required records” exception to the Fifth Amendment privilege.   
The tax returns are indisputably relevant in these cases, particularly as to Plaintiff’s 
claims for punitive damages, and given the Defendant’s invocation of the Fifth Amendment in 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 1 of 10

blanket fashion to all requests for net worth discovery, there is a compelling need for this 
discovery.  Even if Plaintiffs could not demonstrate a compelling need for the tax returns in 
discovery, under applicable Eleventh Circuit precedent and reported cases in this District, 
Plaintiffs would be entitled to this discovery under the broad relevance standard of Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 26(b).  Finally, there is no basis to delay this discovery, as the tax returns are relevant to 
punitive damages, which is an important, current issue in these cases.  For the reasons set forth 
herein, Plaintiff’s request that the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to Defendant’s tax returns be 
affirmed and that Defendant be ordered to produce the tax return discovery requested by 
Plaintiffs.    
Argument 
I. 
DEFENDANT HAS BURDEN TO SHOW THAT MAGISTRATE  
JUDGE’S ORDER IS CLEARLY ERRONEOUS OR CONTRARY TO LAW 
In seeking reversal of the Magistrate Judge’s Order as to discovery of tax returns, it is the 
Defendant’s burden to show that the order is “clearly erroneous or contrary to law”.  28 U.S.C. 
§636(b)(1).  Absent such a showing, the Magistrate Judge’s decision “shall not be disturbed.” 
Emmisive Energy Corp. v. Novatac, Inc., 2009 WL 2834841 *1 (S.D. Fla. 2009).  In the instant 
appeal, Defendant has not shown that the Magistrate Judge’s Order to produce tax returns is 
clearly erroneous or contrary to law.  
II. 
THE ACT OF PRODUCTION OF TAX RETURNS IS NOT  
PROTECTED BY THE FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE 
The Plaintiffs served the following document request in discovery, to which Defendant 
asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege:  
Request No. 1:  All Federal and State income tax returns, including all W-2 
forms, 1099 forms and schedules, for tax years 2003-2008. 
The Magistrate Judge rejected the Defendant’s privilege assertion as to tax returns.  (De 480, pp. 
8-9).  In so holding, the Magistrate Judge applied the act of production doctrine set forth in 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 2 of 10

Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 410 (1976) and United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 35-
(2000).  As noted by the Magistrate Judge, “Defendant cannot reasonably and in good faith 
argue that in producing these documents to Plaintiff he will somehow be incriminating himself.”  
(Order, p. 9).  Yet, Defendant argues just that.  In Hubbell, the Supreme Court made express 
reference to tax returns in discussing documents that cannot be protected by the Fifth 
Amendment privilege under the act of production doctrine:  
[T]he fact that incriminating evidence may be the byproduct of 
obedience to a regulatory requirement, such as filing an income 
tax return, maintaining required records, or reporting an accident, 
does not clothe such required conduct with the testimonial 
privilege.  
120 U.S. at 2043, 530 U.S. at 35 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis supplied).  Accord United States 
v. Hammes, 3 F.3d 1081, 1083 (7th Cir. 1993) (“[w]e reject [defendant’s] compulsory self-
incrimination claim because the government may use voluntarily filed tax returns against a 
defendant without violating the Fifth Amendment”).  See also Garner v. United States, 96 S.Ct. 
1178, 424 U.S. 648 (1976) (holding that disclosures in tax returns are not compelled 
incriminations and may be used as evidence in criminal prosecution); Ebay, Inc. v. Digital Point 
Solutions, Inc., 2010 WL 147967 *8 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (holding that a person cannot incriminate 
himself by turning over a document already in the government’s possession); Federal Savings 
and Loan Ins. Corp. v. Hardee, 686 F. Supp 885 (N.D. Fla. 1988) (holding that personal income 
tax returns and supporting schedules are not protected by the “act of production” doctrine under 
Fisher).  
As an alternative to finding that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply because 
the act of producing documents is not testimonial and communicative, courts have invoked the 
“required records” exception to the act of production doctrine.  See Federal Saving & Loan Ins. 
Corp. v. Rodrigues, 717 F. Supp. 1424, 1427 (N.D. Cal 1988) (“required records” exception is a 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 3 of 10

distinct basis to deny Fifth Amendment privilege alternative to the “foregone conclusion” 
rationale under Fisher).  The “required records” exception defeats the Fifth Amendment privilege 
where: “(1) because of the public aspect of the required records the individual admits little of 
significance by their production; and (2) by doing business in an area where the government 
requires record keeping, an individual may be deemed to have waived the Fifth Amendment 
privilege as to the production of those records.”   In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 21 F.3d 226, 229 
(8th Cir. 1994).    
Defendant contends that the “required records” exception does not apply to tax returns 
because they cannot be accessed by the public.  This is wrong, however, as the “required 
records” exception requires only that there be “public aspects” to the documents at issue.  Id. 
Numerous courts that have addressed this precise issue have found that tax returns have “public 
aspects”. See Rodrigues, 717 F. Supp. at 1426-27 (citing cases); accord Doe v. United States, 
711 F.2d 1187, 1191 (2d Cir. 1983).1   Accordingly, the “required records” exception applies to 
the production of tax returns.   In Rodrigues, the Court denied the Fifth Amendment privilege for 
the act of producing tax returns under the “required records” exception, noting that “records filed 
with a public body pursuant to a valid regulatory scheme have been held to have public aspects.”  
Id. at 1427.  Accordingly, the fact that federal tax returns cannot be accessed by the general 
public does not aid the Defendant.  Accord Resolution Trust Corp. v. Lopez, 794 F. Supp. 1, 3 
(D.D.C. 1992). 
Thus, there are two alternative grounds for holding that Defendant’s assertion of the Fifth 
Amendment privilege to production of tax returns is invalid:  (1) the tax returns are in the 
Defendant further appears to argue that the “required records” exception should be limited to 
“highly regulated business (e.g., physicians)”, citing In re Dr. John Doe, 97 F.R.D. 640, 641-643 
(S.D.N.Y. 1982).  In Dr. John Doe, however, the Court held contrary to Defendant’s assertion 
and consistent with the case law cited herein stating, “[w]e agree that some of these records (e.g. 
W-2 and other tax forms) may indeed fall within the required records exception.”  Id. at 644 
(ordering that Dr. Doe comply with subpoena for W-2 forms).  
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 4 of 10

possession of the government, their existence is a foregone conclusion, and there is no risk of 
“implicit authentication” by Defendant’s production of these documents; or (2) tax returns fall 
within the “required records” exception to the act of production doctrine, and are thus not 
protected by the Fifth Amendment.  Under either of these grounds, the Defendant’s tax returns 
are not privileged and must be produced in discovery.  
II. 
THERE IS NO HEIGHTENED BURDEN 
FOR DISCOVERY OF TAX RETURNS 
Defendant asserts that there is a heightened burden on a party seeking discovery of tax 
returns, requiring that party to show not only relevance, but also that “a compelling need for the 
tax returns exists because the information contained therein is not otherwise available.”  (Appeal, 
p. 24).  However, in the Eleventh Circuit this heightened burden has been rejected. “[T]he 
Eleventh Circuit does not require a showing of compelling need before tax information may be 
obtained by a party in discovery.” Bellosa v. Universal Tile Restoration, Inc., 2008 WL 2620735

2009 WL 383349 (S.D. Fla. 2009).  Significantly, in both Preferred Care and Ruskin the Court 
affirmed the decision of a Magistrate Judge rejecting a higher standard for production of tax 
returns, holding that, despite an arguable split of authority, 2 the Magistrate Judge’s decision was 
not “contrary to law.”  Id.  Likewise, the Magistrate Judge’s decision in this case compelling 
Defendant relies upon Pendlebury v. Starbucks Coffee Co., 2008 WL 2105024 (S.D. Fla. 2005) 
and Dunkin Donuts, Inc. v. Mary’s Donuts, Inc., 2001 WL 34079319 (S.D. Fla. 2001), in which 
the Court applied the higher standard.  These cases do not consider the Eleventh Circuit’s 
opinion in Maddow, and the federal judges in this District over the past five years since 
Pendlebury have consistently rejected the “compelling need” standard for production of tax 
returns.  See cases cited above.  
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 5 of 10

production of tax returns is consistent with authority in this District and the Eleventh Circuit, and 
thus should be affirmed.  
III. 
EVIDENCE OF DEFENDANT’S FINANCIAL 
STATUS AND HISTORY IS RELEVANT TO  
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AMONG OTHER ISSUES 
Defendant does not go so far as to contend that the discovery of his tax returns is not 
relevant under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26.  Defendant only argues that the Magistrate Judge did not address 
the relevancy standard in her Order.  (Appeal, p. 25).  As a result, Defendant does nothing to 
show that the Magistrate Judge’s Order as to tax returns is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.  
In any event, it is abundantly clear that Defendant’s financial status and history are relevant to 
punitive damages, among other issues in these cases, and in this regard the Defendant’s tax 
returns are pertinent and discoverable.  Tennant v. Charlton, 377 So.2d 1169 (Fla. 1979) (holding 
that party may obtain tax returns for purposes of net worth discovery on issue of punitive 
damages).  See also State v. O’Malley, 53 S.W. 3d 623 (Mo. App. 2001) (“[i]t is well settled that 
when a plaintiff seeks punitive damages against a defendant, evidence of the defendant’s 
financial status is both relevant and admissible”); Interstate Narrow Fabrics, Inc. v. Century 
USA, Inc., 2004 WL 444570 (M.D. N.C. 2004) (holding that tax returns are relevant to the jury’s 
determination of the amount of punitive damages to award); E.J. Lavino & Co. v. Universal 
Health Services, Inc., 1991 WL 275767 (E.D. Pa. 1991) (“[m]ost courts that have considered this 
issue have held that a plaintiff seeking punitive damages may discovery information pertaining 
to a defendant’s net worth”).  
Defendant further argues that he should not have to produce his tax returns until “it 
becomes apparent” that “punitive damages will be an issue.”  (Appeal, p. 26).  This argument 
ignores Florida law on punitive damages.  It is well established that “punitive damages are 
always recoverable in intentional tort cases where malice is one of the essential elements of the 
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 6 of 10

tort.”  Ciamar Marcay, Inc. v. Monteiro Da Costa, 508 So.2d 1282 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987) 
(emphasis supplied).  “In Florida it is clear that an act of intentional assault and battery 
committed without legal justification supplies proof of malice.”  Joab, Inc. v. Thrall, 245 So.2d 
291 (Fla. 3d DCA 1971).  Therefore, it is clear in this intentional tort case that punitive damages 
are an issue.  As this Court knows, Defendant Epstein is alleged to have perpetrated a plan and 
scheme to sexually molest dozens of underage teenage girls.3 
Even assuming that the “compelling need” standard were applicable for discovery of tax 
returns, clearly in this case there is a compelling need. Defendant has provided no net worth 
discovery, asserting a blanket Fifth Amendment privilege.4   Defendant nonetheless contends that 
there exists an “alternative” - not to discovery of the necessary information, but through his offer 
to “stipulate” to a net worth in the nine figures.  Of course, a stipulation requires the consent of 
the parties and there is no agreement in this case on the Defendant’s net worth.  Defendant 
cannot unilaterally by fiat claim a certain net worth for purposes of trial.5  The law is well 
established that a jury may determine punitive damages “by exacting from [the defendant’s] 
pocketbook a sum of money which, according to his financial ability, will hurt, but not 
Defendant’s reliance on Gallina v. Commerce and Industry Ins., 2008 WL 3895918 (M.D. Fla. 
2008) is misplaced.  Gallina is an insurance bad faith case and does not involve a claim of 
punitive damages against an intentional tortfeasor. Moreover, in the present case it would make 
no sense to have a different “stage” for punitive damages discovery or trial.   
“[T]he burden to identify an alternative source of the information lies with the resisting party.”  
Interstate Narrow Fabrics, 2004 WL 444570 at *2.  Here, Epstein’s blanket Fifth Amendment 
privilege assertion to all net worth discovery makes it clear that there is a compelling need for 
any net worth discovery not protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege.  
Defendant relies upon Myers v. Central Florida Investment, Inc., 592 F.3d 1201 (11th Cir. 
2010) for its “stipulation” argument.  In Myers, however, the district court heard testimony 
regarding each of the defendant’s net worth.  There was no unilateral statement of net worth in 
Myers as Defendant wishes to create in the instant case.   To the extent that Defendant relies 
upon the Court’s holding in Myers regarding the reasonableness of the trial court’s award of 
punitive damages, the issue of reasonableness is determined by the particular facts and 
circumstances of the case and the discussion in Myers of this issue has no relevance here. Id.  
Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 7 of 10

bankrupt.”  Joab, Inc. v. Thrall, 245 So.2d 291 (Fla. 3d DCA 1971) (emphasis supplied).  
Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to discovery on the Defendant’s real net worth so that the jury 
will be in a position to make an award that “will hurt”.   In any event, it seems beyond dispute 
that Defendant’s tax returns are relevant and discoverable, either under a straight relevance test 
under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 or a heightened “compelling need” standard. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to Defendant’s production of 
tax returns in response to Plaintiffs’ document request no. 1 are not clearly erroneous and not 
contrary to law.  As a result, the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to production of tax returns should 
be affirmed.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ document 
request no. 1 be ordered to be produced forthwith.

JUN f 4 2010 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion to 
Quash and Motion for Attorneys' Fees, With Incorporated Memorandum Of Law 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter "EPSTEIN") by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, hereby files his Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion 
to Quash and Motion for Attorneys' fees and Costs, With Incorporated Memorandum Of 
Law. In support, Defendant states as follows: 
1. As this Court is well aware, these cases have been consolidated for discovery. 
However, on April 1, 2010, Plaintiffs counsel, Spencer Kuvin, filed C.L. v. Epstein, 
Case No. 10-80447-cv-Marra/Johnson, and that case has not been consolidated with the 
other related cases for purposes of discovery. 
2. On April 20, 2010, Mr. Kuvin served Maritza Milagros Vasquez with a subpoena 
for deposition, which is set to occur tomorrow. See Exhibit "A". However, this Notice 
and subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed as Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his 
client, has failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 (d). That rule states, in pertinent part, 

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010   Page 2 of 9
j 
that: "[a] party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred 
as required by Rule 26(t) .... " Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, has not complied with 
Rule 26(t) and, therefore, the subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed and a 
Protective Order should be entered pursuant to Rule 26( c) forbidding the deposition from 
occurring for non-compliance with the applicable rules. In Varo, Inc. v. Litton Systems, 
Inc., 129 F.R.D. 139, 141 (N.D. TX 1989), the court held that one cannot be compelled to 
comply with a withdrawn subpoena. Id. Likewise, the court here cannot compel Maritza 
Milagros Vasquez to attend any deposition when the subpoena itself is invalid, especially 
when it will require those involved in these matters to incur substantial attorneys' fees. 
3. Next, Mr. Brad Edwards, counsel for Jane Doe, cross-noticed Maritza Milagros 
Vasquez's deposition in Jane Doe (#08-80893 - Exhibit "B"), which matter is already set 
for trial in July 2010. 
Discovery concluded on May 31, 2010 (see DE 531). 
Accordingly, the cross notice served by Jane Doe must be stricken/quashed and a 
protective order entered because the subpoena itself in invalid due to C.L.'s counsel's 
failure to comply with Rule 26(d) and discovery in Jane Doe (80893) has concluded. 
Rule 7 .1 Certification 
I hereby certify that counsel for the respective parties communicated by e-mail in a 
good faith effort to resolve the issues set forth above prior to the filing of this Motion and 
none of the issues were resolved. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court enter an order granting 
. 
Defendant's motion for protective order and motion to quash. Defendant further requests 
that this Court award his attorney's fees and costs associated with this motion, m 
accordance with Rule 37, Fed.R.Civ.P. and applicable Local Rules and specifically: 
a. Quash CL's subpoena attached as Exhibit "A"; 
1I

Case 9:09-cv-80802-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010   Page 3 of 9
b. Quash and/or strike Jane Doe's cross notice as to Exhibit "A" because 
Exhibit "A" is invalid and discovery has concluded in Jane Doe; 
c. Award attorneys to Defendant for CL and Jane Doe's noncompliance with 
these discovery matters; and 
d. for such other and further relief as this co
