COUNT ONE 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. 
Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. 
In 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1-1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 3 of 15
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. 
EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
• age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Pa.lm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1-1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 4 of 15
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. 
EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. 
In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. 
Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1-1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 5 of 15
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." 
During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. 
Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasioni at the New York Residence. 
EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. 
In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1-1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 6 of 15
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. 
Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. 
When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. 
Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. 
In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. 
When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. 
In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1-1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 7 of 15
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruite~s to bring a specific minor girl fo~ EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. 
In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. 
EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. 
At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and' 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. 
Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. 
EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1-1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 8 of 15
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. 
In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. 
In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. 
At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. 
Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1-1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 9 of 15
19. 
Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
9. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein was an adult male over 
years old.  Epstein was tremendously wealthy, widely recognized as a billionaire, who used his 
wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal sexual crimes in violation of federal 
Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 2 of 14

and state statutes and to employ and conspire with other individuals and corporate entities to assist 
him in committing those crimes or torts or to facilitate or enable those acts to occur. 
10. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his employees; to 
the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his direction; to the victims 
procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to advance and carry out and conceal his 
crimes and torts.   
11. 
The allegations herein primarily concern Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct while at his 
townhouse in New York.   
12. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females as young as 14 years 
old.   
13. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor children, and 
took pleasure corrupting vulnerable young females, including minor children, into engaging in 
sexual acts with him. 
14. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees and 
associates of entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the purpose of harming teenage 
girls through sexual exploitation. 
15. 
On July 2, 2019, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
New York filed a Sealed Two Count Indictment inclusive of One Count of Sex Trafficking 
Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking, in part due to Epstein’s criminal activities against 
children in the New York Mansion located at 9 East 71st Street.   
16. 
On July 8, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested pursuant to the aforementioned 
Indictment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.    
Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 3 of 14

17. 
The Indictment stated in part, and Plaintiff herein adopts as true, that “from at least 
in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, 
enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York (the “New York Residence”) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
“Palm Beach Residence”) to engage in sex acts with him, after which the victims were given 
hundreds of dollars in cash.”  Criminal Indictment at 1. 
18. 
“Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein 
also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN.  In 
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in 
locations including New York and Palm Beach.”  Criminal Indictment at 1-2.   
19. 
“The victims described herein were as young as 14 years old at the time they were 
abused by Jeffrey Epstein, and were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to 
exploitation.  Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that many of his victims were in 
fact under the age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims expressly told him 
their age.”  Criminal Indictment at 2.  
20. 
“In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple states to 
sexually abuse and exploit, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, … worked and conspired with others, including 
employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims 
and scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm 
Beach Residence.”  Criminal Indictment at 2.   
21. 
The indictment further explained, and Plaintiff adopts and alleges, that, “[v]ictims 
were initially recruited to provide ‘massages’ to Epstein, which would be performed nude or 
Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 4 of 14

partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one or 
more sex acts.”  Criminal Indictment at 3.   
22. 
“Between at least in or about 2002 and in or about 2005, Epstein abused numerous

$300 to provide a massage to a rich man in Manhattan.  
29. 
Plaintiff was a minor female with no experience or training in massage.  
30. 
In 2003, Plaintiff’s friend brought Plaintiff to Jeffrey Epstein’s townhouse mansion 
located at 9 East 71st Street, NY to provide him with a massage.

32. 
Plaintiff’s friend entered the massage room with Plaintiff where they met Jeffrey 
Epstein.   
33. 
Jeffrey Epstein lay down naked on the massage table and instructed Plaintiff and 
her friend to remove their clothes, and both complied. 
34. 
Plaintiff’s friend began instructing Plaintiff how to provide Jeffrey Epstein a 
massage and Plaintiff began doing as told. 
35. 
During the massage, Jeffrey Epstein turned over and began touching Plaintiff’s 
breasts, and vagina. 
36. 
Jeffrey Epstein then began masturbating in front of Plaintiff while instructing 
Plaintiff to pinch his nipples.

kept by Jeffrey Epstein or one of his employees who worked at his NY mansion. 
41. 
Plaintiff was contacted regularly beginning in 2003 while she was 14 years old to 
schedule times for her to visit the mansion and engage in sexual acts with Jeffrey Epstein in his 
massage room. 
Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 6 of 14

42. 
Lesley Groff, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most trusted employees, would typically call 
Plaintiff to schedule a time for her to visit Jeffrey Epstein at the mansion. Other times, Plaintiff 
would be called by Jeffrey Epstein directly. 
43. 
Beginning in 2003 through 2006, Plaintiff visited Jeffrey Epstein at his mansion on 
average once per week. During each visit, Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual contact with Plaintiff, 
which often included touching her naked breasts and vagina and using sex toys on her vagina. 
44. 
On numerous occasions, Jeffrey Epstein would forcibly insert his finger or sex toy 
into Plaintiff’s vagina. 
45. 
On one occasion when Plaintiff was 15 years old, Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend 
entered the massage room while Plaintiff was in there. Jeffrey Epstein ordered his girlfriend to 
engage in oral sex with Plaintiff during that occasion, which she did by force and against Plaintiff’s 
will and consent.  
46. 
On another occasion, when Plaintiff was 16 years old, Jeffrey Epstein engaged in 
forcible sexual intercourse with Plaintiff, and paid her $400 instead of the normal $300 after that 
forcible sexual encounter.  
47. 
In addition to going to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion where Jeffrey Epstein violated the 
minor Plaintiff sexually, Jeffrey Epstein also encouraged Plaintiff to bring her high school friends 
to him for sexual purposes as well. 
48. 
Jeffrey Epstein told Plaintiff he would pay her $300 for each friend she brought 
him. 
49. 
Plaintiff did as she was instructed to do and brought Jeffrey Epstein other females 
as young as 14 years old.  Plaintiff was paid $300 for each she brought.   
Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 1     Filed 12/27/19     Page 7 of 14

that Plaintiff continues to suffer. 
63. 
This cause of action is timely under the Child Victims Act, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214-g

Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent the five Plaintiffs referenced above whose cases have all been assigned to Your Honor. While 
we agree with Defendants’ assertion that our discussions with the designers and administrator of the Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program have been positive and productive, in our view, it remains important to 
every aspect of the process that our cases are not stayed and that they proceed accordingly.   
As we explained during the Case Management Conference that was held on November 21, 2019, our clients 
have varying views of the process, and while each will maintain an open mind about potential alternative 
resolution, those who have filed lawsuits do not wish to delay the expeditious litigation of their claims. 
We have and will continue to work with Mr. Moskowitz to ensure that we arrive at as many agreements as 
possible.  Consequently, we agree with the following discovery schedule as proposed in his report: Plaintiffs 
and the Estate will make initial disclosures by January 23, 2020; the Parties will exchange proposed 
discovery plans by January 30, 2020; and the Parties will jointly submit to Your Honor a proposed discovery 
plan by February 6, 2020. 
Respectfully Submitted,

Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate”), Nine East 71st Street, Corporation, Financial Trust Company, 
Inc., NES, LLC, Florida Science Foundation, Inc., HBRK Associates, Inc., JEGE, Inc., Maple, 
Inc., and LSJ, LLC (together, “Defendants”; and Defendants together with Plaintiffs VE, Katlyn 
Doe, Priscilla Doe, Lisa Doe and Anastasia Doe, the “Parties”) in the referenced actions, as 
applicable.  We write on behalf of all Parties to report to the Court regarding settlement and to 
respectfully request that the Court approve the Parties’ discovery proposal.  
We understand that the vast majority of the plaintiffs in the above referenced and other actions 
against the Estate pending in this District will or are very likely to participate in the Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”), with five plaintiffs having already voluntarily 
stayed their actions pending their participation in the Program.  Counsel for all such plaintiffs 
have conferred extensively with the Program designers and administrator, including in person, 
to, among other things, provide specific input on the draft Program protocol issued on 
December 13, 2019.  We understand such discussions have been positive and productive. 
The Parties propose the following schedule for discovery:  Plaintiffs and the Estate will make 
initial disclosures by January 23, 2020; the Parties will exchange proposed discovery plans by 
January 30, 2020; and the Parties will jointly submit to Your Honor a proposed discovery plan by 
February 6, 2020.

DEBRA FREEMAN, United States Magistrate Judge: 
The above-referenced cases - all brought by plaintiffs claiming that they were sexually 
abused by Jeffrey Epstein and seeking damages from his estate - have been neither consolidated 
for any purpose, nor designated as "related" by the Court. Nonetheless, these cases (together 
with certain other, similar cases, not listed above) have been referred to the undersigned for 
general pretrial supervision, so that discovery - and potentially settlement - may be coordinated 
as reasonable. While, at the parties' request, discovery in the other Jeffrey Epstein cases referred 
to this Court has been stayed pending a further report on the parties' settlement efforts, the 
parties to each of the above-referenced cases have requested, by submissions dated January 10, 
2020, that this Court set a discovery schedule. This Court's having reviewed the parties' 
submissions, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
1. 
In each of the above-referenced cases in which the parties have not yet submitted 
a jointly proposed discovery plan pursuant to Rule 26( t) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
the parties are directed to submit a proposed discovery schedule for this Court's review no later 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 13     Filed 01/14/20     Page 2 of 2
than February 6, 2020. This submission should address all of the matters set out in Rule 26(t)(3), 
and should specifically include proposed deadlines for: 
a. 
service of initial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(l); 
b. 
service of initial document requests and interrogatories; 
c. 
any motion for joinder of other parties or amendment of the pleadings; 
d. 
completion of fact discovery; and 
e. 
expert disclosures and the completion of expert discovery, if any. 
. 
. 
2. 
As to each of the above-referenced cases, this Court will hold a pretrial 
conference pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on February 11, 2020, at 
10:00 a.m., in Courtroom 17 A at the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY 
10007. The parties should be aware, however, that the mere fact that this Court will be holding a 
single, joint case-management conference does not necessarily mean that this Court will set an 
identical discovery schedule in each case. At the conference, counsel should be prepared to 
address whether there are reasons why these cases should be treated differently for scheduling 
purposes.

Moreover, nothing stated herein is intended to or shall be construed as a concession that any 
particular issue or subject matter is relevant to Plaintiff’s allegations. 
1.
Plaintiff’s Complaint fails, in whole or in part, to state a claim upon which relief 
can be granted.

2.
Plaintiff’s claims are barred to the extent Plaintiff has not suffered any damages; 
alternatively, Plaintiff’s claims are barred to the extent Plaintiff has not been damaged to the extent 
alleged, and failed to mitigate any damages she may have suffered. 
3.
Contributory Negligence. If Plaintiff suffered or sustained any loss, injury, damage 
or detriment, and the same was directly and proximately caused and contributed to by the conduct, 
acts, omissions, activities, carelessness, negligence, and/or intentional misconduct of Plaintiff, 
Plaintiff’s recovery herein is partially or completely barred. 
4.
Assumption of Risk.  Plaintiff’s claims are barred to the extent that, at the time and 
place of the incidents alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint, Plaintiff knew of and fully understood the 
danger and risks incident to their undertaking; but despite such knowledge, Plaintiff freely and 
voluntarily assumed and exposed herself to all risks of harm and the consequential injuries and 
resultant damages, if any.  
5.
Comparative Fault of Third Parties.  If and to the extent that the Co-Executors are 
subjected to any liability to Plaintiff due, in whole or in part, to the acts, omissions, activities, 
carelessness, recklessness, negligence, and intentional misconduct of persons or entities other than 
Decedent, any recovery obtained by Plaintiff against the Co-Executors should be reduced in 
proportion to the respective negligence and fault and legal responsibility of all such other persons 
and entities, and their agents, servants and employees who contributed to or caused any such injury 
or damages, in accordance with the law of comparative negligence; the liability of the Co-
Executors, if any, is limited in direct proportion to the percentage of fault actually attributed to 
Decedent.

7.
Intervening/Superseding Causes. To the extent the injuries and damages which 
Plaintiff alleges were proximately caused by, or contributed to by, the acts of other persons or 
other entities, and said acts were intervening or superseding causes of the injuries and damages, if 
any, which Plaintiff alleges, Plaintiff is barred from any recovery against the Co-Executors.

defenses and reserve the right to assert and rely upon such affirmative defenses as may become 
available or apparent during discovery. The Co-Executors further reserve the right to amend their 
Answer accordingly.

Dear Judge Freeman,  
We represent the five Plaintiffs referenced above whose cases have all been assigned to Your Honor.  
We write to provide you with a Status Update regarding the progress of settlement discussions in the 
cases.  As Your Honor is likely aware, counsel for claimants have spent a substantial amount of time 
working with both the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands and the Estate in an effort to facilitate the 
establishment of an independent and Voluntary Claims Resolution Program (“Program”) for the 
purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey Epstein.  Unfortunately, we have reached a 
point of apparent impasse, and thus felt it necessary to apprise the Court of the recent events that have 
transpired.  
As Your Honor is aware, on November 14, 2019, the Estate sought approval of the Program from the 
probate court in the United States Virgin Islands.  On January 15, 2020, just before the February 4, 2020 
hearing wherein approval of the Program was anticipated, the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands 
filed a forfeiture action against the Estate along with a Criminal Activity Lien pursuant to the Criminally 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“CICO”), effectively preventing the Estate from utilizing 
Estate assets to administer the Program.   
At the February 4, 2020 hearing in the Virgin Islands, Judge Hermon-Purcell informed everyone that the 
Attorney General’s lien precluded the Court from allowing the Program to proceed and urged the Estate 
to meet with the Attorney General in an effort to resolve their disagreements to the extent necessary to 
allow the Program to move forward.  The Attorney General expressed that she did not wish to impede 
the establishment of the Program, rather, she felt compelled to seek improvements to the Program to

ensure that its administration is both fair to the victims and independent from the Estate.  In furtherance 
of that position, on February 10, the Attorney General wrote a letter to the Estate, outlining eleven 
substantive concerns about the manner in which the proposed Program was structured.  Summarily, the 
Attorney General’s main concerns centered on the following: (a) the independence of the Program 
Designers and Administrator, who were unilaterally selected by the Estate; (b) ensuring that assets would 
be preserved for victims who opted out of the program or came forward in the future to make sure that 
opting out of the Program was a meaningful option; and (c) the scope of the releases required of victims 
who participated in the program and their ability, and the ability of other witnesses, to cooperate with 
law enforcement. After careful consideration, including in-person meetings with several of Mr. Epstein’s 
victims and counsel for many victims who flew back to the USVI, the Attorney General agreed to a 
partial lifting of her lien to allow for the immediate and effective implementation of the Program if the 
Estate would agree to certain improvements in the Program protocol.   
While it is true that counsel for the victims agreed with the Program moving forward as it was prior to 
the Attorney General’s intervention, there were certain components of the Program that facially appeared 
to favor the Estate to the prejudice of the victims. The most obvious example of this is that the Estate 
unilaterally chose the Program Designers and Program Administrator, refusing to allow the victims or 
counsel any input in that selection process despite many requests for same.  This issue was raised as a 
problem in front of Your Honor at the joint hearing on February 11, 2020.  Your Honor even suggested 
at that hearing that if the appearance of the Program was going to be one of fairness, then the victims 
and their counsel should have some input in the selection process of the Administrator.  The Estate did 
not listen, which only heightened the concerns of the Attorney General.   
We agree with the Attorney General that a Program of this nature requires excellent administration.  For 
that reason, after meeting with and working with her for many months, the undersigned counsel gained 
confidence in the Estate selected Administrator, Jordana Feldman, and believes she is best suited to serve 
in the role of Program Administrator.  The Attorney General, however, has taken great issue with the 
independence of the Program based on the fact that Ms. Feldman and the Program Designers—Ken 
Feinberg and Camille Biros—were unilaterally selected by the Estate without input from the victims.  
After much deliberation, and at the urging of the undersigned, the Attorney General agreed that her 
impartiality concerns could be meaningfully satisfied so long as the Estate would agree to add a victim-
selected Administrator to serve alongside Ms. Feldman.    
We recommended Professor Marci Hamilton, as she is the foremost expert on child sexual abuse in the 
country.  Professor Hamilton has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the area of sexual abuse and 
would be an indispensable asset to the Program.  Professor Hamilton has an unparalleled understanding 
of the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse, and the impact of sexual abuse on 
victims.  Because of Ms. Hamilton’s unimpeachable record as an expert on the topic, the suggestion of 
adding her to the Program was ultimately accepted by the Attorney General and also by the Estate, the 
Program Designers, and the Program Administrator.   
This agreement was promising, although Ms. Hamilton’s precise role had not been defined.  In an effort 
to ensure that Professor Hamilton’s expertise is utilized to the fullest extent possible, the Attorney 
General wanted Professor Hamilton to have equal decision-making authority and for each claim to be 
decided by a consensus agreement between Ms. Feldman and Professor Hamilton.  The Estate rejected 
that notion outright claiming that any disagreement would delay what was designed to be an efficient

process.  Instead, the Estate proposed that Ms. Hamilton would be available to consult with Ms. Feldman 
on an as-needed basis.  
On March 5, 2020, counsel for the Estate, counsel for the Attorney General, the undersigned counsel, 
and the Program Administrator met in Miami, Florida in an effort to resolve all outstanding issues to 
allow the Program to move forward, including to reach an agreement for Marci Hamilton’s role in the 
Program.  After the meeting, the undersigned believed all parties had agreed that Professor Hamilton 
would be a Program Consultant with the ability to make a meaningful impact on the Program, but that 
all final claim decisions would rest exclusively with Ms. Feldman.  Again, counsel for the victims found 
this agreement to be hopeful—albeit far from the Attorney General’s original demand—as Professor 
Hamilton would be able to provide input and valuable information on sexual abuse that would assist in 
the evaluation of the claims.  
After the Miami meeting, varying role descriptions remained pending for Professor Hamilton.  The 
Attorney General and the victims merely requested that in order to serve as a meaningful Consultant to 
the Program, Professor Hamilton should be permitted to review the claimant’s files and provide 
information to Ms. Feldman before evaluation decisions were made, understanding that Ms. Feldman 
could choose to completely ignore any opinions or suggestions Ms. Hamilton made and that the ultimate 
decision will rest exclusively with Ms. Feldman.  The Estate rejected outright the idea of allowing 
Professor Hamilton to have access to the claimant files, and instead maintained that Professor Hamilton 
would only be utilized to answer any general questions that may arise, if someone ever decided to call 
her with a question.  With confidence that Professor Hamilton’s involvement would enhance the quality 
of the Program and serve as an additional protection for the victims, the Attorney General reluctantly 
agreed to allow the Program to proceed notwithstanding the Estate’s refusal to allow Professor Hamilton 
to have decision making authority or even access to the view claimants Program files, so long as the 
Program mandated periodic meetings between Ms. Feldman and Professor Hamilton.  The Estate and 
Attorney General agreed to bi-monthly meetings between the two, resolving the issue.  
In addition to the inclusion of Professor Hamilton as a Program Consultant and referral source for 
counseling or other services to victims, all parties have agreed to make additional enhancements to the 
Program including: 1) the probate court in the Virgin Islands will be responsible for approving and 
overseeing the expenses in operating the Program, 2) information provided by victims during the 
administration of the Program will be maintained as confidential and not be shared with the Estate or 
used against victims in defending claims, 3) the Program will report to the probate court on an aggregate 
basis the number and amount of claims awarded, and 4) a Victim Set-Aside Fund will be established 
with guaranteed minimum funding of $25 million as a floor for victims who opt out of the Program or 
who emerge within eighteen months of the Program’s launch.   
After what has turned into many months of time and effort expended to reach an agreement wherein the 
Attorney General would allow the Program to move forward, all parties—the Estate, the Attorney 
General, and counsel for many of the victims—did in fact agree on all aspects of the Program with the 
exception of the language of the proposed release to be signed by claimants.  Both the Attorney General 
and the victims have asked that the release not include individual sex abusers aside from Jeffrey 
Epstein.  Unfortunately, the Estate has remained steadfast in its position to require claimants resolving 
claims through the Program to release all abusers related to Epstein, making it clear that the release is 
designed in part to protect any criminal associated with the Epstein enterprise.  While the victims do not

believe this makes the statement the Estate should want to make, the Estate has claimed to do so in an 
effort to uphold their fiduciary duties.  We recognize that the Program is whatever the Estate wants it to 
be and that if any victim does not want to release other criminals associated with Mr. Epstein then she 
can reject any offer made to her on that point.   
In an effort to begin obtaining justice and compensation for our clients as soon as possible, counsel for 
the victims have agreed to move forward with the Program using the release as drafted with the intention 
of negotiating the finer points of the release if and when such negotiation becomes necessary during the 
Program process.  Such agreement to relent only came after multiple efforts for compromise were offered 
by both the Attorney General and the victims—all of which were rejected by the Estate.  Despite our 
urging, the Attorney General has expressed that she cannot allow a Program to go forward that on its 
face aims to protect other criminals who abused young women unless the probate court in the Virgin 
Islands rules that the Program should move forward with the current release over her objection.   
As we have expressed to the Attorney General, the reality is that the Estate had no obligation to create a 
Program at all.  The nature of many of these programs is that it is done for the benefit of the entity 
establishing the program—in this case the Estate.  The Estate has not hidden behind that fact.  The Estate 
had no obligation to consider the victims in choosing the Program Designers and Administrator.  That 
decision to make a unilateral selection caused problems and made everyone skeptical from the very 
beginning.  However, this is the Estate’s Program and the Estate’s rules.  Recognizing that, we have 
assured the Attorney General that the victims are going into the Program eyes-wide-open, knowing that 
it is a Program designed by the Estate to protect the Estate and others.  However, we have confidence 
and trust in the Program Administrator and her independence from the Estate and the fact that the 
claimants will have lawyers to advise them about the pros and cons of any settlement, including what 
she may be giving up.  In that sense, the Program as designed, despite a less than optimal proposed 
release, is better than no program at all.   
This court has always been keenly interested in the Program that the Estate has touted so strongly at 
every hearing.  We felt that it was necessary to provide this Court with a brief, yet detailed, overview of 
the current status of the Attorney General’s lien and the negotiations as they relate to the Program.  In 
an effort to finally obtain justice for many of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims, we again request that this Court 
urge the Estate and the Attorney General alike to finalize their agreement so that the Attorney General 
will lift her lien and allow for the Program to go forward.

CO-EXECUTORS' STATUS REPORT ON CONTINUING 
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH VOLUNTARY COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND 
REQUEST FOR RULING 
' -.. 
Come now the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate"). 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN. and provide the Court with this Status Report 
on their continuing efforts to establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program 
(the "Program") for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims again.st Jeffrey E. Epstein. deceased. 
If the Program fails to launch, it will be an extraordinary lost opportunity for 
eligible claimants to receive compensation and voluntarily resolve their claims of sexual abuse 
against Mr. Epstein through a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation. And there will 
be only one culprit: the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands. Despite weeks of negotiation with 
the Attorney General's representatives -
who prefer to file misleading "status reports" with the 
Court rather than engage in actual, good-faith discussions -·· the Co-Executors are no closer than 
before to having the Attorney General lift her liens on the Estate's accounts so that the Program

• 
can receive un s essentia 1or its operations. 
The Co-Executors and the Attorney General agree on one point: both now seek a 
ruling from the Court that will enable the Program to go forward. The Co-Executors disagree, 
however, on the appropriate issue before the Court. According to the Attorney General, "[her] 
Office seeks a ruling from this Court as to whether the Program, as proposed, should be approved, 
or whether additional concessions, as outlined by the Attorney General, and in the better interests 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 2 of 20

of the victims, are required for its approval and fair administration." 1 That is not the correct 
question: rather, it is whether the Co-Executors have acted in accordance with their fiduciary 
obligations imposed by USVI law on executors of estates. 
As the Court noted during the February 4, 2020 hearing (the "February 4 Hearing"), 
the Co-Executors function as an arm of the Coutt and are vested by law with the responsibility of 
administering the Estate. The actual issue before the Court is whether the Program that the Co-
Executors seek to implement is consistent with their fiduciary duties. As Your Honor recognized, 
the Program as originally designed is not only consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Co-
Executors, but, in fact '' ... we agreed that everybody believes this program is a great program .. . " 
(February 4 Hearing Tr. at 113:24-25.) 
Accordingly, the Co-Executors ask that the Court grant their Expedited Motion for 
Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, filed November 14, 2019, and allow 
the Co-Executors to move forward with the Program as originally conceived. 
Background 
More than seven months ago, the Co-Executors sought to establish the Program by 
interviewing numerous highly-qualified candidates for the role of independent claims program 
designer and administrator. The individuals selected -
Jordana Feldman, Kenneth Feinberg, and 
Camil\e Biros- are the gold standard, with unparalled experiencT in that regard. 2 Designed and 
to be implemented by independent, nationally recognized claims administration experts, with input

Executors' Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Program, filed November 14, 2019;

from interested parties including claimants and their representatives, the Program seeks to timely 
resolve claims through a process that is sensitive to the experiences and concerns of claimants and 
treats them with compassion, dignity, and respect. 
On February 4, 2020, the Court held an extensive hearing on the bonafides of the 
Program, taking detailed testimony .from Program Administrator Jordana Feldman and Program 
Designer Kenneth Feinberg. (February 4 Hearing Tr. at 103:12-186:14.) The Court also heard 
repeated approval of the Program from the multiple claimants' counsel present at that hearing. (Id. 
84: 11-85:2; 85:6-19; 92:24-93:8.) As noted above, the Court recognized toward the end of the 
hearing that the Program is widely viewed as an important, positive step for both claimants and 
the Estate. (Id. at 113:24-25 ('THE COURT: ... I think we agreed that everybody believes this 
program is a great program ... ").) Only one person, alone among all involved, opposes the 
Program: the Attorney General. 3 To hold the Program hostage, the Attorney General issued 
Criminal Activity Liens freezing the Estate's accounts, including funds necessary to staff and 
operate the Program.4 
At the conclusion of the February 4 hearing, the Court urged the Co-Executors and 
the Attorney General's representatives to see if they could come to an agreement on funding the 
Program. (Id. 112:4-12; 204:4-10.) Incredibly, the Attorney General tells the Court (twice) that 
it wrote to the Estate on February I 0, 2020, but "received no response."5 That is false: on February 
12, 2020, counsel for the Estate wrote a six-page letter to the Attorney General addressing each of

Liens, dated March 17, 2020).

the points raised in her letter two days earlier. [Exhibit A] And now, more than five weeks later, 
the Attorney General continues to seek to accomplish her previously-stated goal of scuttling the 
Program before it has a chance to succeed. 
Recent Developments 
On February 28, 2020, the Attorney General -
who has no experience whatsoever 
with claims resolution programs -
presented the Co-Executors with an eleven-point laundry list 
of changes she demanded to the Program's funding, structure, and operations.6 In their continued 
effort to make the Program a reality, the Co-Executors agreed to eight of those demands without 
substantial change; as to the other three, the Co-Executors agreed to the extent their fiduciary 
duties allow them.7 Each of these three latter items is discussed below. 
1. 
The Attorney General Demands that Her Personally-Selected Candidate, a 
Biased Advocate with No Claims Administration Experience, Become a Co-
Eg ual Program Administrator 
The Attorney General demands that Professor Marci Hamilton, a legal academic in 
child sexual abuse at the University of Pennsylvania, assume a role in the Program co-equal with 
Ms. Feldman as Program Administrator. 8 But Ms. Hamilton has no experience in mass tort claims 
resolution, and shoe-horning her into that inappropriate role will force the Estate to incur 
substantial additional time and expense with no commensurate benefit to the Program. That is not 
just the Co-Executor's view: the Progri,tm Administrator and the Program Designers unanimously I 
6. See Gov't. March 18 Status Report, at Exhibit B. 
7. 
Bizarrely, the Attorney General reports that she offered the "concession[]" that the Estate's cooperation with law 
enforcement not be tied to her approval of the Program. (Gov't. March 18 Status Report, at 3 .) The Co-Executors 
are extensions of the Court; they neither need nor require the Attorney General's ·'concession" to uphold their 
fiduciary duties to the Estate or cooperate with legitimate law enforcement efforts. 
8. See Gov't. March 18 Status Report. at 2. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 5 of 20

oppose this role for Ms. Hamilton. The Court had the opportunity to hear Ms. Feldman testify 
about her experience and to explain her efforts to address the views of all those interested in the 
design and the implementation of the Program. And, before the Attorney General raised Ms. 
Hamilton's candidacy, not a single claimants' counsel raised any concern about Ms. Feldman's 
qualifications, expertise or independence from the Estate. 
Nor would hiring Ms. Hamilton in the role demanded by the Attorney General be 
consistent with the Co-Executors' fiduciary duties. Ms. Hamilton's outspoken views on the 
purported criminality of Mr. Epstein and those around him reveal her deep-seated bias against the 
Estate. It is rich irony that the Attorney General compares Ms. Hamilton's proposed role to that 
of a neutral arbitrator.9 In this matter, Ms. Hamilton is as far from a neutral party as one could 
possibly be: her public statements -
on television, in opinion pieces and in multiple news articles 
-
are replete with her strong, loudly-voiced bias against Decedent and anyone who knew him 
when he was alive, such that she believes the Estate should be drained of all assets without regard 
to any nexus to individual claims. Here are but a few examples: 
"It took us 16 years, but New York will be the epicenter for taking 
down the powerful who sexually abused children in New York. It 
will start to happen this year -
in the civil courts. That is because 
there is another path that justice will take to force the facts into the 
public square: On Aug. 14, the one-year look-back window in the 
New York Child Victims Act will kick into effect. When it does, 
every girl who was sexually abused through Epstein's scheme will 
be able to sue for civil damages the ones who caused the abuse. 
Epstein is wealthy and so are many of his friends who enjoyed 
spending time partying with him when these girls -
lured into 
doing 'massages' for much-needed cash- were turned into victims 
of a wealthy sex-trafficking ring. The CV A will level the playing 
field by handing these women potent legal weapons. It's a new 
world, and it's finally getting close to fair." Marci Hamilton, New

"Marci Hamilton, a child sex-abuse expert and founder of the 
nonprofit think tank CHILD USA, alleges that there's 'no question' 
that the men who palled around with Epstein must have noticed the 
presence of underage girls. 'There's also no question that they had 
to have known that these girls were supposedly providing massages 
-
and that should have been warning bells all over the place,' 
Hamilton added.'' (Meera Jagannathan, Marke/Watch, July 14,

"Have you noticed that the latest in the Jeffrey Epstein child sex-
trafficking scandal has focused on the powerful men involved, from 
Epstein to President Trump, Alex Acosta, Bill Clinton, Ken Starr, 
Alan Dershowitz and New York Attorney Geoffrey Berman? To be 
sure, these men-except for Berman-operated together to 
empower Epstein to abuse far more girls than he might have 
otherwise, and that is newsworthy." 
(Marci Hamilton, Miami 
Herald, July 14, 2019 ("Epstein's victims deserve to find justice in 
civil 
court, 
too"; 
available 
at 
https://www.miamiherald-

··Basically, this failure to protect children is a political problem 
across the culture . . . This is outrageous that the [Epstein] victims 
themselves were not even part of the negotiation process. The 
arrogance of [ ] Epstein .. .in this situation is overwhelming ... 
These women were sexually abused as children, one after the other. 
Dozens of them ... This is exactly what is wrong with our society."

87 897923 761 ). 
That is not a criticism of Ms. Hamilton -
as a zealous advocate for children, she 
is of course entitled to voice her deeply-held beliefs. But it does disqualify her as any sort of a 
"neutral" voice in hearing and determining claims through the Program.

Despite Ms. Hamilton's obvious bias against the Estate and those around Mr. 
Epstein, the Co-Executors still sought to find a way in which her expertise on relevant issues might 
be used to benefit claimants, while at the sai:ne time avoiding opportunities for her prejudice, to 
mar the Program Administrator's independent, neutral determinations. 
In their efforts .at 
continuing compromise, the Co-Executors proposed to the Attorney General that Ms. Hamilton 
play an extensive consulting role with the Program, a significant concession given Ms. Hamilton's 
bias: 
'·Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expe1t, 
leading legal academic and advocate of victim's rights, will work closely 
with the Program Administrator to complement the Program's resources. 
Ms. Hamilton's role will be to further inform the Administrator and her staff 
about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse. 
and the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the 
Administrator in developing or updating policies and procedures; to advise 
the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in interactions with 
victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing 
post-determination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling 
or other services." 
(See email from Daniel H. Weiner to Linda Singer dated March 16, 2020, annexed as Exhibit D to 
the Government's March 18, 2020 Status Report.) 10 
Regrettably, the Attorney General rejected that generous proposal out-of-hand in 
her latest public filing. 11 
10. While the Attorney General purports to quote the Co-Executors' proposal, she leaves out entirely this extensive 
description of the role offered to Ms. Hamilton. (Gov't. March 18 Status Report. al 4.) That is disingenuous in 
the extreme.

2. 
The Attorney General Demands that the Co-Executors Restrict Funds 
Available to Claimants Under the Program 
The Attorney General also demands that the Co-Executors "set aside'' -
i.e., make 
unavailable to claimants seeking compensation through the Program -
$40 million for the next 
three years. 12 Restricting the Estate's funds available to pay compensation determinations under 
the Program is anathema to the Co-Executors -
after all, one of the primary attractions of the 
Program is that all of the Estate's funds are available to it. Removing $40 million from the Estate's 
assets available to the Program -
on top of the Attorney General's demand that, to ensure she 
gets paid if she prevails in her CICO action against the Estate, the Estate also '·set aside" Little St. 
James Island, Great Saint James Island, and $73.1 million in cash for past tax incentives -
risks 
leaving the Program with insufficient funds to make good on its promise of speedy. just 
compensation. 
As a compromise, the Co-Executors offered to set aside $25 million in assets for 
eighteen months, a time period that will extend well beyond the expected term of the Program. 
The Attorney General did not respond to the Co-Executors' good-faith compromise proposal. 
3. 
The Attorney General Demands that the Co-Executors Report to Her 
Information Not Required by Virgin Islands Law 
Finally, the Attorney General demands that, in addition to performing their 
fiduciary duties to the Court by accounting f9r all items concerning the Estate in accordance with 
Virgin Islands law, the Co-Executors also report to the Attorney General on matters and entities 
outside the probate proceeding. Once again, that is inappropriate: the Attorney General, an active 
The Attorney General initially insisted that any unused funds from this set-aside be donated to charity. That 
would constitute a direct breach of the Co-Executors' obligations under Virgin Islands law.

litigant against the Estate, has no right to usurp the Court's authority to oversee the Co-Executors' 
administration of the Estate. 13 
* 
* 
* 
* 
As the Attorney General continues to prolong her refusal to fund the Program -
finding one pretext after another to claim she simply wants to improve the Program, while taking 
actions that would remove over $200 million from the Program and make it more costly and less 
effective -
the Estate is forced to actively litigate scores of cases that could otherwise have been 
resolved through the Program. As a result, both claimants and the Estate are expending precious 
resources that would have been far better used in resolving claims through the Program. 14 
lt is now-or-never for the Program. Accordingly, the Co-Executors .ask the Court 
to allow the Co-Executors to continue to perform their fiduciary duties, and -
for the benefit of 
all stakeholders in the Estate, including those who seek to participate in the Program -
grant their 
motion to establish the Program as originally conceived and presented to the Court on November 
14, 2019. 
13. The Attorney General also takes a cheap shot at Program Designer Kenneth Feinberg, citing nine-year-old 
criticism of Mr. Feinberg in the BP Deepwater Horizon litigation. (Gov't. March 18 Status Report at 6 and Exhibit 
E.) Yet the court in that case expressly found that Mr. Feinberg was '•independent" in the sense that BP did not 
control his evaluation of individual claims. (Id. Exh. D at p. I I.) And Mr. Feinberg is not the Program 
Administrator here - Ms. Feldman is. 
14. The Attorney General's interference has forced the Estate to litigate against numerous plaintiffs who would have 
participated in the Program if they had the opportunity to do so. As we emphasized to the Court at our February 
21, 2020 conference, the Co-Executors affirmatively decided to reduce litigation ( and the adversity inherent in it) 
by making the Program available to litigants as well as to those who were harmed but either were not prepared to 
litigate in a public forum, or barred from recovery through the courts due to statute of I imitations or other reasons. 
The Attorney General's actions have had the unfortunate effect of pitting many plaintiffs against the Estate. That 
is precisely the opposite of what the Co-Executors sought and the Court endorsed at the February 4 Hearing.

Re: 
In the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Attorney General George: 
February 12, 2020 
As promised in my e-mail to you dated February 10, 2020, we write in response to 
your letter sent earlier that day regard_ing the formation of the voluntary compensation 
program -
officially known as the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the 
"Program") -
proposed by the Co-Executors in November 2019 and endorsed by • 
Superior Court Judge Hermon-Percell ~d multiple claimants' counsel at the Court's 
hearing held on February 4, 2020 (the "February 4 Hearing"). We believe your letter 
I 
misapprehends both the Court's direction to the Co-Executors and the Attorney 
General's limited role in this matter, and that your suggestions concerning the purpose, 
structure and administration of the Program are far outside the scope of the single issue 
as to which the Court requested that we confer. 
EXHIBIT A 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 13 of 20
1. 
The Program is Designed and Will be Administered by the Nation's 
Leading Experts in the Field. 
. 
. 
As your representatives have no doubt reported to you, both Program 
Ad~trator Jordana_ H. Feldman and Program Designer Kenneth R. Feinberg testified 
at length at the February 4 Hearing. Nationally renowned and respected experts in the 
highly specialized field of mass tort claims resolution, Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg, and 
their colleague Camille Biros have extraordinary experience in administering programs 
addressing the Catholic ~hurch's sexual abuse scandal, the Pennsylvania State 
University sexual abuse scandal, the Boeing 737 Max airplane crashes, the General 
Motors transmission recall, the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal, the BP Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill, the Boston Marathon bombing, the September 11th terrorist attacRs, and 
victims of exposure to Agent Orange, DES and asbestos, as well as several other mass 
torts. 
Both Ms. Feldman and Mr. Feinberg testified regarding their absolute 
independence from the Co-Executors in resolving through the Program claims of sexual 
abuse against Mr. Epstein, explaining that such independence is the sine qua non of their 
agreement to design and implement the Program. Far from questioning the capabilities, 
integrity, or independence of Ms. Feldman and Mr. Feinberg, the multiple stateside and 
Virgin Islands counsel for nearly three dozen individual claimants present at the 
February 4 Hearing supported the Program and the manner in which it was expeditiously 
developed without exception. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 14 of 20
Other than your counsel, no one in the courtroom (or elsewhere) voiced any 
objections to the Program, which - as designed by Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. 
Biros -
will provide claimants with an entirely voluntary, easily accessible, non-
adversarial alternative to protracted civil litigation. 
As Judge Hermon-Percell 
appropriately concluded at the February 4 Hearing, the Program has the potential to save 
enormous amounts of time, risk, and money for both individual cl~ts and the Estate. 
2. 
The Court Urged the Co-Executors to Consult with the Attorney General 
on a Single Issue: Providing Adequate Funding for the Program. 
. 
. 
Your Office previously raised several objections to the Programl; each was 
addressed in detail at the February 4 Hearing. As the testimony of Ms. Feldman and Mr. 
Feinberg elucidated, those critiques were either misguided or mistaken, or both. 2 While 
there are various possible permutations in developing the precise details of a 
compensation mechanism, the Program designed by Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. 
Biros - with substantial input from claimants' counsel - is cost-effective, fair and just. 
Perhaps most important, the Program is already well underway. As you know, 
and as Ms. Feldman and Mr. Feinberg testified, they have been working on the Program 
1. See Opposition to Estate's Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, dated 
January 23, 2020. 
2. Your February 10 letter indicates your Office's lingering confusion on certain aspects of the Program. 
For example, the Co-Executors have not jettisoned the concept of individual claimants signing releases 
if, and only if, those individuals elect to accept the compensation offered by the Program Administrator. 
It would be nonsensical for the Co-Executors to do so, since the Estate would otherwise risk being 
dragged back into litigation through third-party demands for contribution or indemnification. Given 
the Estate's need for legal finality and claimants' unfettered ability to pursue their claims in other fora, 
including through the courts, it is no surprise that - as both Ms. Feldman and Mr. Feinberg testified 
- such releases are commonplace in mass tort compensation programs. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 15 of 20
since well before the Co-Executors announced the "Establishment of the Epstein Victims' 
Compensation Program" on November 14, 2019 - almost three months ago. As Ms. 
Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and counsel for the claimants made clear at the February 4 
Hearing, they have been working diligently and cooperatively to develop a Protocol for 
Judge Hermon-Percell's review and approval. 
Mr. Epstein died on August 10, 2019 - six months ago. You only first expressed 
disagreement with the Program when you filed your Complaint in the Superior Court on 
January 15, 2020. You did not seek to intervene in the Probate Court until January 23, 
2020 or issue your liens until January 31, 2020. The concerns you now express raise an 
obvious question as to why you didn't propose a different compensation program before 
filing these pleadings - which taken together amount to an effort to block or at least 
substantially delay the Program. You certainly had every opportunity to contact the Co-
Executors or Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg, or Ms. Biros and present your concerns and 
make your suggestions to improve the existing Program, but chose not to do so. And 
while this is neither the time nor the place to address each of your purported concerns 
about the Program, it ~s worth emphasizing that your letter is long on C!iticisms -
misplaced in our view -- and woefully short on;solutions. 
The bottom line is that the claimants have invested in the Program and both the 
Estate and the claimants are already incurring significant resources unnecessarily 
litigating while you are delaying the Program. That is something no one who is truly 
concerned about conserving Estate resources and offering claimants an alternative to 
litigation should desire. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 16 of 20
As the Co-Executors pointed out in their.recent filings in the Superior Court,3 it is 
for the Court, not your Office, to oversee administration of the Estate and determine the 
propriety of the Co-Executors' actions under Virgin Islands law. There is only one point 
remaining to be discussed: how best to provide adequate funds for the Program. On this 
issue, the Co-Executors have made their position clear since the outset -
they have 
placed no limits, either individually or in the aggregate, on the compensation that 
individual claimants may receive under the Program. That is the very best that the Co-
Executors can do for existing and potential cla~ts, as they exercise their fiduciary 
duties under Virgin Islands law in administering the Estate. Your efforts seem singularly 
designed to thwart the proper exercise of these fiduciary duties to the substantial 
detriment of all such claimants. 
As you know, the Co-Executors believe that the liens placed by your Office on the 
Estate's assets are improper and invalid under Virgin Islands law. It is for that reason 
that they seek judicial relief from those liens, which if left in place will cause irreparable 
harm to the Estate's property - including assets that would otherwise be available to 
fund the Program. Already, the Co-Executors' ability to preserve the Estate's assets have 
been1 severely undercut. The enclosed check written tq an exterminator needed to 
preserve one of the properties is the first of what will be many checks to bounce as a result 
of the lien imposed by your Office on the Estate's operating bank account. This is the first 
3. See Supplemental Brief Regarding Co-Executors' Obligations to Satisfy Expenses of Administration 
Notwithstanding Liens Issued to "The Estate," dated January 31, 2020; Emergency Motion for Order 
Releasing Funds for Administration of Estate, dated February 10, 2020. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-1     Filed 04/15/20     Page 17 of 20
of what will become an avalanche of harms to the Estate. Your lien has also stripped the 
Co-Executors of their ability to meet payroll, and prevents them from paying electric, 
water, and other basic bills. As a result of your actions, all the Estate's assets - including 
the islands in St. Thomas - will rapidly lose value. Likewise, the impact on the properties 
in Paris, New York City, and Florida if the Estate is unable to pay for their operating and 
maintenance expenses will likely be swift and severe. And it will be hard if not 
impossible to rehire staff once they are forced to seek alternative employment. The harm 
will be irreparable and substantial. Most disappointing and in disregard of the Court's 
request, your Office is holding the Program hostage, thereby threatening to derail a 
vitally important process for claimants to obtain justice. 
The Co-Executors continue to hope that you will reverse your Office's position. In 
the interests of all concerned, the Co-Executors remain willing to work with you on how 
best to adequately fund the Program. Time is of the essence if the Program, and the hopes 
of those women who are eager to use it, are to survive. 
Respectfully, 
Christopher Allen I<roblin

ACTION FOR TESTATE 
ADMINISTRATION 
CO-EXECUTORS' CORRECTIONS TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S 
STATUS REPORT ON VOLUNTARY COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
AND RENEWED REQUEST FOR RULING 
On March 24, 2020, the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate"), 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, asked the Court to grant their Expedited 
Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, filed November 14, 2019, 
and allow the Co-Executors to move forward with that Program as carefully constructed in 
consultation with claimants' counsel and leading independent claims program experts. 
The Co-Executors hereby renew their request. Because the Attorney General of the Virgin 
Islands has no standing in this Court to seek to re-shape the Program to suit her whims -
demanding changes that go against the considered views of the Co-Executors, recommendations 
of nationally recognized experts in the field, and endorsement by multiple claimants' counsel -
the Court should reject her continued efforts to undermine the Program. As detailed below, the 
Attorney General's most recent Status Report (filed April 7, 2020) substantially misrepresents the 
actual state of affairs regarding the Program, and requires correction. 
1. 
The Attorney General Misrepresents Claimants' Position Regarding 
the Program's Third-Party Release 
The Attorney General informs the Court that she and claimants' counsel are aligned on 
rejecting the third-party release (the "Release") that those claimants who elect to receive 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-2     Filed 04/15/20     Page 2 of 17

Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page2 
compensation under the Program would execute. (See 4/7/2020 AG Status Report at 2-3.)1 That 
is false. On the very day that the Attorney General made that (mis)representation to the Court, the 
two most active claimants' counsel -
together, representing by far the largest number of claimants 
-
informed the Co-Executors and the Attorney General that they are prepared to proceed with 
the Program without change to the existing Release. 
The evidence on this point is undisputed. On the morning of April 7, 2020, David Boies 
of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP ( counsel for at least five prospective claimants) informed the Co-
Executors that the existing Release was acceptable as written: 
"I spoke with [counsel for the Co-Executors] this morning. I am now in 
agreement that we should move forward with the claims process without trying 
to further modify the [R]elease. 
I am influenced by the desirability of getting the [P]rogram underway so 
that our clients can begin getting compensation; by the fact that the [R]elease will 
be limited to persons who provided services to Epstein, with the [Re ]lease signed 
by individual victims who accept an award having a space to make clear that certain 
individuals . . . are not released, and by the fact that the release of Epstein's 
employees/service providers will be taken into account by the [Program] 
Administrator in setting the amount of the award. And, of course, this is a 
voluntary process where our clients get to decide whether to be bound after 
learning the amount of the proposed award." 
(See email from David Boies dated April 7, 2020 to Bradley Edwards and counsel for the Co-
Executors, copy attached here as Exhibit B; emphasis supplied.) 
Claimants' counsels' intent to proceed with the Program including the Release as written 
was known to the Attorney General before she informed the Court otherwise. On April 6, 2020 
-
the day before the Attorney General filed her most recent Status Report -
lead counsel for 
some two dozen other prospective claimants told her exactly that. Writing to Mr. Boies, Bradley 
1. A copy of the Release, provided on March 16, 2020 by the Co-Executors to the Attorney General and 
claimants' counsel, is attached hereto as Exhibit A. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-2     Filed 04/15/20     Page 3 of 17
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Co-Executors' Corrections to AG's Status Report & Renewed Request for Ruling 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 3 
Edwards explained his agreement to accept the Release as written, and noted that he had the day 
before told the Attorney General of that fact: 
"We are now both on the same page. I would like, with your permission to 
forward that email [i.e., Mr. Boies' email quoted infra, approving the Release as 
written] to the AG, as I voiced a very similar position to her yesterday." 
(See email from Bradley Edwards dated April 7, 2020 to David Boies and counsel for the Co-
Executors; copy attached as Exhibit C).2 
It is one thing for the Attorney General, who has no experience or expertise with mass tort 
compensation programs, to inveigh against the Program. It is quite another for her to misrepresent 
to the Court that claimants' counsel join in her criticism of the Release. They do not. 
2. 
The Attorney General Misrepresents the Scope of the Release, 
Which is Designed to Prevent "Double Dipping" by Claimants 
The Attorney General also misrepresents the scope of the Release, asserting that the Estate 
seeks the release of "any party" who themselves participated in wrongdoing, including 
"individuals for whom the Estate has no liability." (See 4/7/2020 AG Status Report at 3.) Again, 
that is false. 
The Release is closely modeled on releases employed in multiple voluntary compensation 
programs administered by the Program Administrator and Designers, including the sexual abuse 
scandals currently faced by the Catholic Church. Contrary to the Attorney General's claim, it does 
not include "any party" who committed wrongdoing, nor have the Co-Executors ever proposed 
2. Both Mr. Boies and the Co-Executors immediately consented to Mr. Edwards' request to share 
Mr. Boies' email with the Attorney General, who thus had both Mr. Boies' and Mr. Edwards' 
statements accepting the Release as written before she filed her misleading Status Report with the 
Court.

that it would.3 Rather, as the Co-Executors have explained several times to the Attorney General, 
the Release is aimed at protecting the assets of the Estate by ensuring that an individual claimant 
does not "double dip" -
i.e., she cannot both elect to (1) receive full compensation from the Estate 
through the Program, and also (2) sue individuals affiliated with the Estate who may well implead 
the Estate under doctrines of contribution, indemnification, respondeat superior or otherwise.4 
The Co-Executors' duties under Virgin Islands law require them to protect the Estate's assets, 
including for the benefit of its creditors and claimants. The Release is indispensable in achieving 
that result. 
Nor should the Court accept the Attorney General's straw-man formulation that, 
"[a]ssuming a fairly bargained transaction, the Estate would have to offer increased compensation 
to victims to secure the third-party release to satisfy claims for which it has no legal responsibility." 
(4/7/2020 AG Status Report at 4.) As explained above, the Release is not aimed at claims for 
3. The subjects of the Release are limited to the individuals or entities affiliated with or who provided 
services to Mr. Epstein, as follows: 
"The Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the 'Epstein Estate'), the Co-
Trustees of The 1953 Trust, the Epstein Estate, any entities owned or controlled in whole 
or part by the Estate (the 'Epstein Entities') and their respective current and former 
principals, officers, directors, stockholders, managers, members, partners, limited partners, 
trustees, beneficiaries, administrators, agents, employees, attorneys, predecessors, 
successors, assigns and affiliates, and any entities or individuals who are or have ever been 
engaged by (whether as independent contractors or otherwise), employed by, worked in 
any capacity for, or provided any services to Mr. Epstein, the Epstein Entities or the Epstein 
Estate." (Ex. A at 1-2.) 
The Release specifically provides that it will not release third parties unaffiliated with the Epstein 
Entities, including individuals specified by the claimant. (Id. at 4.) 
4. This is no theoretical risk. On March 12, 2020, one of the primary individuals alleged to have worked 
as a "recruiter" of young women for Mr. Epstein brought suit in the Virgin Islands against the Estate 
and the Co-Executors, demanding indemnification. Ghislaine Maxwell v. Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
et al., Civil Case No. ST-20-CV-155 (Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Thomas and 
St. John).

Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 5 
which the Estate "has no legal responsibility". Rather, its function is exactly the opposite: the 
Release's acknowledged purpose is to avoid having the Estate pulled into litigation by individuals 
who claim that the Estate is legally responsible for their actions. And, as claimants' counsel Mr. 
Boies recognized, the Program will properly offer compensation to legitimate claimants that 
reflects their release of any third parties who are affiliated with Mr. Epstein or the Estate. 
Consistent with their fiduciary duties, the Co-Executors determined that the benefits of 
including within the Release those individuals who may claim (as Ms. Maxwell has already done) 
that the Estate bears financial responsibility for the claims against them, substantially outweighs 
the downside of not requiring a release of those persons. Those downsides include that the Co-
Executors would be forced to ( 1) litigate against the very claimants the Estate will have 
compensated through the Program and thereby sought to both avoid being adverse to those 
claimants and incurring the financial costs oflitigating against them; (2) litigate alongside persons 
for harms caused by their alleged conduct for which the Estate has already paid the plaintiff; and 
(3) pay twice for any harm caused by Mr. Epstein if the damages awarded in that litigation focus 
not just on the conduct of the released person but also Mr. Epstein's conduct.5 
3. 
The Attorney General Lacks Standing to Re-Shape the Program Developed 
b the Co-Executors and Experts in the Field 
More than two months ago-but five months after the Co-Executors and the independent 
claims program experts began working arduously to establish the Program- the Attorney General 
sought to intervene in this probate proceeding in order to oppose the Co-Executors' 
5. The Court should not credit the Attorney General's bizarre complaint that some claimants "may not 
even know the identity of their abusers," and thus could not specify them in the liability carve-out of 
the Release. (4/7/2020 AG Status Report at 3.) None of the 32 claimants who have filed lawsuits to 
date has been unable to identify her claimed abuser. Moreover, any claimant who cannot identify a 
purported abuser would not succeed in litigation.against that person, since one cannot enforce a money 
judgment against an unnamed, unknown party.

implementation of the Program.6 At the hearing on February 4, 2020, during which the Attorney 
General displayed her disregard for probate procedures and the Court's statutory authority, the 
Court expressly denied the Attorney General's motion. (February 4, 2020 Hearing Tr. at 98:8-12.) 
Accordingly, the Attorney General has no standing to demand that the Court re-shape the Program 
to suit her preferences or priorities. That includes her most recent demand that the Court ignore 
the Co-Executors, claimants' counsel and acknowledged experts in the field in order to rewrite the 
text of the Release. 
Just as the Attorney General sought to position herself as a substitute for the Court in 
reviewing and approving the Co-Executors' regular administration of the Estate, she now seeks 
to assume the mantle of Program overseer: demanding that her own hand-picked choice (Marci 
Hamilton) be placed on the Program's payroll; requiring that $25 million from the Estate be made 
unavailable to pay legitimate claimants through the Program; 7 and rewriting the scope of the 
Release when everyone but her- including claimants' counsel, whose clients (unlike the Attorney 
General) would sign the Release -
has accepted that Release as written. That is improper. 
The Attorney General has no right to inject herself into the Program, dictating its policies, 
procedures and administration. To allow her to do so would rob the Program of its independence, 
one of its most critical attributes. And the Attorney General has no business forcing the Court to 
act as umpire on each of her dissatisfactions with the Program; as the Court indicated on more than 
one occasion, it is up to the Co-Executors -
acting as duly appointed extensions of the Court -
6. See Attorney General's Motion to Intervene, filed January 23, 2020 (attaching Government's 
Opposition to Estate's Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Program). 
7. The Attorney General's separate CICO action would, if successful, remove an additional approximately 
$150 million from the Estate's assets. Her public pronouncements notwithstanding, the Attorney 
General has never offered to make a penny of those Funds available to victims of sexual abuse.

to fulfill their fiduciary duties to the Estate. As designed and to be implemented by nationally 
recognized experts, and as approved by virtuaUy every claimants' counsel, the Epstein Victims' 
Compensation Program accomplishes that precise goal. 8

As in their March 24, 2020 application, the Co-Executors again ask the Court to allow them 
to continue to perform their fiduciary duties, and -
for the benefit of all stakeholders in the Estate, 
including those women who seek to participate in the Program -
grant their motion to establish 
the Program as originally conceived and presented to the Court on November 14, 2019.

Mr. Boies' co-counsel, Kevin D' Amour, echoed the statements of numerous claimants' counsel at the 
February 4, 2020 hearing: "I think if we go forward with this program we are going to see great results 
and I think we are going to have a much better outcome ifwe can go forward with this program as soon 
as possible." (February 4, 2020 Hearing Tr. at 88:15-19.) The Court summarized the view of those 
present at that hearing, noting as follows: "I think we agreed that everybody believes this program is a 
great program ... " (Id. at 113:24-25.)

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-2     Filed 04/15/20     Page 12 of 17
"Epstein Entities") and their respective current and former principals, officers, directors, 
stockholders, managers, members, partners, limited partners, trustees, beneficiaries, 
administrators, agents, employees, attorneys, predecessors, successors, assigns and 
affiliates, and any entities or individuals who are or have ever been engaged by (whether 
as independent contractors or otherwise), employed by, worked in any capacity for, or 
provided any services to Mr. Epstein, the Epstein Entities or the Epstein Estate Gointly 
and severally, the "Releasees"), from any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of 
action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, variances, trespasses, damages and 
judgments, whether sounding in equity, tort, common law, contract, statute, regulation 
or otherwise and whether now existing, hereafter existing or revived in the future 
whatsoever in law, admiralty, equity or otherwise, including without limitation any and 
all claims or causes of action that arise or may arise from or which otherwise concern acts 
of sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein (the "Claims") which against the Releasees, Releasor ever 
had, now have or hereafter can, shall or may have, for, upon, or by reason of any matter, 
cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world through the date of this 
General Release. 
This General Release is a broad release of any and all Claims of Releasor against 
any and all Releasees, including without limitation any and all causes of action, lawsuits, 
claims, demands, damages and liability whatsoever, and also including without 
limitation to the extent of their respective liability for the same, any and all such claims 
against any and all Releasees for contribution as to any other person or persons who may 
be determined to have been joint tortfeasors arising out of or in any way related to any 
and all known and unknown personal injuries, and also including without limitation any 
derivative claims for loss of consortium, under any federal, state or local law, without 
limitation. This General Release is all-encompassing and is specifically made and given 
on the premise that any and all Claims by Releasor are hereby released and extinguished, 
whether said Claims arose in Florida, New Mexico, New York, the United States Virgin 
Islands, France or any other country, state, territory, possession or jurisdiction, or 
otherwise. 
This General Release extends to released Claims that Releasor does not know or 
suspect to exist in her favor, which, if known by Releasor, would have materially affected 
her decision to enter into this General Release, and Releasor understands and agrees that 
she is releasing any and all such unknown or unsuspected Claims in Releasor' s favor. 
Releasor acknowledges that she is familiar with Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, 
which provides as follows: 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-2     Filed 04/15/20     Page 13 of 17
A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE 
CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN 
HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF 
KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HA VE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER 
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
Releasor expressly waives and relinquishes any right or benefit that Releasor has 
or may have under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code and under any other statute 
or legal principle with similar effect. In connection with such waiver and relinquishment, 
Releasor acknowledges that she is aware that, after executing this General Release, 
Releasor or Releasor' s attorneys or agents may discover released Claims or facts in 
addition to, or different from, those which they now know or believe to exist with respect 
to the subject matter of this General Release, but that it is Releasor' s intent hereby to fully, 
finally and forever settle and release all of the Claims, whether known or unknown, 
suspected or unsuspected, which now exist, may exist, or heretofore may have existed. 
In furtherance of this intent, this General Release shall be, and remain in effect as, a full 
and complete release of the Claims notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any 
such additional or different Claims or facts. 
The Administrator of the EVCP has retained _______ to confirm that 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and Medicaid will not assert 
any reimbursement claim or lien with respect to compensation awarded to any 
participating claimant under the EVCP; provided, however, that if either entity does 
assert any such interest, __ is hereby authorized to act on behalf of the EVCP to verify 
and resolve such lien or reimbursement claim. 
Releasor agrees to allow the 
Administrator to provide to __ certain information as to Releasor, including: (1) first 
name, last name and middle initial, (2) Social Security number; (3) date of birth, ( 4) gender 
and (5) basic information regarding the nature of Releasor' s Claims, and hereby 
authorizes the Administrator and __ to use, exchange and report this information to 
Medicare, if necessary, for purposes of ensuring compliance with the Medicare 
Secondary Payer Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395(y)(b), and its accompanying regulations. 
Releasor represents and acknowledges that she is voluntarily and freely granting 
this General Release in exchange for payment of the Compensation Offer, and that she is 
legally competent to execute and deliver this General Release. 
Releasor further 
represents that she is represented by legal counsel and has received legal advice prior to 
entering into this General Release and that she has been advised by said attorney 
regarding the terms and conditions of this General Release, which she has completely 
read and fully understands, including that accepting the Compensation Offer and signing 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 28-2     Filed 04/15/20     Page 14 of 17
this General Release is a full and final compromise, adjustment and resolution of any and 
all Claims that Releasor may now have or ever will have against Releasees. 
Pursuant to the EVCP Protocol, the Administrator will maintain the confidentiality 
of all information and documentation relating to claimants who participate in the EVCP 
Program. This General Release does not require participating claimants to maintain such 
confidentiality and Releasor may -- at Releasor' s voluntary and sole option -- disclose 
such information regarding the claims process and/ or the Compensation Offer and any 
other information pertaining to her claim. 
This General Release specifically does not include ______ as a Releasee or 
released party under this Agreement, and all parties expressly acknowledge, agree and 
understand that any and all claims that Releasor has or may have against _____ _ 
are expressly preserved. 
Releasor represents and warrants that she has not assigned any Claims released 
pursuant to this General Release. 
As soon as is reasonably practicable after payment of the Compensation Offer is 
made, and in no event later than three (3) business days from the date thereof, Releasor 
will dismiss with prejudice any legal actions -- whether lawsuits, probate claims or 
otherwise - that Releasor has filed against any of Releasees, with each party to bear her, 
his or its own costs and attorneys' fees. 
This General Release contains the entire understanding of the Releasor and the Co-
Executors of the Epstein Estate. Any modification of any of the provisions of this General 
Release shall be effective only if made in writing and executed by Releasor and the Co-
Executors of the Epstein Estate with the same formality as this General Release.

I spoke with Dan and Andy (whom I am copying) this morning. I am now in agreement that we should move forward with 
the claims process without trying to further modify the release. I am influenced by the desirability of getting the program 
underway so that our clients can begin getting compensation; by the fact that the release will be limited to persons who 
provided services to Epstein, with the lease signed by individual victims who accept an award having a space to make 
clear that certain individuals (e.g., Prince Andrew or others to whom our clients were trafficked) are not released; and by 
the fact that the release of Epstein's employees/service providers will be taken into account by the Administrator in setting 
the amount of the award. And, of course, this is a voluntary process where our clients get to decide whether to be bound 
after learning the amount of the proposed award.

Administrator in setting the amount of the award. And, of course, this is a voluntary process where our clients get to 
decide whether to be bound after learning the amount of the proposed award.

Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, in the above-referenced actions.  We write in response to the 
“Status Update” dated April 15, 2020, submitted by plaintiffs’ counsel, Brad Edwards and 
Brittany Henderson, to Your Honor (ECF Doc. 27).  
Mr. Edwards and Ms. Henderson’s letter is accurate in several important respects: 
First: The Co-Executors have – with no legal obligation to do so – worked hard for more than 
five months to establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program, titled the 
“Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program,” for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims 
against Mr. Epstein.  If the Program fails to launch, it will be an extraordinary lost opportunity for 
eligible claimants to receive compensation and voluntarily resolve their claims through a 
confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation. 
Second: After interviewing several potential candidates to design and administer the Program, 
the Co-Executors selected the nationally acclaimed trio of Jordana Feldman, Kenneth Feinberg 
and Camille Biros, who have designed, implemented and administered extensive mass tort 
compensation programs including the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, those 
involving the Roman Catholic Church sex-abuse scandals, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 
the Gulf of Mexico, the Agent Orange toxic chemical matter, and several others.  (Mr. Feinberg 
in particular had been suggested by some plaintiffs’ counsel for such a role in the Epstein 
matter.)  While some plaintiffs’ counsel had their own preferred candidates, none has 
challenged the integrity, independence or extraordinary qualifications of Ms. Feldman, Mr. 
Feinberg and Ms. Biros.  As Mr. Edwards and Ms. Henderson themselves note, they have 
“gained confidence in the Estate selected Administrator, Jordana Feldman, and believes

April 15, 2020 
Page 2
she is best suited to serve in the role as Program Administrator.” (ECF Doc. 27 p. 2 
(emphasis added).) 
Third:  The Attorney General of the United States Virgin Islands, Denise George, is the only 
person who has consistently sought to defeat the Program, filing in the Superior Court of the 
Virgin Islands her proposed opposition to that Program on January 23, 2020 – months after the 
Co-Executors and plaintiffs’ counsel had worked tirelessly to commence it – and later that 
month imposing broad liens on the Epstein Estate’s bank accounts, thereby preventing the Co-
Executors from funding the Program.  As Mr. Edwards and Ms. Henderson accurately observe, 
“counsel for the victims agreed with the Program moving forward as it was prior to the 
Attorney General’s intervention.”  (Id.  (emphasis added).) Although the Epstein Estate is 
being probated in the Virgin Islands (where Mr. Epstein resided at his death and where he 
beneficially owned real property for many years before then), there are no known claimants 
residing there—Attorney General George has never suggested otherwise.   
In other respects, however, Mr. Edwards and Ms. Henderson omit facts important to 
understanding Attorney General George’s improper efforts to re-shape the Program to her own 
liking.  As envisioned by the Program, legitimate claimants will be able to learn the Program 
Administrator’s compensation determination in their cases – made entirely independent of the 
Estate, and not subject to its review – before electing whether to accept it.  Only if a claimant 
decides to accept that compensation would she execute a release of the Estate, the Co-
Executors and a defined group of individuals and entities affiliated with Mr. Epstein; importantly, 
third parties unaffiliated with Mr. Epstein would not be released.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has 
accepted that proposed release:  as Mr. Edwards notes, “we have confidence and trust in the 
Program Administrator and her independence from the Estate and the fact that the 
claimants will have lawyers to advise them about the pros and cons of any settlement, 
including what she may be giving up.  In that sense, the Program as designed, despite a less 
than optimal proposed release, is better than no program at all.”  (Id. at p. 4  (emphasis added).)  
While such a third-party release is standard practice in mass tort compensation programs  -- the 
one contemplated by the Program is in fact modeled on the release used in the Catholic Church 
compensation programs -- Mr. Edwards’ and Ms. Henderson’s clients would no doubt prefer no 
release at all, or one that would permit them to “double dip” by collecting from the Estate twice:  
once under the Program and again by suing persons who would implead the Co-Executors 
under theories of indemnification, contribution, respondeat superior or otherwise.  The Co-
Executors’ fiduciary obligations to the Estate under Virgin Islands law – and, indeed, common 
sense – do not permit them to allow such limitless exposure. 
As another example of Mr. Edwards’ and Ms. Henderson’s mischaracterizations, while the Co-
Executors readily accepted the suggestion of University of Pennsylvania law professor Marci 
Hamilton as a consulting resource for the Program Administrator on issues of child sexual 
abuse, they could not in the proper discharge of their fiduciary duties accede to Attorney 
General George’s insistence that Ms. Hamilton occupy a co-equal role with Ms. Feldman as Co-
Program Administrator.  Ms. Hamilton has no experience administering mass tort compensation 
programs and has repeatedly publicly inveighed against those associated in any way with Mr.

Epstein.1  She is a zealous advocate, and not a neutral fact-finder to whom the Co-Executors 
could properly defer decision-making authority in distributing Estate funds to resolve claims 
against the Estate.   
Finally, there is no need for the relief that Mr. Edwards and Ms. Henderson now request – i.e., 
this Court’s intervention in the Co-Executors’ ongoing efforts in the Virgin Islands to establish 
the Program over Attorney General George’s repeated efforts to eviscerate it.  The Co-
Executors have sought the approval of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands to establish the 
Program, and are awaiting a ruling from the Honorable Carolyn Hermon-Percell so that they can 
finally move forward with the Program as originally presented to that court in November 2019 
and approved by Mr. Edwards and multiple other plaintiffs’ counsel.  (We attach a copy of the 
Co-Executors’ two most recent filings on that subject with the USVI court, dated March 24 and 
April 10, 2020.)  We will of course keep Your Honor informed of the outcome of that application. 
Respectfully submitted,

Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants in the above-referenced actions.  We write on behalf of all parties to 
update the Court regarding settlement and discovery.   
As the Court is aware, there have been no settlement discussions in any of the individual 
above-referenced cases.  The parties’ efforts regarding settlement have been singularly focused 
on the establishment of a voluntary, independent claims resolution program, the Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program.  We are pleased to report that, this past weekend, the Co-
Executors entered into a tripartite agreement with claimants’ counsel (specifically, counsel for 
Plaintiffs in the above-referenced actions, Brad Edwards, and counsel for plaintiffs in four other 
actions pending before Your Honor, David Boies) and the Attorney General of the United States 
Virgin Islands pursuant to which the Program may now move forward.  Earlier today, the Co-
Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands the 
status report attached hereto as Exhibit A.  As stated therein, the Co-Executors, with the 
support of claimants’ counsel and the USVI Attorney General, intend to authorize 
commencement of the Program on Monday, June 15, 2020. Most, if not all, of the Plaintiffs in 
the above-referenced actions intend to participate in the Program. 
Meanwhile, the parties continue to meet and confer in efforts to resolve various discovery 
disputes.   
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

CO-EXECUTORS' STATUS REPORT ON VO LUNT ARY COMPENSATION 
PROGRAM AND PRESENTATION OF PROGRAM PROTOCOL 
On November 14, 2019, the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Co-
Executors") filed their Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution 
Program (the "Expedited Motion") seeking to establish an independent and voluntary claims 
resolution program (the .. Program") for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey 
E. Epstein, deceased. As promised in the Expedited Motion, the Co-Executors now submit to the 
Court the detailed Program protocol (the "Protocol," copy attached as Exhibit A hereto) designed 
and developed over several months by independent, nationally recognized claims administration 
experts with extensive input from the Co-Executors and other interested parties, including 
claimants and their legal representatives. Because the need for the Program has grown increasingly 
urgent and with the support of claimants' counsel and the Attorney General of the United States 
Virgin Islands, the Co-Executors intend to authorize commencement on Monday, June 15, 2020 
of formal claims resolution proceedings under the Program, absent contrary direction from the 
Court.

BACKGROUND 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 2 
As detailed in the Expedited Motion and the Co-Executors' subsequent filings with the 
Court, the Program will provide all eligible claimants an opportunity to receive compensation and 
voluntarily resolve their claims of sexual abuse against Mr. Epstein through a confidential, non-
adversarial alternative to litigation, utilizing a process that is sensitive to the experiences and 
concern of claimants and treats them with compassion, dignity and respect. 1 
On February 4, 2020, the Court heard extensive witness testimony concerning the Program 
(February 4, 2020 Hearing Tr. at I 03: 12-186: 14); at that hearing, multiple claimants' counsel also 
spoke in favor of implementing the Program. (Id. 84: 11-85:2; 85:6-19; 92:24-93:8.) As Your 
Honor recognized, the Program is not only consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Co-
Executors, but in fact " ... we agreed that everybody believes this program is a great program ... " 
(Id. at 113:24-25.) That drumbeat of approval continues to swell; since the Co-Executors' most 
recent filing with the Court concerning the Program,2 counsel for 69 individual claimants have 
come forward to the Court in support of the Program.3

Co-Executors' Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program 
and Presentation of Program Protocol 
II. 
THE PROGRAM PROTOCOL 
The Program Administrator and Designers have now finalized the Protocol for the 
Program, in close consultation with claimants' counsel and the Co-Executors.4 As contemplated 
in the Expedited Motion, the Protocol sets forth the following non-exclusive guiding principles: 
• 
The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a claimant may 
have unless and until she accepts the offered compensation and executes a 
release. 
A claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop 
participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to 
execution of the release. 
• 
The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled, or 
overseen by the Co-Executors. The Program Administrator is responsible for 
all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual 
claims submitted to the Program. The Administrator will have final, binding, 
and exclusive authority to determine claimant eligibility and the valuation of 
each eligible individual claim. Decisions of the Administrator made pursuant 
to the Protocol are not subject to review or modification in any way by the Co-
Executors or any other party or entity. 
• 
Subject to total Estate assets available, there is no cap or limitation on the 
aggregate amount of funds available to compensate all eligible claimants or on 
the amount of compensation to be made to each individual claimant. Each 
individual claim will be evaluated separately by the Program Administrator. 
The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive discretion, issues 
of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will pay all eligible 
claims based on the Administrator's determination. 
• 
All claimants will be treated with respect, dignity, and fairness without regard 
to race, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender, or disability. 
To ensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Program Administrator will 
manage the process so that all claimants can equally access the Program's claim 
process. 
Individuals with disabilities will be given the opportunity to 
effectively communicate their claims and to request special process 
accommodations. 
(See Protocol at pp. 1-2.) 
4. The Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin Islands also expressed her detailed views on the structure and formation 
of the Program, both through filings with the Court and direct communications with the Program Administrator.

Co-Executors' Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program 
and Presentation of Program Protocol 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page4 
The Protocol also sets forth detailed aspects of the Program's administration, including 
eligibility criteria for the Program, proof requirements and claims procedures, the methodology 
for claims evaluation and determining compensatory awards, and timing and regular reports to the 
Court, as follows: 
• 
Eligibility. The Protocol identifies the criteria to determine whether a claimant 
is eligible to receive compensation under the Program. (See Protocol at pp. 3-
4.) 
• 
Proof Requirements and Claims Procedures. The Protocol determines what 
types of supporting documentation or other evidence each individual will be 
required to submit to substantiate her claim, satisfy Program requirements, and 
allow the Program Administrator to review, process and evaluate that claim. 
(See Protocol at pp. 4-5.) 
• 
Claims Evaluation and Determination Methodology. The Protocol defines 
the factors and considerations to be used to determine the amount of 
compensation to be offered to any eligible claimant. (See Protocol at pp. 5-6.) 
• 
Timing. The Protocol sets forth the timeframe of the Program, including an 
effective commencement date and deadline for submission of all claims. (See 
Protocol at pp. 4-5.) 
• 
Reporting. The Protocol reflects the Program Administrator's commitment to 
provide the Court with regular monthly reports regarding the aggregate number 
and total value of claims paid each month through the Program. (See Protocol 
at p. 9.) 
III. 
URGENT NEED TO COMMENCE OF PROGRAM OPERA TIO NS 
In their fiduciary capacity, the Co-Executors engaged in extensive discussions with 
relevant parties in interest regarding the independent, fair, and timely resolution of the sexual abuse 
claims against Mr. Epstein. As noted above, many existing and potential claimants have expressed 
through their representatives their preference to participate in the Program rather than proceeding 
with litigation. Although there will be significant expense in administering the Program, the Co-
Executors contemplate that the Program will substantially reduce the expenses to the Estate of 
litigating multiple lawsuits in numerous jurisdictions, and thus ultimately reduce expenses to the 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 30     Filed 06/01/20     Page 8 of 20

Page5 
benefit of all parties with an interest in the Estate, including claimants and creditors. 5 The 
expedited nature of the Program will also ensure resolution and compensation to claimants in a far 
more timely manner than through litigation. 
As described above, the Protocol is designed to ensure the proportionate restitution of 
approved claims for all claimants, in a manner that will provide similar compensation to similarly 
situated claimants. The Program is in the best interests of both claimants and the Estate because, 
among other things, it avoids the potential of disproportionate and inconsistent awards and should 
help to reduce the time, exposure and burden of handling claims through the courts, which could 
involve years of litigation and appeals and consume enormous resources, along with inflicting on 
all affected parties costs attendant to delay and uncertainty. 
IV. 
FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM 
As the Court is aware, the Attorney General on January 31, 2020 unilaterally imposed 
criminal activity liens on the Estate's bank account in the Virgin Islands, freezing then-available 
funds - funds over which this Court has exclusive jurisdiction - for administration of the Estate 
and implementation of the Program.6 On February 24, 2020, the Attorney General imposed similar 
liens against Southern Trust Company, Inc., one of the entities within the Estate. The Co-
Executors have challenged the validity of the Attorney General's liens, and moved the Superior 
5. 
In the absence of the Program, litigation alleging sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein has increased in scope, pace and 
expense: there are now 22 separate lawsuits brought by 34 individual claimants pending against the Co-
Executors, primarily in the state and federal courts of New York. Discovery proceedings in those actions -
including document demands, interrogatories, non-party subpoenas, and motions to compel -
continue to ratchet 
up each passing week. 
6. 
Following the Co-Executors' resulting emergency motion for release of funds necessary for administration of the 
Estate, the Court directed the Attorney General to lift her liens in amounts sufficient to allow the Co-Executors 
to pay the Estate's operational expenses and legal fees.

Court to vacate them in their entirety.7 However, pending detennination of that motion - as well 
as this Court's approval of the estimated budget for and expenses of designing, implementing and 
administering the Program, submitted by the Co-Executors on February 4, 2020 - the Co-
Executors and the Attorney General have reached consensual resolution in which the latter will 
promptly lift those liens to pay amounts owed for the Program and to begin funding of the 
Program's active operations, including payment of compensation determinations to eligible 
claimants. 8 
*

Because the need for the Program has grown increasingly urgent, and with the support of 
claimants' counsel and the USVI Attorney General - and because the remaining impediments have 
been resolved and the interested parties have consented to the Protocol attached as Exhibit A hereto 
-the Co-Executors intend to move forward with the Program on Monday, June 15, 2020, absent 
contrary direction from the Court.9

7. See Expedited Motion to Vacate Liens, dated March 17, 2020 (Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands vs. Jndyke, 
et al., Case No. ST•20-CV-14). The Attorney General filed no response to that expedited motion. 
8. 
As part of that resolution, the Co-Executors agreed not to assert that the Attorney General's release of such limited 
funds will act as a waiver of Government's ability, if any, to object to the Program's administrative expenses, 
including those paid with these initial funds. 
9. 
The Co-Executors recognize the extraordinary difficulties imposed by the coronavirus pandemic on the 
functioning of the courts of the Virgin Islands. To the extent the Court wishes to conduct a remote conference in 
this matter, either telephonically or via videolink, the Co-Executors and their counsel will of course make 
themselves available.

Independent 
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
PROTOCOL 
May 29, 2020 
I. 
PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW 
The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the "Program") is a voluntary, independent Program that 
has been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by 
Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). 
The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the "Estate") has retained the services of nationally recognized claims 
administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the 
Program. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the "Administrator"). This 
Protocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and 
representatives of the Estate. 
Through the Program, the Estate wishes to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and 
offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse. 
The Program is governed by the following non-exclusive guiding principles: 
• 
The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have 
unless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a 
Release. 
A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop 
participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution 
of the Release. 
• 
The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or 
overseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to 
the review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submitted to the 
Program. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to 
determine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim. 
Decisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to 
review or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity. 
• 
There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to 
compensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to 
each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the 
Administrator. 
The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive 
discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will 
pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination. 
ll Page 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 30     Filed 06/01/20     Page 13 of 20
• 
All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to 
race, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To 
ensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process 
so that all Claimants can equally access the Program's claim process. Individuals 
with disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their 
claims and to request special process accommodations. 
The Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were 
harmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they 
have previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate. 
The exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-
determined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date ("Filing Deadline"). All 
individual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period. 
To complement the Program's resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent 
of the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert, 
leading legal academic and advocate of victims' rights. Ms. Hamilton's role will be to further inform the 
Administrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse, 
and the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or 
updating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in 
interactions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-
determination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. 
The 
Administrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant's prior written consent, request that Ms. 
Hamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in 
her discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants' files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton. 
As set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration 
of the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims 
submitted to the Program. 
During the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her 
representatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton 
will maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains 
through her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants' submissions.

II. 
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 
A. Eligibility Criteria 
The persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused 
by Epstein. In addition, the following criteria apply: 
• 
The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein. 
• 
An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may 
participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met. 
• 
An individual who previously entered into a settlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual 
abuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are 
met. 
• 
An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may 
participate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual 
acted under duress as a result of her own sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other 
eligibility criteria are met. 
• 
If the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with 
prejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities 
and/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or 
prior to the signed acceptance of the compensation determination offer letter and executed 
Release in order to receive payment. 
B. Legal Representatives of Claimants 
An individual may file a claim on a victim's behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority 
to act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The "Legal Representative" of an 
individual Claimant shall mean: (1) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal 
guardian authorized by law to serve as the minor's legal representative; (2) in the case of an 
incompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant's 
legal representative in accordance with applicable law; {3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person 
who has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant's estate by a court of 
competent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an attorney authorized to 
represent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program. 
Legal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such 
proof may include a power of attorney; documentation showing the individual's appointment as 
guardian or guardian ad litem; documentation showing the individual's appointment as personal 
representative of the Claimant's estate (such as letters of administration); a copy of a retainer 
3I Page 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 30     Filed 06/01/20     Page 15 of 20
agreement showing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the attorney or a signed 
statement by an adult Claimant and the attorney that a licensed/admitted attorney is acting on her 
behalf. 
Ill. 
CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION - SUBMISSION, EVALUATION ANO DETERMINATION 
A. Claims Submission Process 
Individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have 
otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before the 
Effective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including Instructions 
for completion and submission of the Claim Form and a copy of this Protocol. Individuals who have filed 
a lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to 
be eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain 
free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals 
must, however, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at 
the time of acceptance of a compensation determination offer in order to receive payment. 
Individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have 
not otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before 
the Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program's website at 
www.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire setting forth their 
name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested 
information. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the 
individual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is 
eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant 
Program information. 
Note: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates 
that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It 
does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive 
compensation. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has 
been submitted and evaluated by the Administrator. 
Registrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the 
Estate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their attorney to the 
Administrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective 
Date through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline ("Registration Deadline"). It is important 
to note that the Registration Deadline is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained 
above, all claims must be filed by the Filing Deadline. 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 30     Filed 06/01/20     Page 16 of 20
All Claim Forms must be completed to the best of a Claimant's ability and filed no later than the Filing 
Deadline. Claim Forms should be uploaded to the Program website at www.EpsteinVCP.com. or mailed 
via overnight courier (a pre-paid courier voucher will be included with each packet) to the Administrator 
at the following address: 
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
Attn: Jordana H. Feldman, Administrator 
P.O. Box 65488 
Washington, D.C. 20035 
Claimants are invited to provide documentation identified in the Claim Form, and any other 
corroborating or supporting information sufficient to substantiate the claim, satisfy eligibility 
requirements, and allow the Administrator to review, process and evaluate the claim. If the claim is 
being presented by a Legal Representative, then the Legal Representative will be responsible for 
submitting the necessary documentation relating to the represented Claimant. 
Additional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Administrator. Both the Claimant 
and the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed 
relevant to the Administrator's evaluation and determination of the claim before the Administrator's 
final disposition of the claim. 
If a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant, 
explain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant's legal 
Representative (where applicable) to assist in submitting a complete claim. 
B. Claims Evaluation and Determination 
Claims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each 
submitted individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all 
required documentation has been submitted to the Administrator, with due consideration granted to 
Claimant's good faith explanations for delays and/or absence of documentation. 
1. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims 
As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
information available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will 
consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to: 
• 
The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the 
nature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the 
age of the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include 
(i) medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the abuse, and 
(ii) contemporaneous written notification or other correspondence (e.g., letters, emails) of the 
abuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others. 
The 
Administrator acknowledges that some Claimants may not be able to provide any 
SI Page 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 30     Filed 06/01/20     Page 17 of 20
documentation to corroborate their Claim based on the nature and circumstances of Epstein's 
conduct. If a Claimant's written and oral presentation is deemed to be credible by the 
Administrator, the Claimant may still be eligible for compensation under the Program. 
• 
Whether there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the appropriate 
Office of the District Attorney, United States Attorney's Office, or other law enforcement 
agency. 
• 
Whether the Administrator finds the claims of the individual to be credible after complete 
review of all relevant documentation and other evidence provided by the Claimant and the 
Estate. 
As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
information available, the amount of compensation that should be offered to each eligible Claimant. 
The Administrator will consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited 
to: 
• 
The nature, duration and extent of the sexual abuse suffered by the Claimant. 
• 
The age of the Claimant at the time of the sexual abuse. 
• 
The nature and extent of the Claimant's physical or psychological damage resulting from the 
sexual abuse, and the effect of the sexual abuse on the Claimant. 
• 
The credibility of the claim based upon all of the facts and circumstances, supporting 
documentation and corroborating evidence. 
• 
Whether the Claimant previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and 
received a payment pursuant to such agreement. 
The Administrator will confidentially send the Claimant a compensation determination offer letter 
including the following: (1) the Administrator's eligibility decision regarding the claim; (2) the amount of 
compensation offered; (3) a Release to be signed by the Claimant if the Claimant accepts the offered 
compensation; and (4) a Payment Option Form. The Administrator's offer shall be valid for 60 days from 
the date of the compensation determination offer letter. 
The Administrator's determinations in this Program will not be binding on any potential criminal 
investigation involving Claimant's claims. 
2. Opportunities to be Heard 
The Claimant will be afforded an opportunity to be heard, either before or after the Administrator 
renders her determination. Upon request by the Claimant, the Administrator will be available to meet in 
person (as practicable in light of the COVI0-19 pandemic), by video conference, or by teleconference to 
further discuss the claim. These meetings are completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet 
GI Page 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 30     Filed 06/01/20     Page 18 of 20
with the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com and will be 
scheduled at a mutually convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting 
with a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location, 
though the Claimant is not obligated to attend any such meeting. 
3. Release 
By submitting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations 
of sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the 
Release. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the 
Claimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all 
past and future claims (including /is pendens, writs of attachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of 
sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the 
offer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time 
prior to the execution of the Release. 
The Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries 
may have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related 
entities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to 
participate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. However, 
the Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant's ability to report and discuss 
allegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. 
In other words, the 
Release will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permitted to 
discuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose. 
Before signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an attorney selected by the Claimant. If the 
Claimant is not represented by an attorney, the Program will provide an attorney to provide free legal 
counseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and 
binding nature of the Release. 
No one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under 
the Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding 
tax liability for payments pursuant to the Program. 
4. Payments 
Upon the Claimant's acceptance of the Administrator's determination, the Administrator's receipt of 
the Claimant's executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing 
lawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the 
Administrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as 
directed by the Claimant. 
Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service. 
All 
payments made under the Program shall be for a Claimant's physical injuries, physical sickness and 
Page 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 30     Filed 06/01/20     Page 19 of 20
resulting emotional distress within the meaning of Section 104(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
C. Program Integrity 
For the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible 
Claimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent 
claims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies, 
irregularities or duplication. 
Each Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information 
provided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant's knowledge, and that the 
Claimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may 
result in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be 
potentially fraudulent or to contain information known by the Claimant to be false when made will be 
forwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the 
District Attorney and/or United States Attorney's Office for possible investigation and prosecution. 
D. Confidentiality/Privacy 
The Program is confidential. 1 By filing a claim with the Program, the Claimant or her Legal 
Representative (where applicable) agrees that information submitted by the Claimant pursuant to 
the Program will be used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her designees only for the 
following purposes: 
I) Processing and evaluating the Claimant's claim; 
2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and 
3) Reports to law enforcement where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent claims. 
When documents or other information maintained or submitted by the Estate become part of a 
Claimant's file for purposes of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to 
assist in processing and evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain confidential. No information 
provided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant's name and the date(s) 
and location{s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and, 
for purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant 
alleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained 
solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any 
claim, regardless of forum. The Program's files are not available for inspection, review or copying by 
the Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent 
mediation privileges, settlement privileges and other privileges apply. 
All parties agree that they are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a resolution of individual claims 
of sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, settlement and all other pertinent 
privileges), and protection from disclosure under applicable law. 
SI Page 

Case 1:19-cv-11869-MKV-DCF     Document 30     Filed 06/01/20     Page 20 of 20
To protect the privacy of Claimants participating in the Program, all personal information provided by 
the Claimant during this process will be returned or destroyed within one year after the conclusion of 
the Program. 
Individual Claimants are not bound through the Program by any rules of confidentiality. Claimants may, 
at their sole and voluntary option, disclose information in their possession regarding their claim, their 
compensation and their experience with the Program. 
All confidentiality requirements are subject to law, regulation and judicial process. 
E. Reporting 
The Administrator shall, on a monthly basis, confidentially provide reports regarding the number and 
total value of claims paid each month to the Probate Court of the United States Virgin Islands and the 
Attorney General of the United States Virgin Islands. Such reports will report on an aggregate level 
only. No individual Claimant information will be published or disclosed in a way that compromises 
Claimant confidentiality.

COURT CLERK 
1At the hearing held on February 4, 2020, while the Court did not allow the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands to intervene, the Court did request the Co-Executors and the Attorney General to resolve their differences 
concerning the proposed compensation program. which has garnered the support of all interested parties, including 
claimants' counsel. The Co-Executors now inform that "(b]ecause the need for the Program has grown increasingly 
urgent, and with the support of claimants' counsel and the USVI Attorney General - and because the remaining
