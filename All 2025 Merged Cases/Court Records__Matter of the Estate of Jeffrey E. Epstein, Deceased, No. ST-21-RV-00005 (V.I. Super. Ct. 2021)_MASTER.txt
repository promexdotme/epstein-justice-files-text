GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS' 
NOTICE OF APPEAL & PETITION FOR REVIEW 
OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDERS 
The Government of the United States Virgin Islands ("Government") hereby petitions 
pursuant to V.I. Super. Ct. R. 322(b)(l) and/or 322. l(b) for review of the Magistrate Judge's 
February 26, 2021 orders (published March 1, 2021 )1 in In Re: The Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
No. ST-2019-PB-00080, which: (1) Denied the Government's Motion to Intervene in the Probate 
action as a claimant against the Estate ( order attached as Exhibit I); and (2) Struck the 
Government's Emergency Motion to Freeze All Estate Assets and Cash on Hand (order attached 
as Exhibit 2). In support thereof, the Government states as follows: 
BACKGROUND & LEGAL ARGUMENT 
Jeffrey Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019, while in custody in New York for sex 
crimes. Comp!., Gov 't U.S. Virgin Islands v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein, et al., No. ST-2020-CV-14, 
Jr 7 (V.I. Super Ct. Jan. 15, 2020). On August 15, 2019, the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein ("the Estate") 
was created. Id. ,i 8. 
Although the orders are dated February 26, 2021, the Government did not learn of them until it 
received a press inquiry on March 12, 2021 . The Government contacted the Clerk of the Court, 
who confirmed that it appears that the Government had not been electronically served with the 
orders. The Clerk of the Court then served the Government with notice of the orders on March 17, 
2021. Therefore, the time to appeal under Rule 322(b )(1) and/or Rule 322.1 (b )(2)(A) should be 
calculated from March 17, 2021, making the Government's Petition timely. 

In the Matter of the Estate of: Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Gov't's Notice of Appeal & Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders 
Page 2 of 4 
On November 14, 2019, the Executors of the Estate filed an Expedited Motion for 
Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program ("Epstein Fund" or "Fund"). The 
Motion asked the Magistrate Judge to "establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution 
program ... for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein[.]" Id. at 1. 
On January 15, 2020, the Government filed a lawsuit against the Estate, the 1953 Trust, 
and numerous Epstein business affiliates and associates for violation of the Criminally Influenced 
and Corrupt Organization Act ("CICO"), 14 V.I.C. § 600 et seq., and civil conspiracy, seeking 
forfeiture and divestment of assets in favor of the Government, civil penalties, damages, and other 
remedies.2 
The Probate Court's ruling not only fails to recognize the Government's interest, which 
supports mandatory or permissive intervention, but also ignores the complexity of this proceeding 
and its significance to Epstein's victims and to the people of the Virgin Islands more broadly. As 
Plaintiff in its CICO litigation, the Government has an interest in the assets of the Estate, as well 
as in ensuring that the laws of the Virgin Islands are enforced for the benefit of the Government, 
the People of the Virgin Islands, and the victims of Epstein's crimes. The Executors of the Estate, 
who are alleged to have been affiliated with various entities that participated in Epstein's criminal 
enterprise, cannot adequately stand in for the Government. Therefore, the Government should be 
allowed to intervene. In re the Estate of Small, 57 V.I. 416,423 (2012); Hendricks v. Clyne, No. 
ST-16-CV-147, 2019 WL 918607, at *2 (V.l. Super. Ct. Feb. 20, 2019); V.I. R. Civ. P. 24. 
The Government filed its operative First Amended Complaint in its CICO action on February 
10, 2020 and its Second Amended Complaint on February 20, 2021.

Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Gov't's Notice of Appeal & Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders 
Page 3 of 4 
Finally, with or without intervention, the Probate Court had jurisdiction to decide the 
Government's Emergency Motion. It should be noted that the Presiding Judge in its March 12, 
2021 Order in the CICO action (Exhibit 3) recognized the overlapping issues in the CICO and 
Probate matters. As a result, the Court has asked the parties to brief whether this case should be 
designated as complex and transferred to the same Superior Court Judge assigned to the CICO 
matter so the Probate and CICO matters can be "coordinated together" to avoid "inconsistent 
rulings." 
ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW 
1. Whether the Magistrate Judge properly denied the Government's Motion to Intervene 
as a claimant against the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
2. Whether the Magistrate Judge properly denied the Government's Emergency Motion 
to Freeze All Estate Assets and Cash on Hand based on lack of standing because the 
Government is not a party to and was denied intervention in the Probate action, even 
though it has a claim against the Estate.

Notwithstanding the Court's denial of said Motion at the February 4, 2020 hearing, the Government continued to file 
pleadings with the Court concerning its requested intervention. The Court considers the pleadings filed subsequent to the 
February 4, 2020 hearing to be advisory or informational in nature. Therefore, the Court will take no action upon said 
pleadings. The Court notes that at said hearing, it requested that the Co-Executors and the Government resolve their 
differences concerning the Voluntary Claims Resolution Program.

4, 2021, by the Government of the United States Virgin Islands (hereinafter the "Government"), 
by and through Carol Thomas-Jacobs, Esq., Chief Deputy Attorney General, wherein, the 
Government moves to freeze the assets of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein based upon its 
contention that the Estate has breached its commitment to fund the Epstein Victims'

Order 
Page2of3 
On February 4, 2020, the Court held a hearing on various motions in this case, including 
the Government's Motion to Intervene filed on January 23, 2020. The Motion to Intervene was 
argued before the Court on February 4, 2020, on which date the Government was represented 
by Attorneys Ariel Smith and Pamela Tepper. After considering arguments from Counsel on 
even date, the Court orally denied the Motion to Intervene without prejudice.2 Therefore, 
because the Government is not a party to this action and is not permitted to intervene, the 
Government does not have standing to move the Court to freeze the Estate's assets and all its 
cash on hand. As such, the Court need not address the Government's arguments arising 
thereunder. 
For these reasons, the Court will use its inherent authority to strike the Emergency 
Motion and all responses thereto from the record.3 Accordingly, it is hereby 
ORDERED that the: (1) Emergency Motion to Immediately Freeze All Estate Assets 
and Cash on Hand filed by the Government of the United States Virgin Islands, by and through 
Carol Thomas-Jacobs, Esq., Chief Deputy Attorney General, on February 4, 2021; (2) Joinder

Estate Assets and Cash on Hand filed by Sean Foster, Esq., on February 5, 2021; (4) Notice of

THIS MATTER was referred to the Complex Litigation Division to determine whether to 
designate this case as complex pursuant to Rule 92 of the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure. The 
co-executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein filed a motion on February I, 2021 for complex treatment 
and the Court (Tejo, J.) granted the motion and referred this matter for a determination. In order to avoid 
delay, and to ensure that all issues relevant to the determination are addressed, the Court will set a briefing 
schedule for the parties to follow. The Court acknowledges that, in their February I, 2021 motion, the Co-
Executors reference the related probate matter, In re: Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Case No. ST-20 l 9-PB-
00080. The Court will also direct the parties to address whether the probate matter should be designated 
complex so that both matters can be coordinated together in the event that the Court, in its administrative

litigation involving the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein should be treated as complex. 
Accordingly, it is hereby

SERVE and FILE a supplemental brief within seven (7) days from the date of entry of this Order, to 
address, if not already addressed in their February 1, 2021 motion, whether In re: Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein, Case No. ST-20 l 9-PB-00080, should be designated as complex, or reassigned to the same judge 
to avoid delay and inconsistent rulings, c,f V.l. R. Civ. P. 92(g); and (2) to identify whether, in their 
capacity as executors, any other civil actions or proceedings are currently pending in the Superior Court 
of the Virgin Islands that also should be reassigned to the same judge to avoid delay, c,f In re Procedure 
for the Assignment & Reassignment of Related Cases & Proceedings, Case No. SX-2020-MC-00087,

ORDERED that all parties to this case, except the Co-Executors, and any pat1ies to the probate 
matter, except the Co-Executors, MAY SERVE and FILE a response in writing no later than fifteen (15) 
days after the supplemental response requested above is filed to respond to the February 1, 2021 motion,

further 
ORDERED that the Co-Executors MAY SERVE and FILE a consolidated reply to any and all 
arguments raised in opposition to their motion, as supplemented, within seven (7) calendar days after 
the last response is filed. It is further 
ORDERED that no extensions of time will be granted as the time for filing an opposition has

CO-EXECUTORS' RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
VIRGIN ISLANDS' NOTICE OF APPEAL & PETITION FOR REVIEW OF 
MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDERS 
Pursuant to V.I. Super. Ct. R. 322(b)(5), the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein, DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. ~HN, hereby respond to the Government 
of the United States Virgin Islands' ("Government") Notice of Appeal & Petition for Review of 
Magistrate Judge's Orders, filed March 17, 2021 ("Petition"). 1 
CO-EXECUTORS' POSITION STATEMENT 
The Government's Petition is too little, too late. Judge Hermon-Percell properly denied 
the Government's Motion to Intervene in these probate proceedings over thirteen (13) months ago, 
a fact that the Government inexplicably fails to tell the Court in its Petition. The Government also 
neglects to inform the Court that the factual basis for its Emergency Motion to Freeze All Estate 
Assets and Cash on Hand (the "Emergency Motion") is no longer accurate. That motion is thus 
moot. 
1. The Government Lost its Motion to Intervene Over Thirteen (13) Months Ago. 
The Government filed its Motion to Intervene on January 23, 2020, relying on V.I. Civ. P. 
Rule 24. As explained in the Co-Executors' January 31, 2020 opposition to that Motion, Rule 24 
While the Government cites V.I. Supr. Ct. R. 322.1 (b) in support of its Petition, that Rule has been repealed. 

'' Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Response to Notice of Appeal 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 2 of5 
is inapplicable to these probate proceedings, which are instead governed by Title 15 of the Virgin 
Islands Code and the Virgin Islands Rules for Probate and Fiduciary Proceedings. 2 On February 
4, 2020, the Magistrate Judge expressly denied the Motion to Intervene from the bench: 
THE COURT: "[B]efore me I have a motion from the People, the Government to 
intervene as a claimant intervenor in the matter and I'm going to deny that -
the 
Motion to Intervene. You're here as a claimant. And I'm assuming that you will 
file your formal creditors claim." 
(Official Transcript of Proceedings at 98:8-14, attached as Exhibit B) (emphasis supplied). 
There was no unce1tainty about the Magistrate Judge's February 4, 2020 ruling, and no 
excuse for the Government to delay any appeal from it. Rather, the Government elected not to do 
so. It strains credulity to now believe that the Government was unaware of that rnling and had to 
await the Magistrate Judge's Order dated February 26, 2021 to realize that the Court denied its 
Motion to Intervene more than one (1) year earlier. 3 
Even if the Comt ignored the Government's extraordinary delay in filing its Petition, its 
application lacks merit. As the Magistrate Judge noted on February 4, 2020, the Government -
a civil litigant against the Estate in the CICO lawsuit entitled Gov 't US Virgin Islands v. Estate 
ofJeffrey Epstein, et al., No. ST-2020-CV-144 -
is in no different position than those asserting 
claims against the Estate. The Magistrate Judge explained that situation to the Government: 
"ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ARIEL SMITH: 
I just have one 
procedural question, Your Honor. 
To the extent that you've denied the 
Government's Motion to Intervene, how would we file any response to -
cause 
2.

we decided to file the Motion To Intervene in order to be able to file the opposition5 
which has not been formally filed. It was just filed as an attachment. 
THE COURT: You come in as claimant, right, so you would be presented before 
the Court." 
Exh. B (February 4, 2020 Hrg. Tr.) at 100: 8-19 ( emphasis supplied). Despite Judge Hermon-
Percell 's direction, the Government never filed a claim in these probate proceedings. 6 As the 
Magistrate Judge made clear, filing a claim is a prerequisite to pursuing relief in a probate 
proceeding. 
For the reasons detailed by the Co-Executors in their opposition to the Motion to Intervene, 
the Government is required in these probate proceedings to proceed pursuant to the Probate 
Division's rules, just as any other claimant would. 
2. The Government's Emergency Motion is Moot. 
The Government filed its Emergency Motion on February 3, 2021 based on its contention 
that the Estate had breached its commitment to fund the EVCP. However, the EVCP is once again 
fully funded and has been operating as it had since its implementation. 7 The Government's 
application is therefore moot. 
ADDITIONAL ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW 
1. Whether the Government's more-than-thirteen (13) months' delay in appealing from the 
Magistrate Judge's denial of its Motion to Intervene renders its Petition untimely. 
5. 
See Government's Opposition to Estate's Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, 
filed January 20, 2020, in which the Government -
alone among all others appearing in these probate 
proceedings -
opposed the Co-Executors' effort to establish the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
("EVCP"), a widely-heralded alternative dispute resolution process to compensate those claiming sexual abuse 
by Mr. Epstein. The Magistrate Judge ultimately approved the EVCP by Order dated June 2, 2020. 
The Government's assertions that it acts "as a claimant" and "has a claim against the Estate" (Petition at 3) are 
belied by its refusal to file such a claim.

Compensation Offers"), attached as Exhibit C.

2. Whether the Government's failure to file a claim in these probate proceedings provides an 
additional ground for the Magistrate Judge's ruling that the Government lacked standing

ACTION FOR TESTATE 
ADMINISTRATION 
Deceased. 
OPPOSITION TO 
GOVERNMENT'S MOTION TO INTERVENE (CORRECTED BRIEF)1 
COME NOW the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate"), 
DARREN K. INDYKE AND RICHARD D. KAHN, by and through KELLERHALS FERGUSON 
KROBLIN PLLC, and hereby oppose the Motion to Intervene filed by the Government of the Virgin 
Islands (the "GVI"). Because the GVI's Motion to Intervene is flawed both substantively and 
procedurally, the Court should deny that application. 
I. 
The Proposed Intervention Serves No Proper Purpose 
The GVI asserts that its intervention in this probate proceeding is, in part, required "to 
ensure that the administration of the Estate conforms to the laws of the Virgin Islands." (Motion 
to Intervene at 1.) That is nonsense: under Virgin Islands law, it is the Court's charge -
not the 
GVI's -
to oversee the proper administration of estates and ensure their compliance with Virgin 
Islands law. 
The Superior Court has original jurisdiction "to supervise and administer estates and 
fiduciary relations." 4 V.I.C. § 76(a). 
"[T]he Superior Court 'has jurisdiction and the power to administer justice 
in all matters relating to the affairs of decedents, ... to try and determine all 
questions, legal or equitable, arising between any or all of the parties to any 
This Corrected Brief in Opposition is filed in place of the Opposition to the Government's Motion to Intervene, 
filed in this Court on behalfofthe Co-Executors on Friday, January 31, 2020. 
Exhibit A

proceeding, ... as to any and all matters necessary to be determined in order 
to make a full, equitable, and complete disposition of the matter by such 
order or decree as justice requires.' 
V.I.C. § 161. 
The court is 
unrestricted in its power to dispose of such cases 'as justice requires' and is 
explicitly authorized to grant letters of administration, direct and control an 
executor or administrator's conduct, distribute assets, and order the sale of 
the deceased person's property. Id." 
Ottley v. Estate of Bell, 61 V.I. 480, 489-90 (V.I. 2014). The GVI offers no explanation for why 
it believes the Court is not up to that task. 
Nor does the GVI explain why it waited more than.five (5) months to seek to intervene in 
this proceeding, which the Co-Executors commenced on August 15, 2019. That the GVI decided 
two (2) weeks ago to commence civil claims and file criminal activity liens against the Estate is a 
self-created emergency: the GVI has long known that Mr. Epstein (and now the Estate) owns 
substantial real property in the Virgin Islands. 
The GVI also purports to find a "potential conflict of interest" in the Co-Executors' 
administration of the Estate, in particular in proposing to hire independent, nationally recognized 
claims administration experts to design and implement the proposed Epstein Victims' 
Compensation Program (the "Program"). (Motion to Intervene at 1.) 2 That purported conflict 
does not exist. "The mere existence of a possible adverse interest, without more, is not sufficient 
grounds for complaint in the Virgin Islands." In re Estate of Vose, 317 F.2d 281, 282, n.4 (3d Cir. 
1963) (internal citations omitted). Here, the Co-Executors do not have an interest adverse to the 
Estate which would prevent them from faithfully administering their fiduciary duties. Nor is there 
any allegation of neglect or dereliction of their fiduciary duties. Indeed, there is absolutely no 
evidence that the Co-Executors' manner and conduct in executing their office has run afoul of the 
2. The GVI's baseless attack on the Program is dealt with separately in the Estate's Reply to the GVI's Opposition 
to Estate's Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, filed Friday, January 31, 2020. 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein

standard of care required of an executor. There is, and can be, no allegation that the Co- Executors 
have been unfaithful to their trust. 
It cannot be a "conflict of interest" for the Co-Executors to have known Mr. Epstein during 
his lifetime -
if that were the case, no one could ever appoint a friend or trusted co11eague as 
executor of his or her estate. Nor can Messrs. Indyke's and Kahn's past and present involvement 
in "various Epstein business entities" constitute a disqualifying conflict of interest. (Motion to 
Intervene at 6.) That some of those entities "are alleged to share liability in [Mr.] Epstein's civil 
and criminal violations in the Virgin Islands and elsewhere" (id. at 6-7) is nothing more than an 
unsupported, unproven allegation -
none of those business entities have ever been criminally 
charged, and none have ever been found liable for Mr. Epstein's alleged conduct. 
II. 
The Virgin Islands Code and the Probate Rules Govern, Not Rule 24 
The GVI bottoms its purported right to intervene on Rule 24 of the Virgin Islands Rules of 
Civil Procedure ("Rule 24"). (Motion to Intervene at 1, 3, 4, 7.) That is a false bottom: it is the 
Virgin Islands Code and the Virgin Islands Rules for Probate and Fiduciary Proceedings (the 
"Probate Rules") that set forth the specific steps a purported claimant must take to bring a claim 
against an estate and participate in a probate proceeding. 
Rule 24 has no application to this 
proceeding. 
Tue exclusive procedure for pursuing a claim against an estate is set forth in Chapter 23 of 
Title 15 of the Virgin Islands Code and the Probate Rules, entitled "Claims and Charge Against 
the Estate." See 15 V.I.C §§ 391-430. The Probate Rules also include provisions governing a 
claimant's participation in a probate proceeding. To the extent the GVI has a claim against the 
Estate, it must follow these mandatory claims procedures to make that claim and participate in 
these proceedings. 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Opposition to Government's Motion to Intervene (Corrected Brief) 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page4 
The Virgin Islands Code and the Probate Rules also provide the only procedure for a 
creditor to present its claim against the Estate. Thus, a creditor must follow the process outlined 
in 15 V.I.C. § 606(b) in order to properly file a complaint against an estate. See Ottley, supra, 61 
VJ. at 493. The language of Section 606(b) is absolute: it forbids a creditor from commencing 
an action against an estate until it has first presented its claim to the executors, and they have 
considered and disallowed that claim. See Oat v. Sewer Enters., 46 V.I. 286, 290 (D.V.1. 2004). 
While all claimants, including the GVI, may file claims with the Estate, they are subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Court in this probate proceeding. See 15 V.l.C. §§ 391 and 392.3 
III. 
The GVI Failed to Follow the Applicable Claims Procedure 
Under Virgin Islands law, one who seeks to assert a claim against an estate must first 
present its claim to the appointed executor or administrator of that estate. See 15 V.l.C. § 391 
(requiring "[ e ]very executor or administrator" to publish in a local newspaper and to post a notice 
"requir[ing] all persons having claims against the estate to present them, with the proper vouchers, 
within six months from the date of the notice, to the executor or administrator, at a place within 
this territory therein specified."). The claimant must conform to the requirements set forth in Title 
15, including verification of its claim by affidavit of the claimant or someone with personal 
knowledge of the relevant facts. See 15 V.I.C. § 393 ("Every claim presented to the executor or 
administrator shall be verified by the affidavit of the claimant, or someone on his behalf who has 
personal knowledge of the facts, to the effect that the amount claimed is justly due; that no 
3. The GVI does not address how Rule 24 could apply to this probate matter, which is of course governed by the 
Probate Rules. See VJ. R. PROB. I (providing that "[t]hese Virgin Islands Rules for Probate and Fiduciary 
Proceedings shall apply in probate, guardianship, trust and other fiduciary proceedings."). While Rule 1 of the 
Probate Rules permits the Court to adapt the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure "as appropriate" when "no 
procedural provision is included [in the Probate Rules]," here there are express procedural provisions in the 
Probate Rules that govern claims and the participation of claimants in probate proceedings. 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Opposition to Government's Motion to Intervene (Corrected Brief) 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 5 
payments have been made thereon, except as stated; and that there is no just counterclaim to the 
same, to the knowledge of the affiant."). 
If and when such a claim is presented to an executor, the executor is then required to 
examine the claim, consider it, and then either accept or reject it. 15 V.I.C. § 394 ("When a claim 
is presented to the executor or administrator, as prescribed in section 393 of this title, if he is 
satisfied that the claim thus presented is just, he shall indorse upon it the words 'Examined and 
approved', with the date thereof, and sign the same officially, and shall pay such claim in due 
course of administration. If he is not so satisfied he shall indorse thereon the words 'Examined 
and rejected', with the date thereof, and sign the same officially."). 
Here, the GVI failed to follow the claims procedure required by Virgin Islands law to bring 
a claim against the Estate. Rather than present its claim to the Co-Executors and call on them to 
review and consider it, GVI instead filed a civil action seeking damages and other relief. That is 
improper. If the GVJ wishes to formally appear in these proceedings, it must (like any other 
creditor) follow the claims procedure set forth in 15 V.I.C. §§ 391-394: the GVI must present a 
verified claim, supported by documentation, to the Co-Executors. Pursuant to the statutory 
scheme, the Co-Executors are then required to assess the GVI's claim and either reject or accept 
it. Only then would the GVI have standing to participate in this probate proceeding like all other 
claimants. However, the Virgin Islands Legislature has mandated that an action may be 
commenced against an executor only after the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date 
letters testamentary are granted by this Court. Ottley, supra, 61 V.I. at 491 (quoting 15 V.I.C. § 
606(a)). These "mandatory" rules apply to all claimants, including the GVI. A claimant is not 
permitted to bypass the probate process enacted by the Legislature, which was designed precisely 
for this purpose -- to relieve the executors from defending the estate's rights in both a civil action

Opposition to Government's Motion to Intervene (Corrected Brief) 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 6 
and through probate proceedings simultaneously. See Ottley, supra, 61 V.1. at 494. This process 
also ensures that a claimant will not serve the executor with a summons, in an attempt to gain 
priority over estate assets to the detriment of other creditors who properly follow the probate 
process. 
IV. 
Even if Rule 24 Were Applicable - It is Not - the Contingent Nature of the 
GVl's Claim Requires the Court to Deny Intervention 
On January 15, 2020, the GVI filed a civil forfeiture action against the Estate in derogation 
of the applicable statutory requirements set forth in the Virgin Islands Code and Probate Rules. 
Even assuming the GVI's complaint had not been filed in contravention of these mandatory claims 
rules, the GVI would merely have a contingent claim -
i.e., one that is entirely dependent on its 
success in that separate action. "[C]ourts in this circuit that have been confronted with the issue 
have consistently held that intervention pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) is inappropriate where the 
proposed intervenor's interest is contingent upon prevailing on a tort claim in a separate action." 
Gen. Star Jndem. Co. v. Virgin Is. Port Auth, 224 F.R.D. 372, 375-376 (D.V.I. 2004) ("Proposed 
Intervenors cannot deny that any interest they have or may have in this matter is purely contingent 
upon a favorable judgment in their underlying suit .... The Court finds that such a contingent 
interest is insufficient to sustain intervention of right"). Here, even assuming for the sake of 
argument that Rule 24 is applicable, the Government's contingent interest in a possible favorable 
judgment in another suit is not an interest significant enough to authorize its intervention. 
V. 
Conclusion 
How and when a creditor may present a claim and participate in a probate proceeding is 
governed by Title 15 of the Virgin Islands Code and the Probate Rules. If the GVI has a claim 
against the Estate as alleged in its Motion to Intervene, it must follow the claims procedure set 
forth in 15 V.I.C. §§ 391-394 and the Probate Rules. The rule under which the GVI seeks to

Opposition to Government's Motion to Intervene (Corrected Brief) 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Page 7 
intervene in this proceeding, Rule 24 of the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure, does not apply 
to this probate proceeding. Because the GVI has not satisfied the requisites for its participation in 
this probate proceeding, the Court should deny the GVI's Motion to Intervene.

Epstein Victims' Compensation Program to 
Resume Issuance of Compensation Offers 
New York, NY - Today, the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the "Program") and its independent 
Administrator, Jordana ("Jordy") H. Feldman, announced that the Program will resume the issuance of 
compensation determination offers, effective immediately. 
On February 4, 2021, Ms. Feldman announced the temporary suspension of compensation determination 
offers due to uncertainty about the liquidity of Estate assets to fund the Program. This week, the Estate 
notified Ms. Feldman that it had completed the sales of Jeffrey Epstein's New York City and Palm Beach 
residences, and transfe1Ted approximately $10,000,000 to the Program to satisfy the outstanding amount of 
the last replenishment request. The Estate also provided assurances to Ms. Feldman, the Probate Court of 
the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Mr. Epstein's estate is being probated), and others that additional funds from 
the sales of these properties will be made available to the Program to satisfy future replenishment requests 
and pay eligible claims. With these developments, the Administrator has determined that there is sufficient 
ce1iainty that eligible claims can be timely and fully paid and has lifted the suspension. 
"I am pleased to report that the Program can now resume full operations after this unfortunate and 
unexpected month-long delay," said Ms. Feldman. "We have continued to process claims and hold 
meetings with claimants in anticipation of the resolution of the Estate's liquidity issue, and will begin 
issuing compensation offers immediately. I am eager to continue the imp01iant work of this Program, and 
remain deeply committed to ensuring that all eligible claimants receive the compensation and validation 
they deserve." 
To date, the Program has received over 175 claims, far exceeding expectations, and has paid out over $67 
million to eligible claimants. Although the deadline to register new claims has passed, those already found 
eligible to participate in the Program have through March 25, 2021 to file their claims. 
Launched on June 25, 2020, the Program is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution 
program that was established to provide fair and expeditious compensation to victims and resolve their 
sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Program was designed by 
nationally recognized independent claims administration experts Ms. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg and 
Camille S. Biros with input from victims' attorneys, the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein 
Estate and other interested parties. The Program operates independently of the Epstein Estate.

Dear Carol Thomas-Jacobs, Esq.: 
CASE NO: ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No: ST-2019-PB-00080 
The Superior Court received the Notice of Appeal in the above-captioned case, which was 
docketed in the Appellate Division on March 17, 2021. The appeal is assigned to the 
Honorable Debra S. Watlington and is assigned a new case number: ST-2021-RV-00005. As 
the person who filed this appeal, it is your responsibility to follow the rules and procedures that 
apply to the Appellate Division, including the following: 
The notice of appeal shall identify the party initiating the appeal, designate the decision or order 
appealed from, and contain a concise position statement of no more than 780 words in length 
( or three pages for self-represented patties) which sets faith the issues the patty wishes to 
present for appeal, together with a brief argument in suppo1t of the party's position. The notice 
must include a ce1tificate evidencing service on all other patties to the Magistrate Division 
proceeding. 
Response: 
Within fourteen (14) days of filing and service of the notice of appeal, any other party to the 
Magistrate Division proceeding may, but is not required, to file a response to the notice of 
appeal. The response may contain a concise position statement of no more than 780 words in

MEMORANDUM OPINION 
,rt 
Pending before the Court is a Notice of Appeal & Petition for Review filed by the Government of 
the Virgin Islands on March 17, 2021. The Appellant, the Government of the Virgin Islands (hereinafter 
"VI Government"), appeals two Magistrate Orders, both entered on February 26, 2021 , which (1) denied 
the Government's Motion to Intervene in the probate action as a claimant against the Estate (entered nunc 
pro tune to February 4, 2020) and (2) struck the Government's Emergency Motion to Freeze All Estate 
Assets and Cash on Hand. For the following reasons, the Magistrate's Orders will be affirmed. 
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
,r2 
On August l 0, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was found dead, while in custody in New York for sex crimes 
and on August 15, 2019, the probate of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein was created. To "establish an 
independent and voluntary claims resolution program ... for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims 
against Jeffrey E. Epstein," the Executors of the Estate filed an Expedited Motion for Establishment of a 
Voluntary Claims Resolution Program (hereinafter called the Epstein Fund). 
On January 15, 2020, the VI Government filed a lawsuit against the Epstein Estate, the 1953 Trust, 
and numerous Epstein business affiliates and associates for violation of the Criminally Influenced and 
Corrupt Organization Act (CICO) 1, and for civil conspiracy seeking forfeiture and divestment of assets in 
favor of the VI Government, civil penalties, damages, and other remedies. 2 
On January 23, 2020, the VI Government filed a Motion to Intervene in the probate matter pursuant 
to Rule 24 of the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure. Thereafter, on February 4, 2021, the VI 
Government filed an Emergency Motion to Immediately Freeze All Assets and Cash on Hand. The VI 
14 V. I.C. § 600 et seq. 
' See VI Government's Notice of Appeal. 

In the matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein 
ST-21-RV-05 
ST-19-PB-80 
Memorandum Opinion 
Page 2 
2022 VI Super 1 SU 
Government asserted that the Emergency Motion was necessary due to the Estate having breached its 
commitment to fund the Epstein Victims Compensation Program. 
,rs 
A hearing on the VI Government's motions was held February 4, 2020, after which the Court 
orally denied the Motion to Intervene without prejudice as well as the Emergency Motion to Immediately 
Freeze All Assets and Cash on Hand reasoning that because the Government is not a party to this action 
and is not permitted to intervene, the Government does not have standing to move the Court to freeze the 
assets and all its cash on hand. 3 Consistent with the Court's ruling that the Government lacked standing, 
the Court issued an Order on February 26, 2021 , striking the Government's Emergency Motion and all 
responses thereto from the record. 4 
,r6 
In response thereto, the Government filed this Appeal and Petition for Review of Magistrate 
Judge's Orders on March 17, 2021 . In the Petition, the Government asserts that the "Probate Court's ruling 
not only fails to recognize the Government's interest, which supports mandatory or permissive 
intervention, but also ignores the complexity of this proceeding and its significance to Epstein's victims 
and to the people of the Virgin Islands more broadly." 
,r7 
On March 29, 2021, the Co-Executors of the Epstein Estate filed the Co-Executors' Response to 
Government of the United States Virgin Islands' Notice of Appeal & Petition for Review of Magistrate 
Judge's Orders. In their response, the co-executors argued that (1) the Government's appeal is untimely, 
(2) that the Government's failure to state a claim further substantiates their lack of standing, and (3) that 
the Government's Motion to Freeze All Estate Assets and Cash on Hand is Moot. 
JURISDICTION 
,rs 
A Superior Court judge has jurisdiction to review judgments and orders issued by Magistrate 
Judges, when they exercise their original jurisdiction as provided for in Title 4 V.I.C. § 123(a). See, V.I. 
Super. Ct. Rule 322, et. seq. An order or judgment involving probate is a matter that a Superior Court 
Judge may review if appealed. Title 4 V.I.C. § 123(a)(4). 
,r9 
V.I. Super. Ct. Rule 322(a) provides that final orders or judgments of the Magistrate Division 
resolving completely the merits of the cases which came before them pursuant to their original 
A written order was issued on Febmary 26, 202 1 (nunc pro tune to Februa,y 4, 2020). 
A copy of the order was submitted as an Exhibit 2 with the VI Government's Notice of Appeal.

jurisdiction, as provided by Title 4 VI.C. § J 23(a), are immediately appealable to judges of the Superior 
Court of the Virgin Islands, as well as any interlocutory orders appealable by law. 
,10 
V.I.R. Civ. P. Rule 54 (a) defines a judgment as a decree or order from which an appeal lies. 
Where an action has multiple claims of reliefs, including third-party claims, the court may direct entry of 
a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties if the court expressly determines 
that there is no just reason for delay. 5 
,11 
In the February 26, 2021 Order the Court determined that because the VI Government is not a 
party, it lacks standing to move the Court in the present action. Therefore, the Court struck the VI 
Government's Motion to freeze assets and all responses thereto. The determination that the VI 
Government is not a party to the action was made due to the VI Government's failure to intervene as a 
claimant as required by the probate rules. However, the Motion to Intervene was denied without prejudice 
which allowed for the VI Government's error to be corrected and calls into question whether this is a final 
judgment with respect to the VI Government. Further, there was no recitation made by the Court that 
"expressly determines" that there is no just reason for delay. As such, this is not a final judgment eligible 
for appeal. 
,12 
Title 4 V.I.C. § 123( c) states that a judge of the Superior Court may consider any pretrial matter 
handled by the magistrate judge where it has been shown that the magistrate judge 's order is clearly 
erroneous or contrary to law. This Court has determined that the magistrate judge's order is not clearly 
erroneous or contrary to law for the foregoing reasons. 
ISSUES RAISED FOR APPEAL BY THE VI GOVERNMENT 
1. Whether the Magistrate Judge properly denied the Government's Motion to Intervene as a claimant 
against the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
2. Whether the Magistrate Judge properly denied the Government's Emergency Motion to Freeze All 
Estate Assets and Cash on Hand. 
ANALYSIS 
1. Whether the Magistrate Judge properly denied the Government's Motion to Intervene as a 
claimant against the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
V.l.R. Civ. P. Rule 54 (b) 

In the matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein 
ST-21-RV-05 
ST-19-PB-80 
Memorandum Opinion 
Page 4 
2022 VI Super 1 SU 
113 
In its appeal, the VI Government asserts that "as Plaintiff in the CICO action against the Epstein 
estate and other Epstein businesses, that it has an interest in the assets of the Estate, as well as an interest 
in ensuring that the laws of the Virgin Islands are enforced for the benefit of the VI Government, the 
People of the Virgin Islands and the victims of Epstein crimes."6 According to the VI Government the 
Motion to Intervene was filed to ensure that it was adequately represented in the probate matter, but was 
denied stating that the VI Government should enter as a claimant rather than as an intervenor. 
114 
In the Co-Executors' Opposition to Government's Motion to Intervene filed on January 31, 2020, 
the Co-Executors assert that "it is the Virgin Islands Code and the Virgin Islands Rules for Probate and 
Fiduciary Proceedings (the "Probate Rules") that set forth the specific steps a purported claimant must 
take to bring a claim against an estate and participate in a probate proceeding. Rule 24 has no application 
to this proceeding." 7 
115 
At the February 4, 2020 hearing, the VI Government was advised by the Magistrate Judge that it 
should enter the proceedings as a claimant as required by Probate Rules. Case law has repeatedly 
established that "when two statutes cover the same situation, the more specific statute takes precedence 
over the more general one ... "8 
116 
In this case, the Magistrate Judge was correct in advising the VI Government to enter as a claimant 
and denying its Rule 24 Motion to Intervene, as the Probate rules are specifically created to address probate 
proceedings as stated in V.I. R. Prob. Rule 1.9 
117 
Under the Title 15 V.I.C. § 391, all persons having claims against the estate are required to present 
their claims within six months from the date of notice of administration. The VI Government was given 
the opportunity to enter as a claimant, after being so directed at the February 4, 2020 hearing, but failed 
to do so. However, this Court notes that the VI Government is still able to enter as a claimant under Title 
V.I.C. § 392 which states in pertinent part that: 
... A claim not presented within six months cifter the first publication of the notice is not barred, 
but it shall not be paid until the claims presented within that period have been satisfied, and if the 
See Government of the United Stated Virgin Islands' Notice of Appeal & Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders filed by 
VI Government on March 17, 2021 . 
See Co-Executors' Opposition to Government's Motion to Intervene filed on January 31 , 2020.

These Virgin Islands Rules f or Probate and Fiduciary Proceedings shall apply in probate, guardianship, trust and other fiduciary 
proceedings.

claim is not then due, or if contingent, it shall nevertheless be presented as any other claim. Until the 
administration has been completed, a claim against the estate not barred by the statute of limitations 
may be presented, allowed, and paid out of any assets then in the hands of the executor or 
administrator not otherwise appropriated or liable. 
118 
In this instance, the VI Government's failure to enter the probate matter as a claimant within six 
months of the executors' publicized notice of administrations, does not bar it from being able to move 
forward as a claimant in the con-ect manner as provided by the Rules of Probate. The VI Government 
was directed of the appropriate method to adequately represent its interest by the Magistrate Judge who 
regularly presides over probate proceedings. 10 Yet, it inexplicably failed to abide by the guidance which 
was intended to achieve the original purpose of the motions. 
119 
The notorious nature and history of the deceased individual in this probate matter coupled with its 
main-stream attention, is not an indication that the case should be treated differently from any other 
probate case. 
2. Whether the Magistrate Judge properly denied the Government's Emergency Motion to Freeze 
All Estate Assets and Cash on Hand. 
120 
The Magistrate Judge properly denied the VI Government's Emergency Motion to Freeze All 
Estate Assets and Cash on Hand because the VI Government failed to established standing as a claimant 
as noted above. Failure to take the necessary steps to enter the case as a claimant, prevented the VI 
Government from securing the necessary standing to freeze the assets of the Estate. It would have been 
inappropriate for the Magistrate Judge to grant the Government's Emergency Motion to freeze all assets 
when the VI Government failed to follow the required procedures as set forth in Title 15 V.I.C §§ 391-
394 and the relevant probate rules. 
CONCLUSION 
122 
The premises considered, the Magistrate's Orders entered on February 26, 2021 (nunc pro tune to 
February 4, 2020), denying the Government's Motion to Intervene in the Probate action and striking the 
Government's Emergency Motion to Freeze All Estate Assets and Cash on Hand, are AFFIRMED. 
"Each magistrate judge may: (4) hear all non-felony traffic offenses, litter cases, misdemeanor criminal cases where the maximum 
punishment is limited to not more than 364 days imprisonment; arraignment and probable cause hearings in any criminal or traffic 
offense matter; small claims cases and probate matters" Title 4 V.I.C. 123(a).

responding to the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, researching relevant legal issues, drafting the 
required briefing, and preparing for and appearing at the Probate Division’s hearings regarding 
the GVI Motions.   
BACKGROUND 
On August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein died suddenly in the Manhattan Correctional 
Center in New York City.  Since the Epstein Estate’s creation on August 15, 2019 and the 
Probate Division’s appointment of Messrs. Indyke and Kahn as Co-Executors on September 6, 
2019, the Co-Executors have administered the Epstein Estate in the proceeding entitled In the 
Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-2019-00080 (the “Probate Action”).   
The Epstein Estate is massive, complex and multi-jurisdictional.  Initially valued 
at over $636 million, the Epstein Estate’s assets included cash and personal property (e.g., 
vehicles, jewelry, artwork, collectibles, furnishings and equipment), fifteen limited liability 
companies wholly owned by Mr. Epstein, ten corporate entities owned by Mr. Epstein and three 
entities in which Mr. Epstein held partial ownership interests.1  In turn, those entities held a wide 
variety of cash, investments, real property, aircraft, vehicles and other assets located around the 
world, including in New York, New Mexico, Florida, France and the Virgin Islands.2 
Following Mr. Epstein’s death, the Epstein Estate and/or the Co-Executors, acting 
in that capacity, were named as defendants in a welter of sizeable and complex civil suits.  To 
date, sixty-four individual plaintiffs filed forty-seven lawsuits against the Epstein Estate and/or 
the Co-Executors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as

00080 (V.I. Super. Ct. Feb. 28, 2020).

well as in the state courts of New York, Minnesota and Florida, claiming sexual abuse at the 
hands of Mr. Epstein.  Many of these suits sought unliquidated damages and together contain a 
litany of factual allegations going back to the 1980s.  In addition to their defense of these civil 
suits, the Co-Executors worked extensively to establish a voluntarily administered, independent 
claims resolution program (the “Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program”), which provided 
compensation for individual claimants seeking redress for sexual abuse.  In November 2019, the 
Co-Executors sought the Probate Division’s approval for this novel program, the first ever 
established by an estate; Magistrate Judge Carolyn P. Hermon-Percell granted that approval on 
June 3, 2020. 
On January 15, 2020, the GVI filed a lawsuit against the Epstein Estate and 
numerous Epstein business affiliates and associates for, among other allegations, violation of the 
Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (the “CICO Action”).3   
On January 23, 2020, the GVI filed the GVI Motion to Intervene, which sought to 
intervene in the Probate Action pursuant to Rule 24 of the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil 
Procedure (“Rule 24”).  On February 3, 2020, the Co-Executors filed their opposition to the GVI 
Motion to Intervene, arguing that (i) intervention by the GVI was unnecessary in light of the Co-
Executors’ fiduciary duties to the Epstein Estate and Probate Division’s original jurisdiction to 
“supervise and administer estates and fiduciary relations,” 4 V.I.C. § 76(a), (ii) the Virgin Islands 
Code and Probate Rules, rather than Rule 24, govern permissible intervention in the Probate 
Action, (iii) the GVI failed to follow the applicable claims procedure, and (iv) even if Rule 24 
3. In February 2021, the GVI sought leave to amend its complaint in the CICO Action to add 
the Co-Executors as defendants.  That application is pending.

were applicable, the contingent nature of the GVI’s claim required the Court’s denial of its 
motion to intervene.   
On February 4, 2020, at an all-day hearing held in St. Thomas, Judge Hermon-
Percell denied the GVI Motion to Intervene, finding that the GVI was not a party to the Probate 
Action and was therefore not permitted to intervene in that proceeding.4  Judge Hermon-Percell 
issued a written order confirming her ruling on February 26, 2021 (nunc pro tunc to February 4, 
2020).   
On February 4, 2021, the GVI filed the GVI Motion to Freeze Assets, arguing that 
the Probate Division should immediately freeze all of the Epstein Estate’s assets and cash on 
hand because the Epstein Estate allegedly breached its commitment to fund the Epstein Victims’ 
Compensation Program and the Co-Executors purportedly mismanaged the Epstein Estate.  On 
February 10, 2021, the Co-Executors filed their opposition to the GVI Motion to Freeze Assets, 
noting, among other things, (i) the Epstein Estate had already funded the Epstein Victims’ 
Compensation Program with over $87 million specifically to pay claimants, in addition to regular 
payments made by the Epstein Estate to cover the costs of the Program’s administration and 
operations, and the Co-Executors were in the process of liquidating additional assets for 
additional funding;5 (ii) the Co-Executors had not mismanaged the Epstein Estate but were 
instead complying with applicable Virgin Islands law, (iii) the GVI would not be harmed by 
denial of the requested relief and, given the Court’s earlier denial of the GVI Motion to Intervene 
4. See February 4, 2020 Hearing Tr., Exhibit 1 at 98:1-16.  Among other things, the Court 
directed the GVI to file a formal claim in the Probate Action if it wished to be heard as a 
claimant.  (Id. at 98:12-14, 100:8-102:16.)  
5. The Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program ultimately awarded 136 claimants over $121 
million in compensation, which the Epstein Estate fully funded.

and the GVI’s continued failure to file a formal claim in the Probate Action, the GVI lacked 
standing to obtain the relief demanded in the GVI Motion to Freeze Assets, and (iv) the GVI’s 
demand would result in extraordinary harm to the Epstein Estate and would not serve the public 
interest.     
Following a hearing on February 19, 2021, Judge Hermon-Percell struck the GVI 
Motion to Freeze Assets, finding that, because the Court had previously denied the GVI Motion 
to Intervene, the GVI lacked standing to move the Court to freeze the Epstein Estate’s assets.6   
On March 17, 2021, the GVI filed the GVI Appeal, challenging the Probate 
Division’s orders denying the GVI Motion to Intervene and GVI Motion to Freeze Assets.  On 
March 29, 2021, the Co-Executors filed their response to the GVI Appeal, arguing that (i) the 
GVI’s appeal was untimely, (ii) the GVI’s continued refusal to file a formal claim in the Probate 
Action against the Epstein Estate further substantiated the GVI’s lack of standing, and (iii) the 
GVI Motion to Freeze Assets was moot because the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program 
was fully funded and was operating as it had since its implementation. 
On February 4, 2022, this Court (the Honorable Debra S. Watlington) issued a 
Memorandum Opinion affirming the Magistrate Judge’s denial of both the GVI Motion to 
Intervene and the GVI Motion to Freeze Assets.  In its accompanying Order, the Court denied 
the GVI Appeal with prejudice.7

APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD 
In a civil action in the Virgin Islands, a prevailing party may recover its costs, 
including attorneys’ fees, pursuant to 5 V.I.C § 541(a).8  Such attorneys’ fees may be awarded 
against the GVI.  See, e.g., Bennett v. Virgin Islands Govt., No. 2004-CV-0031., 2007 BL 
131136 (D.V.I. Oct. 22, 2007) (awarding recovery of attorney’s fees against the GVI); Berne 
Corp. v Govt. of the Virgin Is., 2010 US Dist LEXIS 105265, at *1 (D.V.I. Sep. 30, 2010) 
(same).   
Pursuant to 5 V.I.C. § 541(b), awards of attorneys’ fees are considered an 
indemnity for the prevailing party.  5 V.I.C. § 541(b) (absent agreement to the contrary by the 
parties, “there shall be allowed to the prevailing party in the judgment such sums as the court in 
its discretion may fix by way of indemnity for his attorney’s fees in maintaining the action or 
defenses thereto”).  While such awards lie within the Court’s discretion, the Supreme Court of 
the Virgin Islands recently made clear that courts do not have unlimited discretion to reduce the 
amount of requested attorneys’ fees.  See Mahabir v. Heirs of James Wellington George, S. Ct. 
Civ. No. 2014-0025, 2021 WL 6100552, at *2-4 (V.I. Dec. 22, 2021) (finding that Superior 
Court erred in reducing attorneys’ requested hourly rate).  Instead, courts must “first calculate the 
number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation,” then multiply that numbery of hours “by 
a reasonable hourly rate, calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant 
community.”  Id. at *2-3 (citing Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984)).  “The court must 
then evaluate the attorney’s experience and skill and compare their rates to the rates prevailing in 
8. Courts in the probate proceedings in the Magistrate Division are likewise empowered to 
grant costs such as attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party.  15 V.I.C. § 165 (costs may be 
awarded in favor of one party against another, to be paid personally or out of the estate or 
fund, in any proceedings contested adversely).

the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and 
reputation.”  Id. (citing Blum, 465 U.S. at 895 n.11).  Courts determining a reasonable hourly rate 
may also consider factors including: 
(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions 
involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; 
(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular 
employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; 
(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; 
(4) the amount involved and the results obtained; 
(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances; 
(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; 
(7) the experience, reputation and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the 
services; and 
(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.

ARGUMENT 
Here, the Co-Executors unquestionably prevailed on the GVI Motion to Intervene 
and the GVI Motion to Freeze Assets before Judge Hermon-Percell and on the GVI Appeal 
before this Court.  The Court should therefore award attorneys’ fees to the Co-Executors. 
Contemporaneously recorded, detailed descriptions of the hours expended for 
legal services rendered by the Epstein Estate’s counsel in relation to the GVI Motions and GVI 
Appeal, as well as the relevant attorneys’ rates, are set forth in the accompanying Affidavits of 
Daniel H. Weiner and Christopher A. Kroblin.  As discussed in more detail below, the number of 
hours expended and rates requested are reasonable.

I. 
The Hours Expended by the Co-Executors’ Counsel in Defeating the GVI Motions 
and GVI Appeal Are Reasonable. 
Defeating the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal was of significant importance to the 
Co-Executors and their administration of the Epstein Estate.  The GVI has repeatedly sought to 
unlawfully seize effective control over the Epstein Estate in an attempt to appropriate for itself 
the Court’s power and the Co-Executors’ responsibility under the Virgin Islands Code to 
administer the Epstein Estate.9  The GVI Motions constituted another such illegitimate attempt, 
with the GVI seeking to improperly interfere with the Probate Division’s authority and the Co-
Executors’ ability to discharge their legal obligations.  Instead of properly filing a claim against 
the Epstein Estate as expressly instructed by Judge Hermon-Percell on February 4, 2020 and in 
accordance with the Virgin Islands Rules of Probate and Fiduciary Proceedings—which would 
have allowed the Co-Executors to properly review that claim and conferred standing on the GVI 
to seek relief before the Probate Division—the GVI attempted to circumvent the probate process 
and gain priority over the Epstein Estate’s assets to the detriment of other claimants and 
creditors.10  Likewise, through the GVI Motion to Freeze Assets, the GVI improperly sought to 
prevent the Co-Executors from paying for the necessary and ongoing administration of the 
Epstein Estate. 
Given the size and complexity of the Epstein Estate and the novel, multifaceted 
nature of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program, the implications of the Motions were far-
9. See, e.g., Co-Executors’ Emergency Motion for Order Releasing Funds for Administration of 
the Estate, In the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-00080 
(V.I. Super. Ct. Feb. 10, 2020) (explaining that improper criminal activity lien notices issued 
by the GVI in January 2020 had brought the administration of the Epstein Estate to a 
potentially disastrous halt).  
10. The GVI finally filed its claim in the Probate Action on February 18, 2022, more than two 
years after Judge Hermon-Percell directed the GVI to do so. 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein  
Case No. ST-21-RV-00005 
Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law 
Page 9 
reaching.  The GVI’s unauthorized attempt to intervene in the Probate Action and seize control 
of the Epstein Estate’s assets was both extremely unusual and of extraordinary importance to the 
Epstein Estate.  To further complicate matters, the GVI based its improper Motions on 
unsupported applications of law and baseless accusations concerning the Co-Executors and the 
Probate Division’s ability to effectively administer the Epstein Estate.  As a result, the Co-
Executors were forced retain counsel to spend considerable time in order to, among other things, 
evaluate the implications of the GVI Motions on both the Probate Action and the GVI’s CICO 
Action, strategize the proper response to the GVI Motions in light of those implications, research 
and draft responses to the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, prepare to argue the GVI Motions and 
appear and argue before the Probate Division.11   
In light of these facts, the Court should conclude that time spent by the Co-
Executors’ counsel in relation to the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal was reasonable. 
II. 
The Co-Executors’ Counsels’ Rates Are Reasonable. 
To determine a reasonable hourly rate, courts should assess the experience and 
skill of the prevailing party’s attorneys and “compare their rates to the rates prevailing in the 
community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and 
reputation.”  Mahabir, 2021 WL 6100552, at *3.  The appropriate rate used for this analysis is 
the “rate at the time of the fee petition, not at the time the services were performed.”  Anthony v. 
11. In total, counsel for the Co-Executors researched and drafted three opposition briefs—each 
of which required analysis of complex legal issues and far-reaching implications for the 
Epstein Estate—and prepared for and participated in two substantive hearings before the 
Probate Court.  When broken down, counsel for the Co-Executors spent approximately fifty-
two hours on their opposition briefs to each of the GVI’s Motions, twenty-three hours 
preparing for and participating in the February 4, 2020 Hearing, eight hours preparing for and 
participating in the February 19, 2021 hearing, and fourteen hours on their opposition brief to 
the GVI’s Appeal.

Abbott, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94323, at *7 (D.V.I. July 9, 2012) (quoting Lanni v. New Jersey, 
259 F.3d 146, 149-50 (3d Cir. 2001)).   
Here, the Co-Executors employed highly qualified attorneys from Kellerhals 
Ferguson Kroblin PLLC (“Kellerhals”), a law firm with offices in the U.S. Virgin Islands and 
New York and which is affiliated with New York law firm Solomon Blum Heymann LLP 
(“Solomon”), and Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP (“Hughes Hubbard”), a well-known 
international law firm with offices in New York, Florida and Paris, each a jurisdiction in which 
the Epstein Estate has substantial property and in which the Estate faces various complex legal 
issues.  Counsels’ rates are listed in the Weiner and Kroblin Affidavits filed herewith and range 
from $360 to $1,315 per hour for attorneys and $135 for a legal assistant, including relevant 
discounts negotiated by the Co-Executors.  As discussed below, the requested rates for each of 
the relevant counsel and legal assistants (i) reflect their skills and experience; (ii) constitute 
customary rates as paid by other clients as well as the Epstein Estate; (iii) are consistent with 
rates charged by comparable professionals; and (iv) reflect the complexity of the Epstein Estate 
and the legal issues involved in the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, and the benefits obtained by 
counsel’s successes.   
1. Counsels’ Rates Reflect Their Reputation, Skills and Experience. 
As detailed further in the Weiner and Kroblin Affidavits and the biographies 
attached thereto, the Co-Executors’ counsel are experienced attorneys whose rates reflect their 
skills:   
A. 
Christopher A. Kroblin is a member and the lead litigator at Kellerhals.  
His focus on civil and commercial litigation includes complex contract disputes, product defects 
and other tort disputes, arbitration, employment law, commercial banking litigation, and

creditor's side bankruptcy representation.  Mr. Kroblin also handles tax litigation cases as well as 
association, partnership, and corporate litigation matters.  In addition to his general trial level 
practice, Mr. Kroblin handles a broad array of appellate issues.  Mr. Kroblin has practiced in the 
Virgin Islands since 2005; he was previously a law clerk for Virgin Islands Supreme Court 
Justice Maria M. Cabret in her former position as Presiding Judge of the Superior Court of the 
Virgin Islands.  Mr. Kroblin also interned for the Federal Trade Commission, the Superior Court 
of the District of Columbia, and the Supreme Court of California.  He is admitted to practice law 
in New York and the Virgin Islands, as well as before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 
B. 
Shari N. D’Andrade is a litigation associate with Kellerhals with more 
than eleven years of experience practicing law.  She rejoined the firm in 2019 after serving 
several years as an Assistant Attorney General with the Virgin Islands Department of Justice and 
General Counsel for the GVI’s Bureau of Corrections.  There, Ms. D’Andrade handled a broad 
range of legal matters, including prison litigation, defamation, class action suits, elections 
disputes, and Title VII employment discrimination cases.  Ms. D’Andrade appears regularly

District Court Judge for the District of Columbia.  Ms. D’Andrade is admitted to practice in the 
Virgin Islands and New York.   
C. 
Marjorie Whalen is a litigation associate with Kellerhals with more than 
nine years of experience practicing law.  Before joining Kellerhals, she served for two years as a 
law clerk to the Honorable Kathleen Y. Mackay of the Virgin Islands Superior Court.  A member 
of the Law Review at Roger Williams University School of Law, Ms. Whalen interned for the 
Honorable O. Rogeriee Thompson in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  Ms. 
Whalen is admitted to practice law in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the Virgin Islands.  
D. 
Andrew Heymann is a New York City-based partner at Solomon with 
significant experience handling matters in the Virgin Islands.  He has more than thirty years’

including obtaining judgments defending fiduciaries and beneficiaries in proceedings involving 
foreign forced heirship, undue influence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraudulent conveyance 
claims; foreign tribunal arbitrations resulting in the successful dissolution and distribution of 
international trusts; international reinsurance litigation resulting in multimillion-dollar 
settlements; and, U.S. tax reporting, advice and financial disclosure cases.  He is admitted to 
practice before the federal, state and territorial courts in the jurisdictions of New York, New 
Jersey and the Virgin Islands, and before several federal Circuit Courts of Appeals and the U.S. 
Tax Court. 
E. 
Daniel H. Weiner is a partner at Hughes Hubbard, where he serves as 
Chair of that firm’s Litigation Department and Complex Business Disputes practice.  Mr. 
Weiner, a 1981 graduate cum laude of Princeton University and a 1984 graduate of New York 
University School of Law, has more than thirty-seven years of experience litigating complex 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein  
Case No. ST-21-RV-00005 
Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law 
Page 13 
disputes and has first-chair experience in more than thirty litigations and arbitrations.  
Recognized as a leading international arbitration lawyer by Law360, The Legal 500 United 
States, Chambers USA and Chambers Global, ranked in Chambers USA as a leading lawyer in 
commercial litigation, and recognized by New York Super Lawyers Business Litigation as a 
“super lawyer,” Mr. Weiner is based in New York City and is licensed to practice law in Florida 
and New York, as well as before numerous federal Circuit Courts of Appeals and the United 
States Tax Court, Court of International Trade and U.S. Supreme Court.  He has been admitted 
pro hac vice to practice law in the Virgin Islands in the Probate Action.   
2. Clients Routinely Pay Counsels’ Rates. 
As the Virgin Islands Supreme Court has recognized, “no fee is reasonable unless 
it would be adequate to induce other attorneys to represent similarly situated clients seeking 
relief comparable to that obtained in the case at hand.”  Mahabir, 2021 WL 6100552 at *3.  For 
this purpose, “[t]he value of an attorney’s time generally is reflected in his normal billing rate.”  
Id. at *3.  The rates that attorneys actually charge are the best evidence of what the market will 
bear, as compared to a “rate devised by the court” because “[l]awyers do not come from cookie 
cutters . . . . Clients are willing to pay more, per hour, for . . . better lawyers . . . . Markets 
recognize these truths; judges must too.”  Gusman v. Unisys Corp., 986 F.2d 1146, 1150 (7th 
Cir. 1993) (Easterbrook, J.); see also Rozell v. Ross-Holst, 576 F. Supp. 2d 527, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 
2008) (“[T]he range of rates that plaintiff's counsel actually charge their clients . . . is obviously 
strong evidence of what the market will bear.”). 
Here, the Co-Executors’ requested fees are based on their counsel’s customary 
rates, which are routinely paid by clients in the Virgin Islands and around the world.  (Kroblin 
Aff. ¶¶ 5-6; Weiner Aff. ¶¶ 4-6.)  In particular, these rates represent the rates that Co-Executors’ 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein  
Case No. ST-21-RV-00005 
Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law 
Page 14 
counsel is actually paid for work relating to the Epstein Estate.  (Kroblin Aff. ¶ 5; Weiner Aff. 
¶ 5.)  As rates actually charged and paid, the requested rates are reasonable and consistent with 
the rates charged in the relevant communities.   
3. The Requested Rates Reflect the Rates in the Relevant Communities. 
The rates charged by each of the Co-Executors’ counsel who did work associated 
with the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal also are commensurate with rates customarily charged by 
similarly-experienced attorneys for similar work in the relevant communities.  
For many years, courts in the Virgin Islands stated that the hourly rate for 
attorneys practicing in the Virgin Islands was roughly $300.  See, e.g., Diamond Crest, Ltd. v. 
FNA Service Stations, Inc., Civil No. 591/01, 2006 WL 8418818 (V.I. Super. June 14, 2006) 
(finding that, in 2006, the standard rates charged by attorneys in the Virgin Islands was $200-
$400).  However, just as the cost of living increased dramatically over the last decade and a half, 
rates charged by attorneys in the Virgin Islands have also risen.  As the Virgin Islands Supreme 
Court recently cautioned, courts must not allow their pre-conceived notions of customary market 
rates for attorneys in the Virgin Islands to prevail over the evidence of the prevailing rates set 
forth in the case before them, such as the customary rates actually charged by the attorneys in 
question and affidavits evidencing the standard rates.  Mahabir, 2021 WL 6100552, at *3 
(finding that the court should not use its preconceived notion of current standard rates as a basis 
to lower the requested standard rate).  As set forth in Mr. Kroblin’s Affidavit, the rates requested 
here for the Kellerhals and Solomon attorneys are standard rates charged by experienced 
attorneys in the Virgin Islands.  (Kroblin Aff. ¶ 6.) 
The rate charged by Kellerhals’ legal assistant Shauna Betz also is consistent with 
rates charged by legal assistants in the Virgin Islands.  See, e.g., LPP Mortg., Ltd. v. Ferris, 2014 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein  
Case No. ST-21-RV-00005 
Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law 
Page 15 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74599, at *25 n.3 (D.V.I. June 2, 2014) (approving paralegal hourly rates 
ranging from $120 to $150).  The Virgin Islands Superior Court recently found reasonable and 
approved a Kellerhals’ paralegal’s similar hourly rate.  See Matter of Estate of Benjamin, No. 
ST-95-PB-53, 2019 WL 3219450, at *5 (V.I. Super. Feb. 21, 2019) (“The paralegals’ hourly 
legal rate set forth in Attorney Kellerhals’ motion between $135.00 and $80.00 appears 
reasonable . . . .”).   
The rates charged by Mr. Weiner of Hughes Hubbard likewise reflect the 
prevalent rates in the relevant community.  (Weiner Aff. ¶ 6.)  While courts frequently look to 
the local geographic area to determine the applicable “community” of attorneys against whom to 
evaluate the attorney’s rates, courts addressing attorney’s fees for complex cases may look 
outside their geographic area to find the appropriate hourly rate.  See, e.g., Strauch v. Computer 
Scis. Corp., No. 3:14-CV-956 (JBA), 2020 WL 4289955, at *7 (D. Conn. July 27, 2020) (finding 
that, because the complex litigation was the kind of case for which a local attorney “would need 
to seek out-of-district counsel to prosecute the case effectively,” counsel was “entitled to rates in 
excess of those that prevail in this district . . .”); Polk v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Corr. Servs., 722 
F.2d 23, 25 (2d Cir. 1983) (holding, as a judge “may consider all of the circumstances of the 
case,” out-of-forum rates were appropriate “upon a showing that the special expertise of counsel 
from a distant district is required”); Howes v. Medical Components, Inc., 761 F. Supp. 1193, 
1196 (E.D. Pa. 1990) (finding that “a party should be entitled to retain the most competent 
counsel available, particularly in the highly specialized area [at issue] and particularly when its 
local counsel suggests using an out-of-state law firm for the purpose of litigation. . . . [because 
P]laintiffs had a good reason for using non-local counsel, plaintiffs’ New York City counsel 
[were] entitled to recover the reasonable hourly rate for the New York City community.”).

Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law 
Page 16 
Considering the complex, multi-jurisdictional nature of the Epstein Estate and the far-reaching 
implications of the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, this is precisely the type of case where 
counsel outside of the Virgin Islands with special expertise in similar cases is necessary and 
appropriate.12   
Mr. Weiner’s rate is commensurate with other attorneys in the New York City 
area with similar experience, skill and reputation as well as with other attorneys in relation to 
matters whose complexity is comparable to administration of the Epstein Estate.  (Weiner Aff. 
¶¶ 4, 6); see also, e.g., Trupia v. Astrue, No. 05-CV-6085 (SJF), 2008 WL 858994, at *4 
(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2008) (awarding what amounted to a $1,714 hourly fee); McDonald v. 
Comm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 16-CV-926-FPG, 2019 WL 1375084, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2019) 
(awarding what amounted to a $1,051 hourly fee); Kanzanjian v. Astrue, No. 09 CIV. 3678 
BMC, 2011 WL 284743, at *2-3 (E.D.N.Y. July 15, 2011) (approving fee award of $2,100 per 
hour); Sara Randazzo and Jacqueline Palank, Legal Fees Cross New Mark: $1,500 an Hour, The 
Wall St. J. (Feb. 9, 2016), https://www.wsj.com/articles/legal-fees-reach-new-pinnacle-1-500-an-
hour-1454960708 (Exhibit 2).  Here, Mr. Weiner’s requested rate for time spent on the GVI 
Motions and the GVI Appeal reflects a discount from his current standard rates.  (Weiner Aff. 
¶ 5.)   
12. The USVI Attorney General likewise engaged Motley Rice LLC, a firm with more than 100 
attorneys and offices in New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., South Carolina, Rhode 
Island, Connecticut, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, to represent the GVI in the Probate 
Action and GVI’s CICO action.

Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law 
Page 17 
4. The Requested Rates Reflect the Benefits Obtained by Counsels’ Success as well 
as the Complexity of the Epstein Estate and the Legal Issues Involved in the GVI 
Motions and GVI Appeal. 
In evaluating the reasonableness of an attorney’s rate, the Court also considers 
factors such as the time and labor involved, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, 
the amount involved and the benefits obtained, and the likelihood that the acceptance of the 
particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer.  See, e.g., Yearwood 
Enterprises, Inc., 2017 WL 6316625, at *2; Dorval v. Sapphire Vill. Condo. Owners Ass’n, Nos. 
16-50;18-29, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84668, at *6 (D.V.I. May 11, 2020) (citation omitted).   
Here, as discussed above, the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal presented far-
reaching implications for the Epstein Estate.  Evaluating the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, 
strategizing appropriate responses, researching and drafting those responses, and preparing and 
appearing for the Court hearings required a substantial amount of time, labor and skill.  
Likewise, as grant of the GVI Motions or GVI Appeal would have resulted in both (1) the GVI 
“jumping the line” ahead of numerous claimants and creditors who had properly filed their 
claims in the Probate Action, and (2) the inability of the Co-Executors to continue to administer 
the Epstein Estate, the amounts in question and benefits to the Epstein Estate (including the 
Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program) obtained through the Co-Executors’ success are 
substantial.   
The nature of the Probate Action likewise has a substantial impact on the Co-
Executors’ counsel.  Given Mr. Epstein’s notoriety, the administration of the Epstein Estate has 
negative reputational consequences for Co-Executors’ counsel—particularly USVI counsel, who 
work in a small community where Mr. Epstein is infamous.  This notoriety both makes it 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein  
Case No. ST-21-RV-00005 
Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law 
Page 18 
difficult for the Co-Executors to obtain other representation and necessitates a higher hourly rate 
for their legal services.   
Moreover, while the Co-Executors seek in this application only those fees 
associated with legal work performed on the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, the Court cannot 
evaluate that work without considering the larger legal requirements of the Epstein Estate.  
Administration of the Epstein Estate is a massive, multi-jurisdictional task that requires complex 
and specialized legal work.  Not only would it have been fundamentally unreasonable to bring in 
different counsel separate from those working on the Epstein Estate’s legal issues at large in 
order to address the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, responding to those applications required a 
thorough understanding of the Epstein Estate.  The reasonable rates appropriate in successfully 
litigating the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal cannot be separated from the reasonable rates 
appropriate for attorneys involved in administering and litigating the complex issues relating to 
the Epstein Estate.  In considering the required skill, time and labor involved in litigation of the 
GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, the Court should consider the substantial amount of skill, time 
and labor involved—and the reasonable rates associated with that work—in the Epstein Estate’s 
larger legal work.  
CONCLUSION

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
THE COURT: Good morning. 
THE CLERK: Good morning. Probate 
calendar f or Monday, February 4, 2020. 
Case 
Number 1, in the Matter of the Estate of 
Jeffrey Epstein, ST-19-PB-80. 
THE COURT: Counsel. 
ATTORNEY BLOM: Good morning, 
Your Honor. My name is Attorney Wil l iam Blum. 
I 'm Counsel for t he Co-Executors of the estate 
of Jeffrey Epstein. I am accompanied today by 
Co-Counsel, Christopher Kroblin, Marjorie 
Whalen sitting at Counsel's table, as well as 
Shari D'Andrade sitting behind. 
Two mainland 
attorneys who have been admi tted pro hac vice 
in this matter, Attorney Andrew Tomback at the 
end and Attorney Daniel Weiner. 
If it please Your Honor, I would 
like to start by --
THE COURT: Attorney Blum, before 
you proceed, first off, Good morni ng to you. 
Good morni ng to Counsel. Do we have the pro 
hac admission documents to file with the 
Court? I'm going to ask that they be filed 
wi th the Court. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: We'll do so, Your 

Probate ST-1 9- PB- 0080 
Honor. 
THE COURT: 
be filed in due course. 
Well, they can just 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Okay. 
THE COURT: 
Let me just first 
explain how we are going to work these 
proceedings today because this is an unusual 
probate proceeding, the Logistics of how 
Counsel is to come forward to address the 
Court. The estate counsels have been seated at 
Counsel's table . 
What I am now going to ask i s 
that Counsel for other parties come to the 
podium, identify themselves by names and their 
client. 
Then I'm going to ask you to return 
to the gallery. 
There are numerous motions 
before the Court pending for today. I put them 
in categories to be dealt with. It made sense 
to me to categorize the motions because it 
seems they fit into categories in my thinking. 
As the motions are called by 
category, Counsel would then indicate, after 
the Estate has made its arguments to the 
Court, i£ Counsel wishes to be heard, by 
indication raise your hand and you come 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
forward. That is the only way the Court can 
see how we are going to get through this today 
to allow everyone to have an opportunity to 
address the Court on the different issues. 
Fair enough to everyone present in the 
courtroom? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Thank you, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: Yes. Okay. Counsel 
for claimants or other persons interested in 
the estate, one at a time--I don't know how we 
are going to do this. 
ATTORNEY CHANCO: 
Good morning, 
Your Honor. Douglas Chanco here today on 
15· 
behalf of Claimant Jennifer Araos. 
THE COURT: Attorney Chanco, are 
you an attorney licensed here in the Virgin 
Islands.

Good morning. 
ATTORNEY D'AMOUR: --five 
different claimants. I'm also here with two of 
the state side Counsel that at some point may 
want to address the Court, if they are 
permitted. 
THE COURT: Have they been 
admitted? 
ATTORNEY D'AMOUR: They have not 
been admitted but their application is 
pending. 
THE COURT: Without the 
admission, I don't believe they can address 
the Court. They can address the Court through 
you, attorney. 

Probat e ST-19- PB- 0080 
ATTORNEY D'AMOUR: I understand, 
Your Honor. 
Our claimants are Ms. Maria 
Farmer, Teresa Helm, Juliette Bryant, and a

filed the motion to proceed anonymously and a 
notice of claim, and a claim for 
unliquidated-- for damages and on Monday, 
yesterday, we filed a motion to intervene. 
THE COURT: In which District? 
ATTORNEY WESTFALL: We filed it in 
St. Croix and they told us they would go over 
the documents. 
THE COURT: It hasn't made it to 
the Court's file; it hasn't made it to my 
file . When you say in St. Croix, you were not 
one of the names that was relayed to me this 
morning so I don't have any of your documents

ATTORNEY WESTFALL: Thank you. 
THE COURT: All right.

the docket. I have a copy of the docket sheet. 
THE COURT: All right. Thank you. 
Has the Court now heard from all counsel who 
would like to be heard this morning? 
The first motion that the Court 
will consider is the Motion For Appointment of 
Appraisers for real properties located in New 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
York, New Mexico and Florida. 
This is a motion filed by the 
estate by the Co-Executors where they move the 
Court to appoint appraisers pursuant to Rule 
S 
A of the Virgin Islands Rules of Probate 
and Fiduciary Proceedings to appoint 
appraisers in the jurisdictions of New York, 
New Mexico, Florida to appraise the real 
property that may be of interest to this 
estate. Counsel? 
ATTORNEY WHALEN: Good morning, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Good morning. 
ATTORNEY WHALEN: The estate 
filed a--
THE COURT: Just state your name. 
ATTORNEY WHALEN: My apologies. 
Marjorie Whalen for the executors of the 
estate. The estate filed a motion for 
appointment of appraisers on January 17, 2020 . 
This is a motion, Your Honor, to appoint three 
appraisers for three properties in three 
jurisdictions, in Florida, New Mexico and New 
York. Each of the three proposed appraisers 
have executed and submitted affidavits to the 

Probate ST-19-PB-00~0 
Court affirming that they are competent and 
qualified appraisers and that they are 
licensed in their jurisdictions. 
The first appraiser is Bryan J. 
Rogers and he is proposed to appraise two 
properties in New York. He is a licensed 
appraiser and is Senior Vice President at 
Miller, Samuel, Inc., which is a New York 
based Real Estate Appraisal and Consulting 
firm. 
And the second appraiser is Jim 
Connolly, and the executors seek his 
appointment to appraise real property in New 
Mexico. Mr. Connolly is a licensed appraiser 
as well and has also submitted his affidavit 
affirming his experience. 
The third proposed appraiser is 
Michael R. Slade and the estate seeks to 
appoint him to appraise the property in 
Florida. 
THE COURT: Are you completed 
with your argument or your information to the 
Court? 
ATTORNEY WHALEN: 
Yes. We have 
submitted the affidavits and I believe we 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
submitted everything needed to appoint these 
appraisers and we have not received any 
objection or opposition to our request for 
their appointment. 
THE COURT: 
Let me see if there 
is any Counsel who wishes to address that 
motion for appointment of appraisers for real 
properties located in New York, New Mexico and 
Florida? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I would like 
to --
THE COURT: Attorney Smith. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Good morning, 
Your Honor. 
With regard to the motion --
THE COURT: 
Just identify 
yourself. All Counsels, when you come to the 
podium, again, identify yourselves by name, 
please. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
Attorney 
Ariel Smith on behalf of the Government of the 
Virgin Islands. 
With regard to the motion 
that was made earlier before the Court and 
filed prior to that, one of the questions we 
would ask the Court to inquire of the executor 
who owns the properties from which they're 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
seeking the appraisal and what interest do 
they represent in the estate because that was 
not clear from the motion nor the 
representations before this Court. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Attorney Smith 
and Attorney Whalen, Attorney Smith has nailed 
what this Court, the concerns this Court has 
concerning that motion - is that you are 
seeking for the court to appoint appraisers 
located in these jurisdictions. As I have it 
in the petition that was filed, petition for 
probate and for letters testamentary, The 
estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein does not own any 
real property. It's 
set forth --and I know 
this is the initial petition, but it's set 
forth that these properties in question are 
owned by corporations for which the decedent 
may have owned shares in the corporation. 
So, the question woul d be: 
What is 
it that we are seeking to value? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: That's it. 
THE COURT: Is it the real 
property or is it the shares, his ownership of 
the shares? 
And I would say because the Court 
has no jurisdiction over real property located 

Proba t e ST- 19-PB-0080 
outside of the jurisdiction, that is why the 
Court 
usually does not have to appoint 
appraisers located in any jurisdiction other 
than the Virgin Is l ands. 
And I know what you set forth as 
the proposed rates for these appraisers. This 
Court has a rate schedul e for its appraisers 
that begins at $400 and does not exceed $450 
for reports to be shared by two persons. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, if 
I might add that the f i rst quarterly 
accounting that was literally filed, I 
bel i eve, either Friday or yesterday, reflects 
no real estate owned by the decedent . 
THE COURT: And Attorney Smi th 
also, she is correct. 
In the first quarterl y 
accounting filed with the Court, f iled 
yesterday, the first quarterly accounting says 
real property, none, and i t provides a 
schedule as t o personal property and on that 
schedule, valuation is provi ded for all the 
corporate entities in which the decedent is 
alleged to have owned 100 percent and I have 
values for those. 
So that's what the Court would 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
believe the Court would need. 
What is the 
value of the share 
held by th 
decedent 
not 
to appraise the real property located in these 
jurisdictions because I would have no idea 
what is proposed by these appraisers is fair 
and reasonable. 
Attorney Blum. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Attorney Willi am 
Blum for the Co-Executors of the estate of 
Jeffrey Epstein. Your Honor, the real 
properties that we are seeking to be appraised 
are each found in separate corporations that 
are Virgin Islands corporations. Those are the 
only substantial assets of each of those 
corporations. 
So for us to be able to evaluate 
these stocks of these corporations, we need -
someone needs- to make a determination as to 
what is the value of the underlining real 
estate. 
Now if Your Honor is suggesting that 
we should make our own decision as to how to 
evaluate the property that's owned by these 
corporations, we would do so and then we would 
use that as evidence of the value of the 
stocks and perhaps if required, we coul d have 
a separate apprai ser who could affirm that 

Probate ST-19-PB-OOBO 
although it is sort of fairly obvious. 
THE COURT: 
Well, Attorney Blum, 
I'm saying if the shares are what is owned by 
the estate 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Correct. 
THE COURT: The V.I. Corporations, 
I'm assuming, they are still in operation and 
have corporate government, whether Officers, 
Board of Directors, continuing to function 
that-- someone needs to make sure that their 
cell phone or whatever electronic device they 
have is turned off--it also would seem to me 
these corporations would have had annual 
reports, tax returns, something that would be 
able to value what the value of the shares 
held. 
What I am addressing is the 
motion to appoint appraisers to appraise real 
property when I have the decedent does not own 
any real property and any appraisal that I 
sent or gave an order to would have been for 
real property located here in the Virgin 
Islands. 
So as it pertains to-- Attorney 
Smith? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
I would just ask, I think what is --Well, or 
what the Court may want to inquire of is which 
of the companies that was owned by the 
decedent own these real properties since 
that's what they are suggesting is the case. 
That is not clear in the motion. 
THE COURT: 
But it's set out in 
the petition for probate: 
10,000 shares of 
Maple, Inc., a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation 
which holds title to Nine East 71 Street, New 
York. 
10,000 shares of Cypress, Inc., 
a U.S. Virgin Islands Corporation which holds 
title to 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New 
Mexico; 
10,000 shares of Laurel, Inc., a 
u:s. Virgin Islands Corporation which holds 
title to property located in Palm Beach, 
Florida; 
999 shares of SCIJEP, a french 
company which holds title to some real 
property located in Paris; 
10,000 shares of Poplar, Inc., a 
U.S. Virgin Islands corporation which holds 
title to Great St. James Island. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
10,000 shares of Nautilus, Inc., 
a U. S. Virgin Islands corporation which holds 
title to Little St. James Island. 
So it's set out in the petition. 
So it would seem to me that's what the Court 
and in the petition and the filing, there 
was an estimated value provided for what those 
shares would be so the Court sees no reason, 
the Court 
would need to appoint an appraiser 
to appraise the real property.' That 
information should be to be given by the 
corporation, the Officers, from whether your 
annual report to verify it, and in your 
quarterly accountings in the petition, we had 
values presented, the first quarterly 
accounting again has values presented so the 
Court will deny the motion for the appointment 
for the appraiser for the real property 
located in New York, New Mexico and Florida. 
So that motion is denied. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Your Honor, if I 
may, nevertheless, the estate will need to 
appraise those properties, at least for estate 
tax purposes in order to provide appropriate 
value for the estate tax returns. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
THE COURT: The properties or the 
shares? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: The shares of 
stock, the companies that owns the stock, that 
owns the real property. 
Those are going to be 
listed in the estate tax returns. 
THE COURT: 
And I'm saying to 
you, these are corporations functioning- -
ATTORNEY BLUM: Yes. 
THE COURT: With Officers, Board 
of Directors who can do whatever is needed as 
a corporate structure to valuate the shares 
owned by its shareholders. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Thank you, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, I 
would just say that this is kind of an 
extraordinary circumstance because it appears 
that in a number of these corporations the 
decedent was the sole shareholder and I'm 
concerned as to what that might suggest to the 
estate what they are able to do without input 
from the Court. 
THE COURT: What I'm saying lS I 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
have it that these are corporations. 
I'm 
assuming 
corporations that are operating 
according to Virgin Islands corporate law or 
any jurisdiction where they have been created . 
Corporations having a creation separate and 
apart from the shareholders or from the 
estate. 
The estate is saying we own 
shares in these corporations. 
The Court at 
this point does not know how the co-executors 
are involved with the corporations. 
I 'm 
assuming the corporation s are operati ng 
separate and apart from the estate because 
they are corporations. Unless I have something 
different to inform me, I'm taking the 
decedent own shares in the l ist ed 
corporations - whether he own 100 percent, it 
is s t ill entities separate and apart from his 
estate. 
Okay, Attorney Blum? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Thank you. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: All right. Next motion 
that was fi l ed on August 30, 2019. 
Motion for 
the appointment of a Master pur suant to Virgin 
Is l ands Rule of Civil Procedure 53 in whi ch 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
the Executors--co-executors move to appoint a 
master, which in summary they set out to 
assist the Court with what they believe would 
be a complicated probate proceeding. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your 
Honor. 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Attorney Kroblin. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you~ 
THE COURT: I said your name but 
for the record. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes. 
Christopher Kroblin on behalf of the executors 
of the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. 
Your Honor, 
we submitted this motion in anticipation of 
this estate involving much more work than the 
average estate pending before this Court and 
in particular to deal with a couple of issues, 
one of which --and an important one --is 
dealing with administrative costs of the 
estate, particularly attorney fees that needs 
Court approval. 
We've submitted now four 
different fee applications and we have, I 
believe, two more that will be filed this week 

Probate ST- 19- PB- 0080 
and another one or two next week. 
So that 
brings it to about a t otal of eight fee 
applications and they are ongoing. 
For a little background, Your 
S 
Honor, we have not addressed yet, there are 
numerous lawsuits pending in the United 
States. There are some 32 Plaintiffs that have 
filed suits in different lawsuits and we have 
retained, the estate has retained Counsel 
travel ing to represent the estate in the 
defense of those lawsuits, most all being 
filed in New York at this time and some other 
ones. 
So Your Honor, the ·estate has 
urgent need to appear in these matters and 
defend the matters. They are currently, you 
know, in progress. 
I guess at this junction 
none of them have really gone to the d i scovery 
phase yet but we understand if they were to go 
under discovery which is imminent, that the 
costs would skyrocket for the representation 
of the estate. 
So the need to timely approve 
the fee applications, we find to be highly 
important particularly with the number of 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
lawsuits pending and the matter of attorney 
fees the estate has sustained in defense of 
these lawsuits. That's the reason we've asked 
that the Court consider the appointment of a 
Master to assist with those fee applications 
and he may also be able to potentially assist 
with other issues the Court may have or want 
to refer to the Master. 
We've proposed 
Britain Bryant who is here in the courtroom 
with us today. 
THE COURT: 
Attorney Bryant. 
Honor. 
ATTORNEY BRYANT: Yes, Your 
THE COURT: Good morning, Sir. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: And Your 
Honor, he is the oldest practitioner in the 
Virgin Islands Bar currently. 
{Laughter} 
THE COURT: Oldest practitioner? 
I don't think that is what you want to say, 
sir. He might be the longest serving 
pra ti ioner. 
I think that is what you want 
to say, the longest practice. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: That is 
correct, That is correct. 
And Your Honor, he 

Probate ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
is, you know obviously, he has many years of 
experience, and has been more recently a 
partner in a large firm in the Virgin Islands 
and he is used to dealing with you know, 
engagement of attorneys and fee applications 
and knows how they are submitted under the 
Virgin Islands Court rules and we submit that 
he would be of assistance to the Court to 
prepare reports for the Court's 
consideration, you know, to review the fees, 
all the entries, the rates, and make a 
recommendation to Your Honor that may assist 
in moving these fee applications along so the 
Court can't be bogged down with that. 
We 
know there are many more other complicated 
issues that this Court is going to have to 
deal with and that are being presented in this 
estate and we think that it would be of great 
assistance to the more routine fee 
applications to have assistance .
. 
We filed our application 
pursuant to Virgin Islands Rules of Civil 
Procedure 53 which we believe the probate 
rules allow to look to the Rules of Civil 
Procedure when there's no rule on point in the 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
probate rules. 
Rule 53 lays out the 
requirements for the appointment of a Master. 
In particular, Rule 53 authorizes the 
appointment of a Master to address pretrial 
and posttrial matters that cannot be 
effectively and timely addressed by an 
available Judge or Magistrate Judge. 
Your Honor, we believe that 
this would help address this aspect of the 
case and move the fee applications along, some 
of which have been pending for sometime now. 
Particularly the Troutman Sanders fee 
application. There are two now pending with a 
third on its way. 
THE COURT: Let me ask you this, 
Attorney Kroblin. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes. 
THE COURT: 
What fee application 
comes before this Court? 
Which are the ones 
that have been presented to this Court sitting 
in probate? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: I believe any--
the Court's order, when the initial order was 
entered, required that all estate attorney 
fees be approved by this Court. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
THE COURT: Estate attorney fees? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: A-hem. 
THE COURT: 
Estate attorneys. 
Who are the estate attorneys? 
What law firm 
is the estate attorney? 
ATTORNEY KROBLI N: Well, Your 
Honor, my law firm, of course, is representing 
the estate and the administration of the 
estate but with regard to the lawsuits filed 
in New York, the co-executors have been sued 
on behalf of the estate, essentially. They 
have been sued in a number of lawsuits and 
those co-executors have gone out and retained 
Counsel to represent them in the lawsuit, to 
represent the es ate in the lawsuit , and so we 
believe that those attorneys require approval 
of this Court to be paid. If they do not, then 
we've resol ved an issue, Your Honor, but if 
they do and in an abundance of caution, we've 
asked, you know, for approval from Your Honor 
to not be in violation of the order. 
THE COURT: All right. Thank you, 
Sir. I s there anyone wishing to be heard on 
the appointment of the Master? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor . 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
THE COURT: You know what. Also, 
I looked for the appointment of the Master to 
also assist in the settlement of claims, but 
wouldn't that be addressed under that 
Voluntary Claims Program? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN : Yes, Your Honor, 
we fi l ed the motion for the Master prior to 
filing the motion for that so we were unsure 
how things would necessarily shake out, if you 
will --
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: - - i n the 
Voluntary Cl aims Progr am, our mot i on, so we 
submit that if we do have a Master appointed, 
you know, it coul d possibly come into p l ay at 
some poi nt. 
It woul d be useful in assisting 
with that in some manner, but I think it woul d 
epend on how the Court considers to use the 
claims program and how it is actually 
structured and put together in the end. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
Thank you, Sir . 
Attorney Srni th. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes. 
THE COURT: Just again, identify 
yourself . 

Probat e ST- 19- PB-0080 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, I would, Your 
Honor. 
Ariel Smith again on behalf of the 
Government of the Virgin Islands. 
First of all, Your Honor, we 
have the utmost confidence in your ability to 
handle this probate estate. 
THE COURT: I'm glad you do. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: The utmost. 
You 
have had several years working in probate and 
you're excellent in that particular area of 
law so we would object just on those grounds. 
Notwithstanding that, we have 
some additional concerns. One, it appears that 
the estate is seeking to use the decedent's 
estate to pay expenses that-- let me rephrase 
this . 
The Court is correct that the 
Court would evaluate fee a plications relating 
to estate attorneys' expenses. The expenses 
that they are seeking to have paid are 
relating to lawsuits which are not necessaril y 
expenses that are in the ordinary course of 
the business or expenses that are directly 
related to the running and the preservation of 
the estate. 

Probat e ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
So I think the proper course 
of action should have been when the lawsuits 
are filed, the Court needs to be immediately 
informed as to what is going on, a proper 
motion be brought before the Court and then 
they ask for the ability to retain Counsel as 
opposed to retaining Counsel and -saying, Your 
Honor, we need to pay these fees. 
We're concerned about those 
types of actions without the Court's 
authority-- the CourtJs permission being 
sought that would ultimately dissipate the 
estate prematurely without this Court having 
full knowledge of exactly what's going on. 
THE COURT: But wouldn't the 
Court 
have knowledge because the executors 
are required to file quarterly accountings. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, first 
of all, 
the executors have not even filed an 
inventory so at this point, as we sit here 
this morning, this Court nor the executors 
based on the first quarterly accounting, know 
exactly what the assets are within this 
estate. 
THE COURT: 
And if I understand 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
it, they didn't file the inventory because 
they were waiting for the appointment of the 
appraisers; they believed the apprai sal was 
necessary. 
We do have the first quarterly 
accounting. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, Your 
Honor, if you look at what they provided as 
the firs t quarterly accounting, therers a 
number of assets which they indicate to be 
undeterminable that are right after the 
statement that there's no r eal property and 
then there's a number. 
THE COURT: Determined by 
appraisal . 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Right, but those 
are assets that are rel ated to personal 
property; meaning, watches, jewelry-- not the 
real estate that t hey were suggesting as part 
of their earlier motion. 
So it's a different 
evaluation that needs to be done to fu l ly have 
the Court understand what this estate consist 
of. 
So we believe that the first quarterly 
accounting is premature and not complete. 
There are a number of issues with i t that we 
can ta l k about when the Court gets to that 

F~obate ST-19-PB-0080 
motion. 
I don't want to be premature with 
that but as far as a Special Master, we don't 
think it's necessary and we think that we have 
to be careful in this estate in having the 
executors make decisions about expending 
estate assets without previously seeking 
permission by the Court and it's also clear in 
the quarterly accounting that they have 
already begun to do so. 
THE COURT: 
Well, under the 
terms of the Last Will and Testament of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein dated August 8 of 2019 
which was admitted into court at Paragraph C 
(1), "the testator specifically authorize his 
executors to appoint agents, attorneys of law, 
consultants, investment advisors and to pay 
for such services from the assets of my estate 
without obtaining judicial authorization or 
approval". The testator specifically provided 
for that. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor--
THE COURT: Let me continue. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: When the Court issued 
the order, the Court's order, which is a 

Probate ST-1 9-PB- 00 80 
standing or er issued in eve 
estate provided 
that attorney fees -hould not be paid--and 
this was an order dated September 6 of 2019 
--it provided that the co-executors shall not 
pay from decedent's estate any attorneys fees 
or co-executors fees for services rendered to 
the estate without prior approval of this 
Court. It contemplates Virgin Islands Rule of 
Probate Procedure, Rule 18, that provides in 
part, Simultaneously with the filing of the 
final account, an administrator, executor or 
attorney shall make application to the Court 
for an award of fees and costs where 
appropriate for services performed in the 
execution or administration of an estate. 
The fee petition shall clearly 
state the hourly rate for fees charged for 
services rendered, an explanation of the 
services provided and specific dates and time 
spent performing such service identified in 
the petition. 
The Probate Court reviews the 
fees and expenses of probate counsel, estate 
counsel because that is the work that is 
before this Court-- whether in filings to the 

Pr obate ST-19-PB-0080 
Court, appearances before the Court, so the 
Court can then make a determination whether 
the fees sought, and the time expended was 
reasonable given the nature of the estate. 
This Court does not review as 
the co-executor who had the fiduciary duty to 
represent the estate and preserve and protect 
its assets, the Court does not then, when an 
executor has to hire a counsel for a civil 
proceeding, a counsel to represent the estate, 
say with the bank and a mortgage proposal, 
then say you have to now come in for me to 
review those fees because I don't have that 
work before me to determine if it's 
reasonable. It's estate counsel the Court 
reviews the fee application of and that has 
been the practice of this Court, of the 
Probate Division. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I understand 
that, Your Honor. This particular case also 
presents a unique circumstance in that on 
January 17th, based on the filing of a CICO 
action there was notice given to the Probate 
Court with regard to the Government's lien in 
an effort to preserve the assets of the estate 

Probate ST- 19- PB-0080 
based on the pending CICO litigation. 
So I 
think that particular event --
THE COURT: Okay. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: --changed, to 
some extent, the Court's oversight over this 
estate. 
THE COURT: And I agree and that 
is something we are going to have to flesh out 
if this hearing continues this morning--what 
now happens when now the Government having 
filed that 
lien, but to address that lien, 
correct, and to address whatever civil 
proceeding the Government is going to file, 
would not the co-executors have to retain 
counsel? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, the 
co-executors have been served and counsel for 
that proceeding has not made an appearance. 
So to that end, we can address it when the 
need arises. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
I'm going to 
pick up the attorneys fees in this matter. I'm 
going to go to that now . And I have right now 
concerning the appointment of a Master and I 
understand what is set forth, I'm going to 

Probate ST-19-eB-OOBO 
deny the appointment of the Master without 
prejudice. This Court, while there maybe quite 
a number of filings; it may be a different 
type of probate proceedings, I still see it as 
a probate where persons have to, the 
co-executors are going out to defend the 
estate but as a probate, filing the quarterly 
accountings, filing the inventory, keeping the 
Court apprised as to what's going on. 
The 
Court is not going to intervene in what may be 
happening in New York. I have no authority to 
do that. The report would be mailed back to me 
that these matters have been settled. 
Should we go and set up the 
voluntary resolution program, it would be 
settled from there. 
The co-executors have 
started to convert assets because they have 
the authority of law to do that. 
I see in 
the quarterly accountings notations that 
properties,vehicles may have been sold and 
converted to cash; am I correct? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Right. 
THE COURT: As the co-executors, 
they have the authority by statute and by the 
decedent's Last Will and Testament to do that 

Pr obate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
and all they are doing is keeping the Court 
aware of where the assets are, how they are 
being used. 
4-
So the ruling on the Master is 
denied without prejudice at this point in the 
proceedings. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you, 
Your Honor. 
If I may just for my client's 
sake just so to make sure that I understand 
the ruling of the Court because the Order did 
say, "the co-executors shall not pay from 
decedent's estate any attorneys' fees and 
co-executor's fees for services rendered to 
the estate without prior approval of the 
Court." 
Is it my understanding that we 
know that only applies to the firm 
representing the estate and these proceedings 
have not --
THE COURT: That have always 
been my understanding as a Practitioner in 
Probate when I practiced probate law and the 
time that I'm sitting on the bench because the 
Court cannot--I would tie your hands if each 
and every time you had to come before me to 

Frobate ST- 19-PB-0080 
ask, can this be done? 
You set forth here in 
the motion for approval for Trotman and 
Saun ers. 
Honor. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your 
THE COURT: I believe he was 
retained during the decedent's lifetime. 
If I 
understand the reading, the co-executors are 
seeing to pa y for ser i 
t 
t were 
e 
re 
to the decedent; am I correct? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: No, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: I'm sorry. 
THE COURT: Okay. Let me hear it. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: We did do that, 
Your Honor. 
We did make payments for services 
rendered during his lifetime. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: The only thing 
we've sought the Court's approval for is after 
he died the services that were then retained 
by the co-executors to represent the estate. 
THE COURT: But for matters when he 
was alive, he was facing, there was a 
federal--

Probate ST-19-PB-008 0 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Uhmm--well, 
there was a--
THE COURT: Listen here. 
Don't 
say no. Let me get it. United States versus 
Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Criminal 490 Southern 
District of New York. This is the motion for 
approval of payment of Steptoe and Johnson, 
LLP, an Incorporated Memorandum of Law. 
During his lifetime he retained the law firm 
to provide necessary legal representation. 
Upon decedent's death, the Federal criminal 
case proceeded until August 29th at 2019 and 
Steptoe's representation discontinued shortly 
thereafter. 
So then I have a fee affidavit 
for that, correct? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: So the decedent had 
retained him in his lifetime to represent him. 
He died. They continued representation. 
Now 
they're seeking to be paid; am I correct as to 
that? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: 
They're 
seeking to be paid only for the post-death 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
fees incurred. The pre-death fees, the 
executors went ahead and paid. 
THE COURT: Right, but now for what 
they did to bring this matter to conclusion, 
correct? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Correct, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: I do not see that the 
Probate Court--this is not the kind of fees 
I'm reading that the Probate Court i s said 
needed to come before the Probate Court for 
approval. 
So as it per~ains to the 
motion for appr oval of Steptoe and Johnson, 
Trotman and Saunders--and again, Trotman and 
Saunders, then it was renewed with additional 
fees, and it is my understanding that Trotman 
Saunders, LLP, is representing the estate in 
New York for these numerous cases that have 
been filed by the alleged victims of sexual 
assault, corr ect. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Correct, Your 
Honor. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, if I 
may just for clarification, I am not sure how 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
the legal fees requested by these firms are 
any different than creditors claim. 
42. 
THE COURT: You know how they are 
different? 
I'm going to tell you. 
They are 
different pursuant to Title 15, Virgin Islands 
Code, Section 568, "an executor or 
administrator shall be allowed in the 
settlement of his account all necessary 
expenses incurred in the care, management and 
settlement of the estate, including reasonable 
attorneys fees and any necessary litigation or 
matter requiring legal advice or Counsel. 
When we appoint executors or any 
person of fiduciary capacity, we want to make 
sure that this person can complete his or her 
fiduciary responsibilities to the Court~ 
The 
person is given all rights to go and retain 
Counsel because the Court says he is taking an 
oath to protect the assets of the estate. 
The fiduciary, the co-executor 
goes out and retains Counsel to litigate, to 
represent the estate - whether it's in an 
automobile accident case, whether it's in a 
mortgage foreclosure - wherever the estate is 
now being sued, and the Court says by statute, 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
Virgin Islands law says the Legislature has 
determined that executor is allowed the 
attorney fees in the necessary litigation and 
where he needed the legal advice of Counsel. 
Legal advice of Counsel was 
needed, is needed in these ongoing matters 
pending in New York. The executors, the 
co-executors have retained Counsel to 
represent the estate. 
I'm going to assume the 
co- executors is going to retain Counsel to 
represent the estate in the action the 
Government is going to file against them. 
What the probate Court reviews 
is the expenses of probate administration, 
part of which includes, whether it's paid to 
estate counsel - in this instance, the firm of 
Kellerhauls, right? 
Before me I have a motion for 
approval of Kellerhauls, Ferguson, Kroblin, 
PLLC, Interim payment application Number 1 in 
which they set out, which they are seeking 
fees where they provided to the estate in the 
administration of the probate estate from 
August 11, 2019 to October 31st of 2019. They 
are seeking for this Court to approve those 

Proba t e ST-1 9- PB- 00 8O 
fees. Those are the fees that this Court has 
before it where they are required to set out 
the date, time, and service provided. 
Now on review of these fees, 
which was provided to the Court by Order, they 
had to submi 
to the Court . 
Upon my review of 
these fees, I'm going to deny your motion for 
approval of these fees. Number 1, this Court 
does not enter interim orders for fees because 
then it requires the Court to be keeping an 
accounting system of what fees have been paid 
or not paid. 
This is three months. August 
11th to October 31st of 2019. 
Also, in your fee affidavit, 
Counsel is to provide date, time, service 
provided. When I opened what is termed a 
pre-bill, the bills are seriously redacted. 
I, as the Officer charged with reviewing this 
fee affidavit to determine if the fees are 
reasonable, cannot determine what services 
were provided by your law firm in the probate 
administration. 
Let's begin. September 23rd of 
2019, attention to--redacted. Reviewed--
redacted. 
What was reviewed? 
Legal research 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
and preparation of--redacted. 
Telephone 
conference with Co-Counsel reviewed--
redacted. There are numerous redactions. 
How 
do I know was this work necessary for the 
probate administration customary that the 
Court would find needed for probate? 
You 
don't provide the services provided. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: And Your 
Honor, we would be happy to submit an 
un-redacted version for in-camera review. The 
reason it was redacted is because we believe 
that it contained attorney-client privilege 
information that we didn't believe was 
appropriate to waive. 
So Your Honor, we submitted it 
in a redacted form and we were going to 
request what the Court wanted, once we got 
some guidance on how the Court wanted to 
proceed on fee applications, to submit an 
in-camera un-redacted version. 
THE COURT: Even if I wanted to 
approve this motion, I couldn't. I don't have 
information. I don't know what you did on 
behalf of the estate because it's struck out . 
How is it that I don't understand 

Proba.te ST-19- PB- 0080 
attorney-client privilege, research on probate 
procedures and you know what, that is your 
decision. 
You understand why I am not 
goi ng to approve this motion for interim fees 
a t this time by your law firm. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Your Honor, if 
I may, I understand the Court's ruling and I 
think we filed a motion for reconsideration on 
the interim payment of fees. We believe i t has 
been done in the past in states we've 
represented. 
THE COURT: I'm not saying it has 
not been done. 
I said this Court does not 
enter interim fee orders. Thi s Court does not 
enter interim fee orders. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Okay, Your 
Honor. We respectful l y will request to file a 
motion brief consideration on that ruling, but 
I understand your ruling. 
THE COURT: You can do that. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you. 
THE COURT: And I'm going to tell 
you, doing this cursive review, I picked up 
one page, November 14 of 2019, I see one 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
attorney, 17 hours in one day. Right. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: 
Yes, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: You understand that 
is the kind of-- now, that is what comes 
before me and I can sit down and say I see 
this probate file. I know what's required to 
be filed and done in a probate. 
I have seen 
the attorneys, and that is why it is the 
probate fees that are reviewed by this Court 
and I can l ook and say, well, what could an 
attorney have done for 17 hours - just one 
day, one attorney--this is August 16 of 2019 
--for 17 hours? 
That's why the Court reviews 
the probate fees or the fees generated for 
probate admini stration. So this motion for 
approval for Kellerhauls is denied without 
prejudice at this point in time. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you. 
ATTORNEY SMI TH: Your Honor, one 
of the concerns that we have with regard to 
preserving the estate assets is the same 
concern that the Court just raised. I 
understand the Court's position pursuant to 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
your reading of Virgin Islands law as to the 
attorney fees outside of the probate petition 
or the probate estate that would not require 
consideration by this Court but to the extent 
that even in this initial accounting, there 
are literally no vouchers, nothing to 
support --
THE COURT: 
And I will bring 
that up. 
I will bring that up when we get 
there. 
I know they filed the quarterly 
accounting --and I have a note that the 
quarterly accounting is deficient. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Significantly 
so, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
And when 
co-executors file deficient quarterly 
accountings or are not doing their accounting 
work as the Court 
requires, the Court has a 
process in which the Court can remove the 
co-executors or in some way impose a penalty 
on the co-executors. The testator in his will 
provided for these co-executors to be paid 
executors fees. If the Court were to find the 
co-executors dilatory in their duties, the 
Court could reduce those fees or not award any 

Proba te ST-19-PB-0080 
fees. 
So there are ways the Court can 
deal with co-executors or administrators who 
the Court does not believe is completing or 
fulfilling their fiduciary duties, but we are 
not at that point as yet. 
Concerning the motions for 
Trotman Saun ers and Steptoe Johnson , 
he 
Court does not believe it needs to approve 
those fees. Those attorneys are being hired to 
represent the estate in the civil proceedings. 
These matters are not before the Court. The 
co-executors have been charged with their 
fiduciary duties to preserve and protect the 
estate and that means taking on litigation, 
determining if they need to hire Counsel. 
The only Counsel this Court 
reviews the application of is probate Counsel 
and then in your quarterly accounting 
everything w·11 be set forth as to what is 
being expended. Persons can raise objections. 
Okay. Have we dealt with the fee Ap? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Understood. 
THE COURT: Okay. Now what's left 
before the Court--well, you know what? 
Let's 

Probat e ST- 19-PB-0080 
deal with the quarterly accounting that was 
filed because then based again on how I put 
things in categories, the last category 
remaining will be this claims program, right? 
Concerning the first quarterly 
accounting that was fi l ed with the Court on 
August 31st of 2020, Counsel, again, as the 
Government have pointed out, the items l isted, 
the need to be determined--it says, determine 
by appraisal and this first quarterly 
accounting covers August 10th of 2019 to 
December 31st of 2019. Right? It's signed by 
the co-executors. 
This 1s the problem I had when 
I reviewed it. 
Again, heavily redacted as to 
the bank statements. Then you have copies of 
checks I can't even read. 
Attorney Blum, do you see the 
First Bank, Voucher 1, First Bank. 
Attached 
is a check redacted as to who received 
$16,000. The text is so small, I cannot read 
them. And pursuant to Rule 5, each expenditure 
is to be supported by proper documentation. 
For example, we have the funeral expenses, 
correct? 

Probate ST- 19- PB-0080 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Correct. 
THE COURT: Let me get there. 
Funeral expenses I guess this is to the home, 
16,308, it doesn't say what entity. 
Usually 
you would have then the supporting invoice. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Your Honor, to the 
extent that the vouchers are insufficient, we 
will be happy to re-submit. 
THE COURT: Right. The 
expenditures, specifically by that Rule 15, 
provides every expenditure or other 
disposition of assets must be supported by 
proper documentation. So, right, Co-Executors 
might have issued a check and then I see the 
check redacted as to who the check may have 
been made payable to you and no supporting 
documentation as to why the checks are issued. 
That is j ust one example. 
It's very hard for 
the Court then to determine if these are 
probate related or justi fiable expenditures by 
the estate. 
And I think that is the 
Government's objection, the objection the 
Government has. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Your Honor, we 
believe when we prepared the vouchers that the 

Probate ST-19-eB-0080 
bank statements would be sufficient. 
Obviously , the cancel .... d check are difficult 
o 
read and probably --
THE COURT: Okay, you agree with 
me. I thought it was just me. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: No, it's 
difficult for me as well but we'd ask that we 
do need to redact account numbers which I 
assume is not an issue for the Court so long 
as it provides proper--
THE COURT: Well, you know what--
ATTORNEY BLUM: --detail as--
THE COURT: I'm going tell you this 
about--
ATTORNEY BLUM: --to the payees. 
THE COURT: Sorry, not to 
over-speak you. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: 
It's all right. 
THE COURT: At some point you are 
going to need to provide those account numbers 
because of the final adjudication. 
That is 
what we are adjudicatin , if these accounts 
are still in existence. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: We will do so to 
that extent, at the end. 

fine. 
Probate ST-1 9- PB- 0080 
THE COURT: To the end, t hat's 
ATTORNEY BLUM: We are just 
concerned about security with respect to this 
particular decedent. 
THE COURT: That's fine. 
I mean 
the only payee I can read here is the 
Government of the Virgin Isl ands on these 
checks. 
That is the only payee I can see 
there. I can follow the electronic fund 
transfers, say, I guess, to Verizon, ADT, and 
I guess may be just saying there's ongoing 
with Verizon, whatever is needed for that, but 
some of these others, I can't even see the 
amount. 
So as far as this Court's 
quarterly accounting, when would you be able 
to provide an appraisal as to the personal 
property listed? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: We are still in 
the 
process, Your Honor, of hiring 
appraisers. There are a lot of very valuable 
assets in this estate and personal property 
that was owned by the decedent or his 
companies. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
Based on Your Honor's ruling 
earlier, we will re-evaluate to the extent to 
which any of the personal property may have 
been owned by an entity, but to the extent 
that they were owned by the decedent, we are 
dealing with some valuable antiques and 
valuable jewelry and a lot of assets in a lot 
of places that we have located, but we still 
are having to employ appropriate appraisers to 
take care of that. We are in the process and 
we will continue to do so. 
THE COURT: Attorney Smith. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 
Ariel Smith on behalf of the Government of the 
Virgin Islands. In addition to the concerns 
that have been previously raised with regard 
to the lack of vouchers supporting the checks, 
I'd like to draw the Court's attention to, in 
particular, the page that states--let me see 
if I can get it correct here--Your Honor, it 
says, statement of decreases 
due to sales, 
liquidation and payment of expenses. 
THE COURT: What page? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It would be --
when you look for the one that says Schedule 

?roba t e ST-19- PB-0080 
D, it purports to be, I guess an indication of 
expenses. 
After you go to Schedule D, you go 
to the third page in. The pages are not 
numbered so it's difficult for us. 
THE COURT: Yes, it's very 
difficult. 
Guide me again. 
Attorney Blum, are you there? 
I have the Certificate of 
Service. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: The 
Schedule C which is a statement of income 
collected. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
The next 
page after that was to be Schedule D. 
THE COURT: 
Statement of 
decreases due to sales, liquidation and 
payment of expenses. Okay. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: If you go to the 
third page in of that, so that first page is 
Schedule D and the second page and then you 
get to the third page. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: And this, of 
course, Your Honor, we have not had an 
opportunity since we literally received this 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
by mail yesterday afternoon at 5 0' clock when 
the other parties who are apart of the case 
received theirs by email earlier that day, so 
we did not even get the courtesy of a hand 
delivery or an e-mail, but notwithstanding 
that, in looking at that, you see two expenses 
- one for twelve million dollars to Southern 
Country International Limited; another one for 
3.5 million to Southern Country International 
Limited. 
From what I understand, these are 
not attorneys so I'm not sure why they would 
be getting checks that total fifteen million 
five hundred dollars. 
There's no explanation for it 
with regard to Schedule F which is a couple of 
pages later and again, Your Honor, this is 
just a very quick review, we see there's a 
statement of creditors claims that they say 
have been presented, allowed and paid. 
Now deferring to the Court's 
interpretation of 15 VIC 560 that relates to 
attorneys fees I would want to know what would 
be the authority for the executors to pay what 
they have even classified as creditors claims 
without the authority of this Court. 

Claims--
Probate ST-19-FB-0080 
THE COURT: The V.I. Statute. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, I 
understand that--
THE COURT: You asked a question. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Right. 
THE COURT: Claims presented to 
the executors are examined and if approved are 
paid by the co-executor. 
If rejected, then 
they come before the Court. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your 
Honor,but I see three of these, 
a number of 
these claims are debt claims but there is a 
specific claim which is to the Epstein Virgin 
Islands Foundation 
doing business as Enhanced 
Education, where is the invoice or whatever to 
support that? 
THE COURT: That is why I think I 
just talked to Attorney Blum and he indicated 
that he will provide the documentation. Just 
like you, I got this first quarterly 
accounting yesterday. Just like you, I picked 
it up and said, it does not provide the 
information necessary for the Court to 
determine if these expenditures are proper 

PrQbate ST- 19- PB- 0080 
expenditures. 
I told Attorney Blum the rules 
require the documentation to be attached. So 
now he knows. 
He has to amend, this first 
quarterly accounting needs to be amended to 
provide the documentation to explain what has 
been paid. 
And that is all I can do at this 
point. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I understand 
that, Your Honor. 
I am just concerned about 
what woul d appear to be a course of conduct. 
That's all I would just say t o that matter. 
THE COURT: Okay and now you are 
going to be copied on all the quarterly 
accounti ngs. The Government has now fi l ed its 
Cr iminal Activity Lien Noti ce, I believe, on 
t he estate. 
So the estate now knows this 
affects everything going forward. 
Attorney 
Bl um. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Just to 
re-conf irm, Your Honor , we will amend the 
accounting and to the extent that there are 
issues, what we would suggest t o t he Court is 
that we could have a separate hearing with 
respect to approval of the accounting if i t 's 

Pr obate ST-19-PS- 0080 
necessary. 
THE COURT: 
Well, the accounting 
is not approved as yet. 
You just continue to 
submit your accounting but you need to have--
Attorney Smith is correct, twelve million 
dollars. 
I rnean-- you know what? 
Given the 
size of this estate maybe that's not 
significant. It's still twelve million 
dollars to Southern Country International 
Limited with no information. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And the short 
explanation, Your Honor, is there was a 
mistake in deposit that was made and this was 
the reimbursement of that. 
THE COURT: Reimbursement? 
So 
this money came back? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: It came back, 
yes. I mean, you can see --
THE COURT: Where? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Right in the same 
spot you were looking at. 
THE COURT: 
A check? You know 
what? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Two point six came 
in and 11 came in, and 12 came out and -- -

Probate ST- 19-?B-0080 
THE COURT: You are right and then 
it became, it's less. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Yes and that was 
one point eight. 
THE COURT: 
But you see 
ATTORNEY BLUM: You need more 
information, Your Honor. 
We understand. 
THE COURT: 
If the documents were 
attached, it would have explained it. 
You 
are right, following this, it went in and came 
back . 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Right. 
It was 
because of a mistake as to where the monies 
went and that is why it was corrected. 
Your 
Honor, we'll provide that detail with the 
amended quarterly accountings. 
THE COURT: Because it's required. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Of course. 
THE COURT: It is required. 
By the 
probate rules, it's required. 
Anything else concerning the 
quarterly accounting and all quarterly 
accountings going forward. 
ATTORNEY SMITH~ Your Honor, I 
would just ask -- Ariel Smith, Government of 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
the Virgin Islands. I would just ask that we 
be able to brief the issues as they come up 
because, again, we have not had a real 
opportunity to do more than a cursory review 
of it and we'd like to be able to do that so 
any concerns that we have with regard to the 
first accounting which the Court has not 
approved, we'd like an opportunity --
THE COURT: We don't approve the 
accounting. The attorney has said he is going 
to--and you raised concern -- he is going to 
amend his quarterly accounting. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, could 
you inquire as to when we would be able to 
expect that? 
THE COURT: He is going to amend 
his quarterly accounting and timely file it as 
he is required to file quarterly accountings 
every three months. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, no. I 
understand that, Your Honor, but to the extent 
that the first accounting had some issues, is 
it going to be amended in a short period of 
time before the second accounting or is it 
going to be simply amended in the second 

Probate S'l'-19-PB-0080 
accounting? 
I think we would want to have 
some clarification on that. 
THE COURT: Attorney Blum. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Well, the latest 
would be by the second quarterly accounting. 
THE COURT: 
That's what I'm 
saying, quarterly accountings from the date of 
the appointment every three months thereafter. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: 
Well, to keep it 
straight, we'll amend this one and file the 
next one and if we can file the amended 
version of this sooner than the second one, we 
shall. 
THE COURT: 
You know, Attorney 
Smith. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Probate may be 
different than other matters that you have 
bee 
involved with. 
Okay . You have ogive 
the time for the co-executors to gather the 
information to attach it. Now through Counsel, 
the co-executors are aware of what's required. 
If they were not aware before, they are now 
aware of how to file a quarterly accounting 
and what documentations need to be attached. 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
Right. Rule 15. 
And the consequences of failing 
to file your quarterly accountings as set out 
in Rule 16, in which I explained, they can be 
brought before the Court on a show cause, 
Attorney Smith, and you can move for this 
Court to cause them to come before the Court 
to show cause if any, why they should not be 
punished for contempt of Court. That is always 
an option. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Thank you, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right. The 
claims that have been filed, the Voluntary 
Claims Resoluti on Program and the Criminal 
Activity Lien notice filed by the Government. 
Attorney Blum. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: I would like to 
call on attorney Andrew Tomback to address the 
Court 
and present testimony with respect to 
the Voluntary Claims Program, if it please 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
But, you know what? 
I don't mean --and I see Attorney Smith, I 
understand that Voluntary Claims Resolution 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
Program is what i s being proposed by the 
estate to address these claims that are going 
to be filed in multiple jurisdictions, 
numerous of them pending in New York, right? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Correct. Most of 
them. 
THE COURT: Most of them in New 
York. 
There's also in Florida. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And Minnesota. 
'10 
THE COURT: And Minnesota, right. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And we expect more. 
THE COURT: And we expect more. 
Let me summarize it --and 
everyone listen and if anybody has an 
objection to what I am going to say, then you 
can raise it . 
How I read, 
all the persons who 
have filed claims through Counsel present here 
in this courtroom, they have, the claimants 
have no objection t o the Voluntary Claims 
Resolution Program. Their concern is how much 
money is to be expended to set up this 
program. 
I think it was Attorney Benham--
is he still here? Do you see him in the 

Probate ST-19-ea-ooeo 
courtroom-- who raised those concerns and said 
what are you going to do with the expenditures 
for rents , paying salaries, just the cost of 
setting it up. 
That was his concern, am I 
correct, Attorney Benham? 
ATTORNEY BENHAM: Yes,Your Honor. 
Can I approach? 
THE COURT: Yes. 
Well, you know 
what, cause I'm just doing a summary and I 
just wanted you to confirm and then I can let 
you approach to supplement. 
Who opposed the claims program 
is the Government. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Right. 
THE COURT: Because the 
Government, Attorney Smith, listen and see if 
I'm correct-- because the People have filed 
this Criminal Activity Lien Notice, and this 
lien notice is against the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein ; Jeffrey Epstein; the 1953 Trust; 
Plan D, LLC; Great St. James, LLC; Nautilus, 
Inc. ; Hyperion Air, LLC; and Poplar, Inc . 
And reading what's under the 
Statute, the Statute provides that on the 
filing of this lien, this is Title 14, Virgin 

Proba t e ST-19-PB- 0080 
Islands Code, Section 610 "This lien shall 
commence and attach as of the time of the 
filing with the Criminal Activity Lien Notice 
and shall continue thereafter until 
S 
expiration, termination or release. The lien 
created in favor of the Government of the 
territory of the Virgin Islands shall be 
superior to and prior to the interest of any 
other persons in the personal or real property 
or beneficial interest in, if the interest is 
acquired subsequent to the filing of the 
notice. " 
So that all being said, with The 
People having filed their Criminal Activity 
Lien, hasn't it put everything on hold? 
.16 
ATTORNEY BLUM: It should not, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Tell me why not. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: The reason is that 
the probate code itself, which is not 
addressed in the Government's papers, state 
very clearly --and I can find the cite for you 
if you need it --
THE COURT: Yes. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: --that the 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
administration expenses of the estate have 
priority, virtually priority over everything 
else the estate needs to be administered. 
The 
problem that the executors will have is these 
liens are in fact defective which we believe 
they should not be and we will be asking Your 
Honor to either dismiss them or we will do so 
before Judge Dunston in the other matter under 
which they've filed the Complaint. 
With out that, we question 
whether we can expend anything. We believe 
that that is not correct under Virgin Islands 
probate Code and that it is Your Honor who 
controls in every respect the co-executors 
actions with respect to what they expend and 
what they don't expend and what they can not 
expend and that is the point that we will make 
in papers when we file them with respect to 
those liens. 
THE COURT: Because now there's a 
question because I have here--
I know you're 
pointing to Title 15, Virgin Islands Code, 
Section 421, preference in payments of claims 
and charges. Is that what you are talking 
about? 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
ATTORNEY BLUM: That is correct. 
· 2 
THE COURT: In administration, 
funeral charges, taxes, expenses, debts 
preferred by law, debts which is the debt of 
the deceased were a lien upon his property of 
any rights or interest,debts to employees, all 
other claim against the estate. 
Where would this lien, this 
Criminal Activity Lien fall, because they, by 
the statute, 14 VIC 610, if I'm reading it, 
everything has been locked down. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: That was our first 
reading as well, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And ' that is our 
concern with respect to that. 
THE COURT: 
Except may be for the 
basic administration of the estate but as far 
as it goes to settling claims because if that 
is-- okay, the estate can continue to 
function. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Thank you. 
THE COURT: 
I have no problems 
with that. If the estate has to pay 
taxes--Attorney Smith, the estate has to pay 

Pl:Ob a te s ·r -1 9-PB-0 080 
taxes, it pays its taxes, right? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
employees. 
THE COURT: 
If the estate has to--
ATTORNEY SMITH: Pay its 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
Pay its 
employees; if the estate has to pay its 
attorneys, other than estate Counsel, because 
the estate now has attorneys who have to come 
in and represent him in this matter --Now, 
this civil--
I know --
ATTORNEY SMITH: I'm not happy 
about that. 
THE COURT: 
I know you a r e not 
happy with that civil forfeiture matter-- but 
what i t seems to me that the estate cannot do, 
the estate cannot pay claims, cannot pay these 
claims that have been filed by the persons 
that may be coming out of New York-- whether 
they get a judgment out of New York or whether 
they come in to this Claims Resolution 
Program-- that is how I'm reading that, that 
by this the Government has said, stop because 
and I read that in part of your f iling because 
II 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
the Government is concerned that you could 
then start this program, start entering 
settlements, paying out settlements and then 
when the Government comes, there's nothing at 
all. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: The program will be 
recommending settlement. It will be approving 
settlements that will be paid by the estate. 
They will need to be paid if, in fact, we 
adopt the program. The problem is that if we 
do not proceed to the program, it will tend to 
waste estate assets because, as Attorney 
Kroblin refered to earlier, we wil l now have 
to go much heavier into litigation that are 
already pending. We will need to expend 
additional expenses on attorneys fees and 
other expenses relating to those litigations 
especially with respect to discovery since 
there's at least 22 of them that will be a 
0 
very large amount. 
Since at least the claimants who 
have spoken up, appear to be in favor of the 
program, that is why we would like to get the 
program approved quickly, as soon as Your 
Honor is prepared to do so. 
And then we still 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
have to deal with the liens. That is a 
separate issue . 
I t might prevent the actual 
payment but if we can promptly deal with the 
liens even after we have started the program, 
that would be to the estate's advantage 
because we would not have this additional 
litigation expense, and once we get to the 
point of actually having to pay out the 
settlements via the program or otherwise, 
other settlements, that would be the way we 
think that we should be proceeding. 
THE COURT: 
You see, Attorney 
Blum, how you described it, that was my 
thought process. 
That if you have the 
settlement resolution program quickly, I mean 
fairly quickly dealt with, because if not, if 
you don't use that 
program, then what you 
have is these multiple lawsuits proceeding, 
attorneys being retained to represent the 
estate in these actions and judgments being 
entered but you have no control of and the 
judgment will have to be paid whether it's a 
settlement through this program or a judgment. 
But my question is right now by 
what The People have filed and you said that 

Probat e ST-19-eB-0080 
was your initial reading of it, what has 
changed? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: My initial concern, 
I'm concerned--
THE COURT: Well, that is my 
concern too. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: 
--that this Court 
and the Government feel that we shouldn't be 
spending anything on virtually anything. 
You 
have already confirmed that we can administer 
the estate for which we appreciate that, but 
part of the administration of the estate is 
also dealing with these claims. 
THE COURT: Yes, I know but now 
these claims are going to be paid from where? 
ATTORNEY BLUM: They are going to 
be paid from estate assets, no doubt. 
THE COURT: 
And The People have 
just put a lien and the lien provides that 
nothing could be paid out of those assets. 
I can understand that you need 
to do it today and I think Attorney Smith 
understand that but their concern is that you 
cannot pay claims and you cannot set up this 
program. 

P~obate ST-19-PB-008O 
Attorney Smith, then what would 
you have the estate do? 
Then the estate is 
going to go into New York and Minnesota and 
Florida and wherever else and having to retain 
Counsel for all these lawsuits. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: And Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: These claimants 
will be denied timely compensation which is 
one of the things that the co- executors very 
much wish to avoid. We wish to compensate them 
promptly. They were interested in having this 
program go forward and that is what we would 
like to do. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, 
first of all, the program and I mean-- let me 
go back. Let me go to the podium, Your Honor. 
Ariel Smith on behalf of the 
Government of the Virgin Islands. I think 
Virgin Islands law is clear as to what the 
Criminal Activity Lien is. I don't think from 
my estimation there's any dispute but beyond 
that, I think that there's a misunderstanding 
as to what the Government is saying. 
Besides the Criminal Activity 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
Lien Notice, we have stated an opposition to 
the plan as proposed and what we did in our 
opposition is we indicated the areas in which 
we have concerns about the plan as proposed. 
One of the areas that we were concerned with 
is that the plan as proposed, presumes to 
exonerate other people besides the estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Your Honor, we 
haven't had a chance to present our motions 
yet and she is providing all--
THE COURT: You know what? Yes. 
And I have no idea what you are speaking of. 
You know what? 
Attorney Smith, 
if I could, the estate was going to provide 
the Court with more information concerning 
this plan this morning. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay, and to 
that end, whatever is provided this morning, 
we have no information as to it and the 
information that was provided in the 
opposition we received yesterday, we have not 
had an opportunity to reply to it because we 
just saw it, so it might be premature. 
And finally--and this is the 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
last thing I'm going to say with regard to 
this until I'm called again -- but we believe 
that setting up this plan without the Court 
having a full inventory and a complete 
accounting that has vouchers and all the other 
deficiencies that were missing from this 
accounting would be premature. 
THE COURT: Okay. So let the 
Court say this: 
I'm not going to make any 
decision on this plan, whether creating this 
plan or it shouldn't be created or should be 
put in place this morning because I have no 
information as to the plan because in the 
submissions from the estate, they set forth, I 
think several times that full information will 
be brought to the Court this morning. 
I'm going to allow you then to 
pro ide tha 
informa ion . 
Then Im going 
o 
allow Counsel present to make their comments, 
arguments, for or against the plan but there 
is going to be no decision this morning 
because I do not have full information as to 
this plan. 
Then, I'm going to have to say 
if this Court were to structure, set up, allow 

P~oba t e ST-19-PB-0080 
--first of all, do I even need to be the one 
to allow the co-executors to establish the 
plan, moving estate assets, and if that's the 
way, I need to know how much estate assets are 
you going to move; how does that import with 
the Criminal Activity Lien Notice that the 
People have filed; is there anyway for me to 
get around it; can the two sides, with the 
People work that out and say so much can go 
into the plan? 
Yes, we don't want to affect 
claimants but we also have to know we have a 
claim; The People have filed their claim. 
And you know, for none of 
the claimants before this Court do I have 
numbers; right. 
There are no numbers so I 
can't even say set aside this amount. There 
are no numbers. Everything is, you know, 
speculation, a judgment, we're going into 
court but there are no numbers which is 
unusual because when claims come before the 
Court, a claim by the Statute, that is how we 
determine claims. It sets out the specific 
amounts. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: If we might at 
this time, I would like Attorney Tomback to 

Probat.e ST-19-E'B-00B·0 
provide the Court, via witnesses, with much of 
the information that you are inquiring about 
and that the Government is inquiring about and 
at the end of that presentation, then Your 
Honor can ask whatever questions. 
THE COURT: Testimony? Are you 
going to have written documents? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: That i s my 
concern al so. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: Yes. 
THE COURT: I thought it to be 
written documents with how much is going to be 
expended for rents, money - not testimony. 
ATTORNEY BLUM: It would be both, 
Your Honor. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, I 
think this is part of the Government's concern 
and this is Ariel Smith again for the record. 
The Estate needs to be 
forthright with the Court about every aspect 
of whatever i t is they are proposing even 
though again we maintain it's premature 
because if they haven't at this juncture 
they are making this plan proposal but they 
haven't even done the basics which is to give 

Probate ST-19-PB-0O80 
the Court an inventory and based on its 
motion, they have until March 2nd 
approximately, to provide this inventory so to 
even get into a plan without an inventory so 
the Court knows, essentially the lay of the 
land, is extremely premature and then to 
proposed the plan before the Court without 
any writings, without any opportunity to vet 
it properly, it's highly irregular. 
THE COURT: 
If I understand it, 
Attorney Tomback is going to provide the Court 
with how much he believes, how much the plan 
would cost. 
Am I correct? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
Andrew Tomback on behalf of the executors. 
I 
have been admitted pro hac vice. I know I can 
do this later but my oath is here if Your 
Honor wants it. 
THE COURT: Yes. Please file it 
in the proper way into the Court. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: It's our 
intent to have Your Honor's permission to call 
three witnesses. 
The first witness, Jordana 
Feldman, and they all will be supported by 
documents, documents which have been available 

Pr obate ST-19-PB-0080 
in the public domain, some of which have been 
filed by the Court and available to the 
Attorney General, that describes the program 
in great detail. 
·s 
The reason for the program; why 
it makes sense to the victims; why it makes 
sense, I think, for everybody in terms of the 
estate not to be litigating in various places 
and spending money on litigation. 
Quite frankly, I think that if 
the Attorney General hears from these 
witnesses, I can tell you about it in a 
moment, but if the Attorney General hears from 
these witnesses, I believe that we'll address 
every concern that the Attorney General has 
raised, including whether i n fact we can pick 
a particular number as a number of dollars 
that Your Honor at this time, Your Honor can 
say, okay, that is the right number because we 
don't have the whole number of victims and so 
forth, and I would defer, quite frankly I'm 
just a lawyer, but the people I'm going to 
call, Jordana Feldman who was the 
Administrator of the 911 fund has tremendous 
experience. This is the first witness we would 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
like to call with respect to that, Your Honor. 
The second witness is Ken 
Feinberg. Mr. Feinberg from the beginning of 
his career involving Agent Orange and working 
with the Judge in the United States to solve 
what seemed to be an intractable problem, has 
done plans like this more than any person 
alive - not just in the United States but 
anywhere. 
And then the third wi tness is my 
colleague, Mr. Weiner, who also represents the 
estate who would briefly testify regarding why 
the estate itself is going to be harmed (a) if 
the Attorney General lien, as you put it, 
makes everything grind to a halt, not only the 
victims or the alleged victims or the 
claimants - whatever you want to call them, 
but also the estate. 
I'd just like the opportunity to 
put them forward. I think it will clarify a 
great 
eal for Your Honor, the A torney 
General. 
I think in fairness to the people 
and the Court who don't have an opportunity to 
speak because they are not admitted to hear 
how we be l ieve this wil l help people who 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
alleged that they've been harmed, people who 
are claimants. 
THE COURT: But there is still 
the concern. 
If I understand it, the People 
are the only ones opposing the establishment 
of this program, right, as proposed but there 
is nothing proposed. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, 
we can bridge the enormous gap because the 
Attorney General's understanding and 
expression in our papers of what is proposed 
is not what is proposed and I think if we hear 
from the witnesses, we'll understand from the 
witnesses what is really proposed and I think 
the Attorney General can have every 
opportunity to cross examine them. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, but 
we are not prepared to do that today, Number 
1. 
THE COURT: 
You know, that is 
true. 
You told me, because I did not know 
that you were going to have all these people 
here. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: And so we are 
not prepared to do that today because we 

Proba t e ST-19-PB-0080 
haven't had an opportunity to vet this 
question, but more importantly, we still 
haven't found out from the executor what does 
this program cost. Do you have those numbers? 
That is the preliminary question. We can hear 
all about, you know, all the touchy-feeley, 
whatever. 
THE COURT: Okay, Attorney Smith. 
Let's hear from some of the other attorney 
representing. 
Attorney Benham, do you want to 
come forward or any other attorney wishing to 
speak in this matter? 
Just identify yourself. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: By the way, 
Your Honor, I just want to make one thing 
clear just so Your Honor understands. 
I think 
Your Honor knows this but we 1 re here now and I 
understand your concerns but speed is of the 
essence. 
I think that the victims or the 
claimant's counsel will speak to that. 
But we made our motion with 
respect to that, Your Honor, on November 14th. 
We then filed again on December 13th. The 
Attorney General i s late to the game, right, 
so she says she's not prepared but she wants 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
to stop us. 
THE COURT: But listen, you filed 
your motion to establish the program, right, 
without--
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: That is all we 
want to do now, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Yes, but you want me 
just carte blanche go and establish the 
program? 
You never gave the Court any 
numbers. We didn't know what numbers we were 
dealing with. We didn't have a quarterly 
accounting. We didn't have an inventory. 
That's part of the objections the People are 
making and now--
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your--
THE COURT: --let me finish--so 
don't tell me cause you told me when you filed 
your motion. I know when you filed your motion 
but I was not prepared to rule because there 
was no information for this Court to rule on 
that motion. 
So now if I understand it and 
then motions or filing to the Court during the 
course of the week said the Court will be 
given this information at the hearing. 
Well, 
I didn't know what kind of information you 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
were coming with at the hearing. 
Now you say 
you are coming with witnesses. My thing and I 
specifically said Attorney Benham made one of 
the most salient arguments --no objections to 
the plan but what is the cost of the plan. 
Everybody just want to know what you are going 
to do to set this up. And that is what I want 
to hear. 
Let me hear from other counsel, 
please, sir. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Sure. 
ATTORNEY FOSTER: Good morning, 
Your Honor. Sean Foster. 
Our firm represents 
probably two dozen of the victims - probably 
the majority of the victims that are going to 
be filing claims against the estate and we are 
absolutely in favor of this program. 
We think 
it's a great program that will provide redress 
to the victims without the need for protracted 
litigation and we feel that to derail that 
process at this stage would not be in the best 
interest of those victims. 
We don't disagree that more 
information is required and I think that 1 s why 
we are here today - to get more information so 
that we can move forward and support that 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
program for our clients. That is where we 
stand on that position, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Thank you, Attorney 
Foster. 
ATTORNEY FOSTER: You're welcome. 
ATTORNEY D'AMOUR: Good morning, 
Your Honor. Kevin D'Amour. We represent five 
different victims. I would echo what Mr. 
Foster just said but I want to make it clear 
that if we fail to establish a program that is 
cognizant of the harm that's caused to these 
victims it's going to be far more 
discriminatory than what the Government is 
trying to propose or object to. 
I think if we go forward with 
this program we are going to see great results 
and I think we are going to have a much better 
outcome if we can go forward with this program 
as soon as possible. 
THE COURT: Thank you. Attorney 
Benham. 
ATTORNEY BENHAM: Good morning, 
Your Honor. John Benham on behalf of one 
claimant, Jane Doe. 
I assume at some point 
during our proceedings today we are going to 

) 

Probat e ST-19-eB-0080 
get to the issue of how the creditors are 
going to proceed in this by pseudonym or 
however, but as far as the voluntary 
compensation program, as we stated in our 
papers that were filed on December 23rd, we 
don't oppose the creation of the program but 
we don't know what the program is. 
We don't know in particular, the 
expenses that are going to be entailed in just 
creating the program in the first place. We 
don't know and we still don't know, even after 
the first quarterly accounting, what is in the 
estate, whether or not the program intends to 
divulge making all of the estate assets 
available. 
I think the estate has responded 
that yes, all of the assets, I believe they 
have said that all of the assets are available 
because under the terms of the will, the 
executors have to pay all of the debts in all 
of the claims that are approved and only after 
that the rest and residue of the estate and 
assets will be poured into the trust that was 
created under the will. At least that is the 
way I understood it. 

Probate ST - 1 9- PB- 0080 
THE COURT: Except f or now what 
the Government has done. 
ATTORNEY BENHAM: That is a new 
development, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Yes. That is what I am 
saying. That is what has now maybe thrown 
everything and I got notice of this January 23 
of 2020, right. That is a whole different 
something to look at. What does that do to 
what it may bring to the proceedings or 
persons going under? 
ATTORNEY BENHAM: I didn't get 
notice of that until last Friday, Your Honor, 
because the Government didn't serve anybody 
except for the estate as far as I can tell so 
as far as these proceedings, there's no- -
so 
I'm not here to address whether or not the 
CICO lien is as all encompassing as the 
Government claims it is which basically 
freezes every single asset of the estate and 
say no, you can't pay anybody. I would 
understand that is what they say the effec - of 
the CICO lien is. 
I would be, if the Court wishes 
us and the other creditors who have filed 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
claims in this matter to address that, I would 
suggest that perhaps a briefing schedule 
should be established on that particular 
issue. 
THE COURT: I think that may be 
appropriate and the People then could respond 
because that is now the quandary I believe the 
Court is in because now I have what maybe 
going on in another court. 
I have the lien. 
There's nothing else but it tells me a lien 
against all and it lists specific assets and 
it begins with the estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein so if all these things, the shares in 
all these corporations is sitting in that 
estate, that is why I say does that then stop 
everything. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Let me hear from the 
other Counsel. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I just wanted to 
clarify one thing. 
The claims that are 
represented here are the same kind of claims 
that the Government has. Their claim is not 
with regard to the lien itself1 but the nature 
of the claims. 
It's the same exact type of 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
claim for those who are in New York courts or 
other courts. 
So there's no distinction 
between the claims that the Government has in 
terms of the nature of the claims and claims 
that are presented by these other claimants in 
this case. 
THE COURT: I don't know. 
I just 
know people have filed claims; claims of 
sexual assault, claims without any monies 
attached to it indicating that they have filed 
them in a Court of law and saying maybe they 
can resolve them through this settlement 
probate. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: And also one of 
those same type of --
THE COURT: You're saying sexual 
trafficking. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, the point 
I'm making, Your Honor, is that their claims 
had no numbers nor do all claims and they are 
all filed in court. 
THE COURT: And I said that and 
everybody has filed their claims here with no 
numbers. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Right. 

Probate ST-1 9- PB-0080 
THE COURT: So if I were to say 
those are claims, those claims don't comport 
with what the Statute requires but I'm 
allowing people at some point to fix numbers 
on them, they're coming in as claims. 
If I'm 
just sitting strictly on probate and just 
reading what probate requires, it requires you 
to have affixed a number. Nobody has affixed a 
number but I can understand why you can't fix 
a number cause you are just, to me, preserving 
a claim that you say I may perfect somewhere 
by getting, may get a judgment and then if I 
don't or I don't want to try to get this 
judgment, I'm willing to resolve this matter 
through this voluntary settlement program. 
Correct? 
Right. 
Everyone? 
ATTORNEY FOSTER: Yes. I think 
setting up the program is different than 
paying out under the program. 
We want to move 
forward with setting something up; we are not 
talking about paying out. 
That is different~ 
THE COURT: 
Attorney Foster, that 
was one of the things and the note I have 1s 
that's what it 1s. 
You just want to have this 
program in place. 
You just want them to start 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
talking with the alleged victims and maybe 
then you just have matters are settled, but 
you still know I have to wait for whatever is 
going to pan out here with this CICO lien. 
ATTORNEY FOSTER: But I think 
that program will also hel p flesh out what 
those numbers are for each claimant cause each 
claimant is very different. 
THE COURT: Okay, Sir. 
Let me 
hear from final Counsel. 
ATTORNEY CHANCO: Douglas Chanco 
here for the record. 
Your Honor, to build on 
Attorney Benham's argument 
adopt, this Court has kind 
concerns already so I will 
The setup of 
that I'd like to 
of touched on our 
be brief. 
the fund . not 
lS 
what my claimant Araos's issue is. 
It's the 
fact now that we've been hearing today of 32 
plaintiff's lawsuit s and the funding of any 
sort of claims program and we just--even with 
the fact that Your Honor stressed, I have not 
been able to provide a number as no other 
claimant has, I would cite to the filing on 
January 31st of this year in Schedule G. 
My 
client's case is the first one listed on 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
Schedule G; it is a New York State case. It is 
proceeding . It is not one that may possibly 
be filed or is intended to be filed . It is 
going forward at this time and her New York 
Counsel 1s present here so we would just ask 
the Court to, again, take concern as to 
funding of any amount from the estate for the 
payment claims at this point as we have a 
valid claim to present and preserve at this 
point. 
ATTORNEY WESTFALL: Your Honor, 
may we be heard? 
THE COURT: Yes . State your name 
for the record, please. 
ATTORNEY WESTFALL: Melody 
Westfall. Your Honor , we would ask that the 
estate be allowed to resolve the claims Your 
Honor ruled earlier today that the estate 
would be allowed to settle some claims and we 
would urge you to allow the --
THE COURT: 
No, I don't recall 
that. 
I said the estate could pay its 
attorneys, except probate attorneys. 
ATTORNEY WESTFALL: 
Well, we 
would argue that the lien applies after what 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
claims are paid . This is about the victims. 
It's about the people's whose lives are ruined 
and we are very in favor of the voluntary 
program. The victims desperately need help . 
It ' s pressing and we would urge the Court to 
hear from the administrators and perhaps we 
can resolve this today . 
Thank you, Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
Have I heard from all the 
attorneys representing persons who may be 
fi l ing or have filed claims against the 
estate? 
ATTORNEY BOURNE-VANNECK: Good 
morning, Your Honor . Richard Bourne- Vanneck on 
behalf of the claimant Tela Davis. I would 
second the issues that have been raised by 
Attorney Benham . I thought he did it 
adequately so that is why I sat back down. 
Thank you. 
THE COURT : Thank you. So if I 
understand what the persons here , the 
attorneys representing the claimant , what we 
really just need to get is testimony on the 
5 
numbers. I think everybody says they' re in 

Pr obate ST-19-PB-0080 
favor of this program. 
They're satisfied how 
the program may be set up . 
We just need to 
know how much monies we are talking about that 
would be allotted to this program. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, I 
would just state one thing. 
I really just 
want an opportunity to present our own 
witnesses. I think there's information that we 
may have that I would like to present to the 
Court also before the Court can make its final 
decision. 
THE COURT: 
I'm not making a 
decision. 
I specifically said that. 
I'm 
going to take the testimony because the 
persons are here to testify. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay . 
THE COURT: I think I specifically 
said I'm not ruling on this and I'm also going 
to require Counsel to brief the Court on the 
effects of this lien as to anything how this 
estate proceeds as far as it wants to set up 
the claims. I understand that the estate just 
want at this point permission to set up this 
program . 
That is what I am understanding -
permission to set up the program . 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
Then the question will be and 
thereafter once the program is set up, you go 
ahead and start to talk to the alleged 
victims, would any settlement then have to 
wait until resolution of this criminal 
forfeiture in the civil action? 
I'm going to ask Counsel to 
brief the Court and provide to the Court say 
within thirty days memorandums of law to 
assist the Court on that but I'm going to 
allow you to present-- I think everybody has 
agreed that at this point they have enough 
information as to what this program would 
entail. 
My law clerk, Attorney Harrigan 
did some research on this program and he 
provided to the Court that this similar 
program has been done with 911 victims, the 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles with i t s sexual 
assault cases. 
So it's not a program that has 
not been used by other persons. It's just as, 
I think, the estate has said, this may be a 
new one in a probate but it has been done, 
tried, tested, worked. I think we are just 

Probat e ST- 1 9-PB-0080 
here and all Counsel for claimants have said 
they support the program because they believe 
it will be a quick resolution for these 
victims, alleged victims, rather than having 
to go to court and testify, right, in open 
court and have to present a full claim. 
To me, it also has to reduce 
attorneys' fees on both sides significantly. 
Just how much will be set up maybe the Estate 
can work with the People as to what -- because 
it's the People, the Government is the 
opposition. 
That's where your opposition is. 
I have no other opposition but the Government 
and maybe their mistake is just try to work 
with the Government with regard to what the 
Government has filed. 
But Sir, just go 
ahead, please. I think we can just limit it to 
what the numbers are. Fair enough for everyone 
in the courtroom? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
with some leeway, I thi nk we can focus, okay? 
THE COURT: Okay. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: So Ms. 
Feldman, will you take the stand, please? 
DIRECT EXAMINATION 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
By Attorney Tornback: 
Q. 
Please state your name for the 
record? 
A. 
It's Jordana Harris Feldman. 
S 
Q. 
Where do you live? 
A. 
I live in --
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Sorry. Sorry. 
I 'm sorry. She should be sworn. 
THE COURT: 
Yes, she should be. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
She's 
trustworthy, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Well, yes. 
(Laughter) 
And you do have your pro hac 
admission? 
May I have it before I allow you, 
let me just at least say I saw that. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: May I step 
forward or--
THE COURT: The marshal will take 
it for you. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Thank you, sir. 
THE COURT: Let's take a 
ten-minute recess. 
{Ten-minute recess} 
{Court re-convened} 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
Good afternoon. 
Before we 
proceed I need to take care of ,some matters. 
After I retired to chambers, it came to my 
attention, I think I have been free with the 
Counsel for the claimants to allow them to 
come forward and make presentations to the 
Court because this is an unusual situation 
here this morning. But before me I have a 
motion from the People, the Government to 
intervene as a claimant intervenor in the 
matter and I'm going to deny that - the Motion 
to Intervene. 
You're here as a claimant. And 
I'm assuming that you will file your formal 
creditors claim. 
You know you face that 
lien. You have the Criminal Activity Lien 
Notice. 
So that being said, also there's 
a Motion to Intervene filed by Attorney 
D' Amour . The Court recognize you are a 
claimant. 
You represent c l aimants for the 
estate. You may have a claim against the 
estate. I'm going to deny the Motion To 
Intervene also for those claimants represented 
by Attorney D'Arnour. Is he still present in 
the court? 

Pr obat e st-1 9- PB-0080 
ATTORNEY D'AMOUR: Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Yes, you are. You have 
filed claims against the estate. 
You just 
need to perfect those claims, provide the 
information, whether it's by judgment or 
should this voluntary program be established 
by the Court, but as the Court has not now 
allowed anyone to intervene, 
this matter will 
proceed just as if it was a regular probate 
proceeding. The estate Counsel is here. 
The 
Court is here. I'll allow you to present the 
testimony limited to what the Court believe it 
needs concerning this program. Sir? 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Sorry to 
interrupt but we also had a motion to proceed 
anonymously for claimants. 
THE COURT: With that, let me say 
that proceed in the same name in which you 
were proceeding in the New York Courts or 
whatever courts you are filing this assault 
case. It just seems to me that would make it 
easier because then when you bring your 
judgment, should you have a judgment that 
comes in as a creditors claim, the Court would 
know what claim it goes with. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
100 
So, file your claim in the name, 
however you are proceeding in whatever Court 
you are proceeding in with the sexual assault. 
Fair enough, all Counsel? 
So the motion would 
be persons will then file however you are 
proceeding under, the claim would be filed i n 
the same way. 
Attorney Smith. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: I just have one 
procedural question, Your Honor. 
To the 
extent that you've denied the Government's 
Motion to Intervene, how would we file any 
response to-- cause we decided to file the 
Motion To Intervene in order to be able to 
file the opposition which has not been 
formally f iled. 
I t was just filed as an 
attachment. 
THE COURT: 
You come in as 
claimant, right, so you would be presented 
before the Court . 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Well, the motion 
to intervene was premised on the criminal 
activity lien and so once we were able to 
intervene we would then file an opposition as 
a movant of sorts. 
I'm just trying to figure 
it out procedurally . 

erobate ST-19-eB-0080 
THE COURT: Okay. 
I'm not 
leaving you intervene for probate purposes. 
Now, you have this civil --
ATTORNEY SMITH: Criminal. 
101 
THE COURT: And I don't know what 
happens over there. 
Once that case has been 
filed, then I guess you would file it and then 
show the Court why you have to be here making 
opposition to whatever we have. 
But right now 
I'm not allowing you to ask questions of the 
person on the stand. 
Do you understand that? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
THE COURT: Should you go farther 
there, right, you have a lien. 
If I 
understand it , thee should 
e then so e 
in 
of action filed . 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It has been 
filed. 
THE COURT: It has been filed? 
Well, I don't have it. 
I know there was a 
lien. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It was attached 
to the motion. 
THE COURT: Not what I have, I 
don't believe. 

exhibits. 
Proba te s~- 19-PB- 0080 
102 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It has five 
THE COURT: Then once it's her e 
and you hear that, if you believe this program 
would affect your claim, then you would have a 
right to file your opposition but I'm not 
going to a llow you to be questioning the 
wi tness. 
Do you understand that ? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
THE COURT: I'm not going to 
allow --or when you submit your cl aim, fo l low 
the claim procedures and the executors will 
review it, whether they approve it or reject, 
guess what? 
Then you move the Court to hold a 
hearing and then we go i n full presentation. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Okay. 
THE COURT: Fair enough. 
All 
right. 
Okay, Sir, and for the record, 
Attorney. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, I 
had assistance from your col league here to the 
left . 
THE COURT: My able law clerk, 
Attorney Harrigan. 
Yes, we do have your 
application for pro hac vice admission that 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
103 
was approved and signed by Justice Cabret 
January 30th at 2020. 
And we have your oath 
that was attested by the Clerk of the Court, 
Attorney Handy February 3rd at 2020. So you 
are properly before the Court. We will now 
swear the witness. 
Thereupon, JORDANA HARRIS 
FELDMAN, first having been duly sworn, was 
examined and testified as follows: 
DIRECT EXAMINATION 
By Attorney Tom.back: 
Q. 
Please state your name? 
A. 
Jordana Harris Feldman. 
Q. 
Where do you live? 
A. 
New York City. 
Q. 
Did you come down in St. Thomas 
specifically to testify in this proceeding? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And are you familiar with our 
filing indicating on January 9th in our brief 
that you would be here to answer questions 
that the Court 
may have? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And where were you most recently 
employed? 

Probat e ST-19-PB- 0080 
104 
A. 
I worked at the September 11 
Victim Compensation Fund. 
Q. 
And briefly describe that fund for 
the Court? 
A. 
It's a federal program that was 
established in the aftermath of the September 
11th attack to compensate the families of 
those who died and people who were injured in 
the immediate aftermath of the attack. 
Q. 
What was your position there? 
A. 
I was Deputy Special Master and 
Director of the New York office. 
Q. 
How long did you hold that 
position.? 
A. 
I held that position for three 
years but I worked through the Justice 
Department and with the program for over ten 
years in its various iterations beginning in 
2001 and then when it was re-opened in 2011. 
Q. 
And did you leave the 911 fund 
generally your position there to embark on 
working on this program? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And just briefly describe your 
responsibilities with the 911 fund? 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
105 
A. 
I ran our appeals process which 
afforded any claimant an opportunity to 
challenge eligibility and compensation 
determinations if they didn't believe that the 
decision appropriately accounted for their 
circumstances. 
I presided over or participated 
in hundreds of those hearings. 
They were 
intended both as an opportunity for the 
claimant to supplement the record and be heard 
and also for us to acknowledge the traumatic 
experience that each claimant had been through 
and the impact that it had on their lives. 
Q. 
I'm going to shorten what I was 
going to cover with you but have you devoted 
t he bulk of your professional career to mass 
work or mass c l aims programs? 
A. 
I have. 
Q. 
And you have developed a fair 
amoun 
of ex ertise at it, right? 
A. 
Yes. 
It's de f initel y a niche 
practice but this is the kind of claims 
compensation programs outside of traditional 
litigation similar to what we do with the 
September 11th fund determining eligibil ity, 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
106 
determining compensation, figuring out a 
claims process, intended to be expeditious, 
voluntary. 
That is my experience with the 911 
program. 
S 
Q. 
And do you recognize this book 
that I'm holding up? 
A. 
I do. 
Q. 
It's Mass Claim Resolution 
Facilities. Who is the author? 
A. 
I'm a co-author of that book. 
Q. 
And basically what does the book 
cover? 
A. 
It provides case studies of mass 
claims resolutions facilities outside of 
litigation, and offers some practical guidance 
in navigating the design, implementation and 
administration of those programs. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, I 
would just like to offer now just to speed us 
up Ms. Feldman's biography. It's been 
distilled to one page. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, is 
it possible even though I'm not allowed to ask 
questions that I can see the CD. 
THE COURT: 
Do you an have extra 

copy? 
Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
107 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Absolutely. 
I'm just putting it on the record, Your Honor. 
I'm not going to ask any questions. I want to 
move us forward. 
By Attorney Tomback: 
Q. 
When were you first approached 
regarding a possible compensation program that 
related to Mr. Epstein? 
A. 
In late September 2019. 
Q. 
Who first contacted you? 
A. 
Dan Weiner. 
Q. 
And did you have conversations and 
meetings thereafter with the state 
representative? 
A. 
Yes. I h ad several meetings by 
phone and then in person with representat ives 
of the estate. 
Q. 
And where did those conversations 
end up in terms of your career? 
A. 
They asked me to serve as a 
co-designer of the program and also to 
administer the program once it was up and 
running. 
Q. 
Do you know a gentleman named 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
Kenneth Feinberg? 
A. 
I do. I know him well. 
Q. 
How do you know him? 
108 
A. 
Mr. Feinberg was my professor in 
law school in a course about Individual 
Justice in Mass Torts Context. We worked very 
closely together in the first iteration of the 
September 11th Victims Compensation Fund. We 
sat on this Mass Claims Commission that 
resulted in the book that you just offered, 
and he's been a mentor to me through out my 
professional career. 
Q. 
Before you took on this new 
responsibility related to Mr. Epstein, did you 
consult with Mr. Feinberg? 
A. 
I did. 
Q. 
And I was pointing backwards, is 
Mr. Feinberg in the courtroom here today? 
A. 
Yes, sir, he is. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: For the record 
he is the gentleman waiving to my right. 
THE COURT: Good afternoon, Sir. 
By Attorney Tomback : 
Q. 
Did Mr. Feinberg have a role in 
the compensation program? 

Proba t e ST-1 9-PB-0080 
109 
A. 
Yes. He was also selected to act 
as a co-designer of the program and helped to 
implement it. 
Q. 
And was one of the first things 
hat you did--
I ' m sorry . There ' s a third 
person that you worked with. 
Who was that? 
A. 
Camille Biros. 
Q. 
And the three of you, was one of 
the first things the three of you put together 
called a mission statement? 
A. 
Yes. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: If I may offer 
that, Your Honor. 
I don't know what the 
Court's 
intention is with numbering things. 
I would call this Number 2 and the Bar Number 
1. 
THE COURT: 
So this lS 1; that 
would be 2 . 
By Attorney Tomback: 
Q. 
Let me ask you a few things about 
the Epstein Victims Compensation Program. 
By the way, how did the program 
get that name? 
A. 
Mr. Feinberg, Ms. Biros and I 
decided on the title. We thought it was 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
important to acknowledge upfront that these 
were Epstein victims, to acknowledge the 
wrongs that they suffered. 
110 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
And is it a voluntary reprogram? 
It is a voluntary program. 
And explain what you mean by 
voluntary? 
A. 
It just means that the victims 
have a choice. If they want to resolve their 
claims in an alternative way outside of the 
litigation, they can participate. No one is 
required to participate in the program. 
The way that we have designed 
the proposed design of the program, which as 
you heard was supported by many of the 
victims, is that a claimant could come into 
the process, go through the entire process, 
get a compensation determination, and then 
only at that point would any sort of legal 
rights be affected or compromised. We wouldn't 
ask that they sign a waiver of release until 
they had an opportunity to make a more 
informed decision about whether the 
compensation that's being offered is 
attractive and appropriate for them. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
111 
Q. 
Is it a confidential program as 
well? 
A. 
It's confidential to the extent 
that we, as the program administrators and my 
staff and contractors, would be protecting the 
privacy of the victims. We wouldn't be sharing 
any information with the estate or publicly. 
But the confidential requirement is 
unila,teral. It 's 
only imposed on us and 
there's no requirement whatsoever that 
claimants limit their-- what information they 
want to share with whomever they wish -- you 
know, investigators, the public. 
This is an 
alternative to civil litigation and so we have 
no intention to interfere with any sort of 
criminal proceeding . 
Q. 
Are you familiar with the civil 
lawsuit that the Attorney General of the 
United States Virgin Islands filed in the 
other court? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And have you read the Complaint? 
A. 
I have. 
Q. 
And direct your attention--you 
probably don't remember this, but I'll tell 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
you --Paragraphs 87 to 88 described the 
program as quote, imposing confidentiality 
restrictions, close quote, on claimants. Is 
that accurate? 
A. 
It's not for the reasons I just 
stated. 
Q. 
Did you contact the Attorney 
General to correct that error and any other 
issues that came to your attention in 
reviewing the Complaint? 
A. 
I did. I sent a letter to the 
Attorney General on January 16th, the day 
after the Complaint was filed, not only to 
correct that mischaracterization, but also 
just to give her some insight into the 
112 
proposed design of the program. I had attached 
a draft of the protocol that we have developed 
-
Mr. Feinberg, Ms. Biros and I - had 
developed and circulated to the Plaintiff's 
lawyers weeks before. 
I explained to her in the letter 
the various meetings that we had had with 
Plaintiff's Counsel to get their input on the 
draft protocol and seek their recommendations. 
I thought it was important to 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
113 
shed light on what the proposed design was so 
that she understood that many of her 
assumptions about the program were incorrect 
and had been addressed in the draft protocol. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
I'd like to have marked as Exhibit 3 that 
letter. It's dated January 16, 2020. 
It's 
written by Ms. Feldman to the Honorable Denise 
N. George, Attorney General. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
By Attorney Tomback: 
Q. 
Is that the letter you wrote, Ms. 
Feldman, to Attorney General George? 
A. 
I don't have a copy. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, I'm 
not questioning the witness but I do believe 
tha t this goes beyond what the Court was 
anticipating. 
THE COURT: I think Attorney 
Tomback is going to bring me to what I need to 
know about the monies. I haven't heard that, 
setting that up. 
That is really what I want 
to know. 
I think we agreed that everybody 
believes this program is a great program but 

~rebate ST-19-PB- 0080 
what is going to be the costs of setting up 
this program? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, 
114 
the short answer is that the costs definitely 
justifies the program and we are going to get 
to the cost but I just want help on one item 
and you tell me if I should do it or not, but 
I think that while I have Ms . Feldman here 
--and quite frankly it's wonderful to come 
down here. 
It's beautiful, but Ms. Feldman 
is here and Mr. Feinberg is here. 
I'd like to 
close the gap for the Court and so the 
Attorney General understand the proposed 
program is not what the Attorney General wrote 
about. 
It just isn't remotely related to the 
process that is laid out in her papers. 
Judge, there's no live person 
that the Attorney General represents. The 
Attorney General represents a claim of a 
client that is historical. I've just been 
admitted to be pro hac. I don't profess to be 
an expert of the law but I think it's clear to 
everyone in the courtroom that this program 
needs to go forward to save the estate, quite 
frankly, just to address the victims or the 

claimants. 
Probate ST-19-PB-OOBD 
115 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: So I just want 
to put the context there and close the gaps so 
the Attorney General can have some residual 
concern that the estate can address and move 
on and get going. 
THE COURT: Okay. Continue. 
By Attorney Tomback: 
Q. 
Did the co-executors or Counsel, 
anyone affiliated with them, direct you to 
write this letter? 
letter? 
A. 
No. 
Q. 
Whose idea was it to write the 
A. 
It was my idea. 
Q. 
Okay. And the mission statement 
that I showed you before, Exhi bit Number 2, 
did you describe the program as a, quote, 
non-adversarial alternative to litigation, 
c l ose 
front 
given 
quote? 
A. 
It does. I don't have a copy in 
of me but I remember writing it. 
Q. 
Why is non-adversarial important 
your background and expert ise? 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
116 
A. 
In these kinds of programs, you 
have to remove any sort of adversarial posture 
or tone. 
I mean the victims are sharing very 
personal details of their lives about the 
abuse whatever happened in the aftermath and 
so they need to be able to feel comfortable 
that they can share that information without 
fear of being cross examined or interrogated 
or that that will be used against them at some 
later point. 
Q. 
In your mission statement it also 
says that the program, quote, aim to timely 
resolve, close quote, claims. Why is 
timeliness important? 
A. 
It's important because it's 
important to the victims. 
I mean the victims 
are the ones who want this program to move 
forward. They want an option that will 
expeditiously resolve th~ir claims. 
We have 
made a goal to resolve claims within sixty to 
ninety days of a complete submission. 
We 
wanted to make a meaningful alternative to 
litigation for the victims and as you heard 
today, the victims are in support of allowing 
this program to move forward. 

Probate ST- 1 9- PB- 0080 
117 
Q. 
The Mission statement also says 
quote, the program offers a, quote, a process 
that is sensitive to the experiences and 
concerns of the claimants and treat them with 
compassion, dignity and respect. 
Why is that important and how do 
you know that the program is actually going to 
do that? 
A. 
I know it because I have done it 
before. 
I mean Mr. Feinberg has done it 
before. 
You know, these programs are, we 
find the victims are looking for validation as 
much as they are for compensation. They want 
someone to acknowledge what they have been 
through and to be treated in a compassionate 
and dignified way in the process. That is 
exactly what I have done in the 911 fund. 
Q. 
And the Mission statement also 
goes on to say that the program will be run 
by, quote, independent, close quote, cl aims 
administration experts. What do you mean by 
independent and why is that important? 
A. 
Well, that's key. I mean 
particularly in this unusual context but we 
are, Mr. Feinberg, 
Ms. Biros and I, we are 

Probat e ST-19- PB-0080 
118 
not agents of the estate. We're not here to do 
their bidding. We make decisions on the design 
and I will make designs on the administration 
of the program, how it operates, and how 
claims are determined based on our own 
judgment and experience and the estate has 
agreed to be removed from any part of that 
process. 
Q. 
And so just to focus in on an 
individual claimant's claim and the amount of 
compensation that the program, and you as the 
administrator, arrive at, the statement 
provides that quote, the estate will have no 
authority to reject or modify the 
administrator's determination on any bas i s or 
as to any c l aims, close quote. Why is that 
important to the program and the clai mants? 
A. 
It's import ant because to allow 
the estate a say in these deci sions 
compromises the key-guiding princi p l e of the 
program. It compromises our independence; it 
compromises our claims and confidentiality; it 
compromises the non-adversarial nature of the 
program. 
Q. 
And with respect to the program it 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
119 
says participation in it does not affect any 
rights the claimant might have unless and 
until the claimant accepts the compensation, 
determination, and signs a release. 
Why is it 
set up that way? 
A. 
It is set up again as a choice 
where the legal rights are not affected until 
the very end of the process, until claimants 
are able to go through and eval uate her 
options, see if it's something that she's 
willing to accept or not, with the freedom to 
withdraw the claim at any point in the process 
if she's not satisfied. 
And I would add that one of the 
things that Mr . Feinberg and 
thought was 
important to incl ude in this program was that 
that also includes not requiring as a 
condition of participation in the program any 
victim to s t ay pending l itigation in order to 
participate. Claimants can go on a parallel 
track through our claims process and through 
litigation if they want to seek discovery and 
only at the very end of the process would they 
have to make a decision of which way to go. 
Q. 
Taking that out of order as far us 

Probat e ST-19- PB-0080 
120 
you know have any claimants stayed voluntarily 
their actions? 
A. 
Yes, it is my understanding that 
five Plaintiff's have stayed litigation with 
the expectation that this program would be up 
and running in short order because they 
apparently, I understand that they believed 
that this was a bona fide alternative. 
Q. 
The sooner the program is up and 
running, I take it the more likely it is to 
have people stay their litigation, is that a 
fair assumption? 
A. 
That's beyond the scope of what I 
can say. 
Q. 
Now, the statement also says there 
in the statement, Exhibit 2, quote, All 
claimants will be afforded a confidential 
opportunity to meet face-to-face with the 
Administrator , if they so desire . 
Why is 
that important? 
A. 
Again, in my experience, the 
victim wants an opportunity to be heard to 
tell their story in a way that is rarely 
captured in a paper file and so it's something 
we wanted to offer the victims if they wish to 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
121 
avail themselves of it. There's no requirement 
that any victim come in to meet with us. If 
they do want to meet, we'll make it available 
in different ways but that piece is important 
because of the opportunity to be heard and 
tell their stories. 
Q. 
Are you familiar with the Attorney 
General Counsel complaint and other papers 
that have expressed a concern that the 
opportunity to meet face to face with you 
doesn't adequately take into account some of 
the persons here in the Virgin Islands? 
You 
need to come to me. 
What would you do to 
accommodate that? 
A. 
We would accommodate. 
It's 
already written into the draft protocol but we 
woul d accommodate any questions. 
You know, we 
can do it by teleconference, video conference. 
We would be willing, as we have said to some 
of the Plaintiff's lawyers who have clients in 
Florida, to go to areas where there are a 
number of claimant's where we could hold those 
meetings face to face. 
Q. 
And the mission statement refers 
to a claims protocol that includes, quote 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
122 
eligibility criteria, the methodology for 
determining compensation, proof requirements 
and claims procedures, close quote. 
Can you briefly address program 
protocol? 
A. 
Yes. It just, it lays out the 
terms and conditions or the proposed terms and 
conditions of how the program would operate. 
It gives some visibility of the criteria that 
we'll apply when evaluating claims for 
eligibility and compensation and outlines the 
way that we'll process the claims and the 
expectations in terms of timing. 
Q. 
And how is the protocol developed? 
A. 
So Mr. Feinberg, Ms. Biros and I 
drafted the protocol in November and December 
of 2009. One of our main objectives was to 
make it as broad and as claimant friendly as 
possible and with that in mind, we removed a 
lot of the barriers that would apply or could 
apply in litigation. 
The Statute of 
Limitations is not an issue that we'll keep in 
allowing people to participate; prior 
settlement would not preclude someone from 
participating in the program; and so we 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
123 
developed a protocol with that in mind. 
We want any victim who suffered 
abuse to be able to come in and participate in 
the program and once we had an initial draft, 
we circulated it to the estate, to the 
Plaintiff's lawyers, to the USVI Attorneys 
Office, in the Southern District of New York 
to get their feedback on the protocol. 
Q. 
And just to be clear, I might not 
have heard you but I take it numerous 
Plaintiff's met with you and proceeded with 
you or Plaintiff's Counsel, some of whom are 
here? 
A. 
Yes, we met with nearly all of the 
lawyers we know about who represented 
Plaintiffs. 
Q. 
And if the Attorney General or her 
representative wanted to meet with you or just 
talk to you on the phone or have a series of 
meetings to express concerns, will you listen 
to her? 
A. 
Absolutely. 
In fact, in my letter 
I invited an opportunity to meet with her and 
discuss more about the program and seek her 
input. 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
Q. 
Have _you heard from her yet? 
A. 
I have not heard back~ 
124 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
I would just 
like to offer up the protocol still in draft 
form. 
It's not finalized but the protocol, 
as it exists that have been provided to us for 
this purpose by Ms. Feldman, shows a track 
change based on meetings with Plaintiff's 
Counsel. 
I don't want to review that. 
I 
want to get this done before you lose 
patience. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
I want to hear 
about the money. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, just 
for the record I'm not going to ask a 
question. 
Just that the revision of the 
protocol is not what was before the Attorney 
General in the letter that was sent to her. 
THE WITNESS: 
As Mr. Tornback 
just said, the protocol that he just offered 
has a red line copy. 
Only the red lines are 
new; anything additional to that, we 
circul ated to the Attorney General. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, I 
have one more topic to cover, which is to 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
provide briefly an overview of the actual 
claims process. 
So if we can mark this as 
Exhibit 5. 
I just want to provide some 
125 
context because the program is not -- you need 
to understand the program, I think, to 
evaluate the costs. 
By Attorney Tomback: 
Q. 
So taking a look at Exhibit 5, i s 
that in front of you? 
A. 
Not yet. 
Q. 
Let me wait. 
I'm reminded by my 
colleagues for the record of Exhibi t 5 which 
I'm going to offer and when the wi tness 
identifies it, then I will put it into 
evidence. 
It's entitled the overview of the 
claims process. 
So directing your attention to 
the third paragraph, it says, quote, Claimants 
who 
voluntarily elect to file a cl aim with 
the program will be invited to participate 
--excuse me --invited to provide documentation 
identified in the claim form devel oped by the 
claims admini stration experts and any 
additional corroborating or supporting 

Pr obate ST-19-PB-0080 
126 
information to substantiate their claims. 
Can you offer to the Court how 
that works in practice? 
A. 
So we all developed a claim form 
that will look to capture just some basic 
information about the claimant, about the 
circumstances of her abuse, the type of abuse, 
the location, when it happened, how long it 
happened, and invite her to submit any sort of 
documentation she might have to help 
corroborate the claim. 
Q. 
And if there is a deficiency in 
the claim, will the claimant and other Counsel 
have an opportunity to correct that or address 
it? 
A. 
Yes. The program, as we have done 
in other programs we have administered before, 
is intended to be claimant-friendly. 
So if 
someone files a deficient claim, we'll do a 
preliminary review, identify what the 
deficiency is, do out-reach to the claimant or 
her representative, and work them to try to 
address the deficiency. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, 
much of the Mission Statement speaks for 

Proba te ST-19- PB-008 0 
itself. 
If you don't mind I will quote two 
more paragraphs then move on. 
By Attorney Tornback: 
127 
Q. 
If you look, Ms. Feldman, at the 
fourth full Paragraph, Line 5, where the word 
once appears on the right, can you just read 
that into the record and comment on that for 
us? 
A. 
"Once a completed claim has been 
submitted, the Administrator will evaluate the 
claim based on all available information and 
will issue a determination regarding whether 
the claimant is eligible to receive 
compensation and the amount of compensation to 
be paid to an eligible claimant." 
The individual claim 
determination will be based on that factor in 
the considerations identified in the protocol. 
It speaks for itself. 
Q. 
I don't have any questions. I 
just wanted to cover that. 
I want to get to 
sort of an end game of how the process works. 
In your overview statement there's an ultimate 
paragraph and I will read that into the 
record, "Upon the issuance of a compensation 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
128 
determination by the Administrator", that's 
you, "the claimant will have complete freedom 
to accept or reject that determination. 
If 
the claimant elects to accept the 
determination, the claimant will sign a 
release waiving the claimant's rights to 
litigate in the courts, as set forth in the 
protocol. Upon the Administrator's receipt of 
the claimant's acceptance of the compensation 
determination and executed release, the 
Administrator will authorize payment to the 
claimant". 
Do you have anything to add to 
that ? 
A. 
Only that the idea of this type of 
program, as with the other programs that Mr. 
Feinberg and I have administered, is to get 
these victims paid quickly. 
So our 
expectation is t hat once we issue a 
determination, if the claimant accepts it, and 
sends in the release, we will immediately 
notify the estate and our expectation is that 
they will disburse the funds very shortly 
thereafter. 
Q 
And are you familiar with the 
,___ ___________________________ __,,,

129 
Attorney General lawsuit? 
This is, again, 
that Complaint of Paragraph 88 where they say 
the program, quote, requires any claimant 
accepting an award under the program is 
sacrificing any other claims against any 
persons or entity arising from or related to 
Mr. Epstein. Closed quote. 
Do you view that 
criticism as sensible? 
A. 
Well, like I said before, this 
program is not intended to interfere with any 
sort of criminal investigation and the scope 
of the release has not yet been determined. 
Ultimately, I mean, that is something that the 
estate is, I understand, 1s working on and 
ultimately if a claimant believes that their 
rights are unfairly compromised, she has the 
freedom not to sign the release. 
Q. 
Right. 
And if a claimant signs a 
release and, for example, the United States 
Virgin Islands Attorney General wants that 
claimant to serve as a witness in a criminal 
investigation, hypothetically, the person can 
still receive compensation, sign a full 
release in terms of civil claims of the 
estate--if it i s not scheduled another time 

Pr obate ST- 19-PB-0080 
130 
and the Attorney General could still sit with 
that person and perhaps use her as a witness 
or to help the Attorney General's 
investigation; is that fair? 
A. 
Absolutely, like I said before 
nothing limits the claimant from speaking with 
investigators about the circumstances. 
Q. 
Just in terms of the civil release 
itself, those are common in your experience? 
In other words, that you settle sort of total 
settlement? 
A. 
Absolutely and actually, this is 
different from the 911 context where the 
waiver attaches at the very beginning of the 
1.5 
process upon submission of the claim. 
Here, we thought it would be 
beneficial to the claimant to wait until the 
end of the process so that they have a more 
informed understanding about what they would 
receive. 
Q. 
I'm just going to go through this 
fast. 
You set up a website, right? 
A. 
Yes. 
We started to develop a 
website. 
We will set up a website. 
Q. 
And you set up a commencement 

Probate ST-19-PB~OOBO 
131 
date, a start date, a let's-go date? 
A. 
We have not. 
We are tying it to 
approval by the Court to allow the program to 
move forward but we will be once it's approved 
by the Court, we can be up and running within 
ninety days and I expect, because of the 
considerable amount of work that we have done 
up until then, we would be able to do that 
even more quickly. 
Q. 
Last point before turning to the 
anticipated cost of the program, there's a 
deadline for the submission of claims. Why do 
you have to have a deadline? 
A. 
Because deadlines motivate people 
to act. It provides certainty. 
We found in 
our experience that people often wait till the 
very end of the process to file their claims, 
the last day, because life gets in the way and 
it's not a priority until it becomes a 
priority. 
So we proposed in the draft 
protocol making a 90-day filing window, and we 
didn't hear any feedback from anyone that that 
was an inappropriately short period of time so 
that's our expectation. 

Probate ST-19-PB-00 80 
132 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK : 
So, Your 
Honor, the budget for the program, can I have 
this marked as Exhibit Number 6 and then, I 
think, it would be best to mark Number 7. 
Number 7, if it's admitted into evidence, is 
the engagement letter that Ms. Feldman signed 
with one of the counsels for the estate. 
By Attorney Tomback: 
Q. 
So I'm told that the actual 
signatories for the engagement letter is not 
counsel but all co-executors? 
A. 
It was like not me. 
Right. 
Q. 
Precisely. Al l right. 
So is it 
correct that the design and the implementation 
on the operation of the program such as this 
requires significant personnel and costs? 
A. 
It requires a specialized 
expertise in a unique area and it requi res 
buil ding out the infrastructure to support the 
operation. 
Q. 
And is there a budget prepared by 
you, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros? 
A. 
Yes . 
Q. 
And at the beginning when the 
budget was put together, had you redacted the 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
133 
fees for Mr . E stei --excuse m -- or Mr . 
einberg and fo 
you upfront? 
A. 
We did. 
Q. 
And wh y was there concern about 
not having that being the very first thing 
that people focused on? 
A. 
We just felt like it was a 
distraction at the very beginning. 
Q. 
The copy that you presented to the 
Court, which is Exhibit 6, is un-redacted, and 
so let me just h~ve one more minute. 
So Ms. Feldman, turning here to 
Page 3 of Exhibit 6, the esti mated budget, I 
think i t's probably just easier if you walked 
us through --without quoting necessarily --but 
walk through the large p i eces of these 
expenses for the program and t hen I wi l l ask 
you some questions about them. 
A. 
You said Page 3? 
Q. 
Yes, but let me start by --this 
i sn't something we really prepared but -- how 
many people have the sort of expertise that 
you do and Mr. Fei nberg does to conduct a 
program like this? 
A. 
I don't know of many people. Mr. 

Probat e ST-19- PB- 0080 
Feinberg is obviously the leading person in 
this area. 
It's a pretty small group of 
people who do this kind of work. 
134 
Q. 
So I'm not great with analogies, 
but if I were to compare Mr. Feinberg to a 
car, right, would he be a good car--Let's not 
talk about the --is he the best in the area in 
your view? 
A. 
In my view he is the best. 
Q. 
And in considerati on of how to set 
up the fund in terms of the program, in terms 
of design and in terms of administration, 
without giving anything away that is 
privileged, the group that came together to 
figure out how to t ry to do this -- firs t of 
al l , are you familiar with the fact that the 
group of executors, co-executors and thei r 
Counsel looked at other candidates other than 
you? 
A. 
I understand that you met with 
several other people. 
Q. 
And in talking through exactly how 
to structure the relationship between the--
wel l , relati onship between you and Mr. 
Feinberg, are you familiar with some thoughts 

Prob ate ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
or what you thought about why you should be 
the administrator rather than Mr. Feinberg 
135 
being the administrator and who should focus 
on design? 
A. 
It was rny--I mean, you probably 
could speak to this selection process better 
than I can, but it is my understanding that 
you were looking for someone who both had 
experience and had sensitivity to the victims' 
experiences and I believe you were looking for 
a female to run the program. 
Q. 
And so can you just walk through 
them with the budget? 
Starting with the first 
part of the budget, what are the payments to 
Mr. Feinberg? 
I guess that's the start. 
A. 
Well, he was retained to design 
the program based on his very extensive 
experience so the fees are related to the 
drafting of the protocol, the meetings that we 
had with the Plaintiffs' lawyers, all of the 
work that goes into bringing his years and 
years of experience to bear, and in designing 
and then the implementation of the program. 
Q. 
And then turning to the second 
part in terms of your fees -- first of all, 

~r ebat e ST-19-PB-0080 
136 
just to divert and try to pick up on that 
area, you are currently, you are working sort 
of in the hope that the program will be 
approved, right? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
I mean, you are just between jobs, 
effectively working on this? 
A. 
Yes. 
I have left my job with the 
911 fund to do this program because I truly 
believe it was in the best interest of the 
victims. 
So since November, we have been 
working full steam ahead to get this process 
up and running because we believe it's the 
right thing to do, but I have not been 
compensated and more importantly, I haven't 
been able to compensate other people who have 
been willing to dive in and start doing work 
to ensure the timely 
implementation of the 
program . 
Q. 
And the budget specifically says--
going back to Mr. Feinberg--so this is on the 
record, it says after listing a number of 
services that will be offered that Mr. 
Feinberg's law offices will receive $850,000 

Probate ST-19-PB-00 80 
137 
per month and it says for a maximum period of 
two months. 
It says, "thereafter, all ongoing 
consulting services provided by Mr. Feinberg 
and Ms. Biros will be deemed to be included in 
the above-referenced fee." 
Do you understand Mr. Feinberg to 
have made a commitment after the two months 
are over to provide services for free? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And in your experiences will he 
stick with the program or will he disappear? 
A. 
He always stick with the program. 
He i s very rel iable, very reliable. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Your Honor, 
the budget, those are the main pieces. 
We 
can walk through --
THE COURT: 
Tell me the bottom 
line. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
The bottom 
l ine of t he budget ? 
THE COURT: The budget has a 
bottom line. 
Are you going to rent office 
spaces? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
We can walk 
through that, Your Honor. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
138 
THE COURT: Just tell me what the 
office space is . You know, and this question 
about Mr. Feinberg, this $850,000 a month for 
two months; is that to him or his law firm? 
THE WITNESS: 
The law firm . 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: The law Office 
and just to be clear, so he'll bring to bear 
the whole thing --
THE COURT: I just want to know 
if it's to the law firm? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Yes, and Ms. 
Biros alluding- -
THE COURT: Let's just get it for 
the persons here, right? 
Remember, you have 
been kind enough to give Government Counsel 
copies of the budget and other documents, but 
remember there are other counsels for 
claimants' present who that was their concern 
concerning their claims and they have not been 
given that information and will have to wait 
until the session adjourns to go to the 
clerk's office to get copies. 
So I just want 
you to give us where the large expenses would 
be. 
By Attorney Tomback: 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
139 
So, Ms. Feldman, the payments used 
for the duration for programs, right, which 
were how many months is the estimate, assuming 
the timeline? 
A. 
The estimated budget assumed 12 to 
months to design, implement, administer 
from start to finish. 
I think that the 
estimation was made with the expectation in. 
November that it would be approved in short 
order and that we would be able to execute the 
contract with vendors and contractors which we 
have not been able to do because I don't have 
the authority to do it. 
So we have done all of the work up 
until that point but have not yet been able to 
execute and some people have had to decline to 
participate because of the passage of time. 
We still anticipated it being a relatively 
short time frame. 
I don't know if it will be 
within the 12 to 14 month period. 
That number 
also assumes, you know, depending on the 
number of claimants, and that is not just 
legitimate claimants. We will be accepting 
claims from some claimants who were determined 
not to be eligible and those are claims that 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
140 
have to go through the process just like any 
other claims in order to get to that 
determination. 
Q. 
And so with respect to your 
personal fees, is the fee $150,000 a month for 
the estimated 12 to 14, and if necessary 
additional, months? 
A. 
I'm sorry. 
Q. 
Just to understand, if you look at 
B {i} for Design and implementation for the 
entire program, what is the fee that will be 
paid to you, Ms. Feldman? 
A. 
After the 14 months? 
Q. 
No. 
In total for during the 
14-month period? 
A. 
It would be that, times 14. 
Q. 
Right? And then with respect to--
I mean, just walking through this so it's in 
the record even though the documents are 
there, in terms of the fees and expenses that 
will be required to be paid and operation of 
the claims process, you have the backroom 
costs, some sort of website, the distribution 
of program documents, developing of procedures 
to track the claims, to investigate the claims 

Probate ST-19-PB-0 080 
141 
and to supervise a toll -free calling center, 
do you estimate the projected costs for that 
for the entire program to be in the range of 
$150,000 to $250,000? 
A. 
Yes, that is what we estimated in 
November. 
Q. 
The Attorney General said a month 
but 1s that not for the whol e program? 
A. 
Right. 
Most of those are cost 
that would be up front in terms of t he 
development of the website. 
We want to 
develop functionality to allow someone to 
submit a claim electronically, but that is for 
the duration of the program. 
Q. 
And then in terms of staffing, 
depending upon the number of c l aimants who 
come forward, there's provision in the budget 
f or up to - not necessaril y three, but up to -
three attorneys to support your program and 
t hen 
administ rative support, data analyt i cal 
support , inform-tion 
echnology 
ppor , 
etcetera. 
So those staffing services mont hly 
cost s are estimated to be in the range of 
$160,000 but that can change if you were to 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
become --that would be addressed for more 
people, correct? 
142 
A. 
Yes. 
These estimates are based on 
whatever information we had available at the 
time that we drafted this in November. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
there's one other topic that I would like to--
I have to do one other thing is what I'm told. 
By Attorney Tornback: 
Q. 
This final item is in the 
estimated budget on Page 5 that you need to 
have office 
spaces and equipment. 
You can't 
use your old spaces, right? 
And there are 
other employee costs in the range of 15 to 
20,000; is that correct? 
A. 
That's right. 
Q. 
That is additional cost, okay. 
The last topic I want to cover, 
Your Honor, is timing. So we touched on timing 
but can you just express in a nutshell how 
important it is for the program toge· 
oing? 
A. 
It's extremely important. 
Q. 
Why? 
A. 
Because the victims want it to 
move forward. 
I mean, to hear many of their 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
representatives come up and say i t actually 
impacted me even more than just-- this was 
143 
particularly imp-ressive upon me because these 
victims have been at the precipice of 
opportunity to get some measure of justice i n 
many different points and it's been pulled out 
from under them or delayed in some way . 
And we are now at a poi nt where 
we invested a considerable amount of time to 
put together a draft of what the program would 
look like to seek the input of the plaintiffs' 
lawyers. 
We have their support and the 
victims are now, from my understanding in 
speaking with many of the Plaintiffs' lawyers, 
they have had conversations with their clients 
and their clients are really eager to have 
this process move forward . 
And their expectations have been 
raised in terms of i t being implemented in 
short order and so to delay this further would 
really be a great d i s-service to these 
victims. 
Q. 
Just so I sort of break them 
int o-- I call them claimants; you call them 
victims but it's the same thi ng-- j ust put them 

Probate ST-1 9-PB - 0080 
144 
in two categories, okay? 
One category are 
Plaintiffs who've already brought sui t through 
their counsels - the bulk of them in New York. 
If the program doesn't go forward, then they 
would be stuck litigating, right? 
I mean, 
they're going to have to litigate. Is that a 
fair assessment of what's going to happen to 
them? 
A. 
That's my understanding. 
Q. 
Okay. 
I want to address this 
separately. I mean, I think that the Court 
understands that, so I don't want to bel abor 
it but I just want to address a separate 
group, which is, if a person whose claim that 
she's been harmed by Mr. Epstein but for 
whatever reason does not want to go to court, 
want s the confi dentiality, wants to sit with 
you and not sit in a courtroom and testify and 
so forth and so on, if the program doesn't go 
forward, what happens, in your view, to that 
person? 
A. 
She's left without recourse. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK : One moment, Your 
Honor. 
I think I'm done here. So I just have 
one more question of Ms. Feldman and I wanted 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
to call Mr. Feinberg solely to address the 
prior • concern that the Attorney General has. 
And Your Honor, I don't want to 
THE COURT: But you know what? 
145 
It's not about the Attorney General's concern. 
My concern is you are coming here to ask this 
Court to £und this program. 
My concern is 
what types of monies are you talking of? 
That 
is what you need to address - not the Attorney 
General, r i ght? 
How much money are you talking 
about that I would have to say, allow the 
executor's, co-executors to move from the 
estate to this program? 
Ms. Feldman, would you be able 
to say, based on your experience, what would 
be the range of settlement in these types of 
matters? 
THE WITNESS: 
Well, it's--let me 
just preface it by saying, you know, we have 
gotten representati on from the estate that 
there wi ll be no cap on either a given amount 
on the individual claims, and I believe Mr. 
Foster made this point, it is impossible to 
value these claims in the abstract, right. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
146 
There are different circumstances in each case 
so it's hard to say. 
You know, I think that we are 
talking about, you know, claims that would 
range from the thousands of dollars up into 
the millions of dollars. 
THE COURT: Would this be where 
you could 
and I think you may have 
testified to this -- you could enter an 
agreement with these claimants/ victims as to 
the settlement amounts, they sign the release 
and they understand they may have to wait for 
their payment because I think you said that 
the whole idea is to have them fully 
compensated within a short period of time. 
THE WITNESS: But the goal would 
BE that once they sign the release and we are 
able to notify the estate that the estate 
would be able to disburse that money almost 
immediately. 
I understand from the Catholic 
Church Sex abuse cases, it's turned around in 
a week or two. In the September 11th program, 
they were also able to turn it around in a few 
weeks time so that would be the goal. 
THE COURT: That would be the 

Probate ST- 1 9- PB- 0080 
147 
goal b t you un ers and in his matter, the 
Government of the Virgin Island has filed an 
action that may impede that? 
THE WITNESS: 
I would say that 
to the extent that the Government's interest 
is at least in part to protect the victims' 
interest, that interest is not being served by 
them trying to step in and take priority over 
the victims. 
THE COURT: 
Well, I don't know. 
The People will have to speak to where their 
interest lies, but I know what the People have 
filed to put a l ien on all the properties of 
the estate. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: I asked 
counsel whether there are any claimants, any 
individual people that they represent. 
THE COURT: 
Well, the Government 
never represent individual people. The 
Government represents the People of the Virgin 
Islands. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Right, but 
just to be clear, there is no claimant that 
would receive those monies. There are 
criticisms about the program in terms of how 

Probate ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
it will treat claimants, but they have no 
claimants. 
148 
THE COURT: 
If I understand what 
the People of the Virgin Islands is saying is 
they are concerned that this program could 
wipe out whatever they believe they should be 
entitled to under the action they have filed. 
That's what I am trying to get, what is the 
bottom line? 
How much money are you talking 
about? 
Is there anyway to segregate and say 
whatever the People are coming against and 
they have listed what they are seeking, what 
property they put a lien on. 
They haven't put 
a lien on-- well, they put a lien on the 
entire estate which all these shares are 
sitting in the estate--that is what I am 
trying to getr and I think it maybe you have 
to talk to the People. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: The only thing 
I believe I can help in one respect is that 
the co-executors and their Counsel believe-~ 
first of all, there's a net savings of 
litigation costs to the estate to proceeding 
in this way. 
THE COURT: 
Sir, you are 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
149 
missing --I understand that. 
I totally get it 
that it will be for everybody involved less 
costly to enter into the settlement program 
than to litigate. 
I get that in terms of 
money; in terms of time. 
But I'm also backed up where I 
have what the People of the Virgin Islands, 
The Government of the Virgin Islands has filed 
this Criminal Activity Lien Notice which tells 
me that everything that they have taken this 
lien, nothing can be disbursed. That is where 
we are. What can I do at this point with this 
notice that has been given to the Court? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Two ways, Your 
Honor, that I think that we can try to address 
that. One way is to point out that the 
concerns expressed about the program are not 
accurate. 
I think Ms. Feldman has 
THE COURT: Sir --
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: And the second 
way --
THE COURT: 
No. 
Listen. I 
disagree. 
I don't think whatever concerns 
they had about the program, that's not before 
me. 
I understand that The Government of the 

Probat e ST- 19- PB- 0080 
150 
Virgin Islands is saying I'm going in to take 
a stake in this forfeiture action to take 
control. It's not about the program. They are 
saying don't pay out anything on the program 
because you could not distribute anything from 
this estate because I have filed this lien and 
this lien says any trustee, executor, person 
or institution who moves, transfer or conveys 
title to personal or real property upon which 
a Criminal Activity Lien Notice has been filed 
which the personal or real property is located 
or who transfers or conveys such property 
while having actual notice of this lien shall 
be liable to the Attorney General. 
That is 
the concern. 
That is what they are seeking 
here or they come in. 
And I told Attorney Smith she 
couldn't ask any questions, but that is what I 
understood; that by this program you said you 
could enter into settlement you said ten 
thousand to tens of thousands of dollars to 
persons and then their concern is and then we 
get our forfeiture judgment and there's 
nothing there. Do you understand? 
That is 
what I understand the Government is moving. 

Probate ST~l9-PB-0080 
151 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Could I have 
one question and then I will propose a way of 
going forth which is we could like let the 
program at least develop. 
So the Order that 
is before Your Honor-- maybe that is the best 
thing to do at this point -- the Order before 
Your Honor is just to allow Ms. Feldman to be 
engaged and Mr. Feinberg to really be engaged 
to continue their work and to get a protocol 
to bring to Your Honor to approve, but it 
seems, I mean, I think I'm reading between the 
lines that it seems that Your Honor is 
speaking about maybe a cap on the amount that 
you don't like the--maybe put a cap on the 
amount. 
You don't like the infinite nature--
I guess the way you are describing it. 
THE COURT: 
Well, is there a 
set of money that could be moved to fund this 
program because, okay, you bring the protocol 
to be approved, right? 
I approved the 
protocol. 
You start working. You say 12 to 14 
months from the time of the release this 
person is to be paid, but then I have on the 
other side what the People are dealing with in 
the civil court. 

Probat e ST- 19- PB-0080 
152 
And how I read the Statute, that 
lien can be in place for a period of six 
years. 
So now you've set up a program. 
Persons, the victims come in, sign, release, 
believe everything is in place. I think that 
is where I am at. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: The problem with 
that, Your Honor, is that-- I mean, I can let 
the Plaintiff's Counsel address that-- that 
will chill the program. 
11. 
THE COURT: I understand. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Let me just ask 
a question so I understand so we can clarify 
the point on this, okay? 
If the Attorney 
General recovers, let's say one million 
dollars from the estate, is that one million 
dollars going to go to the budget of the 
Virgin Islands or is it going to go to the 
victims? 
If it's going to go to the victims, 
I don't know why we can't bridge the gap and 
get the Attorney General to be satisfied with 
this program. 
THE COURT: 
You know what I said 
and it comes down maybe to the estate needs to 
meet with the Attorney General. 

to do that. 
Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
153 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: We're prepared 
THE COURT: 
I think I have said 
that a couple of times. The estate may need to 
mee 
with 
he 
ttorney Gener 1 , with the 
victims, the claimants, Counsel here is saying 
we are fully in support of this because the 
only person we believe will be hurt by not 
approving this program are the victims because 
the victims either would have to go into 
courts, right, expend monies for attorneys on 
both sides when there's a program that is 
going to be fully developed. They are saying 
we can deal with these victims, fully resolve 
the issues and have them compensated in 12 to 
months. 
Madam Attorney General, what 
would you be willing to do on this point? 
Release a portion of the estate just to fund 
this program while you proceed with your 
action? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: We can 
absolutely do have. 
We could do that 
immediately and the only question I can ask, 
Your Honor, I can hand up as an exhibit --it's 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
154 
already in the court records, but Your Honor, 
two copies. One I want you to have. It's not 
really for the witness. 
In the interim, we would just 
like to move forward. No awards of money; no 
release of money but to move this process 
forward to complete the protocol which is 
something that would come to you, Your Honor, 
to approve, if that is what you want if you 
want to exercise that jurisdiction over the 
program. 
Otherwise, for the executors to 
approve the protocol and be in a position to 
move forward if in fact we can reach an 
agreement with the Attorney General or 
otherwise avoid what I think you call a freeze 
of the program which obviously we don't want. 
That Order will allow Ms. Feldman actually to 
be gainfully employed again and to move 
forward and for Mr . Feinberg to put i 
0 
together. 
THE COURT: You are going to ask 
2 
me to sign this order now? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Yes, Your 
Honor, please. 
THE COURT: 
No, I don't believe 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
155 
so. I haven't even seen what you had marked in 
the exhibits and they have not been admitted. 
You haven't moved for the admission. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: I move for the 
exhibits of 1 through 7. Eight is already in 
the record. I thought I move a few of them in 
before. 
THE COURT: No, you haven't 
because I never ruled. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: I'd like to 
move to enter into the record Exhibits 1 
through 7. 
THE COURT: They will be so 
admitted. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Of course, Your 
Honor, I just would want to say that I want to 
put my objection on the record. 
THE COURT: I'm not signing any 
motion from the bench. Trust me on this. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
I'm being urged to ask and I actually want to 
ask it myself but I don t want to anger Your 
Honor. 
I would very much like to call Mr. 
Feinberg just to add es the Attorney 
General's concern. 
It may help make progress, 

Pr obate ST-19- PB-0080 
I think. 
THE COURT: 
Call just him for 
the limited purpose of that. I've gotten, I 
156 
think, the claimants Counsel who was present 
wanted to know the money. Attorney Benham, I 
keep looking at you. 
You have that as part 
of the record that now you can get copies of 
that and then now the attorneys can be in a 
better position to say, if I understood that, 
that was their reservation, but I think maybe 
you need to talk to the Attorney General, the 
Government of the Virgin Islands, Department 
of Justice as to his concerns. 
We now know 
what the monies are. 
We now know what you are 
seeking to set it up. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 
just so you understand that the executors are 
trying to sort of move between a rock and a 
hard place. 
What is difficult for the 
executors is that the reason that there's no 
quote/unquote cap on the program is to attract 
claimants to the program and to avoid 
criticisms from Plaintiff's Counsel that we 
are given quote/unquote only X dollars. 
And 
so we carefully avoided that and I understand 

Probate ST-L9~PB- OOBO 
157 
that the Attorney General wants effectively a 
cap and we'll work with the Attorney General 
to try to get this done. 
THE COURT: I don't think that is 
what they want. The Attorney General to me is 
just saying make sure whatever judgment they 
may get-- right now, you know what? 
We have 
two sets o f claims. 
We have a claim by the 
Attorney General and the claimants. 
The question is, does the 
Attorney General lien take priority over 
anything else done in the estate and I said 
that is how I read it. 
Attorney Blum said 
that 1s how he read it too, that it may stop 
everything because the Attorney General has 
put a lien on all the property. I said, well, 
the estate has to continue to function. 
It 
has to pay its bills; it has to -- and 
Attorney Smith, I think, conceded that it may 
have basic administration costs, but this 1s 
different what you are asking this Court to do 
while I have this lien here. 
And this is what 
I am saying, why can't somebody guide the 
Court - whether Counsel submit memorandums of 
law -- no, it does not; we can proceed --

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
158 
whether you can say we can back out this 
amount, whatever is going on in the civil 
court should not be affected; we believe the 
estate, if the Attorney General, the 
Government of the Virgin Islands was to 
prevail, this will be the amount that they 
would recover and so we can safely expend 
these monies on this program, but remember the 
question was because we don't have the 
quarterly accountings, we don't have the full 
evaluation. 
We don't know what the estate 
consist of. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, I 
understand. 
Can we start with Mr. Feinberg 
just to address the subsequent concerns that 
the Attorney General have with the program, if 
I can call him? 
THE COURT: Just call him quickly. 
Thank you, Ms. Feldman. We have all exhibits 
admitted? 
Thereupon, KENNETH R. FEINBERG, 
first having been duly sworn, was examined and 
testified as follows: 
DIRECT EXAMINATION 
By Attorney Tomback: 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
159 
Q. 
Mr. Feinberg, before you were 
sworn in, I think you have all the exhibits in 
front of you so it would go much quicker. 
THE COURT: He's already sworn 
. 
in. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: He already 
sworn in? 
THE COURT: Yes, we were good on 
this one. 
By Attorney Tomback: 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
Where do you live, Mr. Feinberg? 
Washington, DC. 
Did you come down here just to 
testify in this proceeding? 
A. 
I did. 
Q. 
Where are you employed? 
A. 
I'm the Law Office of Kenneth R. 
Feinberg, PC. 
Q. 
What do that firm do? 
A. 
We specialize in alternative 
dispute resolutions, mediations, arbitrations 
and claim programs like the one proposed. 
Q. 
Would you just describe briefly to 
Your Honor your experience in this matter? 
A. 
I started in 1984 with the Agent 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
160 
Orange Vietnam veterans liability litigation 
where we set up a program following the 
settlement. I was appointed by the Bush 
Administration to design and administer the 
911 funds. 
I was appointed by the Obama 
Administration to design and administer the 
Deep Water Horizon Explosion and I'm currently 
a co-administrator and designer of Catholic 
Church sexual abuse cases in five states. 
Q. 
Have you written any books? 
A. 
I have written two; One is "Life 
Worth". My experiences with the 911 Victim 
Compensation Fund. And "Who Gets What", 
chapters devoted to my various claim 
administration programs. 
Q. 
And is it fair to say that you are 
regarded as either the best or one of the best 
people in dealing with these sorts of 
complicated multiple claimant filings? 
A. 
That is for others to say. I'm 
busy at it. 
Q. 
Will you disagree with Ms. Feldman 
on that? 
A. 
No. 
Q. 
Do you have a role in this 

Piobat e ST- 19- PB- 0080 
program, the Epstein Victim Compensation 
Program? 
A. 
Yes. 
I have been asked by the 
161 
estate to work with Ms. Feldman and Ms. Biros 
in the design, implementation and 
administration of a proposed program. 
Q. 
Do you believe the program would 
work if the Court approves it? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And are you familiar with the 
oppositions to the estate motion for 
establishment of a voluntary claims resolution 
program fi l ed basically last Friday by 
Attorney General Denise George? 
A. 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
A. 
Yes. 
Have you reviewed 't? 
l 
. 
I have. 
What do you think of 
The Attorney General 
't? 
l 
. 
is trying 
do what i s best for the Virgin Islands. I 
to 
can't question that. There are statements made 
in the Complaint that I disagree with, and I 
agree with the Court sitting up back that the 
estate and the Attorney General should be able 
to work this out. 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
162 
Q. 
And I direct your attention to 
Page 1 of the Opposition. It says, quote, the 
program does not secure the Government's 
substantial and legally protectable interest 
in the appropriate and supervised distribution 
of the estate's assets. 
What's your understanding of 
whose ro 
it should be to , quo e , supervise 
the 
i s ribution of the es ate's assets? 
A. 
The Government has an interest. 
It's the executor's role. 
There's no reason 
you can't set up this program and administer 
it to the satisfaction of the Government, I 
think, as we've done in other programs with 
the Government of the United States or states 
that have studied the program and gone along 
with the proposal. 
Q. 
Okay. On Page 3 of the Attorney 
General's letter, she notes that Virgin 
Islands law entitles victims of crimes to be 
treated with dignity and compassion, to be 
protected from intimidation, to be informed of 
their legal rights and to receive reparations 
for -physical and emotional injuries suffered 
as a result of being a victim of a violent 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
163 
bodily crime. 
Breaking that down, how many 
claimants have made themselves known, roughly, 
to the program so far? 
A. 
I think it's probably either known 
or in anticipation from talk with Plaintiff's 
lawyer, probably about fifty. There may be 
more. 
Once you announce a program, they will 
be gilded and they will come. 
But the goals 
set out in the Attorney General's Complaint is 
exactly the goal of this program - to satisfy 
the Attorney General and the estate and 
especially the victims in getting them prompt 
compensation. 
Q. 
To date are any of the claimants 
that have come forward, US Virgin Islands 
residents that you know of? 
A. 
I'm not aware of any. I don't 
know. 
Q. 
And Ms. George says, quote, under 
the framework of the fund, there's no 
obligation that the program Administrator be 
subj ect--wi thdrawn. 
On Page 4, on the long part of 
Page 4, Ms. George notes that the programs 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
164 
design, quote, would be in part determined by 
an undefined group of those with an interest 
in resolution of the sexual abuse claims made 
by Mr. Epstein's victims, and she complains 
that, quote, this group could include any 
number of individuals and entities, close 
quote. 
Who actually designed the 
program to the extent it's designed so far? 
A. 
The protocol was very transparent. 
The Administrator will be Jordana Feldman; the 
program has been designed by Ms. Biros and 
myself. It's been submitted to both the estate 
lawyers and the executor and it's been 
submitted to very distinguished Plaintiff 
Counsel. 
They have commented; we've 
redlined it; we are still reviewing it; but it 
is a very transparent process designed to get 
eligible claimants fast compensation. 
Q. 
Without restating what Ms. George 
said, do you understand that in administering 
the program, Ms. Feldman, you, and Ms. Biros 
will be subjected to the supervision and 
approval of this Court? 

Probate ST- 19- eB-0080 
165 
A. 
That's my understanding. 
Q. 
And do you understand that we are 
here because we sought the approval of the 
Court. 
We just didn't do it, right? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And once you developed the 
protocol, is it the plan of the executors and 
the funds administrators, independent though -
we do communicate - is there a joint plan to 
come back to the Court with the protocol for 
Your 
going 
Honor, 
A. 
Q. 
to be 
for the judge's 
approval? 
That is my understanding. 
And that happens before a cent 
paid out of the fund? 
A. 
That's my understanding. 
lS 
Q. 
And I asked Ms. Feldman a bunch of 
questions about would she listen to the 
Attorney General, has she heard from the 
Attorney General. 
I take it not only will the 
Co-Executors be willing to speak with the 
Attorney General, but you, Ms. Feldman, Ms. 
Biros, etcetera, will be willing to take her 
input? 
A. 
Whatever the Attorney General 
wants. 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
166 
Q. 
Okay. 
On Page 4, the Attorney 
General also complains that the Epstein 
--well, the program, quote, fails to specify 
what constitutes a sexual assault and who 
qualifies as a claimant. 
What in your experience is the 
program--what constitutes sexual assault i n 
this program? 
A. 
The submission by a Plaintiff's 
lawyer or prose claimant claiming that the 
alleged victim was abused in various ways, 
minimally to very, very extensively, here are 
all the circumstances given rise to that 
sexual 
abuse and the administrator will make 
a determination as to eligibility and as to 
the amount, if eligible, the amount of money 
that will be proffered or offered to that 
claimant. 
Q. 
It sounds like a whole bunch of 
questions. 
Is it fair to say that it's an 
extremely low bar for a person or her counsel 
to come forward and to participate in the 
program and then have a dialogue with the 
program about what is just compensation? 
A. 
Yes, it is. 
Much lower than a 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
167 
court 
of law. 
Q. 
And Ms. George expresses concern 
that, quote, children who were sexually abused 
by Mr. Epstein may mistakenly believe that 
they consented to this assault and may not 
recognize their eligibility for compensation. 
Of those that you're familiar 
with who has come forward, do any of them 
allege that they were minors when Mr. Epstein 
sexually abused them? 
A. 
I'm not aware of individual claims 
at this stage. 
Q. 
Combining a number of concerns 
that Ms. George has, why is there a window and 
a deadline and why does the program not just 
go on forever? 
I know Ms. Feldman addressed 
that, but can I hear from you? 
A. 
You can't have a program like this 
go on forever. It's not good for claimants. 
In the 911 fund, two thirds of all the 
claimants arrived and filed a claim in the 
last ninety days of a 33-month program. If you 
do not have a deadline, people procrastinate. 
It's human nature. 
So we try and set up a timeline 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
168 
that will provide claimants and their Counsel 
ample opportunity to file claims. We have 
discussed this, not only with the estate, but 
with the various lawyers representing 
claimants. 
Q. 
And if a claimant missed that 
window, will they still have recourse to the 
courts? 
to 
in 
to 
A. 
Not only will 
the courts, but as you 
certain circumstances, 
allow a late filing. 
Q. 
On Page 5 of 
they have recourse 
may understand, we, 
will bend the rules 
her letter, Ms. 
George urges that, quote, any program proposed 
to compensate Mr. Epstein's victims should 
counsel 
the psychological trauma of minors 
who often repress memories of their abuse by 
allowing them additional time for filing a 
claim instead of limiting time for filing. Do 
you feel the program give enough time? 
A. 
I think so and I agree with that 
statement, but I think that a nine-month 
program, as the word gets out, we should be 
able to get all eligible claimants to file. 
Q. 
And you just covered this but in 

Probate ST-1 9- PB- 0 080 
169 
your experience, the programs have cutoffs and 
then there is some flexibility that the 
administrator has to try to loop people in who 
for whatever reason has missed the time? 
A. 
In the 911 Victim Compensation 
Fund, 97% of all eligible claimants filed. In 
the GM Ignition Switch Traumatic Car Accident 
Program, over 95% filed and in all of these 
church sexual abuse cases, the overwhelming 
number, well in excess of 95%, filed within 
the deadline. 
Q. 
On Page 5, Ms. George continues 
and says, quote, the evidence requirement 
could potentially exclude deserving claimants, 
close quote, and says there's concern that the 
program will exclude victims or claimants who 
may be unable to document their claims. What's 
your reaction to that? 
A. 
That's a very legitimate concern. 
We think the way the protocol was drafted and 
the procedures that have been drafted will 
satisfy the Attorney General that we won't 
find eligible claimants deemed ineligible and 
that is a very real concern of ours in 
drafting the protocol. 

Probate ST- 19-PB-0080 
170 
Q. 
I mean, that's a very fine point I 
asked. It's not really clear to me whether the 
Attorney General is concerned about finding 
too many people eligible or finding too many 
people ineligible. 
I mean the goal of the program, 
right, is to figure out the people who are 
truly eligible and to accurately figure out 
what is just compensation? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
That's the whole game, right? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Okay. We covered the concern about 
being forced to come to New York or not being 
heard. 
If need be, could you envision corning 
down here, I guess you or Ms. Feldman coming 
down here if there's enough people here and 
meeting with claimants? 
A. 
Absolutely. 
Don't forget, what 
these people often want as much as 
compensation, if not more, is validation, is 
acknowledgment, the opportunity to be heard 
and this is something that is a very important 
voluntary aspect of the program. 
Q. 
Ms. George complains that the 

rrobate ST-19-eB-0080 
171 
program, quote, contains no assurances that 
the information submitted by a claimant cannot 
be later used against her if she thereafter 
decides to file suit against the estate or any 
other co-defendant. 
Is that criticism grounded in 
the 
way you see the program? 
A. 
No. 
No. The protocol expressly 
secures the confidentiality of anything 
provided by the claimant. The claimant, and 
the claimant alone, decides the extent of 
transparency or disclosure - not the program, 
not the administrator, or the estate. 
Q. 
A few more, on Page 6,there's a 
concern that notes, quote, the program 
provides no protection to claimants who 
voluntarily provide information that may later 
be used to defend the estate from claims or 
provides evidence against other victims. Does 
the program work that way? 
A. 
No. The program seals all the 
information and various common law and 
statutorial privileges apply. We've seen that 
in these other programs - attorney-client, 
etcetera; settlement discussions, etcetera 

Pr obate ST-1 9-PB- 0080 
172 
Q. 
Is one thing clear between you and 
the executor's and their counsel that you are 
independent, right? 
A. 
That's right. When the estate 
approached me --and the Court asked this 
question a little earlier. 
When the estate approached me 
and I recommended Ms. Feldman and Ms. Biros, I 
had certain preconditions based on my 
experience. 
One: Once the program is up and 
running, any decision made by Ms. Feldman as 
the Administrator is independent and may not 
be challenged by the estate. 
Second pre-condition, I asked 
the estate point blank, is there enough money 
in the program to indemnify all eligible 
claimants and the expressed answer I received 
from the estate is absolutely. 
There are 
sufficient funds in the estate to provide 
eligible claimants with generous compensation 
without resort to any cap or any artificial 
ceiling placed on an individual award. 
Now, I reminded the estate that 
in the 911 fund the compensation ranged from 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
173 
$250,000 a claim. 
We had a few claims in 
excess of five million dollars. In the GM 
Ignition Switch programs, the claims ranged 
from about $100,000 to a few million dollars 
and I wanted to be satisfied that in designing 
this protocol, the estate had suffici ent 
assets-- not only to fund the infrastructure, 
the budget, but albeit, 
sufficient funds 
without a cap for the administrator to f und in 
some cases perhaps multi-million dollar 
awards. The estate has assured me and Ms. 
1.2 
Feldman that there are sufficient funds so 
that any reasonable program with maybe fifty 
or one hundred, maybe more claimants, there 
will be claimants that will received, I 
suspect, multi- million dollar awards and there 
would be claimants deemed ineligible because 
Ms. Feldman is correct that when you build one 
of these programs, there will be certain 
claimants who will file and will be found 
ineligible . 
So in response to the Court, 
I can't say yet without examining the claims 
whether the average claim will be one hundred 
thousand dollars, a million dollars, two 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
174 
million dollars but the protocol anticipates 
any claimant deemed eligible can be valued by 
the Administrator without regard to limited 
funds. 
Some other plaintiffs' counsel 
raised this; I've raised this with David 
Boies; 
I've raised this with Brad Edwards; 
I've raised this with other Plaintiff's 
counsel. 
There is no cap and Plaintiff's 
Counsel have been assured that they should 
participate in this program. 
Q. 
Directing your attention to when 
Ms. George says on Page 7 of her letter, 
quote, the range of compensation must be 
available to claimants before filing. 
It goes 
on to say, quote, the potential range of 
compensation available for each claim should 
be provided in advance, close quote. 
Based on your experience, is 
that the way you generally develop the 
protocol? 
A. 
Can't be. Until we examine the 
claims and the allegations and the 
circumstantial evidence of abuse, you can't 
begin to anticipate variations among 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
175 
claimants. You can't develop a public matrix 
that will, I think, raise false expectations 
as to what the ranges would be. 
There's a 
certain degree of discretion that the 
independent administrator must have once 
reviewing the entire file to determine 
eligible compensation. 
Q. 
If the claimant wishes, this 
includes an interview with Ms. Feldman, 
correct? 
A. 
At the claimant's option. 
Not 
required. 
Failure to request a hearing won't 
adversely impact the administrator. That's 
something that the claimant must decide with 
his or her lawyer. 
Q. 
A few more. On Page 6, Ms. George 
says, quote, the absence of clear and precise 
parameters for inclusion or exclusion in the 
program fails to provide appropriate guidance 
to ensure potential claimants will not be left 
out. Specifically, without clear criteria, 
potential claimants neither have the 
information or confidence to approach the 
fund. 
We've been over this, basically, 

Probate ST-19-PB~OOBO 
176 
you believe you've been sexually abused and 
you show up, that is sufficient? 
I mean, do 
you feel there is a need for more 
infrastructure at the front end? 
A. 
In the draft protocol that we 
hope to finalize with the approval of this 
Court, we lay out in some pretty clear 
language the criteria that the administrator 
looks at. It's similar to what we're looking 
at now in the Catholic Church sexual abuse 
cases in five states. It's basically that type 
of criteria. It's not exclusive but we think 
that provides the claimant, and I think the 
Attorney General, with a pretty good blueprint 
of what Ms. Feldman will be looking at in 
administering this voluntary program. 
Q. 
Ms. George makes the statement 
that the program administrator's ability to 
award compensation, quote, makes it less 
likely that each claimant receives the 
compensation to which she is fairly and 
impartially entitled. 
Your view on that? 
A. 
Well, I just said that is not 
true. 
As long as there's no cap on the 
program, as long as Administrator Feldman can 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
177 
render an independent decision as to each 
claim without regard to any cap, based on the 
state's representations, I don't think any 
eligible claimant is going to be shortchanged 
by the number of eligible claimants. 
Q. 
So far, I just want to ask you, do 
you agree that one of the themes that the 
Attorney General is pointing towards is 
concern that any claimant will somehow be 
disadvantaged, not receive enough 
consideration, there might be a cap on what 
they may get. 
In other words concern that 
people would come forward and state that they 
have been victimized and become claimants, 
they need to be treated as well as possible? 
A. 
I think that's right. 
I think 
it's a fair concern but I think the protocol 
addresses that concern and ensures that each 
claimant will receive an independent valuation 
without regard to available, other available 
funds. 
Q. 
You've already addressed this, but 
the demand that Ms. George makes on Page 7 is 
that the program, quote, should disclose any 
limits on the amounts of compensation 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
individually or collectively - speaking of 
compensation to claimants. 
In your view, should those 
178 
amounts be disclosed? 
You know, married to an 
identifier of the claimant? 
In other words, 
Cl aimant named A,B,C receives X,Y,Z? 
A. 
No. I don't think claimants in 
particular, claimants in particular don't want 
amounts that they've received to be disclosed 
and the protocol spells out expressly that 
there is no cap or no limit on the amount of 
individual compensation. 
Q. 
Right. She says the quote 
addresses disclosing limits. 
You don't want a 
l imit? 
A. 
That's right. 
Q. 
If a claimant doesn't like the 
compensation award she receives, can she 
reject it? 
A. 
Of course, very few do if we do 
our job right, but the answer is yes. 
Q. 
I was just going to ask you, in 
your experience with just a couple of the 
funds that you've run, what has been the 
acceptance rate exactly? 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
179 
A. 
All of the funds that I've 
administered, the acceptance rate is above 90% 
and that's because the programs have very 
quick -- I think Ms. Feldman was a little 
guarded. 
I think in this program since it's 
been delayed in up and running, I think the 
compensation decisions once made, people will 
be paid within a week and I'll be very 
surprised --it will be a first --if we don't 
have the vast number of eligible claimants 
paid quickly. 
Q. 
And then are you---well, Ms. 
George said that --this is on Page 7 again. 
There is a lot on Page 7. 
She says, quote, 
the waiver of requirement is unjust 
referring to the waiver requirement that, I 
think this is what she is terming the 
waiver--that if somebody receives 
compensation, she must give a global release. 
Do you view that as unjust or necessary? 
A. 
I don't view it as unjust. 
It's a 
voluntary program. If the claimant and her 
lawyer don't feel that the compensation that's 
offered by Ms. Feldman is fai r or just or 
reasonable, they opt out and continue to 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
180 
litigate or pursue other remedies. 
Q. 
Is the estate vulnerable to third 
party claims and how does that work if, in 
fact, the estate does not receive a general 
release from a compensated claimant? 
A. 
That's a very interesting 
provocative question raised by the Attorney 
General and others. 
And as Ms. Feldman stated 
earlier, the scope of the release has not yet 
been finalized. The estate has to make a 
decision. Does it want total peace? 
Ms. Feldman, you will pay what 
ever is necessary to secure a comprehensive 
release so we won't be cross-claimed by a 
claimant or alternatively now, if a claimant 
wants to release the estate but litigate 
against X or Y, that is up to the claimant. 
So that is a critical issue and 
you can argue both ways and I think that the 
estate and the administrator and the 
plaintiffs' lawyers are discussing that at 
this time. 
Q. 
Page 8, Ms. George complains that 
the program, quote, does not specify whether 
the administrator is permitted or required to 

181 
share evidence with law enforcement, thus 
positioning the program as a potential means 
to conceal criminal activity, close quote~ I 
take it that wasn't an accusation that you're 
trying to conceal anything, but in any event, 
what's your view on that? 
A. 
In the forty years that I've 
designed and administered these programs, law 
enforcement has never sought to secure any 
civil confidential information. 
In the church cases, the 
Attorney General of various states have come 
to us and said, you know, you have a lot of 
information about wrongdoings by Clergy and we 
refused to--we work out with the Attorney 
General, go see the diocese or the Church. 
Don't come to a program where claimants, 
individual victims have participated in a 
program on the absolute guarantee of the 
administrator that information that have been 
submitted will not be disclosed to anybody. 
And that is a very important part of this. 
Claimants do not want information disclosed. 
Q. 
The program, would it respect that 
wish of claimants? 

Probate ST-1 9-PB-0080 
182 
A. 
It's expressly spelled out in the 
protocol, yes. 
Q. 
And they can still go to law 
enforcement. Period. 
Full stop. It's up to 
them? 
A. 
It's up to them and they can go 
public. That's up to them. 
The estate cannot. 
The administrator cannot. 
Q. 
On Page 8, Ms. George says that 
the program, quote, presents an unavoidable 
conflicts of interest, close quote, between 
the executors and the program. She said, the 
Co-Executors have, quote, an inescapable 
conflict of interest in recommending a program 
that proposes to compensate any individual or 
entity making such allegations requiring in 
return overly broad releases. Do you have a 
view on this? 
A. 
You have to ask the estate on 
that. I can tell you that before we agreed to 
take on this assignment, Ms. Feldman and 
myself and Ms. Biros, we have received 
absolute assurances from the estate that they 
will play no role in the day-to-day 
administration of this program. 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
183 
Q. 
Okay. So when it comes to the time 
to set what is viewed as just compensation for 
claimants anywhere, for me, my clients, one of 
the Co-Executors, other counsel, zeror right? 
S 
A. 
No. Zero. 
Q. 
And in terms of your 
understanding, just from your long experience 
of the Co-Executors, in viewing them so far, 
do you view them there as exercising their 
fiduciary duty appropriately? 
A. 
In this case? 
Q. 
In this program? 
A. 
Very much so. The estate has made 
it clear from day one they want to create an 
independent claims program to quickly and 
efficiently resolve these sexual abuse claims 
against the estate in a manner that is 
efficient, cost effective and satisfies their 
fiduciary duties. 
There have been no problems. They 
have worked closely with us as have the 
Plaintiff's lawyers in designing and 
implementing this program. 
Q. 
And Ms. George goes on to say on 
Page 9 that,quote, disclosure of conflicts is 

P~obat e ST-19-PB-0080 
184 
critical to allow the Court to evaluate the 
ability of the program to engage in error and 
impartial arms length negotiations or 
resolutions. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Your Honor, if I 
may, Counsel is referring to a letter; there's 
no letter that's before the Court that's from 
the Attorney General. He's referring to a 
motion. It's not a letter. There's no 
communication with the Attorney General to the 
estate. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Sorry. 
THE COURT: I've been reading along 
on the Motion. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK= It's in the 
mot·on , Your Honor . I have been referring to 
it as a letter. Thank you very much. 
By Attorney Tornback : 
Q. 
So let's assume there is a 
conflict in some way that the Executor has 
with something-- I don't know what. Would that 
matter in terms of the determination that the 
program makes? 
A. 
No. Under the protocol and under 
the agreement, once this program is up and 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
185 
running, Ms. Feldman examines every claim and 
makes an independent judgment as to 
eligibility first and valuation second. 
Q. 
And the next to the last, we've 
covered the concern about undisclosed costs 
and the budget and the engagement letter. 
So 
I want to address that. 
The last thing on Page 9 that Ms. 
George asserts the program as proposed, quote, 
offers no reconciliation or accountability 
because, quote, there's no disclosure of Mr. 
Epstein's conduct, the number of victims or 
the amount of awards paid. 
Does the program in anyway 
discourage disclosure of Mr. Epstein's or 
anybody's conduct related to him? 
A. 
No. This program is about 
compensating victims quickly. 
Whether or not 
there's criminal activity or criminal 
investigation or what have you, this program 
is focused strictly on determining eligible 
compensation and paying those victims who 
have waited so long for compensation. 
Q. 
Besides the specific identify, 
will the number of victims, the amount of 

Probate ST-19-eB- 0080 
awards paid by the program be disclosed and 
provided to the Court for its review? 
A. 
You'll have to ask the estate 
that. I'm assuming that there would be some 
degree of obligation on the part of the 
186 
administrator to keep the Court i nformed about 
the progress and scope of the program. 
Q. 
If this program does not go 
forward in real speed, in real time, in your 
view based on your experience with similar 
programs, what is the likely outcome? 
A. 
It will be a tragedy. It will be a 
tragedy not to quickly try and compensate as 
many victims as come forward who are eligible. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, I 
welcome any questions you may have of Mr. 
Feinberg. I'm done. 
THE COURT: I don't believe the 
concern is o 
the p ogram an 
what the program 
is designed to accomplish or whether the 
persons who have been engaged to design this 
program have the experience, knowledge and can 
3 
get it done. 
No one has addressed for me --and 
I keep coming back to that --I'm still at I go 

Probat e ST-19-PB-0080 
187 
forward with the program and how do I do that 
with what the Government of the Virgin Islands 
has filed because the program requires a 
significant expenditure of monies, right, and 
it is the victims come in, I understand you 
would like a quick turn around, but victims 
could have awards of millions of dollars and 
then the Government of the Virgin Islands is 
here saying the estate has been dissipated. 
We've proceeded with the 
program; you knew we had this lien; assets of 
the estate were converted to cash to satisfy 
the claims. That ' s where I am. 
I never had 
any concerns about the program and how the 
program would work. 
And as the claimant's counsel 
who were present said everybody agrees the 
program is what they want. 
They just wanted 
to know what is the money to establish the 
program. We now have a budget and now we have 
that the awards can be any amount depending on 
how the victim presents what she is able to or 
can show the administrator, but we still come 
back to this lien on everything of the estate. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: Your Honor, 

Probate ST- 19-PB- 0080 
188 
we'll speak to it right now. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: But can I just 
point out one last thing before we do that. If 
you look at the prayer for relief of the 
Attorney General, correct, I mean it basically 
summarizes that the Attorney General wants all 
the money. 
THE COURT: Yes, I got that. She 
wants everything. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: But the Attorney 
General, in her Complaint and in her Motion To 
Intervene has put forth--I think the witnesses 
have been completely clear--it's sort of--I 
don't think intentionally --but sort of fake 
facts about the program. 
I just want to put 
the cap on that. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: I don't 
understand why the Attorney General ~stalking 
about the program and why the Attorney General 
is even criticizing the program. 
If she's 
basically just saying I want to take all the 
money, right, and I want to deny the victims 
the right to the program and I want to try to 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
gum up the entire estate, well, sure, we'll 
talk to the Attorney General. 
I don't 
189 
underst~nd, but we'll grapple with the merits 
of her claim but the merits of her criticisms 
w· h 
he program is why M. Feinberg is here 
and Ms. Feldman and I'm asking questions and 
why the Plaintiffs, I presume, are defending 
the program. I'm just saying they don't have 
any merit and I want to move on. 
THE COURT: You talked to the 
Attorney General. 
I let you address the 
Attorney General's concern. 
My concern was 
how much money are we talking about to fund 
the program for this Court to approve and you 
say to the executors, you can fund this 
program; 
you can set this up, right. 
I 
didn't go into the merits of the program 
because I have where all the claims that are 
filed, everybody said they support the 
program. 
The issue is, and I keep bringing 
it back, is how does this Court fund this 
program if I have what the Attorney General 
has set an action in process in the civil 
court and has filed a lien that says you 

Probate ST-19- PB-0080 
190 
cannot use any assets of the estate? 
Wouldn't I have to move 
significant assets over to this program if you 
are going to compensate victims within 12 to 
days? 
That's what it is. 
But you're saying the Attorney 
General, whether or not she's not compensating 
any particular vie ims , s e is seeking to 
compensate the People of the Virgin Islands 
that is her client. That is who she 
represents. 
Now, if you want to go over to 
the civil court and say she has no merits to 
say I should take what the estate has, that 
the People can't show why she should be 
entitled to that --and I see it in the 
complaint - - an 
I did have the Complaint 
before me. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Well, to be 
honest, I don't want to get into the merits 
but it's not quite as simple as the Attorney 
General might think. 
THE COURT: But that is not for me 
to determine, right? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: 
Right. 

Proba te ST-19-PB- 0080 
191 
THE COURT: Another Judge is going 
to handle that. 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: What I want to 
say are two things. 
One, in terms of what 
the Attorney General can do here, you know, 
t here are other law enforcement authorities. 
There is a house in New York; there's a ranch 
in New Mexico; and it will be a shame if the 
Attorney General, as I understand it, has not 
been in contact with the United States 
Attorney General for the Southern District of 
New York which still has the active 
investigation going. 
It would be a shame if 
we have a battle between law enforcement 
agencies and it destroys the ability of the 
estate to address the vict ims. 
Your Honor, I just want to say 
on my own behalf that I hope that the Attorney 
General, through the presentation of Ms. 
Feldman and Mr. Feinberg that she could at 
l east claim to be interested in the victims 
and I think that we have tried to make a case 
to her here that this is a good program that 
will help the victims. 
So hopefully we can make some 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
192 
progress in figuring out how much the Attorney 
General needs in terms of cash in the estate 
to let the program go forward. 
THE COURT: 
Maybe that is what you 
have to talk to the Attorney ·General about. 
That is why I keep saying maybe the estate 
needs to talk to the Attorney General and the 
Attorney General will say, you know what? 
I 
filed this lien, but maybe I will release so 
much to fund the program, but to me, the 
Attorney General has taken a lien on 
everything this estate has. 
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honor, may I be 
heard just in response? 
THE COURT: Sir? 
THE WITNESS: This has happened 
occasionally in other programs that I've 
designed. 
THE COURT: Okay. Somebody help me. 
THE WITNESS: For example, 
sometimes the Government says we're interested 
in seizing or freezing the assets because we 
want to make sure that through restitution and 
civil and criminal fines there will be enough 
money available from the estate to compensate 

Probate ST-19-PB- 0080 
193 
eligible victims. 
Well, in this program, I would 
hope based on the testimony that the AG of the 
Virgin Islands will see no reason to freeze 
for purposes of restitution and fines owing to 
the victims because the victims, under the 
estate plan, will be compensated quickly 
without regard to the public in ervening . 
And 
he second point I think 
you've made very very clear. 
In my experience 
that if the estate and distinguished Counsel 
sit down with the Attorney General now that 
the Attorney General has a better 
understanding, I think, of the program that 
Your Honor has elicited from the testimony, I 
would like to think that the Attorney General 
and distinguished Counsel shall be able to 
work out a solution for these women, the 
innocent victims of this delay. 
That's the 
real dilemma here. 
THE COURT: 
Right. 
And that's 
what I am saying because, right, if we have 
the lien and it's a question of, remember we 
said we have to go and research it, what is 
that lien? 
That lien seems to take everything 

Probate ST-19-eB- 0080 
194 
because it begins with the estate and all 
these assets are sitting in the estate held by 
the decedent, right, of these corporations, 
all the shares and all these shares, the 
corporations own the real property. So title 
is in the decedent. 
So the Attorney General has come 
in and she put a lien on all that property. 
Even if I wanted to fund that program, what 
could I safely move over to that program that 
doesn't impact what I've now been put on 
notice there's nothing that I can transfer. 
And so I think we now understand 
the program and I thank you for your testimony 
and Ms. Feldman. 
We now understand the 
program better, right, not just on paper but 
understanding how it will work through your 
testimony. 
Claimants attorneys have heard 
the testimony on how this program is designed 
to work. We may just need to tweak with the 
development of the release, the protocol has 
been changed in some way. 
Can it be that this 
Court can safely, with the consent of the 
Attorney General, move so much money into that 

Probate ST-19-PB-OO BO 
195 
program to then allow that program to proceed 
to start compensating the victims/claimants in 
the manner in which Counsel present want it 
done without impacting what the Attorney 
General believes she has to do as her legal 
representative of the People of the Virgin 
Islands? 
Can that be something that can be 
done? 
I've heard it all today, but I 
keep saying, I have this lien. 
I know she 
opposes--and you know what? 
I don't even 
think the Attorney General has to go to oppose 
the program. 
All she had to do is file a 
lien; you're stopped. I filed a lien and 
you're stopped, right? 
ATTORNEY TOMBACK: But just to 
put a fine point on this, Your Honor, and Mr. 
Feinberg used the word tragic; I would use the 
word waste. 
But if a terrible waste if the 
way in which the Court views its jurisdiction 
and the Attorney General views its 
responsibilities, we'll see the estate really 
getting, and able to pay for litigation and 
ultimately probable able to pay for claims 
simply because there are enough assets in the 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
196 
United States to pay for those claims, but to 
go down that road and not be able to fund the 
program which is a much better option, I think 
for all. 
So we will work with the Attorney 
General to get something done. 
THE COURT: I keep thinking you 
are missing what I am saying. She has taken a 
lien on the entire estate. 
She's not taking a 
lien on Little St. James only. She's taking a 
lien on the entire estate and say no assets 
can be taken out and her lien is a priority 
lien. It specifically says nothing can be 
taken out so if I approve the funding of the 
program, you start talking, the claimant's 
come in; you start awarding claims. 
You know 
what I asked Ms. Feldman, so can I then tell 
the victims, now just wait until whatever 
resolves itself down here in the VI and you 
said no. 
That defeats the whole purpose of 
the program. Right? 
And we can have claims 
where it could be- a multi-million dollar claim 
that a person gets or you would have thirty 
cases so far. 
Thirty people, all get 20 
million dollars. 
Well, now the executor has 
to be able to pay over this money but we have 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
197 
this action going on that no, he can't. 
So it has to be worked out with 
something either hold back to some extent and 
the Attorney General say, yes, I understand 
now. 
This program has been fully presented. 
The claimants attorneys are all in support of 
it because it will give quick resolution for 
settlement of these victims. 
They can be 
compensated. 
There's a spread, depending on 
what evidence they present but we need to be 
able to move so much of those assets of the 
Epstein estate over there to that program. And 
I think it just comes to that. 
So talk, I think you people need 
to talk; the two sides need to speak. I 've not 
allowed the Attorney General to intervene so 
the AG did not hear any questions but I'm 
still left where I know that I have been put 
on notice that this lien is there. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Your 
Honor? 
THE COURT: Yes. 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: If I may, 
we filed a supplemental brief in this matter, 
Your Honor . 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
198 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: It does address 
the issues Your Honor has raised. 
THE COURT: Did you file a 
Supplemental brief? When? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, we did. 
Last Friday. 
THE COURT: Last Friday? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yeah. 
THE COURT: What is the date? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: The 31st. 
THE COURT: Okay, then I have to 
get to that. And you addressed that? 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: It addresses the 
issue, one about the priority of the lien, 
Your Honor . 
The Attorney General, when they 
filed that says that the lien takes priority, 
they cut off the last sentence of the Statute 
and it clearly says that the lien takes 
priority and it says overall interest if the 
interest is acquired subsequent to the filing 
of the notice. 
THE COURT: That's a beneficial 
interest in it. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your Honor. 
But what we've addressed is that the lien 

Probate ST-19-PB-0080 
199 
doesn't actually have a super priority; it has 
other things come before it and it's the issue 
of priority. 
And we also filed in the brief 
that we believe because the decedent died and 
the money went to the estate, this Court took 
control of the money. 
It's not some other 
Court that has control of the money; they 
didn't file the lien prior to the death so 
therefore this Court has control of all of 
decedent's money and the distribution of it. 
They can file a lien and seek 
for a claim in this court, but as far as 
freezing the assets, we don't believe that 
they can and it's addressed in our 
Supplemental Brief .. 
THE COURT: Okay. I may have 
overlooked that. Then I will find that. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Thank you, 
Your Honor. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Just the same, 
we would like an opportunity to respond, Your 
Honor, cause we just got it on Friday. Sorry, 
we got it yesterday at five clock by mail so 
they didn't really want to have us have an 
opportunity to respond. 

Probate ST-19-ea- OOBO 
200 
THE COURT: Well, Okay. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: That's not 
true, Your Honor. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: It is true. 
THE COURT: Okay. The bottom line 
is, Attorney Kroblin, I've not seen it. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: I understand, 
Your Honor. I just wanted to bring it to the 
Court's attention. 
THE COURT: I'm going to look at 
it. You may have given me where I can begin 
the research on this. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: Yes, Your Honor. 
Just as far a briefing goes for us to 
understand whether the Government, the lien, 
cause in its papers that has been filed 
although the lien seems very broad in the 
papers that they've filed, they say they 
didn't want to impede in any way the victims 
and their being cqmpensated. 
THE COURT: I did note that. 
ATTORNEY KROBLIN: So it seems 
that the Government actually has carved out 
from the lien what would be this program and 
any payment to victims. 
So we would like some 

P%obate ST-19- PB- 008 0 
201 
clarity on the Government's position whether 
it 1 s actually seeks to impede the process of 
paying victims or if the lien specifically 
carves out the program of the victims. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: You are free to 
speak t o the Attorney General about that 
issue. 
THE COURT: 
Yes, we know. He l S 
just a designee here. What is the extent of 
the lien, correct? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: Yes. 
THE COURT: 
And I read the 
extent of the lien to be everythi ng. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: That is what it 
provides, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: But you said you had a 
Supplemental Brief and I would definitely look 
for that. 
ATTORNEY SMITH: And, Your Honor, 
we would just ask for a seven-day period to 
respond to that. 
THE COURT: A seven--
ATTORNEY SMITH: Seven days. 
THE COURT: Oh, I thought you said 
seven weeks. 

Probate ST- 19- PB- 00B0 
202 
ATTORNEY SMITH: No. 
Seven days 
to respond to it because we just literally got 
it yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock. 
THE COURT: Sorry. 
You may step 
down from the witness stand. 
[Witness excused] 
You know what? So the Court is 
going to--I've now received the testimony of 
the interested parties concerning this 
Voluntary Claims Resolution Program. I'm going 
to allow persons to file in seven days, you 
have the response to the Supplemental Brief 
--I do have to find that--any claimants' 
attorneys who wish to file any memorandums of 
law or anything what you believe can guide the 
Court, again the seven days. 
This Court is going to make a 
quick turn around on its decision concerning 
whether it can go ahead to fund this program, 
yes or no on the motion that you have. 
So is 
that fair enough, seven days? 
ATTORNEY SMITH: To file the brief, 
Your Honor, yes. 
THE COURT: And anybody else, file 
any response, any information, any guidance, 

?r oba t e ST-1 9- P.E- 0080 
203 
any memorandum of law that you believe will 
assist the Court, because I think I've dealt 
with all motions before this Court. 
The only 
one remaining is the creation --no, the 
funding of this program through the assets of 
this estate. Correct, and will be determined 
then how the Court reads that lien that has 
been filed by the Attorney General and in the 
time where you are preparing your briefs or 
your memorandum of law or whatever you believe 
you need to file with the Court, I ask both 
sides, Attorney Smith, Attorney Tepper, 
please, Attorney Blum, Attorney Kroblin, 
Attorney Whalen, and all the attorneys for the 
estate, to see if we can meet cause I 
understand the Attorney General's position and 
her arguments, but I also understand what the 
estate is trying to achieve as to the victims, 
the alleged victims who are represented by 
their counsels who wish this program to be put 
into place so they can proceed because I 
really agree, the program is going to save 
time and money and especially in attorneys' 
fees. 
It has to be a more effective way of 
marshalling the assets than bo h sides 

Probate ST-19- PB- 0080 
204 
I 
engaging counsel going into courtsl but I have 
' 
to understand how, why I'm researching to see 
if this lien just tie up everythin~ of the 
estate. 
Maybe the parties on thei~ own could 
come to some resolution and say we l have so

Legal Fees Cross New Mark: $1,500 an Hour

Body
The day of the $1,500-an-hour lawyer has arrived.
Partners at some of the nation's top law firms are approaching -- and, in a few cases, surpassing -- that watershed 
billing rate, making the $1,000-an-hour legal fees that once seemed so steep look quaint by comparison.
Despite low inflation and weak demand for legal services, rates at large corporate law firms have risen by 3% to 4% 
a year since the economic downturn, according to Citi Private Bank's Law Firm Group.
"We just raise them every year," said John Altorelli, a finance lawyer at DLA Piper LLP in New York, who says the 
firm has set his rate at more than $1,500 an hour. Mr. Altorelli, who filed for personal bankruptcy in 2014 to halt a 
legal battle with the estate of his former law firm, Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, cracked the $1,000-an-hour mark a 
decade ago. His fees have risen steadily ever since.
To soften the blow to clients, Mr. Altorelli does more than half his work on some kind of fixed-fee basis. "Using 
hourly rates is really anachronistic, but we still do it," he said.

Legal Fees Cross New Mark: $1,500 an Hour

Raising rates ensures that law firms keep up with the competition and helps them wrest more money from clients, 
who routinely demand discounts for all but the most sensitive work.
"If you think of the rules of supply and demand, how in the world can they keep raising their rates?" said Jeff Carr, a 
former general counsel of oil-and-gas services and equipment company FMC Technologies who for years has been 
an outspoken opponent of hourly legal rates.
The rate creep has boosted law firms' revenue at a time when many of them are under pressure from lower-cost 
legal-service providers and corporate clients that are keeping more legal work in-house. Revenue at law firms rose 
4% last year, according to Wells Fargo Private Bank's Legal Specialty Group, though demand rose just 0.5%.
"Lots of law firms will charge whatever the market can bear," said the head of one of the nation's 200 largest law 
firms.
Documents filed in chapter 11 bankruptcy cases offer a rare public glimpse at mounting fees. These court filings 
show the rates of partners specializing in corporate restructuring, as well as those with specialties like tax, litigation 
and corporate law.
A review of filings over the past three months in about two dozen bankruptcy cases shows that senior partners 
routinely charge between $1,200 and $1,300 an hour, with top rates at several large law firms exceeding $1,400.
Proskauer Rose LLP's hourly partner billing rate has climbed as high as $1,475, while Ropes & Gray LLP's tops out 
at $1,450, court papers show.
Kirkland & Ellis LLP's top hourly billing rate is now $1,445. And rates at two firms -- Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & 
Feld LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP -- peak at $1,425 an hour.
Representatives of the law firms declined to comment.
In disclosing their firmwide rate increases, many firms tell the courts it is a standard way of keeping pace with 
"economic and other conditions." These include rising fixed costs, such as real estate and salaries.
Still, only elite lawyers can charge $1,400 an hour or more. Such rates are found almost exclusively in New York 
and other major markets, and only in the least price-sensitive fields, such as mergers and acquisitions, 
restructuring, tax, antitrust and high-stakes litigation and appeals.
For lawyers at the very top of those fields, hourly rates can hit $1,800 or even $1,950.
"You have a very few people at the very top where price is almost no object," said legal consultant Bruce MacEwen, 
who likens it to the way celebrities, sports stars and best-selling authors are paid. "It is a talent market."
Most lawyers in the U.S. fall well below those high marks. In a survey of in-house legal departments by BTI 
Consulting Group, the average highest rate paid for law-firm partners was $875 an hour in 2015, up more than 27% 

Legal Fees Cross New Mark: $1,500 an Hour
Page 3 of 3
from three years earlier. Of the respondents, 38% had paid more than $1,000 an hour for a lawyer, and the highest 
rate those in the survey paid was $1,600 an hour.
For many firms, the stated rate is simply a starting point in discussions with corporate law departments. As a result, 
said legal consultant Ward Bower of Altman Weil, "sophisticated" law firms tend to implement annual rate increases 
to offset clients' requests for discounts.
Such discounts are becoming more commonplace. A decade ago, law firms could typically get clients to pay around 
92% of their stated rates, according to Thomson Reuters Peer Monitor. Last year, that fell to less than 83%.
Smaller companies can get squeezed the most on fees, because they don't send enough work to any one law firm 
to get the best deals.
Companies with $4 billion or more in annual revenue were twice as likely as those with less than $100 million in 
revenue to use some form of alternative fee, according to a survey from industry trade group the Association of 
Corporate Counsel.
Some industry watchers view the raise-and-discount approach with skepticism.
"If clients are pushing back on rates, the answer isn't to raise them" and then ask for a discount, Mr. MacEwen said. 
"The answer is to provide better total value."

AFFIDAVIT OF DANIEL H. WEINER 
I, Daniel H. Weiner, Esq., declare and affirm as follows: 
1. 
I am an attorney admitted to practice in Florida and New York. I am admitted pro 
hac vice to practice in the Virgin Islands in connection with this probate proceeding (the 
"Probate Action"). 
2. 
I am a 1981 graduate cum laude of Princeton University and a 1984 graduate of 
the New York University School of Law. Since 1993, I have been a partner at Hughes Hubbard 
and Reed LLP ("Hughes Hubbard"), counsel for Darren K. Indyke as Co-Executor of the estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein in the Probate Action. 
3. 
I attach as Exhibit A a copy of my professional profile as posted on Hughes 
Hubbard's website. The facts contained therein are true and accurate. 
4. 
My current standard hourly billing rate is $1,450. Clients customarily pay this 
rate for my services. 
5. 
In my representation of Mr. Indyke, I charged $1,315 per hour for hours billed in 
in January 2020, which was my standard rate at the time and reflects a 9% discount from my 
current standard rates. For hours billed in 2021, I charged $1,251 per hour, which reflects a 10% 

discount from my standard rate at the time of $1,390 per hour and a 13.7% discount from my 
current standard rates. The Epstein Estate pays these rates for my representation of Mr. Indyke. 
6. 
My hourly rates are customary and reasonable for similarly experienced attorneys 
practicing law with firms similar to Hughes Hubbard in New York City. 
7. 
I attach as Exhibit B a chart showing my contemporaneous time entries relating to 
the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, as those terms are defined in the Motion for Award of Costs 
and Attorneys' Fees and Incorporated Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof, filed herewith. 
The services for which I charged were actually and necessarily performed in connection with the 
GVI Motions and GVI Appeal. 
8. 
I affirm and declare under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States of 
America that the foregoing is true and correct.

GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS' 
OPPOSITION TO CO-EXECUTORS' MOTION FOR AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES 
The Government of the United States Virgin Islands ("Government") hereby responds in 
opposition to the Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees brought by the Co-Executors of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Epstein Estate") (the "Epstein Estate's Motion") regarding the 
Government's Motion to Intervene in the Probate Action, the Government's Emergency Motion 
to Immediately Freeze All Assets and Cash on Hand, and the Government's Notice of Appeal and 
Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders. 
The Epstein Estate's Motion is baseless and should be denied. First, the Epstein Estate is 
not entitled to attorneys' fees, because the underlying orders are not "judgment[ s ]" and the Epstein 
Estate is not the "prevailing party". Second, even if underlying orders were judgments and the 
Epstein Estate was the prevailing party-both of which are not true-the Court should exercise its 
discretion to deny the Epstein Estate's request for attorneys' fees. Requiring the Government to 
pay the Epstein Estate's attorneys' fees when the Government may ultimately prevail in its claims 
and is acting as a law enforcement agency to protect the public is contrary to the policy behind 
section 541. Third, the Epstein Estate's request for over $112,000 in attorneys' fees is extremely 
unreasonable. 

GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED ST ATES VIRGIN ISLANDS' OPPOSITION TO 
CO-EXECUTORS' MOTION FOR AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES 
In the Matter of the Estate of: Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Case No. ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No. ST-20 l 9-PB-00080 
Page2 
BACKGROUND 
On January 15, 2020, the Government filed a lawsuit against the Estate, the 1953 Trust, 
and numerous Epstein business affiliates and associates for violation of the Criminally Influenced 
and Corrupt Organization Act (''CICO"), 14 V.I.C. § 600 et seq., and civil conspiracy, seeking 
forfeiture and divestment of assets in favor of the Government, civil penalties, damages, and other 
remedies (a redacted copy of the Government's Second Amended Complaint is attached as 
Government Exhibit 1 ). The Government alleges that for decades Jeffrey Epstein conducted an 
enterprise whereby he used his web of businesses in the Virgin Islands to transport female victims, 
many of them children, to his privately-owned Little St. James Island, where they were sexually 
abused, injured, and held captive in violation of Virgin Islands criminal laws. See Ex. 1, 2d 
Amend. Compl. ,I,I 43-75. The Government further alleges that Southern Trust Company, Inc.-
a Virgin Islands corporation of which Jeffrey Epstein was President/Director and Co-Executors 
Darren K. lndyke and Richard D. Kahn were corporate officers-committed fraud against the 
Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority by claiming at least $80.5 million in unearned 
tax benefits. See id. at ,r,r 157-176. 
On January 23, 2020, the Government filed its Motion to Intervene in the Probate Action 
("Government's Motion to Intervene") and on February 4, 2021, the Government filed its 
Emergency Motion to Immediately Freeze All Assets and Cash on Hand ("Government's Motion 
to Freeze Assets"). On February 26, 2021, the Court denied the Government's Motion to Intervene 
without prejudice and directed the Government to file a claim in the Epstein Estate instead of 
seeking to intervene. The Court also struck the Government's Motion to Freeze Assets.

In the Matter of the Estate of: Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Case No. ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No. ST-20 l 9-PB-00080 
Page3 
The Court's orders on the Government's Motion to Intervene and the Government's 
Motion to Freeze Assets were formally issued on February 26, 2021. On March 17, 2021, the 
Government filed its Notice of Appeal and Petition for Review of Magistrate Judge's Orders 
("Government's Petition for Review") pursuant to V.I. Super. Ct. R. 322(b)(l) and/or 322.l(b). 
On February 4, 2022, the Court denied the Government's Petition for Review with 
prejudice, finding that the underlying orders were not final judgments eligible for appeal. 
On February 22, 2022, the Government filed a claim in the Epstein Estate. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
THE EPSTEIN EST ATE IS NOT ENTITLED TO ATTORNEYS' FEES UNDER 
SECTION 541 
Section 541 (b) provides that courts may award attorneys' fees to "the prevailing party in 
the judgment." 5 V.I.C. § 541. 1 Here, the underlying orders are not "judgment[s]" and the Epstein 
Estate is not the "prevailing party." Thus, the Epstein Estate's requests for attorneys' fees should 
be denied. 
A. 
The Orders Underlying the Epstein's Estate's Request For Attorneys' Fees 
Are Not Judgments 
Rule 54 of the Virgin Islands defines judgment as "a decree and any order from which an 
appeal lies." The Rule embraces two different types of orders: ( 1) any final decision from which 
an appeal is permitted, and (2) any appealable interlocutory order. See Island Tile and Marble, 
The Epstein Estate cites to 15 V.I.C. § 165 to support its request for attorneys' fees. The standard 
for awarding attorneys' fees under section 165 is the same as the standard for awarding attorneys' 
fees under 5 V.I.C. § 541. See Ka/loo v. Estate of Small, 62 V.I. 571,582 (V.1. 2015) (applying 
the attorneys' fees standard of section 5 V.I.C. § 541 to a claim for attorneys' fees under 15 V.I.C. 
§ 165). 

GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS' OPPOSITION TO 
CO-EXECUTORS' MOTION FOR AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES 
In the Matter of the Estate of: Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Case No. ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No. ST-2019-PB-00080 
Page4 
LLC v. Bertrand, 57 V.I. 596,614 (V.I. 2012) (citing to 10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller 
& Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure§ 2651 (1998)).2 
The orders stemming from the Government's Motion to Intervene and the Government's 
Motion to Freeze Assets are not final decisions. The orders unquestionably do not dispose of the 
litigation. Further, the Court denied the Government's Motion to Intervene without prejudice and 
struck the Government's Motion to Freeze assets-allowing the Government to correct the errors 
identified by the Court. In addition, the Court's orders do not specify that they are final judgments, 
and the Court did not "expressly determine[] that there is no just reason for delay." V.I. R. Civ. P. 
54(b). The Superior Court Judge reviewing the Government's Petition for Review found these 
facts to be determinative in finding that the orders were not final orders eligible for appeal. As 
such, the Court reviewed the Government's Petition for Review pursuant to its reconsideration 
authority under 4 V.I.C. § 123(c), not as an appeal pursuant to section 322(b)(l) or 322.l(b). See 
Feb. 4, 2022 Mem. Order at 3; see also Valerino v. Manning, 68 V.I. 276, 301 (V.1. Super. Ct. 
2018) ("appeal is not the same as reconsideration"). 
Similarly, these orders are not appealable interlocutory orders. Interlocutory orders can 
only be appealed in limited circumstances, such as granting/modifying/refusing an injunction, 
appointing receivers or refusing orders to wind up receivership, and other orders in which the 
Superior Court judge finds a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for 
Decisions by the Virgin Islands Supreme Court and Superior Court interpreting and applying the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure remain applicable where the relevant provision of the Virgin 
Islands Rules of Civil Procedure resemble its federal counterpart. See Gov 't of the V.l v. Takata 
Corp., 67 V.I. 316,336 & n.13 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2017).

difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the 
ultimate termination of litigation. See 4 V.I.C. § 33(b). None of those circumstances apply here.3 
8. 
The Epstein Estate Is Not The Prevailing Party 
The test adopted by the Superior Court for determining whether a party is a "prevailing 
party" is whether a party has achieved at least some of the benefits sought in litigation. Rohn v. 
Daily News Pub/'g Co., Inc., 72 V.I. 301, 308-09 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2019). "Under this standard, 
'the operative criteria for such an award of attorney's fees is success at the conclusion of 
proceedings, rather than the means by which success is achieved."' Id. (internal citation omitted). 
As such, attorneys' fees are awarded '"at the conclusion of litigation', not in the beginning or in 
the midst of it." Bell v. Radcl([fe, 2014 V.I. LEXIS 119, at *7 (V.I. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2014) 
("None of the defendants are 'prevailing parties' because this matter is still pending.") (internal 
citation omitted). 
As discussed above, the Court's denial of the Government's Motion to Intervene and 
striking of the Government's Motion to Freeze Assets were not final judgments and did not dispose 
of this litigation. To the contrary, the Government has now filed a claim in this proceeding and is 
free to seek the same type of relief it requested as an intervenor. A warding attorneys' fees to the 
Epstein Estate when the Government may still ultimately prevail and obtain the same relief it 
requested as an intervenor contradicts the entire notion of a prevailing party. 
The Court did not deny the Government's Motion to Freeze Assets. The Court simply struck the 
motion, allowing the Government to later refile.

II. 
THE COURT SHOULD EXERCISE ITS DISCRETION UNDER SECTION 541 
TO DENY THE EPSTEIN ESTATE'S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES 
Even if the Court believes the Epstein Estate's request for attorneys' fees satisfies the 
prerequisites of section 541-which the Government strongly disputes-the Court should still 
deny the Epstein Estate's request. It is within the Court's discretion to grant or deny attorneys' 
fees pursuant to section 541. See Mahabir v. Heirs of George, 2021 V.I. 22, 4 (V.I. 2021) ("Section 
541 (b) provides that the court 'may' award attorneys' fees 'in its discretion."'). The policy behind 
section 541 is that "a party should not have to bear the legal expenses of demonstrating either that 
it is not at fault or that it is the victim of another's fault." M & N Aviation, Inc. v. United Parcel 
Servs., Inc., No. 2010-0083, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37382, at *6-*7 (D.V.I. Mar. 21, 2014). As 
discussed above, the Court has not considered, let alone decided, the merits of the Government's 
claims. It is possible (and in the Government's view, likely) that the Government will ultimately 
prevail in its claims against the Epstein Estate, which would make awarding attorneys' fees to the 
Epstein Estate contrary to the policy behind section 541. 
Further, unlike the cases cited by the Epstein Estate, Epstein Estate's Motion at 6, the 
Government's claims relate to a law enforcement action the Government initiated to protect the 
public. The Government filed the underlying motions to ensure the Epstein Estate preserved assets 
to compensate victims and the people of the Virgin Islands for Jeffrey Epstein's illegal conduct. 
The Court directed the Government to enter the probate action as a claimant-rather than an 
intervenor-to accomplish this goal. Requiring the Government to pay the Epstein Estate's 
attorneys' fees under these circumstances is contrary to the spirit of section 541 and unjust.

III. 
THE EPSTEIN ESTATE'S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES IS 
EXTREMELY UNREASONABLE 
The Epstein Estate's request for attorneys' fees is extremely unreasonable. Counsel's 
hourly rates are excessive and their billing entries contain vague descriptions, duplicative tasks, 
unrelated work, and clerical duties. In the event the Court decides to award attorneys' fees, the 
attorneys' hourly rates should be reduced to a maximum of $350 per hour and all inappropriate 
billing entries should be excluded. 
A. 
Counsel's Hourly Rates Are Excessive 
When determining the reasonableness of an hourly rate, courts compare the hourly rate 
being charged with the customary charges of Virgin Islands attorneys. See Lakeview Loan Serv., 
LLC v. Singh, 74 V.I. 439, 449 (V.I. Super. Ct. July 28, 2021 ). "It is universally accepted that the 
party seeking fees bears the burden of 'producing satisfactory evidence-in addition to the 
attorney's own affidavit-that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the 
community for similar services by lawyers of reasonable comparable skill, experience, and 
reputation."' Isaac v. Rhonda Crichlow, 2016 V.I. LEXIS 145, *9 (V.I. Super. Ct. Sept. 29, 2016) 
(citing Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886 (1984)). The Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands has held 
that a reasonable hourly rate is calculated according to the prevailing market in the community. 
See Hodge v. Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110340, at *4 (D.V.I. 
Nov. 25, 2009) (noting requested fees must be based on "counsel's usual billing rates, which are 
in accord with customary and prevailing market rates in the Virgin Islands" for legal services). The 
Estate's reliance on New York rates and rates above the prevailing market rates for attorneys in 
the Virgin Islands is misplaced. Virgin Islands courts have found hourly rates between $250-$350 

GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS' OPPOSITION TO 
CO-EXECUTORS' MOTION FOR AW ARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES 
In the Matter of the Estate of: Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Case No. ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No. ST-2019-PB-00080 
Page8 
to be reasonable, including a $350 hourly rate for a trial counsel who had practiced law for 37 
years. See Lakeview Loan Serv., 74 V.I. at 449. In 2019, in Matter of Estate of Benjamin, 70 V.I. 
110, 114, 117-18 (V.I. 2019), the Court found the $350 hourly rate of attorney Marjorie Whalen-
one of the attorneys now representing the Epstein Estate and requesting fees-to be excessive and 
reduced the hourly rate to $300. 
The Epstein Estate is seeking over $112,000 for less than 150 hours of work billed at the 
following hourly rates: 
Attorney Daniel H. Weiner 
Attorney Andrew Heymann 
Attorney Christopher Kroblin 
Attorney Marjorie Whalen 
Attorney Shari D' Andrade 
Legal Assistant Shauna Betz 
$1,315 (2020) 
$1,251 (2021) 
$630 (2020) 
$660 (2021) 
$500 
$360 
$400 
$135 
See Epstein Estate's Mot., Aff. Daniel H. Weiner, Ex. B; Epstein Estate's Mot., Aff. Christopher 
A. Kroblin, Ex. 8. 
These hourly rates are excessive and far exceed the customary charges of Virgin Islands 
attorneys, which range from $250-$350 per hour. Attorney Weiner's rate, for example, exceeds 
the high-end of the customary range by almost $1,000. If the Court awards the Epstein Estate 
attorneys' fees, it should reduce each attorney's hourly rate to no more than $350 per hour.

B. 
Several Billing Entries Are Inappropriate And Should Be Excluded 
Counsel for the Epstein Estate submitted several, inappropriate billing entries that should 
be excluded, including entries that contain vague descriptions, duplicative tasks, unrelated matters, 
and clerical work. A chart identifying the Government's specific objections to counsel's billing 
entries is attached as Government Exhibit 2. 4 
1. 
Vague Descriptions 
Requests for attorneys' fees must be sufficiently specific to allow the court to determine 
whether the hours claimed are unreasonable for the work performed. See Crown Bay Marina, L.P. 
v. Subbase Drydock, Inc., No. 2018-68, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129178, at *6 (D.V.I. July 12, 
2021 ). Courts have found that entries lumping together multiple tasks without identifying the 
amount of time spent on each task are not sufficiently specific. Id . 
. 
Several of the Epstein Estate's billing entries have vague descriptions and contain multiple 
tasks, which makes it impossible for the Government to determine what work counsel performed 
and how much time counsel spent on each task. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 2, 5, 7-10, 14-15, 32-
33, 40-41, 43-44, 46-47, 49, 68-70). For example, Attorney Heymann's description for 5.9 billed 
hours is: "Strategize on opposition to AG motion to freeze assets and standard and research and 
related advice to clients." See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry No. 4). Similarly, Attorney D' Andrade's 
description for 1.8 billed hours is: "Calendared deadline for response to GVI's emergency motion; 
tried to gain access to court website for docket; called clerk's office to determine when GVI 
Government Exhibit 2 is an annotated version of the billing information the Epstein Estate 
provided in its Motion. The Government created additional columns and rows (all highlighted in 
gray) to state its objections and make the chart easier to read.

Originating Case No. ST-2019-PB-00080 
Page 10 
emergency motion was filed; communication w/team re strategy." See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry No. 33). 
These vague entries should be excluded. 
2. 
Duplicative Tasks 
Courts have previously reduced fee awards for duplication of effort among several 
attorneys, including multiple-lawyer conferences not involving opposing counsel. See Morcher v. 
Nash, 32 F. Supp. 2d 239,258 (D.V.I. 1998). The Epstein Estate's Motion contains several billing 
entries for duplicative work. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 1-6, 8, 11-13, 16-18, 22, 24, 26-28, 30-
32, 36, 38, 50-54, 56-61, 63-70). For example, Attorneys Weiner, Heymann, Kroblin, Whalen, 
and Andrade all billed time to drafting and editing opposition to the Government's Motion to 
Intervene. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 1-2, 5-6, 8, 22, 24, 26-28, 31-32, 50-54). The Government 
should not have to pay counsel's exorbitant hourly rates for several attorneys to perform the same 
tasks. Thus, the Court should exclude all duplicative entries. 
3. 
Unrelated Matters 
The Epstein Estate's Motion also includes tasks unrelated to the Government's Motion to 
Intervene, the Government's Motion to Freeze Assets, or the Government Petition for Review and 
should therefore be excluded. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 2, 5, 7- 10, 14-15, 25, 29, 32, 40, 43, 
50, 55, 62). In some instances, counsel lumps together these unrelated tasks with tasks that do 
relate to the at-issue motions, making it impossible for the Government to separate the appropriate 
and inappropriate billing entries. For example, Attorney Kroblin's description for 2.9 billed hours 
is: "Preparation for hearing including proposed agenda, proposed witnesses, and hearing binders, 
and review of the quarterly accounting and edit of the same." See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry No. 7). 
Reviewing and editing the quarterly accounting is not related to the at-issue motions; however, the

In the Matter of the Estate of: Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Case No. ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No. ST-2019-PB-00080 
Page 11 
Government cannot determine what portion of the 2.9 billed hours Attorney Kroblin spent on this 
task. As such, these types of entries should be excluded. 
4. 
Clerical Work 
Expenses for clerical work, such as copying and filing, are considered overhead and should 
be excluded. See Crown Bay Marina, L.P., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129178, at *6; see also Matter 
of Estate of Benjamin, 70 V.I. at 117 (excluded hours Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC billed to 
contacting Court's clerks regarding status updates and conferences). The Epstein Estate's Motion 
contains several billing entries for clerical work. See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 7, 25, 29, 33, 35, 
40-49). For example, Attorney D' Andrade billed five hours (at $360 per hour) for "prepar[ing] 
binders for February 4 hearing." See Gov't Ex. 2 (Entry No. 29). 
In addition, the Epstein Estate's Motion includes billing entries for legal assistant Shauna 
Betz. Counsel cites to a case in which Ms. Betz's time was included in an award for attorneys' 
fees, Epstein Estate's Mot. at 14-15; however, counsel failed to explain that in that case, Ms. Betz 
was identified as a paralegal-not a legal assistant-and the tasks she performed included drafting 
pleadings. See Matter of Estate of Benjamin, 70 V.I. at 117-18. Here, Ms. Betz's tasks are entirely 
clerical, such as assisting with copying and filing documents, and should be excluded. See Gov't 
Ex. 2 (Entry Nos. 40-49); see also Crown Bay Marina, L.P., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129178, at *6 
(citing Jordan v. SEPTA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42123, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 26, 2013) ("Purely 
clerical or secretarial tasks should not be billed at a paralegal rate ... ").

CONCLUSION 
For all the reasons set forth, the Court should deny the Epstein Estate's Motion for Award 
of Attorneys' Fees. Alternatively, the Court should exclude the billing entries the Government 
identifies herein and in Government Exhibit 2 and reduce counsel's hourly rate to a maximum rate 
of $350 per hour.

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT 
COMES NOW, the Government of the United States Virgin Islands ("Government") and 
files this Second Amended Complaint containing information that has become known through 
further investigation and third-party discovery and in support thereof, would show unto the Court 
as follows: 
JURISDICTION AND PARTIES 
1. The Attorney General of the United States Virgin Islands (herein after "Virgin  
Islands") brings this action on behalf of the Plaintiff, Government of the Virgin Islands, pursuant 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 2 of 76 
to 3 V.I.C. § 114 and 14 V.I.C. §607 and her statutory authority to enforce the laws of the Virgin 
Islands, and advocate for the public interest, safety, health and well-being of persons in the 
Virgin Islands. 
2. 
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this civil matter pursuant to 4 
V.I.C. § 76 and 14 V.I.C. § 607. 
3. 
This Court has personal jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 V.I.C. § 4903. 
4. 
The Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States. It consists 
of St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John, and Water Island, and more than 40 surrounding islands and 
Cays, some of which are privately owned. Among these privately owned islands are Little St. 
James and Great St. James. 
5. 
Jeffrey E. Epstein ("Epstein") was a resident of the Virgin Islands and he 
maintained a residence on Little St. James, which he acquired in 1998 and in 2016 he also 
purchased Great St. James. 
6. 
Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands in 2010. He was a Tier 1 
offender under Virgin Islands law based upon his Florida conviction of procuring a minor for 
prostitution. As a Tier 1 offender, Epstein was required to register annually with the Virgin 
Islands Department of Justice ("VIDOJ") and give advance notice of his travel to and from the 
Virgin Islands. Epstein was also subject to random address verification by VIDOJ. 
7. 
Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019 while in custody in New York for sex 
crimes. 
8. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke ("Defendant Indyke") is co-executor of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein and Administrator of The 1953 Trust and was and/or is a participant in the 
activity of the “Epstein Enterprise,” as set forth below. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 3 of 76 
9. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn ("Defendant Kahn") is co-executor of The Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein and Administrator of The 1953 Trust and was and/or is a participant in the 
activity of the “Epstein Enterprise,” as set forth below. 
10. 
Defendants Indyke and Kahn, in addition to administering the Estate under the 
laws of the Virgin Islands, engaged in conduct in the Virgin Islands through their participation in 
businesses, financial transactions, and accounts registered, held, and operating in the Virgin 
Islands, and by filing documents with the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
11. 
Defendant, the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein ("Estate"), created upon Epstein's death, 
is domiciled in the Virgin Islands. On August 15, 2019, Defendants Indyke and Kahn filed a 
Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary which included Epstein's last will and testament 
with the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
12. 
The Petition reported the value of the real and personal property in The Estate 
located in the Virgin Islands at $577,672,654.00 dollars. 
13. 
According to the Petition, the assets in the Virgin Islands thus far included: 
a. $56.5 million in cash; 
b. $127 million in fixed income and equity investments; 
c. $195 million in hedge fund and private equity investments; and 
d. $18.5 million in planes, boats, and automobiles. 
The Estate did not originally value his fine arts, antiques, and other valuables. 
14. 
The Estate also included shares of various corporate entities which hold residences  
and real property used by Epstein, namely: 
a. Brownstone in New York City valued at $56 million; 
b. Ranch in New Mexico valued at $72 million; 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 4 of 76 
c. Gated home in Palm Beach, Florida, valued at $12 million; 
d. Seven units in an apartment building in Paris, valued at $8 million; and 
e. Great St. James and Little St. James, collectively valued at $86 million.  
15. 
At the time of this Second Amended Complaint filing, the Estate’s most recent 
accounting, filed February 1, 2021, valued its total assets at $240,782,955.84, which is almost 60% 
lower than the Estate’s starting valuation less than 18 months earlier when Defendants Indyke and 
Kahn began their Co-Executorship of the Estate. 
16. 
The Estate is responsible to pay penalties and damages for the acts committed by 
Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise described below. 
17. 
Defendant The 1953 Trust ("The Trust") was created by Epstein, who "amended 
and restated" its terms only two days before his suicide. That same day, Epstein revised his Last 
Will and Testament, transferring all of his "property, real and personal, wherever situated" to The 
Trust. The Trust also contains Epstein's financial assets and is also responsible to pay damages 
for the acts committed by Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise described below. Defendants 
Indyke and Kahn, filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands for The 
Trust on August 26, 2019. 
18. 
Epstein maintained a deliberately complex web of Virgin Islands corporations, 
limited liability companies, foundations, and other entities, not all of which are yet known to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands, through which he carried out and concealed his criminal 
conduct. 
19. 
Epstein regularly created new entities in the territory and transferred properties 
and funds between them in order to preserve and shield Epstein's assets and to facilitate and 
conceal the unlawful acts described in this Complaint. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 5 of 76 
20. 
These entities held properties, including Little St. James and Great St. James, at 
which Epstein trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls. Epstein owned and 
arranged for private planes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from, and 
within the Virgin Islands, and provided money to pay these young women and underage girls. 
21. 
Epstein sat at the hub of this web, serving as president, member, manager, or 
director of each of the entities and, upon information and belief, directing their activities. 
22. 
Defendant, Nautilus, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the 
laws of the Virgin Islands. It was incorporated on November 22, 2011. 
23. 
According to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Nautilus, Inc. owns 
Little St. James, a/k/a Parcel Number 109803010100, a parcel of 3.1 million square feet valued 
at $3.2 million, with buildings and improvements valued at $4 million. 
24. 
Epstein was president and director of Nautilus, Inc., which corporate filings 
describe as "holding property for personal use." Defendants Indyke and Kahn are the secretary 
and treasurer of Nautilus, Inc., respectively. The Estate values Epstein's holdings of Nautilus, 
Inc., which holds title to Little St. James at $63.9 million. 
25. 
A deed recorded with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds on December 30, 
2011 reflects that the property was transferred from a Delaware entity, L.S.J., LLC, to Nautilus, 
Inc. for "TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration." The quitclaim 
deed lists Jeffrey Epstein as the sole member of L.S.J., LLC, which it acquired Little Saint James 
via a warranty deed dated April 27, 1998. 
26. 
As described below, Epstein engaged in a pattern and practice of trafficking and 
sexually abusing young women and female children on this private, secluded island of Little St. 
James where Epstein and his associates could avoid detection of their illegal activity from Virgin 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 6 of 76 
Islands and federal law enforcement and prevent these young women and underage girls from 
leaving freely and escaping the abuse. 
27. 
Thus, Nautilus, Inc. participated in carrying out, facilitating and concealing 
Epstein's crimes, hence Little St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
28. 
Defendant, Great St. Jim, LLC, is a limited liability company established and 
organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands. Great St. Jim, LLC was organized on October 26, 
2015. Great St. Jim, LLC, according to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, owns at 
least three properties that make up Great St. James acquired on January 28, 2016: Parcel Number 
109801010100, consisting of 3.5 million square feet and valued at $17.5 million; Parcel Number 
109801010200, consisting of 450,000 square feet of land, valued at $2.8 million; and Parcel 
Number 109801010300, 1.2 million square feet of land, valued at $2.7 million. According to a 
warranty deed filed with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Epstein, through Great St. Jim, 
LLC, acquired the last two parcels for $5 million each. 
29. 
Epstein is listed as manager and a member of Great St. Jim, LLC and the nature of 
its business is described as "holding assets." Upon information and belief, Epstein purchased 
these Great St. James properties—the island with closest proximity to Little St. James—to further 
shield his conduct on Little St. James from view, prevent his detection by law enforcement or the 
public, and allow him to continue and conceal his criminal enterprise. Epstein's significant 
investment in the purchase of Great St. James demonstrates his intent to expand his illegal 
operation in the Virgin Islands for years to come. Thus, Great St. Jim, LLC participated in 
carrying out, concealing, facilitating and continuing Epstein's crimes, and Great St. James became 
an instrumentality of those crimes.

Defendant, Poplar, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
of the Virgin Islands. Poplar, Inc. was incorporated on November 22, 2011. Epstein was 
president and director of Poplar, Inc., and its purpose was described in corporate filings as 
"holding property for personal use." Defendants Indyke and Kahn are secretary and treasurer of 
Poplar, Inc., respectively. 
31. 
A certificate of incumbency provided to the Department of Planning and Natural 
Resources ("DPNR") also lists Epstein as president of Poplar, Inc. and expressly authorizes the 
incorporators to conduct "transactions related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great 
St. Jim, LLC." 
32. 
Poplar, Inc. is listed as the signatory for the 2017 Annual Report for Great St. Jim, 
LLC, and the signature appears to be Epstein's. The Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary 
filed by The Estate lists Poplar, Inc. as holding title to Great St. James. Thus, Poplar, Inc. 
participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and continuing Epstein's crimes.  
33. 
Defendant, Plan D, LLC is a limited liability company established and organized 
under the laws of the Virgin Islands. In its original Articles of Organization, filed October 19, 
2012, and Annual Report filings, Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski, was listed as Plan D, LLC's sole 
manager/member. However, the July 31, 2019 Annual Report revealed Epstein as the principal 
behind Plan D, LLC. 
34. 
Upon information and belief, Plan D, LLC owns one or more of the airplanes and 
helicopters that Epstein used to transport young women and children to and from the Virgin 
Islands to carry out the criminal pattern of activity described below. Among the airplanes owned 
by Plan D, LLC is a Gulfstream with N-number N212JE. Flight logs and travel notices indicate 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 8 of 76 
that Epstein used this plane to traffic and transport and young women and underage girls to the 
Virgin Islands.  
35. 
Defendant, Hyperion Air, LLC is a limited liability company established and 
organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands on October 19, 2012. Jeffrey Epstein is a 
manager/member of Hyperion Air, LLC, along with his pilot, Larry Visoski. The purpose of 
Hyperion Air, LLC is listed in its Annual Report as "holding assets." 
36. 
Hyperion Air, LLC is the registered owner of a Bell helicopter with N-number 
N331JE and a Keystone helicopter with N-number N722JE. Upon information and belief, 
Epstein used these helicopters to transport young women and underage girls between St. Thomas 
and Little St. James. 
37. 
Defendant Southern Trust Company, Inc. was originally incorporated in the Virgin 
Islands on November 18, 2011 as Financial Informatics, Inc., but changed its name to Southern 
Trust Company in September 2012. Southern Trust Company is a tenant at American Yacht 
Harbor in Red Hook, St. Thomas, and Epstein is a "passive investor" in IGY-AYH, d/b/a 
American Yacht Harbor. By the end of 2013, according to its corporate filings, Southern Trust 
Company has assets of $198.5 million; four years later, its assets reached $391.3 million. From 
2011 until at least 2018, Jeffrey Epstein was the President/Director of Southern Trust Company, 
and Defendants Kahn and Indyke were Treasurer/Director and Secretary/Director, respectively. 
Epstein was the sole owner of Southern Trust Company. 
38. 
Defendant Cypress, Inc. is a Virgin Islands corporation that was formed and first 
licensed in or about November 2011. As of December 31, 2018, Epstein was listed as 
President/Director and Defendants and Co-Executors Indyke and Kahn were listed, respectively, 
as Vice President/Secretary/Director and Treasurer/Director of Cypress, Inc. Cypress, Inc. owns

the property 49 Zorro Ranch Road in Stanley, New Mexico, which was transferred to it in or 
about December 2011, shortly after it was incorporated. 
39. 
Defendant Maple, Inc. is a Virgin Islands corporation that was formed and first 
licensed in or about November 2011. As of December 31, 2018, Epstein was listed as 
President/Director and Defendants and Co-Executors Indyke and Kahn were listed, respectively, 
as Vice President/Secretary/Director and Treasurer/Director of Maple, Inc.  Maple, Inc. owns the 
property 9 East 71st Street in New York, New York, which was transferred to it on or about 
December 23, 2011, shortly after it was incorporated. 
40. 
Defendant Laurel, Inc. is a Virgin Islands corporation that was formed and first 
licensed in or about November 2011.  As of December 31, 2018, Epstein was listed as President/ 
Director and Defendants and Co-Executors Indyke and Kahn were listed, respectively, as Vice 
President/Secretary/Director and Treasurer/Director of Laurel, Inc.  Laurel, Inc. owns the 
property 358 Brillo Way in Palm Beach, Florida, which was transferred to it in or about 
December 2011, shortly after it was formed. 
41. 
John and Jane Does represent individuals and entities whose identities or 
involvement with Epstein are currently unknown. The Government of the Virgin Islands will 
amend the Complaint to add these individuals and entities when discovered. 
42. 
The Attorney General brings this action to seek all remedies available to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands in enforcing its laws and protecting the public interest and 
public safety. These claims are distinct from, and are not intended to supplant, the claims of 
victims who were unconscionably harmed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. 
The Conduct of the "Epstein Enterprise" in the Virgin Islands 
43. 
Epstein and his associates, including Defendants, identified and recruited female 
victims, including children, and transported them to the Virgin Islands where they were abused 
and injured. Epstein, through and in association with Defendants, trafficked, raped, sexually 
assaulted and held captive underage girls and young women at his properties in the Virgin Islands. 
44. 
Epstein created a network of companies and individuals who participated in and 
conspired with him in a pattern of criminal activity related to the sex trafficking, forced labor, 
sexual assault, child abuse, and sexual servitude of these young women and children. Epstein and 
his associates trafficked underage girls to the Virgin Islands, held them captive, and sexually 
abused them, causing them grave physical, mental, and emotional injury. 
45. 
To accomplish his illegal ends, Epstein formed an association in fact with 
multiple Defendants and others (both companies and individuals) who were willing to 
participate in, facilitate, and conceal Epstein's criminal activity in exchange for Epstein's 
bestowal of financial and other benefits, including sexual services and forced labor from 
victims. 
46. 
This illicit association of Epstein, Defendants, and his associates constitute what 
is referred to herein as the "Epstein Enterprise." Epstein's associates in the Epstein Enterprise, 
including, but not limited to, those named as Defendants knowingly facilitated, participated in, 
and concealed Epstein's illegal conduct. 
47. 
Epstein used his wealth and power to create the Epstein Enterprise which 
engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin Islands by repeatedly procuring and 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 11 of 76 
subjecting underage girls and young women to unlawful sexual conduct, sex trafficking, and 
forced labor. 
48. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin 
Islands (and elsewhere) with the criminal purpose and goal of placing a steady supply of 
vulnerable female children and young women into sexual servitude in service of Epstein's 
desires, and those of his associates. The Epstein Enterprise maintained and made available 
young women and underage girls for the purpose of engaging them in forced labor and sexual 
activities and used coercion and deception to procure, abuse, and harbor its victims.  
49. 
Flight logs and other sources establish that between 2001 and 2019 the Epstein 
Enterprise transported underage girls and young women to the Virgin Islands, who were then taken 
via helicopter or private vessel to Little St. James where they were then deceptively subjected to 
sexual servitude, forced to engage in sexual acts and coerced into commercial sexual activity 
and forced labor. 
50. 
In furtherance of its criminal activities, the Epstein Enterprise used its aircrafts 
to transport the young women and underage girls to the Virgin Islands for purposes of sexual 
abuse and exploitation. 
51. 
The Epstein Enterprise facilitated and participated in the sexual molestation and 
exploitation of numerous girls between the age of 12 and 17 years old. 
52. 
On the pretext of providing modeling opportunities, careers and contracts, 
associates of the Epstein Enterprise, funded by the Epstein Enterprise, lured and recruited young 
women and underage girls to travel to locations including the Virgin Islands where, upon 
information and belief, based on the pattern and practice of the Epstein Enterprise, they were 
sexually abused and exploited. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 12 of 76 
53. 
Associates in the Epstein Enterprise recruited both victims and abusers into the 
Epstein Enterprise, participated in sexual acts of rape and abuse of minors and witnessed 
Epstein and others engage in sexual acts with children. 
54. 
As recent as 2018, air traffic controllers and other airport personnel reported 
seeing Epstein leave his plane with young girls some of whom appeared to be between the age 
of 11 and 18 years. 
55. 
Upon information and belief, based on Epstein's pattern of trafficking and 
sexually abusing young girls, the Epstein Enterprise trafficked and abused these girls, and 
others, in the Virgin Islands through 2018. 
56. 
When sued in civil court for committing sex trafficking and sex crimes, Epstein 
never denied engaging in sexual acts with underage females and procuring underage females for 
prostitution, but instead consistently invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination. 
57. 
Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise kept a computerized list of 
underage girls who were in or proximate to the Virgin Islands, and able to be transported to 
Epstein's residence at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. 
58. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct by trafficking 
children and young women and placing them in sexual servitude and forced labor in the Virgin 
Islands. The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 133 to 138, which prohibit 
trafficking and sexual abuse. The Epstein Enterprise also repeatedly violated laws against child 
abuse and neglect, including 14 V.I.C. § 505, which defines the crime of child abuse as knowingly 
or recklessly causing "a child to suffer physical, mental, or emotional injury," or causing a child to 
be placed in a situation where such injury is foreseeable, and 14 V.I.C. § 506, which applies, as 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 13 of 76 
here, where the child suffers serious physical, mental, or emotional injury as a result of that abuse. 
The harm to Epstein's victims was both fully foreseeable and deeply damaging. 
59. 
The Epstein Enterprise knowingly recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, 
received, procured, obtained, isolated, maintained, and enticed young women and girls to 
engage in forced labor (such as providing massages) and, ultimately, sexual servitude at his little 
St. James residence. 
60. 
A 15-year old victim was forced into sexual acts with Epstein and others and then 
attempted to escape by swimming off the Little St. James Island. Epstein and others organized a 
search party that located her and kept her captive by, among other things, confiscating her passport. 
Another victim, who was first engaged in provide massages to Epstein, was then forced to 
perform sexual acts at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. When she attempted to escape the 
"private island," Epstein and a search party found her, returned her to his house, and suggested 
physical restraint or harm if she failed to cooperate. 
61. 
Another victim was flown by Epstein and his associates to New York or Palm 
Beach and then to the Virgin Islands dozens of times from 2004, when she was age 20, to 2017. 
She was repeatedly abused by Epstein and also was pressed to have sex with Epstein’s business 
colleagues.  
62. 
During the latter part of this period, she was forced into an arranged marriage to 
another victim that was facilitated by Defendant/Co-Executor Indyke to prevent the other victim 
from being deported. Indyke and a New York immigration lawyer retained by Epstein prepared 
the victim for communications with U.S. immigration officials almost immediately after the 
wedding. Defendant/Co-Executor Kahn provided a letter of reference for the immigration 
proceeding. When the victim inquired about ending the marriage and leaving Epstein’s circle, 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 14 of 76 
Indyke repeatedly tried to talk her out of a divorce and threatened that she would lose Epstein’s 
and his associates’ protection. 
63. 
The Epstein Enterprise forced at least three separate arranged marriages, in each 
case requiring American female victims to marry foreign victims to avoid their deportation.  The 
victims were coerced into to participating in these arranged marriages, and understood that there 
would be consequences, including serious reputational and bodily harm, if they refused to enter 
a marriage or attempted to end it.  In each instance, Indyke and Kahn knowingly facilitated the 
fraudulent and coerced marriages, performing and securing the legal and accounting work 
involved and enabling a fraud that would further bind Epstein’s victims to him and enable 
Epstein to continue to control and abuse these victims sexually.  
64. 
The Epstein Enterprise deceptively lured underage girls and women into its 
sex trafficking ring with money and promises of employment, career opportunities and 
school assistance. The Epstein Enterprise preyed on their financial and other vulnerabilities, 
and promised victims money, shelter, gifts, employment, tuition and other items of value. 
For example, participants in the Epstein Enterprise targeted young and underage females 
under the pretext that they would be paid substantially merely to provide massages to him 
and others. However, once drawn in, victims were then pressured and coerced to engage in 
sexual acts. 
65. 
The Epstein Enterprise forced underage victims to recruit others to perform 
services and engage in sexual acts—a trafficking pyramid scheme. 
66. 
The Epstein Enterprise paid girls for each "meeting," with additional money if 
they brought additional girls. Epstein reportedly required three meetings per day. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 15 of 76 
67. 
The Epstein Enterprise used the term "work" as a code for sexual abuse, and, 
upon information and belief, reportedly kept computer records of the contact information for the 
victims. 
68. 
Consistent with his creation and use of a complex web of entities to carry out 
and conceal the criminal trafficking enterprise in the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Enterprise 
sometimes paid young women and underage girls he exploited and trafficked through his 
charitable foundations. 
69. 
Once the girls and women were recruited, participants in the Epstein Enterprise 
enforced their sexual servitude of victims by coercion, including but not limited to, confiscating 
passports, controlling and extinguishing external communications, and threatening violence. 
They also made fraudulent statements to family members of victims, claiming victims were 
being well cared for and supported financially in college and other educational opportunities. 
70. 
One of the victims, who was flown by Epstein and his associates to the Virgin 
Islands dozens of times up until as late as 2017, described how Epstein exercised strict control 
over her and other victims’ activity. The girls had to give notice if they left the main residence 
and were kept to a rigid set of roles and rules. Epstein brought victims to business meetings, 
where they were often required to massage his feet or run errands. Victims had to use Epstein-
approved doctors and sign consent forms for access to their medical records. Epstein also 
required them to give him their email passwords.  Each of these was a means of demonstrating 
and reinforcing his control over the women and girls. 
71. 
During this time period through 2017, this victim observed a succession of girls 
and young women who were transported to Little St. James and while there were called into 
Epstein’s office or sauna to engage in sexual acts. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 16 of 76 
72. 
Another victim, who was brought to Little St. James more than 50 times during 
the years 2000 to 2002, when she was 17 to 19 years old, was required to have sexual relations 
with “guests” of Epstein, and was subjected to sexual abuse virtually every day, and on some 
days, multiple times a day by Epstein or his guests. 
73. 
This victim, too, observed a large number of young women and girls around 
Epstein at Little St. James. Many of them did not speak English, which was Epstein’s preference 
since they spoke less. 
74. 
Epstein sent these victims out to night clubs or on shopping trips to try to 
identify and recruit other young women and girls, at times paying them a fee for each recruit. 
75. 
The Epstein Enterprise transported, held, sexually abused, trafficked, and 
concealed women and children at his property in the Virgin Islands dozens of times over nearly 
two decades. 
B. 
Defendants and Co-Executors Indyke and Kahn were Instrumental to the 
Epstein Enterprise’s Human Trafficking and Financial Fraud. 
76. 
Defendants Kahn and Indyke organized, controlled, and directed almost every 
aspect of the Epstein Enterprise. They were officers in virtually every corporate entity that 
Epstein created to fund and conceal his activities.  They were deeply involved in the financial 
activities of the Epstein-owned entities, including those of Defendant Southern Trust Company, 
which made clear that Southern Trust did not provide the services described to the Government 
as the basis for tax incentives that allowed Epstein to fraudulently obtain more than $80 million 
from the Government.   
77. 
Defendants Indyke and Kahn also directed, approved, enabled, and justified 
millions of dollars in payments that fueled the Epstein Enterprise’s sex trafficking, including 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 17 of 76 
payments to women who were forced to have sex with Epstein and/or recruited others to be 
victimized.  Defendants Indyke and Kahn obtained large and frequent stocks of cash for Epstein 
which, based on public knowledge, would have funded Epstein’s cash payments for 
“massages”—code for forced sex.   
78. 
Defendants Indyke and Kahn participated with Epstein in coercing his sex 
trafficking victims, in at least three cases, to enter into arranged and forced marriages in order to 
obtain immigration status for the foreign women so that they could continue to be available to 
Epstein for his abuse – a doubly-deep assault on their will and dignity.  Defendant Kahn 
provided a letter of reference for at least one immigration application and tax services to the 
spouses, and Defendant Indyke paid the immigration lawyer who applied for citizenship for the 
women and threatened at least one who indicated that she would seek a divorce.  They used 
their professional skills and authority to carry out this abhorrent scheme.   
79. 
Indyke and Kahn were, in short, the indispensable captains of Epstein’s criminal 
enterprise, roles for which they were richly rewarded. 
80. 
Defendants Kahn and Indyke controlled and directed the activities of the other 
entities and personal bank accounts of Epstein accounts after they were funded.  One, and 
frequently both, of them were officers or directors of Butterfly Trust; of companies holding 
Epstein’s real property (as laid out below); and of Financial Strategy Group, Ltd.; Financial 
Trust, Inc.; FT Real Estate Inc.; Gratitude America, Inc.; Hyperion Air, Inc.; J. Epstein Virgin 
Islands Foundation, Inc.; Jeepers, Inc.; Mort, Inc.; Nautilus, Inc.; and Zorro Development 
Corporation; among others.   
81. 
Along with their officer and director roles, Defendants Kahn and/or Indyke also 
had signatory authority over virtually all of the accounts held by the Epstein Enterprise entities, 
-
-

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 18 of 76 
which allowed them to personally authorize and sign off on payments totaling hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to the Enterprise’s sex-trafficking and abuse victims, including those who 
also acted as recruiters, and other expenses including legal fees, apartment rent, and tuition. 
Further, they routinely withdrew cash in various ways, including ATMs, checks, or by 
converting U.S. Dollars to Euros.  In many instances, Kahn and/or Indyke structured these 
transactions in order to evade the bank’s reporting requirements. 
82. 
Defendant Kahn also oversaw the accounting and tax reporting for the other 
entities in the Epstein Enterprise.  As discussed below the “Tree entities,” Laurel, Maple, and 
Cypress, filed materially false and misleading financial statements by not including the 
properties in other states they owned or related expenses.  These financial statements were 
submitted to the Office of Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands and signed by Defendant 
Kahn.  In addition, in 2013, Defendant Kahn also directed the outside accountant not to report 
the properties on their respective tax returns.  
83. 
The J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”) is a 501(c)(3) 
tax-exempt private foundation that was founded in June 2000 and registered in the Virgin 
Islands. 
84. 
As of October 23, 2007, Indyke was listed as President of the Foundation. He 
also was a signatory on the Foundation’s checking accounts. 
85. 
Between September 2015 and June 2019, Indyke signed Foundation account 
checks for over $400,000 made payable to young female models and actresses, including a 
former Russian model who received over $380,000 through monthly payments of $8,333 made 
over a period of more than three and a half years until the middle of 2019. 
■ 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 19 of 76 
86. 
In November 2017, Indyke signed a Foundation check made payable to the 
immigration lawyer in New York who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged 
among Epstein’s victims to secure a victim’s immigration status. The check’s memo line 
references the former Russian model’s last name.   
87. 
These payments were inconsistent with the charitable purpose of the Foundation 
and designed to serve the private benefit and criminal activities of Epstein and the Epstein 
Enterprise.  
88. 
Earlier in 2017, Indyke signed a Foundation check for $160,000 to resolve a fine 
Epstein had incurred for construction on Great St. James Island that violated Virgin Islands 
environmental regulations and attempted to make the payment appear to be a charitable 
donation.  Over two years later, the Estate had to repay this amount to the Foundation after 
questions were raised to Epstein’s lawyer about the propriety of the Foundation payment. 
89. 
With help from Indyke and Kahn, Epstein established and operated separate 
businesses through which he could pay victims and recruiters, and, upon information and belief, 
which he used to maintain their immigration status. 
90. 
JSC Interiors, LLC is a New York Limited Liability Company, the Articles of 
Organization of which were filed in November 2014. The Articles list JSC, who was forced and 
coerced to have sex with Epstein, as the company’s sole owner.  JSC was manipulated, 
exploited, and controlled by the Epstein Enterprise.   
91. 
According to JSC’s operating agreement, Kahn was to be the initial Manager of 
the company, with full and complete authority, power, and discretion to do all things necessary 
or convenient to manage, control, and carry out the business. Kahn also had signatory authority 
for JSC’s bank accounts.

92. 
One of JSC’s bank accounts was funded entirely with money transferred from 
Epstein’s personal bank accounts. 
93. 
JSC’s payroll was paid to two persons, one of whom was the listed sole owner. 
Kahn gave conflicting reports to JSC’s bank about the second person on the company’s payroll 
and the reasons for its payments to her. Once, he described her as an interior designer, which 
would justify the payments in light of JSC’s purported line of business, but which appears to 
have been false. The other time, Kahn described this payroll recipient as a dentist, which would 
not justify JSC Interiors’ payments to her, but which appears to be true. 
94. 
LSJE, LLC is a Virgin Islands Limited Liability Company that was organized on 
October 27, 2011.  Defendants Indyke and Kahn were authorized signatories on the company’s 
checking account. 
95. 
Indyke and Kahn signed company checks for combined value of almost 
$300,000 made out personally to young women or to, again, the immigration lawyer in New 
York who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to 
secure a victim’s immigration status. 
96. 
Upon information and belief, after his guilty plea in Florida for soliciting 
prostitution from a minor, Epstein began to focus on procuring and abusing women from 
Eastern Europe.  These women’s immigration status and language barriers made them more 
isolated, dependent, and vulnerable to Epstein’s abuse and manipulation. 
97. 
The Butterfly Trust is a trust created for the benefit of numerous persons who 
performed work for Epstein, including numerous young women with Eastern European 
surnames and also including Indyke and Kahn themselves. Indyke and Kahn were authorized 
signatories on the Trust’s checking account.

-

GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 21 of 76 
98. 
Indyke and Kahn signed trust checks for combined value of over $1,000,000 
made out personally to young women, or their associated entities, who in some instances were 
not beneficiaries of the trust. 
99. 
Defendants and Co-Executors Indyke and Kahn also were deeply involved with 
transactions made in and out of Epstein’s personal accounts, for which Indyke had signatory 
authority, that were flagged by bank representatives and the New York Department of Financial 
Services as potentially suspicious. 
100. 
Indyke also engaged in repeated transactions that seem designed to have 
provided Epstein with cash in small enough increments to avoid triggering financial reporting 
requirements.  It is well known that Epstein paid girls and women in cash for sexual encounters 
that began as or were euphemistically described as massages, or for recruiting other girls to 
provide such massages. 
101. 
On July 20, 2016, Indyke brought two checks to a branch teller window for 
withdrawal, one for $7,500 drawn on Epstein’s personal account and one for $4,000 drawn on 
Indyke’s business account.  Indyke presented the $7,500 check for cashing and stated that he 
would be cashing the other check the next business day to avoid all the paperwork.  On July 21, 
2016, Indyke returned to cash the $4,000 check. 
102. 
From June 2018 to February 2019, there was a series of 97 separate withdrawals 
of $1,000 made from this account at an ATM that is a short walk from Indyke’s law office. 
103. 
From this same account, Indyke wrote 11 checks, between April 2016 and April 
2019, for the purpose of converting U.S. dollars to Euros totaling over $126,000.  Some of the 
checks contained the notation “Euros for safe.” 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 22 of 76 
104. 
Also, Indyke withdrew large amounts of cash in single transactions. For 
instance, on January 17, 2018, Indyke cashed a check for $100,000.  Although Indyke cashed 
the check, Kahn arranged with the Bank representative to have the cash ready for pickup.  
105. 
Payments from this account, for which Indyke had signatory authority, totaling 
over $2,500,000 were made to dozens of women with Eastern European surnames, purportedly 
for hotel expenses, tuition, and rent, and to, again, the immigration lawyer in New York who was 
involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to secure victims’ 
immigration status.   
106. 
For another of Epstein’s personal accounts with the same bank, Indyke, from 
2014 to 2016, made almost 45 separate check-cashing withdrawals at a pace of two to three per 
month, each for the amount of $7,500, which was the bank’s limit for third-party withdrawals. 
107. 
From this same account, between June 2014 and September 2015, Indyke wrote 
eight checks for the purpose of converting U.S. dollars to Euros.  Each of the checks to 
effectuate the conversion approximated $7,500, presumably in order to evade reporting 
requirements, with some containing the notation “Euros for safe.” 
108. 
Payments from this account totaling over $1,000,000 were made to dozens of 
women with Eastern European surnames and to, again, the immigration lawyer in New York 
who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to secure 
a victim’s immigration status. 
109. 
Indyke made wire transfers from another of Epstein’s personal accounts with a 
different bank totaling almost $50,000 between November 2016 and July 2019 (just before 
Epstein’s arrest) to women with Eastern European surnames, including one known to have 
recruited young women and girls for Epstein.

110. 
From another of Epstein’s personal accounts with another different bank, for 
which Indyke had signatory authority, someone acting on Epstein’s behalf made a total of 21 
separate withdrawals each in the amount of $1,000 on every but one business day from April 9, 
2019 to May 8, 2019. 
111. 
Payments from this account totaling almost $60,000 were transferred by wire to 
young women mostly at foreign beneficiary banks in February and March 2016.  
112. 
Upon information and belief, based on their authority for the accounts, their 
interactions with the relevant banks, and records indicating that they made or approved the 
transactions, these payments could have only been made with the knowledge and/or at the 
direction of Indyke and Kahn.  
113. 
The sheer complexity of the infrastructure that Epstein set up and maintained 
with the participation of Kahn and Indyke suggest their unlawful purpose.  Based on the 
Government’s current knowledge, Epstein, with Kahn and Indyke, held and managed at least 
140 different bank accounts for Epstein and Epstein-owned entities, many of which existed only 
to transfer payments to other entities and accounts.  
114. 
Kahn and Indyke profited substantially from their relationship with Epstein.  
The amount of their payments is further evidence of the illicit nature of the work they 
performed.  
115. 
From 2011 to 2019, Epstein and Epstein-owned entities paid over $16 million 
net to Defendant/Co-Executor Indyke, and over $10 million net to Defendant/Co-Executor 
Kahn.  This includes loans that are still outstanding to Indyke- and Kahn-related entities.  Based 
on records obtained so far, tax forms provided by Epstein entities did not report nearly the full 
compensation to Indyke and Kahn.

116. 
Indyke and Kahn were paid through multiple entities, including HBRK 
Associates, Inc. (Kahn), Coatue Enterprises, LLC (Kahn), Birch Tree BR, LLC (Indyke) 
Harlequin Dane, LLC (Indyke) and Darren K Indyke, PLLC, which functioned as shell 
companies and engaged in no activities other than to coordinate the activities of Epstein’s 
Enterprise, including the receiving and sending money to other entities they held.   
117. 
Since they were appointed as Co-Executors of the Epstein Estate in 2019, 
Defendants Indyke and Kahn have approved the release of Estate funds to pay for the legal fees 
and costs of persons who—like the Co-Executors themselves—are alleged herein to have 
participated in the criminal activity of the Epstein Enterprise. 
C. The "Epstein Enterprise" Abused Privileges of Residency to Carry out its 
Criminal Scheme 
118. 
The Epstein Enterprise in 1998 acquired Little St. James in the Virgin Islands as 
the perfect hideaway and haven for trafficking young women and underage girls for sexual 
servitude, child abuse and sexual assault. Little St. James is a secluded, private island, nearly 
two miles from St. Thomas with no other residents. It can be visited only by private boat or 
helicopter; no public or commercial transportation is available to carry persons on or off the 
island, and no bridge connects the island to St. Thomas. Epstein had easy access to Little St. 
James from the private airfield on St. Thomas, only 10 minutes away by his private helicopter, 
but the women and children he trafficked, abused, and held there were not able to leave without 
his permission and assistance, as it was too far and dangerous to swim to St. Thomas. 
119. 
In 2016, upon information and belief, using a straw purchaser to hide Epstein's 
identity, the Epstein Enterprise acquired Great St. James the nearest island to Little St. James. By 
then, Epstein was a convicted sex offender. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 25 of 76 
purchased the island for more than $20 million because its participants wanted to ensure that the 
island did not become a base from which others could view their activities or visitors. By acquiring 
ownership and control of Great St. James to the exclusion of others, the Epstein Enterprise created 
additional barriers to prevent those held involuntarily on Little St. James from escaping or 
obtaining help from others. 
120. 
Great St. James and Little St. James are environmentally sensitive locations, with 
native coral and wildlife protected by federal and territorial law and enforcement authorities. The 
Department of Planning and Natural Resources ("DPNR") regulates and monitors construction in 
the Coastal Zone to protect, maintain and manage the precious natural resources of the Virgin 
Islands. Under its authority, DPNR repeatedly issued citations and assessed thousands of dollars 
of fines for violations of the Virgin Islands construction code and environmental protection laws 
on both Little St. James and Great St. James—significant penalties to the agency and to the 
average resident of the Virgin Islands. But because of Epstein's enormous wealth, these fines had 
little effect in curbing or stopping the Epstein Enterprise's unlawful conduct or conforming its 
activities to the law. 
121. 
As a result of illegal construction activity of the Epstein Enterprise, the Virgin 
Islands has incurred, and will incur, significant expenses to remove the illegal construction or 
remediate its effects on natural resources in and around Little St. James and Great St. James. The 
extent of the potential environmental damage is unknown at this time as the illegal construction 
has not been removed or remediated. 
122. 
The Epstein Enterprise continues to attempt to prevent or limit DPNR authorities 
from conducting random inspections on the Little St. James and Great St. James necessary to 
comply with Virgin Islands law. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 26 of 76 
123. 
The Epstein Enterprise's violation of the construction and environmental laws was 
part of a pattern of behavior in flouting the laws of the Virgin Islands and holding itself above the 
law. Upon information and belief, as described above, the Epstein Enterprise undertook 
construction at Great St. James after 2016 to continue the scheme to carry out and conceal his 
trafficking and sexual abuse of young women and children in the Virgin Islands. These actions 
are also indicative of the Epstein Enterprise's disregard for Virgin Islands' law. The Epstein 
Enterprise used the Virgin Islands' land, resources, people, and laws for its illicit purposes. 
Rather than participating lawfully in this community, the Epstein Enterprise took advantage of 
the secluded nature of the islands in furtherance of its crimes. 
124. 
As a result of its deplorable and unlawful conduct, the Epstein Enterprise has 
subjected the Virgin Islands to public portrayals as a hiding place for human trafficking and sex 
crimes. 
D. The "Epstein Enterprise" Fraudulently Concealed its Conduct 
125. 
The Epstein Enterprise fraudulently concealed its actions to prevent detection by 
the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
126. 
The secluded properties at Little St. James and Great St. James were repeatedly 
used by the Epstein Enterprise as the locations for unlawfully soliciting, transporting, 
transferring, harboring, receiving, providing, isolating, patronizing, maintaining, deceiving, 
coercing, and sexually abusing young women and children and concealing these crimes. 
127. 
The Epstein Enterprise was able to hide the trafficking ring from law 
enforcement, despite the fact that Epstein was a registered sex offender. Given the isolation of 
the Little St. James and Great St. James and the nature of the crimes and of the victims targeted 
by the Epstein Enterprise, the activities of the Epstein Enterprise were not readily detectable. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 27 of 76 
Moreover, Epstein's great wealth and power likely made witnesses reluctant to report their 
observations to the local law enforcement.  
128. 
Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise prevented its employees from 
cooperating with law enforcement. Employees and others were required to sign confidentiality 
agreements that prohibited them from speaking to or sharing information with law enforcement. 
If they were contacted by law enforcement they were to notify the Epstein Enterprise and be 
represented by Epstein's counsel. 
129. 
The employees were directed not to communicate or interact with guests visiting 
Little St. James and were also directed not to disclose to anyone events that occurred on the island. 
130. 
Monitoring a sex offender with his own private islands and the resources to fly 
victims in and out on private planes and helicopters presented unique challenges and allowed the 
Epstein Enterprise to limit scrutiny by the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
131. 
Sexual Offender Registration and Community Protection Act ("SORCPA") 14 
V.I.C. § 1721, et. seq. requires sex offenders to register in their resident jurisdictions and to make 
periodic in-person appearances to verify and update their registration information. 
132. 
Epstein renewed his registration each year in the Virgin Islands. In addition, 
beyond this statutory requirement, the Virgin Islands periodically visited—or attempted to 
visit—Little St. James to conduct additional address verifications. 
133. 
At his last verification in July 2018, Epstein refused to permit Virgin Islands 
Department of Justice Investigators, assisted by United States Marshals, to enter Little St. James 
beyond its dock, claiming that the dock was his "front door." Instead, Epstein arranged to be met 
at his office on St. Thomas. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 28 of 76 
134. 
Epstein also misled the Government regarding his travel plans. On March 19, 2019, 
the Virgin Islands was notified that Epstein would be traveling to France for 10 days on the private 
plane owned by Plan D, LLC. His notification form did not disclose travel to any other countries. It 
was later found by law enforcement authorities that Epstein also travelled to Vienna and Monaco 
during that trip. 
135. 
Similarly, the Epstein Enterprise sought to prevent DPNR from conducting 
routine site visits to inspect unpermitted and potentially damaging construction activity on Great 
St. James. The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly objected to DPNR's inspections referring to them as 
"invasions" of Epstein's constitutional right to privacy in his home, which he described defined 
as the entire island. These DPNR inspections are required for all construction and Virgin Islands 
residents are required to cooperate with the inspections to assure compliance with the law 
throughout the construction phases. 
136. 
These efforts represent Epstein Enterprise's intent to conceal its unlawful activity 
on Little St. James and Great St. James. 
137. 
The Epstein Enterprise also created numerous corporations and limited liability 
companies in the Virgin Islands to help conceal its unlawful activity. Most of these companies were 
created in 2011 and 2012, soon after Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands. 
138. 
Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski is identified as member or co-member in companies 
that serviced and maintained the planes that the Epstein Enterprise used to traffick young women 
and children — Freedom Air Petroleum, LLC (registered November 28, 2011 to hold assets); 
and JEGE, LLC (registered October 19, 2012 to hold assets). 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 29 of 76 
139. 
Other Epstein entities include LSJ Employees, LLC (registered October 27, 2011 
to provide services); Southern Financial, LLC (registered February 25, 2013 to provide services) 
and LSJ Emergency, LLC (registered December 2, 2015 to provide services). 
140. 
Some of these companies held considerable assets: Financial Informatics, Inc. 
(incorporated November 18, 2011, also known as Southern Trust Company, Inc.) had assets of 
approximately $391 million in 2015; and Financial Trust Company, Inc. (incorporated November 
6, 1998) had assets of $212 million when it publicly filed its last balance sheet in 2012. 
141. 
Though often absent in the original incorporation or registration documents or 
annual filings, Epstein ultimately appeared as president, director, manager, or sole member of 
each of these companies. Upon information and belief, the purpose of this complex array of 
corporate entities—some of which may still be discovered—was to allow Epstein to shelter his 
assets in order to fund, carry out, and conceal his identity and pattern of criminal conduct. 
142. 
The Estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the 
criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise. On November 24, 2019, Epstein's Estate filed an 
Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program in the Superior 
Court of the Virgin Islands. ("Motion"). According to the Motion, the proposed program was to 
be designed to "establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program for purposes 
of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein." (Motion, at 1). 
143. 
The program proposed by the Estate, whose executors are trustees of The 1953 
Trust and officers in at least two Epstein entities, imposes confidentiality requirements and 
requires any claimant accepting an award under the program to sacrifice any other claims against 
"any person or entity arising from or related to Mr. Epstein's conduct." (Motion, at 5). It acts to 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 30 of 76 
conceal the criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise and shield its participants from liability 
and accountability for the injury they caused to the victims. 
144. 
The Estate also refused to agree to preserve documents or to release individuals 
from the non-disclosure agreements.   
145. 
Two days before his death, Epstein amended The Trust and his Last Will and 
Testament. Upon information and belief, he did so, as part of a pattern and ongoing effort to 
conceal and shield his assets from potential recovery by claimants.  
E. The "Epstein Enterprise" Violated Numerous Virgin Islands Laws 
146. 
The pattern of criminal activity engaged in by Epstein and other participants in 
the Epstein Enterprise violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 605 and 607 of the Criminally Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act ("CICO"). 
147. 
The Epstein Enterprise also violated Title 14, Chapter 3A, The Virgin Islands 
Uniform Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act relating to Trafficking of 
Persons; Title 14, Chapter 24, relating to Child Protection and Child Abuse and Neglect; Title 
14, Chapter 81, relating to Prostitution and Related Offenses; Title 18, Chapter 85, relating to 
Rape and Sexual Assault and other related offenses, as well as other Virgin Islands laws. 
148. 
The Epstein Enterprise violated Virgin Islands laws by engaging in the human 
trafficking of underage girls and young women and commercial sex with young women and 
underage girls by force, fraud, enticement, or coercion, which serve as predicates to the Epstein 
Enterprise's violations of CICO. 
149. 
Certain participants who recruited women and underage girls to be trafficked 
and forced into sexual servitude themselves were sexually trafficked and abused by the Epstein 
Enterprise and may be afforded the protections of 14 V.I.C. § 145. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 31 of 76 
150. 
Specifically, Plan D, LLC knowingly and intentionally facilitated the 
trafficking scheme by flying underage girls and young women into the Virgin Islands to be 
delivered into sexual servitude. Plan D LLC repeatedly made flights from the mainland to 
St. Thomas with Epstein and underage girls and young women for the purpose of engaging 
in sexual activity on Little St. James. On some occasions, they would transport Epstein 
and female children by helicopter to Little St. James. On other occasions, Epstein and the 
young women and girls would be transported by boat. 
151. 
Great St. Jim, LLC and Nautilus, Inc. knowingly participated in the Epstein 
Enterprise and facilitated the trafficking and sexual servitude of young women and underage 
girls by providing the secluded properties at, from, or to which Epstein and his associates were 
able to transport, transfer, receive, maintain, isolate, harbor, provide, entice, deceive, coerce, 
and sexually abuse underage girls and young women. 
152. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a continuing course of unlawful conduct. 
153. 
After Epstein's suicide, the Epstein Enterprise continued to exist as each of the 
participants continued to conspire to prevent detection of the breadth and scope of the Epstein 
Enterprise's criminal wrongdoing and to prevent accountability. These conspiratorial acts are 
ongoing. 
154. 
The conduct of the Epstein Enterprise offends the core purpose of the Virgin 
Islands Uniform Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act, 14 V.I.C. §131 et seq, 
and violates CICO, enacted to "curtail criminal activity and lessen its economic and political 
power in the Territory of the Virgin Islands by establishing new penal prohibitions and 
providing to law enforcement and the victims of criminal activity new civil sanctions and 
remedies." 14 V.I.C. § 601. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 32 of 76 
155. 
The Epstein Enterprise is an illicit enterprise within the meaning of 14 V.I.C. §§ 
604 and 605. 
156. 
The Government is entitled to recover civil penalties, damages and other 
remedies and to extinguish and recoup from the Epstein Enterprise and its participants any and 
all financial and other benefits, and any personal and real property that was used during the 
course of, or intended for use in the Course of the conduct or criminal activity in violation of the 
laws of the Virgin Islands. The Government is entitled to obtain through divestiture, forfeiture, 
or other equitable relief all properties and instrumentalities used by the Epstein Enterprise in the 
criminal pattern of trafficking and sexual abuse in the Virgin Islands, including but not limited 
to Great St. James and Little St. James, and all other remedies and penalties permitted by law in 
the interest of justice. 
F. The Epstein Enterprise Used Corporate Entities to Defraud the Government 
and Fund its Criminal Activities 
1. Defendant Southern Trust Company, Inc. 
157. 
In October 2012, the Southern Trust Company applied for economic benefits 
from the Economic Development Commission ("EDC"). The EDC is a subsidiary of the Virgin 
Islands Economic Development Authority ("EDA"), a semi-autonomous governmental 
instrumentality created and governed pursuant to 29 VIC § 1101. 
158. 
In sworn testimony at a public hearing on the tax incentive application 
conducted by the EDC on November 15, 2012, Epstein and his attorney, Ericka Kellerhals, 
described Southern Trust Company as providing "cutting edge consulting services" in the area 
of "biomedical and financial informatics." 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 33 of 76 
159. 
The EDC granted Southern Trust Company a 10-year package of economic 
incentives running from February 1, 2013 until January 31, 2023 that included a 90% 
exemption from income taxes and 100% exemptions from gross receipts, excise, and 
withholding taxes in the Virgin Islands. 
160. 
Between 2013 and 2019, Southern Trust Company employed 13 different 
individuals (not including Epstein). Of those 13 individuals, 11 served in administrative or 
support roles: six as personal, administrative, or executive assistants, receptionists, or as a 
driver/helper, one as an office manager, one as a clerk, and three in accounting or payroll 
functions (though only one was licensed as a certified public accountant). There was one 
network administrator/IT manager, and a second who was added in 2019. 
161. 
In fact, several of those individuals seemed to perform other personal services 
for Jeffrey Epstein. Though he was reported by Southern Trust Company to be resident of the 
Virgin Islands, the network administrator/IT manager was issued a Florida driver's license, 
which listed an address in Miami. Further, he appears, in fact, to have served as Epstein's driver 
and picked up luggage and cargo from Epstein's private planes on his behalf. 
162. 
Another executive assistant lived at 301 E. 66th Street, Apartment 11B, New 
York, New York. Epstein's address book lists various units in this building as providing "Apt. 
for models" and she is publicly identified as a model. As noted above, the Epstein Enterprise 
used modeling opportunities and contracts as a pretext for recruiting underage girls and young 
women into its sex trafficking scheme. 
163. 
Financial records more recently obtained show that the employee described 
above whom Kahn represented to be, alternatively, an interior designer and a dentist, was also a 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 34 of 76 
paid employee of Southern Trust Company, which did not actually or even pretend to perform 
either interior design or dentistry services, in 2019.   
164. 
During several time periods, Southern Trust Company affirmed to EDC that it 
had no employees who were non-residents, even though it employed non-residents. 
165. 
Southern Trust company does not appear to have had any clients and performed 
no visible informatics services. According to financial records, it held no investments for others.  
Instead, its employees performed tasks related to any number of other Epstein-owned companies 
or properties, such as Little St. James.  
166. 
Despite having no visible clients and only one full-time employee working on 
information technology during the bulk of the period, Southern Trust Company reportedly 
generated net income of $50.3 million in 2013, $67.5 million in 2014, $52.8 million in 2015, and 
$4.8 million in 2016 and $17.1 million in 2017, with aggregate income of $117.8 million in 2014, 
$170.6 million in 2015, $175.3 million in 2016 and $192.4 million in 2017, or aggregate income 
for the period of $656 million. 
167. 
Money received by Southern Trust was then funneled, frequently by Defendant 
Indyke as authorized signatory, and often with copies given to Defendant Kahn, through other 
Epstein-owned entities and accounts, funding payments to foreign women and for credit cards, 
airplanes, and other instrumentalities of the Epstein Enterprise. 
168. 
In fact, the main source of funds for the Epstein Enterprise came from Southern 
Trust. Between 2013 and 2017, Southern Trust reported approximately $184 million in 
revenues.   
169. 
Defendants Kahn and Indyke directed and controlled the day-to-day activities of 
Southern Trust in form and in substance, serving as members of its Board of Directors, along 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 35 of 76 
with Epstein.  Indyke was a signatory on Southern Trust’s primary bank account to which funds 
were wired, primarily from a single source, as described below.  Kahn, as Southern Trust’s 
treasurer, oversaw its accounting, invoicing, and tax reporting.  Indyke also authorized a 
majority of the wire transfers from Southern Trust’s bank account in order to fund the various 
entities and personal bank accounts of Epstein, and had full inquiry capabilities over the 
account.  
170. 
Bank records show that virtually all of Southern Trust Company’s income came 
from a single source (including related entities).   
171. 
In all, the single source paid $158 million to Defendant Southern Trust Company 
from 2013 to 2017, which constitutes 85% of the total revenues reported by Southern Trust 
Company.  These funds appear to have not been used to pay for informatics or datamining 
services.     
172. 
These payments to Southern Trust were the main source of funds for Epstein’s 
Enterprise.  Indeed, no other entity in Epstein’s Enterprise generated revenues.  Funds received 
from the single source were funneled, at the direction of Kahn and Indyke, to Epstein’s personal 
accounts, and other Epstein entities to fund his criminal activities. 
173. 
For the period between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017, Southern Trust 
Company received tax exemptions totaling $73.6 million. 
174. 
As of December 31, 2017, Southern Trust Company, Inc. elected to file its 
income tax as an S-corporation, which elects to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and 
credits through to its sole shareholder—Jeffrey Epstein—for tax purposes. For this time period, 
Epstein's income tax exemption was $71.3 million. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 36 of 76 
175. 
Including gross receipt taxes, the Government currently estimates that, as a 
result of the EDC incentive, Epstein was able to avoid paying $80,576,236 in taxes. 
176. 
Based upon these facts, it is clear that Southern Trust Company did not perform 
the "informatics" business represented to the EDC and could not have generated the business 
income attributable to that business. Instead, upon information and belief, Southern Trust 
Company existed to secure tax benefits for Epstein, to employ individuals associated with the 
Epstein Enterprise, and to provide a source of income to support his criminal activities and 
properties in the Virgin Islands. 
2. 
Defendants Cypress, Inc.; Maple, Inc.; and Laurel, Inc. 
177. 
Epstein formed Cypress, Inc.; Maple, Inc.; and Laurel, Inc. as Virgin Islands 
corporations in or about November 2011. 
178. 
As of December 31, 2018, Epstein was listed as President Director and 
Defendants and Co-Executors Indyke and Kahn were listed, respectively, as Vice President/ 
Secretary/Director and Treasurer/Director of each of Cypress, Inc.; Maple, Inc.; and Laurel, Inc. 
179. 
Defendant Cypress, Inc. acquired ownership of the property 49 Zorro Ranch 
Road in Stanley, New Mexico in or about December 2011, shortly after Cypress was formed. 
180. 
Defendant Maple, Inc. acquired ownership of the property 9 East 71st Street in 
New York, New York on or about December 23, 2011, shortly after Maple was formed.  Maple 
acquired ownership of the property from Nine East 71st Street Corporation, which was owned by 
Epstein. 
181. 
Defendant Laurel, Inc. acquired ownership of the property 358 Brillo Way in 
Palm Beach, Florida in or about December 2011, shortly after Cyrpess was formed.  Laurel 
acquired ownership of the property from Epstein personally. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 37 of 76 
182. 
Epstein appears to have maintained divided ownership of these properties, 
transferred ownership of them to the Virgin Islands, and then concealed this fact even from 
Virgin Islands authorities in an attempt to shield the properties from any judgment in the states 
where they are located. 
183. 
The financial statements submitted by each of these three Defendant corporations 
to the Office of Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands were false and misleading due to their 
failure to include the above properties owned by each company or the related expenses incurred 
by each company, such as property taxes. 
184. 
For instance, Cypress’s Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect 
any assets other than cash of $18,824. Further, Cypress reported only $301 in expenses for the 
year ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $106,394.60 in Santa Fe property taxes on 
November 6, 2018. 
185. 
Similarly, in 2017, Cypress reported as its only asset cash in the amount of 
$29,736 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $55,770.41 and $113,679.56 in Santa Fe 
property taxes during 2017. 
186. 
Similarly, for the tax years 2011 through 2016, Cypress did not include the value 
of the New Mexico property in the total assets it reported and did not include any expenses 
related to the New Mexico property in the total expenses it reported to the Government. 
187. 
Likewise, Maple’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect any 
assets other than cash of $21,265. Further, Maple reported only $300 in expenses for the year 
ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $336,471.87 in New York City property taxes 
during 2018. 
-

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 38 of 76 
188. 
Similarly, in 2017, Maple reported as its only asset cash in the amount of 
$18,281 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $327,497.48 and $6,487.04 in New York City 
property taxes during 2017. 
189. 
Similarly, for the tax years 2011 through 2016, Maple did not include the value 
of the New York property in the total assets it reported and did not include any expenses related 
to the New York property in the total expenses it reported to the Government. 
190. 
Likewise, Laurel’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect any 
assets other than cash in the amount of $20,155. Further, Laurel reported only $300 in expenses 
for the year ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $196,673.56 in Palm Beach property 
taxes on November 6, 2018. 
191. 
Similarly, in 2017, Laurel reported as its only asset cash in the amount of 
$37,129 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $191,941.52 in Palm Beach property taxes on 
October 31, 2017. 
192. 
Similarly, for the tax years 2011 through 2016, Laurel did not include the value 
of the Palm Beach property in the total assets it reported and did not include any expenses related 
to the Palm Beach property in the total expenses it reported to the Government. 
193. 
Neither Cypress’s, Maple’s, nor Laurel’s financial statements ever reflected the 
reality of the above assets held or the above expenses incurred by each entity. 
194.

In fact, Indyke and Kahn knew or should have known that their attestations were 
false.  Upon information and belief, particularly given the absence of any other justification for 
these transactions and the fraudulent nature of their reporting, these transactions were made for 
the sole purpose of sheltering these assets from collection. 
STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ARE TOLLED AND DEFENDANTS ARE ESTOPPED 
FROM ASSERTING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS AS DEFENSES 
1. 
Equitable Estoppel and Fraudulent Concealment 
196. 
Defendants are equitably estopped from relying upon a statute of limitations 
defense for conduct that occurred prior to the limitation period because they undertook active 
efforts to deceive the Government and to purposefully conceal their unlawful conduct and 
fraudulently assure public authorities that their conduct was in compliance with the laws, all with 
the goal of avoiding punishment. 
197. 
Defendants were deliberate in taking steps to conceal their criminal sex 
trafficking and abuse conduct and their fraudulent conduct in obtaining unearned tax benefits 
from the Government.  Defendants’ acts of concealment include, but are not limited to, the 
following. 
198. 
Defendants used Epstein’s secluded island of Little St. James and his later 
purchase of the nearby island of Great St. James to shield their trafficking and sexual abuse of 
young women and female children from detection by law enforcement authorities and to prevent 
their victims from escaping. 
199. 
Defendants used Epstein’s private aircraft to transport young women and female 
children to the Virgin Islands and to Little St. James while limiting public observation of this 
trafficking activity. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 40 of 76 
200. 
Defendants used Epstein’s businesses and ostensibly charitable foundations in 
the Virgin Islands to make payments to the victims who were trafficked and sexually abused 
while concealing these payments from detection by law enforcement authorities. 
201. 
Defendants also prevented Epstein Enterprise entity employees from cooperating 
with law enforcement by requiring them to sign confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. 
202. 
Defendants also actively obstructed law enforcement by denying investigators 
access to Little St. James beyond its boat dock. 
203. 
Defendants also attempted to conceal their criminal sex trafficking and abuse 
conduct by paying large sums of money to participant-witnesses, including by paying for their 
attorneys’ fees and case costs in litigation related to this conduct. 
204. 
Epstein also threatened harm to victims and helped release damaging stories 
about them to damage their credibility when they tried to go public with their stories of being 
trafficked and sexually abused. 
205. 
Epstein also instructed one or more Epstein Enterprise participant-witnesses to 
destroy evidence relevant to ongoing court proceedings involving Defendants’ criminal sex 
trafficking and abuse conduct. 
206. 
Defendants also concealed their fraud on the Government in obtaining unearned 
tax benefits by providing false testimony and submitting false and inaccurate reporting to the 
Economic Development Commission to prevent detection of Defendant Southern Trust 
Company’s non-compliance with requirements concerning the nature of its business and the 
residency of the persons it employed. 
207. 
The discovery of the nature, scope, and magnitude of Defendants’ unlawful 
conduct and could not have been acquired earlier through the exercise of reasonable diligence.

Continuing Violations 
208. 
The continuous criminal conduct by the Defendants has caused repeated and 
continuous injury. 
209. 
Defendants criminal trafficking and sexual abuse of young women and female 
children in the Virgin Islands occurred continuously from Epstein’s purchase of Little St. James 
in 1998 through his arrest and death in prison in 2019. 
210. 
Flight logs and other sources establish that between 2001 and 2019, Defendants 
transported young women and female children to the Virgin Islands, where they were then 
transported by private helicopter or boat to Little St. James. 
211. 
Air traffic controllers and airport personnel have reported seeing, as recently as 
2018, Epstein leaving his private jet with young girls who appeared to be between the ages of 11 
and 18 years. 
212. 
One victim was brought by Defendants more than 50 times between 2000 and 
2002, when she was around 18 to 20 years old, to Little St. James, where she was required to 
have sexual relations with Epstein or his guests multiple times per day and where she saw large 
numbers of other young women and female children subject to the same treatment. 
213. 
Another victim was brought by Defendants dozens of times between 2004 and 
2017 to Little St. James, where she too observed a succession of young women and female 
children who likewise were transported to the island and were required to have sexual relations 
with Epstein and his guests. 
214. 
Defendants’ fraud on the Government in obtaining unearned tax benefits through 
Defendant Southern Trust Company likewise was continuous inasmuch as Southern Trust’s 
failure to perform the informatics services that it represented to the Economic Development

Page 42 of 76 
Commission and its false reporting of the residency and job descriptions of its employees were 
continuous from the start of the tax benefits in 2013 through Epstein’s arrest and death in prison 
in 2019. 
215. 
The continued criminal conduct by Defendants has caused repeated and 
continuous injury.  The criminal conduct of the Epstein Enterprise was not completed nor were 
all damages incurred until the wrongdoing ceased.

Each Defendant engaged in acts that revealed its intent to join and participate in 
the criminal conspiracy, including, but not limited to, transferring assets to and between various 
entities controlled by Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise to avoid, defeat, hinder, or delay claims 
against them. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 73 of 76 
424. 
These false statements and documents included annual financial statements for the 
years 2011 to 2018 submitted by each Cypress, Maple, and Laurel to the Office of Lieutenant 
Governor of the Virgin Islands that misrepresented the value of the assets held and the amount of 
the expenses incurred by each company during each of these years. 
425. 
Epstein appears to have maintained divided ownership of these properties, 
transferred ownership of them to the Virgin Islands, and then concealed this fact even from 
Virgin Islands authorities in an attempt to shield the properties from any judgment in the states 
where they are located. 
426. 
Defendants knowingly benefitted financially and/or obtained other non-financial 
value from their participation in the Epstein Enterprise, which has engaged in human trafficking, 
forced labor, sexual servitude, and commercial sexual activity of underage girls and young 
women, in knowing and reckless disregard of the laws of the Virgin Islands. 
Notice of Allegation of  
PUNITIVE DAMAGES 
427. 
The purpose of punitive damages in the common law is to punish the defendant 
for outrageous conduct that is reckless or intentional and to deter others from engaging in such 
conduct in the future. 
428. 
This Complaint describes intentional conduct so egregious, persistent, and 
injurious that it shocks the conscience and offends a civilized society. 
429. 
Punitive damages are especially important in the case of persons or companies 
that have so money, assets, and power that mere fines, penalties, and economic damages are 
simply not sufficient. 

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI’s Second Amended Complaint  
Page 74 of 76 
430. 
At all times material herein, Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise engaged 
repeatedly in wrongful acts which were intentional and outrageous. The Government gives 
notice that it intends to pursue the possibility of punitive damages in any jury verdict.

DIVISION OF ST. THOMAS AND ST. JOHN 
********************************* 
IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF 
JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN, 
Deceased. 
CASE NO: ST-2021-RV-00005 
Originating Case No: ST-19-PB-80 
REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR AWARD OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES 
COME NOW the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Epstein 
Estate”), DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN (the “Co-Executors”), and submit 
this reply brief in support of their Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees (the “Motion for Attorneys’ 
Fees”) dated March 4, 2022.1 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
The Co-Executors Are Entitled To Their Attorneys’ Fees. 
Despite having made the GVI Motions in the Probate Division, the GVI argues in 
its opposition that (i) the Court orders denying the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal (together, the 
“Orders”) are not “judgments” and a party may not receive attorneys’ fees until the entirety of the 
proceedings are complete, and (ii) the Co-Executors are not the “prevailing party.”  That is 
incorrect.  First, the GVI ignores that this is a probate matter in which the asserted need for a final 
judgment resolving the proceeding is neither logical nor required by applicable statute.  Second, 
the GVI’s argument that attorneys’ fees are not available without a final judgment is inconsistent 
with longstanding Virgin Islands case law.  Third, in light of the nature of the Probate Action, the 
relief unsuccessfully sought by the GVI in the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, and existing case 
1. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees.

law, the Co-Executors were the prevailing party on these applications and are accordingly entitled 
to an award of their attorneys’ fees.  
A. A Final “Judgment” Is Not Required to Obtain Fees in a Probate Matter. 
The GVI bases its argument that an award of costs or attorney’s fees is available 
only upon a “judgment” on the language of 5 V.I.C. § 541.  (GVI Opp. at 3.)  However, the GVI 
disregards the language of 15 V.I.C. § 165, which applies to matters arising in probate proceedings 
such as the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal.  15 V.I.C. § 165 (stating that it applies “[w]ith respect 
to matters to which [Chapter 15] relates” and implicitly distinguishing between such matters and 
“civil action[s] in the district court”).  Probate proceedings are distinct, statutory actions that may 
require the resolution of many disputes, often among multiple parties, before the close of probate.  
In such matters—and as the Virgin Islands Code recognizes—costs are not reserved for the 
conclusion of the probate proceeding or a final “judgment,” but are instead available “in favor of 
one party against another . . . in any proceedings contested adversely.”  15 V.I.C. § 165.   
While the GVI notes that the standard for an award of attorneys’ fees is the same 
under 5 V.I.C. § 541 and 15 V.I.C. § 165 (GVI Opp. at 3 n.1), it cites no support—because none 
exists—for its argument that the purported requirement from Section 541 that there be a final 
“judgment” applies equally under Section 165 to probate proceedings such as this one.  Because 
the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal were contested, adversarial proceedings, an award of attorneys’ 
fees is available here pursuant to Section 165.   
B. The GVI’s Arguments Are Inconsistent with Applicable Case Law. 
Even outside of the probate context, no case supports the GVI’s argument that fees 
and costs cannot be awarded absent an appealable judgment.  To the contrary, Virgin Islands case

Probate No. ST-21-RV-05 
Reply in Support of Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees 
Page 3 
law indicates that, in civil actions, attorneys’ fees and costs may be awarded absent a final 
judgment.   
For example, in John v. Maldonado, the parties settled before trial (and therefore 
without a final judgment, such as the GVI seeks to require here) and the plaintiff thereafter sought 
reimbursement for his attorney’s fees and costs incurred in maintaining the suit before it settled.  
Civ. No. 536–1988, 1991 V.I. LEXIS 13, at *5-6 (V.I. Terr. Ct. June 11, 1991).  The Court held 
that the plaintiff could recover his fees and costs, and characterized the defendant’s argument that 
the plaintiff was not the “prevailing party in the judgment” because the parties settled as “almost 
frivolous, for it has long been settled in the Virgin Islands that ‘as long as a plaintiff achieves some 
of the benefits sought in maintaining a lawsuit, even though that plaintiff does not ultimately 
succeed in securing the judgment sought, the plaintiff can be considered the prevailing party for 
purposes of a fee award.’”  Id. at *7 (quoting Ingvolstad v. Kings Wharf Island Enterprises, Inc., 
V.I. 314, 317 (Dist. Ct. 1983) (citations omitted), aff’d., 734 F.2d 5 (3d Cir. 1983).  
Similarly, in Melendez v. Rivera, the parties engaged in litigation but resolved the 
matter before trial.  Civ. No. 10/1988, 1988 WL 1628341, at *1 (V.I. Terr. Ct. Oct. 28, 1988).  The 
Court awarded fees and costs to the respondent, reasoning that: 
While as a rule the prevailing party is considered to be the one in 
whose favor a decision or verdict is rendered and a judgment is 
entered, the term may be construed more broadly.  The test is 
whether a party has achieved at least some of the benefits which 
were sought in the litigation, even if a judgment is not finally 
obtained. 
Id. at *3 (citations omitted); see also, e.g., Great Bay Condo. Owners Ass’n v. Socolof, No. ST-
13-CV-426, 2019 V.I. LEXIS 165, at *7 (V.I. Sup. Ct. Feb. 25, 2019) (“Whether a party is a 
prevailing party does not turn on whether it obtained success through litigation—through a formal 
determination of the Court—but whether it prevailed in obtaining the relief it sought.”).

The Third Circuit has likewise repeatedly held that a litigant can be considered the 
“prevailing party” for purposes of a fee award as long as it achieves some of the benefits it sought 
in the lawsuit, even though it does not secure a judgment.  See, e.g., People Against Police Violence 
v. City of Pittsburgh, 520 F.3d 226, 234 (3d Cir. 2008) (finding the plaintiff constituted a 
“prevailing party” entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees where it successfully obtained a 
preliminary injunction, even where no final “judgment” was reached); P.N. v. Clementon Bd. of 
Edu., 442 F.3d 848, 855-57 (3d Cir. 2006) (finding that party that obtained interim orders requiring 
action in its favor was “prevailing party” entitled to attorneys’ fees); NAACP v. Wilmington Med. 
Ct., Inc., 689 F.2d 1161, 1165 (3d Cir. 1982) (holding that “a prevailing party can be awarded fees 
before the conclusion of protracted litigation”).  See also Golden v. N.J. Inst. Of Tech., 934 F.3d 
302 (3d Cir. 2019) (finding that party was entitled to attorneys’ fees under New Jersey statute 
requiring a party to prevail where the lawsuit served as the catalyst for desired action). 
C. The Co-Executors Are the Prevailing Party Since the Orders Dispensed with the 
Then-Pending Litigation. 
The Virgin Islands Supreme Court recently directed courts to interpret the term 
“prevailing party” for the purposes of awarding attorneys’ fees “liberally and broadly” “in light of 
the Legislature’s intent to indemnify the party that is not at fault in the litigation.”  DaCosta v. 
DaCosta, 74 V.I. 640, 647 (V.I. 2021).  Given the underlying Probate Action, the facts underlying 
the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, the relief awarded in the Orders, and the law discussed above 
in Sections I.A and B, there can be no doubt that the Co-Executors were the prevailing party here.   
The GVI seeks to frame the “prevailing party” analysis in terms of the merits of the 
claim it filed against the Estate after this Court denied the GVI Appeal with prejudice.  But that 
claim is not what the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal concerned.  Rather, those applications 
exemplified the GVI’s attempted interference with the ongoing administration of the Estate and

Probate No. ST-21-RV-05 
Reply in Support of Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees 
Page 5 
the Estate’s funding of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program, based purely on the GVI’s 
separate CICO Action and without the GVI submitting to the jurisdiction of the Probate Division 
by filing a formal claim—despite Magistrate Judge Hermon-Percell’s express direction on 
February 4, 2020 that the GVI do so.  The GVI’s consistent strategy throughout these probate 
proceedings has been to assert that it is entitled to control the administration of the Estate with no 
regard for probate rules.  Through the Orders, the Co-Executors prevailed in obtaining the Court’s 
affirmance that the GVI could not assume the Co-Executors’ fiduciary responsibilities and that, if 
the GVI wishes to be heard in the probate proceedings, it must submit to the Probate Division’s 
jurisdiction and file a claim in the Probate Action.  Particularly given the nature of the Probate 
Action, which requires complex administration completely outside of the final determination of 
individual claims, this successful realignment of the parties’ legal relationship is separate from the 
merits of the GVI’s CICO Action.  See supra Section I.B; see also, e.g., Tex. State Teachers Ass’n 
v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989) (finding that a party may be the “prevailing 
party” entitled to legal fees if the resolution of the dispute “changes the legal relationship” between 
the parties).   
II. 
An Award of Attorneys’ Fees Against The GVI Is Appropriate. 
The litigation resolved by the Orders was also separate from the GVI’s claim in the 
Probate Action, which as noted above the GVI did not even file until after the Probate Division 
issued its Orders and this Court upheld those Orders on the GVI Appeal.  That the GVI hopes it 
will eventually succeed in the CICO Action—which forms the sole basis for its probate claim—is 
irrelevant to the award of attorneys’ fees here, and the Court should not deny the Motion for 
Attorneys’ Fees on that basis.

Probate No. ST-21-RV-05 
Reply in Support of Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees 
Page 6 
In addition, the Court should reject the GVI’s assertion—for which it once again 
provides no support—that the Court should not award attorneys’ fees because its failed GVI 
Motions and GVI Appeal allegedly relate to a law enforcement action.  (GVI Opp. at 6.)  The 
Virgin Islands Legislature chose to allow prevailing parties to recover costs and attorneys’ fees 
because “a party should not have to bear the legal expenses of demonstrating either that it is not at 
fault or that it is the victim of another’s fault,” and it is intended as an indemnity.  DaCosta, 74 
V.I. at 646-47 (quoting Int’l Leasing & Rental Corp. v. Gann, Civ. No. 08-40, 2010 WL 1284464, 
at *1 (D.V.I. Mar. 23, 2010)) (finding that Section 541 should be interpreted broadly in light of 
this intent).  The GVI’s pending CICO Action does not in and of itself entitle the GVI to obtain 
relief in the Probate Action or use any litigation tactics it chooses to interfere with the orderly 
administration of the Estate; nor does the GVI’s role as a government agency justify forcing the 
Estate to bear the costs of defending against the GVI’s unsuccessful attempts to do so.  See Equivest 
St. Thomas, Inc. v. Gov't of Virgin Islands, No. CIV.2001-155, 2004 WL 3037953, at *7 (D.V.I. 
Dec. 31, 2004) (rejecting the GVI’s argument that it should not have to pay attorneys’ fees and 
costs because of its “financial plight,” particularly given the GVI’s unwise decision to litigate the 
matter at issue).   
To the extent that equity is relevant to the grant of attorneys’ fees, it favors the Co-
Executors.  The GVI made the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal in a vain effort to impede the 
administration of the Estate, including funding of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program, 
which provided compensation for 125 individual claimants seeking redress for sexual abuse.  
Moreover, this litigation was needlessly prolonged by the GVI’s year-long delay in appealing the 
GVI Motion to Intervene and the GVI’s refusal to follow Judge Hermon-Percell’s direction to 
observe the requirements of probate claims procedure.  The Court should not countenance such

Probate No. ST-21-RV-05 
Reply in Support of Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees 
Page 7 
disregard for court orders and waste of Estate and judicial resources by immunizing the GVI from 
the costs of its ill-advised GVI Motions and GVI Appeal.  
III. 
The Co-Executors’ Counsels’ Rates Are Not Excessive. 
In its opposition, the GVI ignores the case law and evidentiary support presented 
by the Co-Executors regarding the reasonableness of their counsels’ rates.  Instead, the GVI asserts 
flatly that attorneys in the Virgin Islands can never, under any circumstances, obtain compensation 
greater than $350 per hour.  (GVI Opp. at 7-8.)  The Court should not credit the GVI’s refusal to 
consider the Virgin Islands Supreme Court’s direction that an attorney’s normal billing rate is 
evidence of a reasonable rate, the experience of the attorneys in question, the magnitude and 
complexity of the Estate and the unprecedented challenge presented by the GVI Motions and GVI 
Appeal, or the evidence that rates for attorneys in the Virgin Islands have risen (like the costs of 
everything else) in the years since courts approved unchanging rates for Virgin Islands attorneys.  
As the Virgin Islands Supreme Court recently held, courts cannot simply apply a preconceived 
belief regarding attorneys’ rates in the Virgin Islands—rather, they must consider evidence 
including the attorneys’ normal billing rates.  Mahabir v. Heirs of James Wellington George, S. 
Ct. Civ. No. 2014-0025, 2021 WL 6100552, at *3 (V.I. Dec. 22, 2021) (finding that courts should 
not use preconceived notions of current standard rates as a basis to lower the requested standard 
rate and that “the value of an attorney’s time generally is reflected in his normal billing rate”) 
(quoting Estien v. Christian, 507 F.2d 61, 63 (3d Cir. 1975)).2     
2. With regard to the rates of the Co-Executors’ New York counsel, the GVI cites no law in support of its untenable 
position that the Court should not consider prevailing New York rates in determining reasonable compensation.  
The GVI’s own use of Motley Rice LLC—a firm with more than 100 attorneys and offices in New York, New 
Jersey, Washington, D.C., South Carolina, Rhode Island, Connecticut, West Virginia and Pennsylvania—to 
represent it in the CICO and Probate Actions demonstrates the GVI’s recognition that counsel outside of the 
Virgin Islands with special expertise in similar cases is necessary and appropriate here.

IV. 
The Hours Expended by the Co-Executors’ Counsel in Defeating the GVI Motions 
and GVI Appeal Are Reasonable. 
Finally, the GVI argues that the Court should exclude several of the Co-Executors’ 
counsels’ time entries because they contain “vague descriptions, duplicative tasks, unrelated 
matters, and clerical work.”  (GVI Opp. at 9.)  Despite the GVI’s contention, those time entries are 
reasonable.   
A. The Time Entries Are Not Vague. 
Courts in the Virgin Islands have recognized that allegedly “vague” billing entries 
are reasonable where, as here, they are “sufficiently clear to allow [the court] to know the tasks to 
which [the attorney] devoted his time.”  Watts v. Blake-Coleman, No. CV 2011-61, 2014 WL 
902231, at *2 (D.V.I. Mar. 7, 2014) (quoting Tenafly Eruv Ass’n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, 195 
F.App’x 93 (3d Cir. 2006)) (finding that entries such as “Attn to brief” and “Attn to reply” provided 
the requisite level of specificity).  The Third Circuit has similarly held that time entries that provide 
the “general nature of the activity and the subject activity where possible,” as well as “the date the 
activity took place and the amount of time worked on the activity,” are reasonable.  Rode v. 
Dellarciprete, 892 F.2d 1177, 1191 (3d Cir. 1990); see also Washington v. Phila. Cnty. Court of 
Common Pleas, 89 F.3d 1031, 1038 (3d Cir. 1996) (same). 
Likewise, courts in the Virgin Islands have granted attorneys’ fees for time entries 
consisting of so-called “block billing” where the court was “able to determine that the time spent 
on the various tasks was reasonable.”  Chem. Bank v. Lampe Fam. Living Tr. (Irrevocable Living 
Tr. Agreement), No. CV 2018-23, 2019 WL 4259459, at *3 (D.V.I. Sept. 9, 2019).  It is “not 
necessary to know the exact number of minutes spent nor the precise activity to which each hour 
was devoted nor the specific attainments of each attorney.”  Rode, 892 F.2d at 1190 (quoting Lindy

Probate No. ST-21-RV-05 
Reply in Support of Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees 
Page 9 
Bros. Builders, Inc. of Phila. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanatory Corp., 487 F.2d 161, 167 
(3d Cir.1973)).  
Here, the GVI claims that several billing entries are “vague” because they contain 
“block billing,” that certain words contained in the entries are “unclear,” or that the amount of time 
spent on each individual task set forth in the entry is not separately broken out.  (GVI Opp. Ex. 2.)  
That is baseless nit-picking:  each of the entries conveys the nature of the activity and overall time 
worked, and is sufficient for the Court to determine that the amount of time spent was reasonable.  
Similarly, while the GVI asserts that some entries are “vague” because the GVI claims that it 
cannot discern to which hearing or motion the entry refers, not only do the entries themselves make 
that information abundantly clear—for example, the GVI absurdly claims that it cannot tell what 
hearing the Co-Executors’ counsel attended on February 4, 2020, when Judge Hermon-Percell 
conducted an all-day evidentiary hearing which the GVI’s attorneys also attended (GVI Opp. Ex. 
(Christopher Kroblin’s 10th expressly-listed time entry))—but the attorneys’ affidavits attached 
to the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees also state that the relevant time entries relate to the GVI Motions 
and GVI Appeal.   
B. The Time Entries Are Not Duplicative. 
The GVI also argues that the Estate’s entries are “duplicative” because more than 
one attorney participated in drafting or revising briefs in successful opposition to the GVI Motions 
and GVI Appeal.   
The GVI’s argument misses the mark.  Courts in the Third Circuit have recognized 
that “overlapping” billing entries are reasonable when each attorney plays a “differing role” in 
accomplishing certain tasks or each attorney’s presence is “essential” to the completion of the task.  
See, e.g., Hatchett v. Cty. of Philadelphia, No. CIV.A. 09-1708, 2010 WL 4054285, at *4 (E.D. 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein  
Probate No. ST-21-RV-05 
Reply in Support of Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees 
Page 10 
Pa. Oct. 15, 2010) (finding that overlapping time entries were reasonable where multiple attorneys 
billed for attending a conference and a meeting); Inventor Holdings, LLC v. Bed Bath & Beyond 
Inc., No. CV 14-448-GMS, 2016 WL 10957312, at *1 n.1 (D. Del. July 14, 2016), aff’d, 876 F.3d 
1372 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (finding that, where multiple attorneys billed to complete a particular 
project, the hours expended were reasonable).   
As detailed in the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and discussed above, defeating the 
GVI Motions and GVI Appeal was of significant importance to the Co-Executors and the Probate 
Division’s oversight over the ongoing administration of the Estate, and those applications had far-
reaching implications for the Estate and the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program.  (Mot. for 
Attorneys’ Fees at 8-9, 17-18.)  Moreover, the GVI’s attempt to intervene in the Probate Action 
and seize control of the Estate’s assets rested on unsupported applications of law and baseless 
accusations concerning the Co-Executors and the Probate Division’s ability to effectively 
administer the Estate.  It is both unsurprising and reasonable that completing the tasks necessary 
to defeat those applications required the input of different attorneys—each of whom has differing 
expertise and knowledge of different aspects of the Estate.  As each of these attorneys played a 
different role and was essential to completion of the tasks necessary to defeat the GVI’s ill-
conceived applications, there is no unreasonable duplication in the time entries.   
Moreover, the rules and orders governing pro hac vice admission to practice law 
before Virgin Islands courts require that the regularly admitted attorney who moved for a pro hac 
vice admission review the work of pro hac vice counsel and accompany such counsel to hearings 
to insure compliance with local rules.  See, e.g., V.I. S. Ct. R. 201(a)(4) (“The regularly admitted 
attorney of record shall be accountable to the Supreme Court for the timely prosecution of such 
causes and compliance with all applicable rules . . .”).  Not only is it not duplicative to have both

Page 11 
pro hac vice and regularly admitted Virgin Islands counsel work together on briefs and appear 
together at hearings, it is actually required. 
C. The Time Entries Do Not Contain Unrelated Entries. 
The GVI also incorrectly asserts that the Estate “lumped” together unrelated time 
entries, pointing mainly to references to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program and 
incidental tasks related to administration of the Estate that arose in direct relation to the GVI 
Motions and GVI Appeal.  As discussed above and in the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, the GVI’s 
primary purpose in filing the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal was to wrongfully interfere with the 
ongoing administration of the Estate, including funding of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation 
Program.  The GVI therefore should not be surprised that its applications required some work to 
defend.  As all of the time entries relate to the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal, they are reasonable 
and should be allowed.  See, e.g., Tangible Value, LLC v. Town Sports Int’l Holdings, Inc., No. 
10-1453-MAS-TJB, 2014 BL 325994, at *11 (D.N.J. Nov. 17, 2014) (finding that the “bundling” 
of numerous tasks under a single entry was reasonable where the tasks were not grouped together 
“indiscriminately,” but were instead related); Washington Federal Savings Bank v. McGuier (In 
re McGuier), 346 B.R. 151, 168 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 2006) (finding that “lumped” time entries were 
reasonable based on the “specificity of the entries and the Court’s actual knowledge of services 
provided”).   
D. The Time Entries Are Not for Clerical Work. 
While the GVI complains about time spent by Virgin Islands legal assistant Shauna 
Betz, the weight of authority holds that time spent by paralegals and legal assistants is properly 
recoverable.  See, e.g., MRL Development, LLC v. Whitecap Investment Corp., Civ. No. 2013-48, 
2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46211, at *11 (D.V.I. March 23, 2017) (collecting cases).  The GVI cites 

Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein  
Probate No. ST-21-RV-05 
Reply in Support of Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees 
Page 12 
no authority for its bizarre theory that a movant must identify an individual (here, the same 
individual) as a “paralegal” rather than a “legal assistant” in order for their services to be 
compensable.  See id. (using the terms paralegal and legal assistant interchangeably).  Likewise, 
while the GVI complains that Ms. Betz’s work in cases where courts found her time recoverable 
“included drafting pleadings,” her work here likewise include proofreading and reviewing briefs.  
(See, e.g., GVI Opp. Ex. 2 (Ms. Betz’s time entries).)  
The GVI’s other complaints about purported “clerical work” likewise fail.  As each 
of the time entries relates to preparation and drafting of the Co-Executors’ oppositions to the GVI 
Motions and GVI Appeal, these entries are reasonable. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth herein and in the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, the Co-
Executors respectfully request that the Court issue an award reimbursing them for their attorneys’ 
fees incurred in successfully opposing the GVI Motions and GVI Appeal in the amount of 
$112,216.90.
