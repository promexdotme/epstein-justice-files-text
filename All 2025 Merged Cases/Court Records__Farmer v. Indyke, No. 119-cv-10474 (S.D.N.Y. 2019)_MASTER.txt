SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
X 
COUNT ONE 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and · 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
.in cash. 
Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. 
In 

Case 1:19-cv-10474 Document 1-1 Filed 11/12/19 Page 3 of 15 
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. 
EP~TEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Pa.lm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 

Case 1:19-cv-10474 Document 1-1 Filed 11/12/19 Page 4 of 15 
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude , would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. 
EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. 
In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. 
Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005 , EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 

Case 1:19-cv-10474 Document 1-1 Filed 11/12/19 Page 5 of 15 
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." 
During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims ' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. 
Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, mariy were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasioni at the New York Residence. 
EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. 
In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 

Case 1:19-cv-10474 Document 1-1 Filed 11/12/19 Page 6 of 15 
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. 
Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. 
When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. 
Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of addi tional minor girls. 
13. 
In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to t he New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additionil 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. 
When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. 
In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 

Case 1:19-cv-10474 Document 1-1 Filed 11/12/19 Page 7 of 15 
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruite~s to bring a specific minor girl fo~ EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. 
In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. 
EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were ·available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida . 
15. 
At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN , the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and ' 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. 
Once 
inside , the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals . 
EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 

Case 1:19-cv-10474 Document 1-1 Filed 11/12/19 Page 8 of 15 
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. 
In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN'S travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled ~or when he arrived. 
In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. 
At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. 
Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 

Case 1:19-cv-10474 Document 1-1 Filed 11/12/19 Page 9 of 15 
19. 
Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
MARIA FARMER, 
Plaintiff, 
CASE NO:  
v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN,  
in their capacities as the executors of the  
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN,  
Defendants. 
_____________________________________  
COMPLAINT 
BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP  
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 1 of 15

Plaintiff Maria Farmer, by her attorneys Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, for her Complaint 
against Defendants, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn in their capacities as the executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein (“Epstein”), avers upon personal knowledge as to her own 
acts and status and upon information and belief and to all other matters as follows: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1. 
This suit arises out of Jeffery Epstein’s sexual assault of Plaintiff. 
2. 
Maria Farmer was sexually trafficked by Epstein and a co-conspirator as part of his 
organized ring of procuring young females for sex.  As an aspiring artist, Maria believed that 
Epstein’s connections to the art world would help further her career when he offered her a 
position to procure art for him.  Maria began working for Epstein in his Manhattan mansion, 
performing a variety of tasks including procuring art and manning the guest check in at the front 
door of the home.  During the course of her employment for Epstein, Epstein and Ghislaine 
Maxwell violently sexually assaulted Maria while she was working on an art project at Epstein’s 
guest house on Les Wexner’s Ohio estate, and threatened to ruin her career and her life if she 
told anyone about the assault. 
3. 
Epstein’s trafficking scheme involved recruiting young females by making false promises 
and using his wealth, power and threats to intimidate the females into submission to his 
demands.  This same pattern was repeated numerous times with numerous young women. 
4. 
As United States District Judge Kenneth Marra found, “From between about 1999 and 
2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor girls . . . at his mansion in Palm Beach 
Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas. . . . In addition to his own sexual abuse 
of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually.  Epstein used paid 
employees to find and bring minor girls to him.  Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 2 of 15

minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.”  
Doe 1 v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1204 (S.D. Fla. 2019) (internal citations omitted).   
5. 
Epstein organized this sex trafficking network to obtain hundreds of young females for 
himself for sex, and also lent these females out to other powerful and wealthy individuals to be 
sexually abused.  
6. 
Epstein conspired with others and hired staff to maintain and keep secret this network of 
sexual abuse for years, which sprawled throughout Epstein’s residences in New York, Florida, 
New Mexico, the United States Virgin Islands, and Paris.  Epstein’s preference was to have three 
different girls a day for his sexual pleasure. 
7. 
  Despite his significant criminal activity, in 2008 Epstein received a shockingly minimal 
charge pleading guilty to a single Florida state law charge of procuring a minor for prostitution 
and a non-prosecution agreement (a “NPA”) with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida.  Unknown to the public and the victims at the time, Epstein’s lawyers were pressuring 
the Government to commit to the NPA without informing the victims.  Epstein’s multiple 
victims were kept in the dark and told to be “patient” while Epstein’s lawyers worked to protect 
him and other potential co-conspirators from prosecution.  Epstein served one year in jail, but 
was afforded the privilege of being able to leave the jail to go to work for twelve hours per day, 
six days per week. 
8. 
The NPA allowed Epstein to escape proportionate punishment for his actions and to 
continue operating his sex trafficking enterprise with liberty.   
9. 
A few years later, Epstein flippantly referred to his sexual abuse of multiple minors, and 
the slap on the wrist he had received for it, in a 2011 interview with the New York Post: 
“Billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City – and making wisecracks about his 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 3 of 15

just-ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl. ‘I am not a sexual predator, I’m an 
offender,’ the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a 
person who steals a bagel,’ said Epstein.”  Amber Sutherland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein:  I’m a 
Sex Offender Not a Predator, N.Y. Post (Feb. 25, 2011), 
https://nypost.com/2011/02/25/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-im-a-sex-offender-not-a-predator/. 
10. 
In August 2018, just one year before his death, Epstein told a New York Times reporter 
“that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it 
was perfectly acceptable.”  James B. Stewart, The Day Jeffrey Epstein Told Me He Had Dirt on 
Powerful People, N.Y. Times (Aug. 12, 2019), 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html. 
11. 
When Plaintiff was 26 years old, Epstein added her to his long list of victims by 
committing sexual assault and battery against her.  As such, Epstein is responsible for battery 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to New York common law.  The damage 
to Plaintiff has been severe and lasting. 
12. 
This action has been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of a criminal action against the 
same defendant to commence an action with respect to the event or occurrence from which the 
criminal action arose.  A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking 
enterprise from which Plaintiff’s claims arise was terminated on August 29, 2019. 
13. 
Any statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiff’s claims, if any, is tolled due to the 
continuous and active deception, duress, threats of retaliation, and other forms of misconduct that 
Epstein and his co-conspirators used to silence his many victims, including Plaintiff.  Epstein’s 
actions deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity to commence this lawsuit before his death.  Until his 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 4 of 15

death, Plaintiff feared that Epstein and his co-conspirators would harm her or her family, or ruin 
her life, if she came forward. 
14. 
Defendants are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense.  
Allowing Defendants to do so would be unjust.  Epstein and his employees intimidated each of 
his victims into silence by threatening their lives and their livelihoods.  They therefore prevented 
Plaintiff from commencing this lawsuit before his death.  By using threats, along with his wealth 
and power, Epstein was able to escape punishment for his intolerable and brutal crimes against 
countless young women and underage girls for the duration of his life. 
PARTIES 
15. 
Plaintiff Maria Farmer is a citizen and resident of Arkansas. 
16. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
17. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
18. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin Islands at 
the time of his death.  Jeffrey Epstein maintained a residence in the Southern District of New 
York.  As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Darren K. Indyke and 
Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
19. 
The amount in controversy in this action exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.00 
excluding interests and costs and is between citizens of different states. Accordingly, jurisdiction 
is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 5 of 15

20. 
Venue is proper in this Court as Epstein’s sexual abuse of Plaintiff began in New York, 
New York, where he recruited her to be a part of his organized sex trafficking ring. 
21. 
Many of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the Southern District 
of New York, where a substantial amount of Epstein’s property is located.  Thus, venue in this 
district is proper.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. 
Epstein’s Sex Trafficking Enterprise 
22. 
 Jeffrey Epstein was widely renowned as a billionaire who used his vast connections to 
powerful individuals, and seemingly unlimited wealth and resources, to create a web of 
transcontinental sex trafficking that served himself, his co-conspirators, and some of the most 
powerful people in the world. 
23. 
Epstein owned multiple residences and frequently travelled between them, including at 9 
East 71st Street, New York, New York 10021, and at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New 
Mexico 87056, where the illegal sexual crimes against Plaintiff occurred.  Epstein conservatively 
valued his New York townhome at $55,931,000.00.  Epstein conservatively valued his New 
Mexico ranch at $17,246,208.00.  In addition, Epstein owned residences in the Virgin Islands, 
Florida, France, and even on his own island, Great St. James Island, where his transcontinental 
sex trafficking of hundreds of young girls servicing him, his co-conspirators, and wealthy and 
powerful individuals around the world occurred. 
24. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein utilized his seemingly 
unlimited power, wealth, and resources, as well as his deep connections to powerful and 
politically connected individuals to intimidate and manipulate his victims of sexual abuse.  
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 6 of 15

25. 
Epstein and his co-conspirators had perfected a scheme for manipulation and abuse of 
young females.  As part of the scheme, a female “recruiter” would approach a young female and 
strike up a conversation in an effort to quickly learn about the young female’s background and 
any vulnerabilities they could expose.  The recruiter would then manipulate the young female 
into coming back to one of Epstein’s residences by offering the young female something she 
needed.  At times the recruiter’s lure would be a modeling opportunity, money for education, 
help for the young female’s family, and a whole host of other related offers depending on their 
target’s situation.  Once in the residence, the recruiter and Epstein would work in concert to 
impress and intimidate the young female with displays of vast wealth, including having 
employees that were butlers and maids formally dressed around the house.  They would also 
strategically place photographs of very powerful political and social figures amongst 
photographs and art displaying nude females in an effort to normalize the sexual abuse.  They 
would also normalize the sexual abuse by placing a massage table and spa related products 
around the massage area in an effort to legitimize the area where the abuse was set to occur.  
Once abused, Epstein and his co-conspirators continued to manipulate the victims, using their 
financial power, promises, and threats to ensure that the victim returned as directed and remained 
compliant with their demands. 
B. 
The Arrest, Prosecution, and Death of Epstein 
26. 
The sexual trafficking ring described herein started at least as early as 1995 and 
continued up until at least July 2, 2019, when the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of New York (“SDNY”) charged Epstein with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. He was arrested on July 8, 2019, pursuant to the SDNY’s Sealed 
Two Count Indictment, which is attached as Exhibit A. 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 7 of 15

27. 
The Indictment described Epstein’s conduct and his abuse and trafficking of females in 
the same trafficking operation he used to abuse and traffic Plaintiff. 
28. 
Epstein’s last will and testament (the “Will”) was executed on August 8, 2019, at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. The witnesses were Mariel Colón Miró and Gulnora Tali.  The 
Will included affidavits from Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in which they swear an 
“Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and Appointment of Local Counsel.” 
29. 
Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 
2019.  
30. 
Epstein’s last will and testament was filed on August 15, 2019, in the Probate Division of 
the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
31. 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court 
of the Virgin Islands for Epstein’s 1953 Trust on August 26, 2019.  See Certificate of Trust, In 
the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Aug. 26, 
2019). 
32. 
Epstein’s will was entered into probate on September 6, 2019, and the Superior Court of 
the Virgin Islands accordingly authorized Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn to administer 
Epstein’s estate.  See Order for Probate, In the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate 
No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019); Letters Testamentary, In the Matter of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019). 
33. 
The Will’s first article directs Epstein’s executors “to pay from my estate all expenses of 
my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my estate and all 
of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate.”  The Will further directs that “after the 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 8 of 15

payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST,” Epstein “give[s] all of my property, real 
and personal, wherever situated . . . to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust.” 
34. 
Following Epstein’s death, SDNY submitted a proposed nolle prosequi order in the 
criminal matter against him because it was required by law to do so after Epstein was deceased.  
On August 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman formally dismissed SDNY’s 
indictment against Epstein, terminating the criminal action against him.  Plaintiff’s claims are 
therefore timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
C. 
Maria Farmer 
35. 
Maria Farmer was born on November 28, 1969.  Her parents divorced when she was 
young, and her mother struggled to financially support Maria and her siblings.  In 1993, Maria 
moved to New York City to pursue art. 
36. 
In approximately 1995, Maria was an accomplished artist and graduate student at the 
New York Academy of Art.  She met Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite known 
for recruiting young girls for Epstein, at one of her art openings in New York.  Epstein noticed 
Maria’s artwork and offered to help her art career if she sold a piece of artwork to him for half 
price.  Maria agreed and sold the painting to Epstein. 
37. 
Epstein asked Maria many personal questions, including if she had a father, and other 
questions about her life and family.  Maria told Epstein that her parents were divorced, and that 
she and her family were struggling financially. 
38. 
Epstein later offered Maria a job to purchase art for him in New York, and she accepted. 
39. 
Eventually, Epstein modified Maria’s job duties to focus on monitoring and keeping 
records of who entered Epstein’s New York mansion.  In her position at the front door, she 
observed that Maxwell was regularly bringing school-aged girls to the mansion and that the girls 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 9 of 15

were always escorted upstairs.  Among the guests that came to the mansion, Maria observed 
Alan Dershowitz, a lawyer, on a number of occasions, and observed that he would go upstairs at 
the same time the young girls were there.  
40. 
Maxwell described her role to Maria as recruiting models for Epstein, and told Maria that 
the girls were interviewing for modeling positions with Victoria’s Secret, a lingerie retailer.  
Maria witnessed Maxwell approaching young females on the street and talking to them outside 
of the mansion.  Maxwell would leave the mansion claiming she had “to go get girls for Jeffrey” 
and referred to the girls she was recruiting as “nubiles.” 
41. 
At the time, Maria was unaware of the sex trafficking conspiracy and believed the girls 
and young women were being recruited for modeling positions. 
42. 
Epstein also made very clear to Maria that he was incredibly wealthy, powerful, and 
regularly in contact with world leaders.  In fact, in his New York mansion, he had photographs 
displayed of significant political figures to ensure that any young female entering the home 
would know that he had extensive government connections.  Epstein was not to be disobeyed and 
he made clear by his words and actions that there would be consequences if Maria did not 
comply with his demands.   
43. 
Epstein and Maxwell asked Maria many questions about her family.  Maria often would 
use her family members as her subjects for her artwork so she had several photographs of her 
siblings, including her younger sister Annie.  Epstein and Maxwell started asking a number of 
questions about Annie, and Maria told them how smart Annie was and how she hoped to go to a 
great college.  After seeing photos of Annie, Epstein told Maria that he wanted to fly Annie to 
New York for a visit.  Maria thought Epstein was simply being generous since Maria had 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 10 of 15

explained how much she missed seeing Annie.  What Maria did not realize was Epstein was 
intending to groom Annie for sexual abuse. 
44. 
Epstein paid for plane tickets to fly Annie to New York.  During the visit, Epstein took 
Annie and Maria to a movie.  During the movie, without Maria’s knowledge, Epstein groped 
Annie against her will.  Thereafter, Annie left New York to head home without telling Maria that 
Epstein groped her during the movie. 
45. 
After Annie’s visit to New York, Epstein began to call Annie and Maria’s mother to 
discuss Annie and to falsely claim that he was interested in helping Annie with her goal of going 
to a great college.  He eventually convinced Annie’s mother to allow Annie to fly to his ranch in 
New Mexico at the age of 16, where Maxwell and Epstein assaulted her.   
46. 
During the course of her employment with Epstein, he directed Maria to become an 
“artist in residence” at billionaire Les Wexner’s Ohio estate.  At the time, Wexner was the chief 
executive of the parent company of Victoria’s Secret.  Epstein informed Maria that she would be 
staying in Epstein’s 30,000 square foot guest house that was located on Wexner’s Ohio estate. 
47. 
During Maria’s time at Wexner’s estate, Epstein and Maxwell visited.  Epstein requested 
a foot massage from Maria.  Maria found the request to be disturbing but complied because 
Epstein was her employer. 
48. 
After complying with his request for a massage, Epstein invited Maria to sit on the bed 
where he was watching television.  Maxwell then joined them on the bed.  Epstein and Maxwell 
proceeded to attack Maria physically against her will, including by violently sexually assaulting 
Maria. 
49. 
Maria fled from the room and called the police.  But the police did not respond to her.  
Desperate for help, Maria then called her father for help.  Despite demanding to be allowed to 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 11 of 15

leave the property, Wexner’s security personnel held Maria against her will and did not let her 
leave the property for several hours, even after she pleaded with them and told them about her 
assault.  They eventually let Maria leave with her father, who had driven from Kentucky to Ohio 
to get Maria away from Epstein and Maxwell. 
50. 
After Maria returned to New York from Ohio, Maxwell called on behalf of Epstein and 
threatened Maria in order to keep her quiet: “We’re going to burn all your art.  And I just want 
you to know that anything you ever make will be burned.  Your career is burned.” 
51. 
Instead of letting Maxwell’s words silence her, Maria reported her assault to the Sixth 
Precinct of the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”).  The NYPD referred Maria to the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”).  Maria followed the instruction and called the FBI to 
make a report of the abuse.  To the extreme detriment of Maria—and also countless other victims 
who came after her—authorities ignored Maria’s reporting efforts and took no action.  
52. 
Maria also called her younger sister, Annie, who was overseas studying at an educational 
seminar for high performing high school students.  During the call, Annie shared with Maria that 
she too had been assaulted by Epstein and Maxwell in New York and New Mexico.   
53. 
Frustrated that authorities did not appear to be taking any action and in the hopes of 
exposing the crimes that Epstein and Maxwell were committing, Maria and Annie decided to 
share their stories with Vanity Fair magazine. Tragically for Maria and Annie, Epstein threatened 
and intimidated the magazine and Vanity Fair bent to those threats, ultimately publishing a 
profile of Epstein without mentioning the sisters or their allegations.  
54. 
Once Epstein and Maxwell learned that Maria had revealed their sexual abuse to Vanity 
Fair, they embarked on a campaign to destroy Maria’s reputation and art career.  They called 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 12 of 15

Maria’s clients and other individuals in the art community in New York and were ultimately 
successful in shutting her out of all art-related opportunities. 
55. 
Maxwell again called Maria to threaten her, but this time threatened her life:  “I know 
you go to the West Side Highway all the time.  While you’re out there, just be really careful 
because there are a lot of ways to die there.”  Afraid for her safety, having informed the NYPD, 
FBI, and media to no avail, Maria moved several times to try to hide from Epstein and Maxwell.  
Her fear of Epstein’s power was exacerbated by the fact that state and federal authorities, as well 
as the media, were not taking action against Epstein. 
56. 
 Maria was deeply impacted by her harrowing time with Epstein.  She underwent breast 
reduction surgery because she was unable to forget Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual assault.  
57. 
Maria suffers extreme emotional distress from an experience that has affected her for her 
entire life. 
58. 
Epstein’s sexual assault and battery of Maria continues to cause her significant distress 
and harm. 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Battery) 
59. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1–58 as if fully 
set forth herein.  
60. 
Epstein intentionally committed battery by sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was a 
young woman.  As described above, Epstein intentionally touched intimate parts of Plaintiff’s 
body in an offensive and sexual manner without her consent. 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 13 of 15

61. 
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from 
which Plaintiff’s first cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
62. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in 
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, 
loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION  
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress)  
63. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1–58 as if fully 
set forth herein.  
64. 
As a direct result of these allegations as stated, Epstein committed intentional infliction of 
emotional distress against Plaintiff.  
65. 
Epstein’s actions, described above, constitute extreme and outrageous conduct that 
shocks the conscience.  Epstein’s plan to recruit, entice, and assault Plaintiff goes beyond all 
possible bounds of decency and is intolerable in a civilized community. 
66. 
Epstein knew or disregarded the substantial likelihood that these actions would cause 
Plaintiff severe emotional distress.  
67. 
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from 
which Plaintiff’s second cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
68. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in 
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, 
loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
Case 1:19-cv-10474   Document 1   Filed 11/12/19   Page 14 of 15

WAIVER OF THE SERVICE OF SUMMONS 
To: 
David Boies 
(Name of the plaintiff's attorney or unrepresented plaintijj) 
I have received your request to waive service of a summons in this action along with a copy of the complaint, 
two copies of this waiver form, and a prepaid means of returning one signed copy of the form to you. 
I, or the entity I represent, agree to save the expense of serving a summons and complaint in this case. 
I understand that I, or the entity I represent will keep all defenses or objections to the lawsuit, the court's 
jurisdiction, and the venue of the action, but that I waive any objections to the absence of a summons or of service. 
I also understand that I, or the entity I represent, must file and serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 within 
days from 
I I /~ 5/ 19 
, the date when this request was sent (or 90 days if it was sent outside the 
United States). If I fail to do so, a default judgment will be entered against me or the entity I represent.

Duty to Avoid Unnecessary Expenses of Serving a Summons 
Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Ci ii Procedure requires certain defendants to cooperate in saving unnecessary expenses of serving a summons 
and complaint. A defendant who is located in the United States and who fails to return a signed waiver of service requested by a plaintiff located in 
the United States will be required to pay the expenses of service, unless the defendant shows good cause for the failure. 
"Good cause· does not include a belief that the lawsuit is groundless, or that it has been brought in an improper venue, or that the court has 
no jurisdiction over this matter or over the defendant or the defendant's property. 
If the waiver is signed and returned, you can still make these and all other defenses and objections, but you cannot object to the absence of 
a summons or of ser ice. 
If you waive service, then you mu t, within the time specified on the waiver form, serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 on the plaintiff 
and file a copy with the court. By signing and returning the waiver form, you are allowed more time to respond than if a summons had been served.

executors of the Estate Of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Civil Action No. 19-cv-10474 
Dear Judge Buchwald, 
We are counsel to non-party Alan Dershowitz (hereinafter "Dershowitz"). We respectfully submit this letter 
to request a pre-motion conference in compliance with Rule 2.B of the Court's Individual Practice Rules, 
and seek permission to file a motion for limited intervention in order to move to strike redundant, 
immaterial, impertinent, and scandalous matter contained in Maria Farmer's (hereinafter "Farmer") 
complaint pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(f), and separately, move for the imposition of sanctions, and an 
award attorney's fees and costs, against Farmer and her attorneys at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (hereinafter 
"BSF"). Alternatively, we request that the Court exercise its authority pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(f)(l) 
and strike the offending content sua sponte. 
Farmer has gratuitously included an impertinent, irrelevant and false allegation in her Complaint. The 
offending paragraph (39) reads as follows: Eventually, Epstein modified Maria's job duties to focus on 
monitoring and keeping records of who entered Epstein's New York mansion. In her position at the front 
door, she observed that Maxwell was regularly bringing school-aged girls to the mansion and that the girls 
were always escorted upstairs. Among the guests that came to the mansion, Maria observed Alan 
Dershowitz, a lawyer, on a number of occasions, and observed that he would go upstairs at the same time 
the young girls were there. 
The scandalous and defamatory insinuation is blatantly clear and has no relevance to the two causes of 
action Farmer is bringing against the Defendants in this case: Battery and Intentional Infliction of Emotional 
Distress. At issue is whether Jeffrey Epstein committed the tort of battery against Farmer and intentionally 
inflicted emotional distress upon her for which Epstein's estate is liable. The irrelevant and false allegation 
levelled against Dershowitz has absolutely no bearing as to the elements of the two causes of action brought 
by Farmer, nor the anticipated defenses to be asserted by Epstein's Estate. There is simply no legitimate 
purpose for including the offending content in the Complaint, and it is entirely prejudicial, defamatory, and 
harmful to the reputation of Dershowitz, and was clearly interjected into the complaint out of spite, to 
defame and to solicit media attention. 
Dershowitz has confronted the allegation made by Farmer previously. In a declaration attached to his 
Motion to Disqualify BSF as counsel for Virginia Giuffre in the Giuffre v. Dershowitz case, Dershowitz 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 9   Filed 12/06/19   Page 2 of 3
stated the following: Maria Farmer has filed an affidavit in which she falsely claims that she saw me 
walking up the steps of Jeffrey Epstein's house with young women. Not only is that claim absolutely and 
categorically false, it is provably false by the indisputable chronology. Farmer terminated any relationship 
she had with Epstein during the summer of 1996, when she was working for Leslie Wexner in Ohio and 
claims to have been assaulted by Epstein. I did not even meet Epstein until after Farmer terminated her 
relationship with him. I was never in Epstein's New York house until after Farmer was no longer in the 
house. There is no possible wcy that Farmer could have ever seen me in Epstein's house. Nor is there any 
possible wcy she could have seen me in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein with any underage females, because 
no such event ever occurred. 
The complaint posits the scandalous and salacious allegation to garner negative press for Dershowitz while 
he litigates on other fronts. Having successfully disqualified BSF from representing Virginia Giuffre in her 
action against him, the gratuitous inclusion of the allegation reeks of personal animus. To the detrirneµt of 
Dershowitz, and as Farmer and her counsel at BSF surely anticipated, the media immediately picked up on 
the allegation. To this date Dershowitz continues to be hounded by media inquiries into the false and 
surreptitious allegations. For example, upon the filing of Farmer's Complaint, countless major news outlets 
included the allegations contained in Paragraph 39 in their reporting of the filing of the complaint, including 
but not limited to, the New York Times, the New York Post, the New York Daily News, The Daily Mail, 
and The Toronto Sun. 
Dershowitz is entitled to intervention pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 24 
Dershowitz is permitted to intervention as of right pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 24(a)(2) and to permissive 
intervention pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 24(b)(l)(B). F.R.C.P. Rule 24(a)(2) requires the Court to allow 
anyone to intervene who claims an interest relating to the transaction that is the subject of the action, and 
is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant' s ability 
to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest. Injury to reputation 
satisfies this criteria. (Sackman v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 167 F.R.D. 6, 20-21 [E.D.N.Y. 1996] citing 
Penthouse Int'L Ltd. v. Playboy Enterprises, Inc., 663 F.2d 371,373,392 [2d Cir. 1981]; In re Bank ofNew 
York Derivative Litig., 320 F3d 291, 300 [2d Cir 2003.]) 
Dershowitz's reputation is again being attacked and as such that he has an interest relating to the subject 
matter of this action. In defending the suit that Plaintiff have brought, the Defendants will not necessarily 
need to defend against or seek to disprove the false allegation that Dershowitz was at Epstein's home with 
young girls, which surely insinuates nefarious conduct. Only Dershowitz is situated to protect his 
reputational interest here. 
As Dershowitz adequately meets the criteria for intervention of right, he surely meets the less restrictive 
requirements for permissive intervention. Rule 24(b )(2) provides that: Upon timely application anyone mcy 
be permitted to intervene in an action ... when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a 
question of law or fact in common .... In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the 
intervention will unduly delcy or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. "[T]he 
words claim or defense [in permissive intervention] are not to be read in a technical sense, but only require 
some interest on the part of the applicant." (Louis Berger Grp., Inc. v. State Bank of India, 802 F.Supp.2d 
482, 488 [S.D.N.Y. 2011] (quoting Dow Jones & Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 161 F.R.D. 247, 254 
[S.D.N.Y. 1995]; United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 801 F.2d 593, 594-95 [2d Cir. 1986]; U.S. Postal 
Serv. v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191 [2d Cir. 1978]; Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v. Sprint Corp., 320 F.R.D. 
358, 361 [S.D.N.Y. 2017]) 
Here, the Dershowitz adequately exemplifies "some interest on the part of the applicant" to satisfy the 
requirements of permissive intervention under Rule 24(b )(2) in protecting himself against gratuitous 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 9   Filed 12/06/19   Page 3 of 3
defamation. Dershowitz seeks intervention for the limited purpose of moving to strike the allegation against 
him to the extent it gratuitously and impertinently alleges scandalous and salacious content bearing no 
relevance to the causes of action that Farmer brings against the Defendants. Dershowitz' s motion will be 
timely as this request is filed approximately three weeks after the filing of Farmer's complaint and before 
the Defendants have joined issue by way of a responsive pleading, let alone the taking of any discovery. As 
such, it cannot be said that Dershowitz's limited intervention would unduly delay or prejudice the parties. 
Dershowitz will move to strike the allegation pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(f) 
If permitted to intervene, Dershowitz will seek to strike the defamatory and baseless allegation in Paragraph 
from Farmer's Complaint. The Court has authority to strike material that is "redundant, immaterial, 
impertinent, or scandalous" pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(f). Motions to strike will be granted when it is 
"clear that the allegations in question can have no possible bearing on the subject matter of the litigation.' 
(Lennon v. Seaman, 63 F. Supp. 2d 428, 446 [S.D.N.Y. 1999]; OTG Brands, LLC v. Walgreen Co., No. 
13-CV-9066 (ALC), 2015 WL 1499559, at *5 [S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2015] (a party seeking to strike 
allegations must show that evidence in support of the allegation would be inadmissible, the allegations have 
no bearing on relevant issues, and permitting the allegations to stand "would result in prejudice to the 
movant.") Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., 551 F.2d 887,893 [2d Cir. 1976]). 
Furthermore, the Court has the authority to strike such material on its own accord pursuant to F .R.C.P. Rule 
12(f)(l). In fact, Virginia Giuffre's allegations against Dershowitz contained the in the Motion for Joinder 
and in subsequent court filings in the CVRA case were eventually stricken from the record by Honorable 
Kenneth A. Marra, United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida sua sponte as being 
redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter pursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(f) upon Dershowitz 
motion for intervention in that case in order to move to strike. Judge Marra stated: 
" ... Mr. Dershowitz moves to intervene "for the limited purposes of moving to strike the outrageous and 
impertinent allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorneys that have 
made them." As the Court has taken it upon itself to strike the impertinent factual details.from the Rule 21 
Motion and related filings, the Court concludes that Mr. Derschowitz's [sic] intervention in this case is 
unnecessary. Accordingly, his motion to intervene will be denied as moot. Regarding whether a show cause 
order should issue, the Court finds that its action of striking the lurid details from Petitioners' submissions 
is sanction enough. However, the Court cautions that all counsel are subject to Rule 11 's mandate that all 
submissions be presented for a proper purpose and factual contentions have evidentiary support ... and that 
the Court may, on its own, strike from any pleading "any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous 
matter". 
As the Hon. Jose A. Cabranes stated in Brown v Maxwell, 929 F3d 41, 47 (2d Cir 2019): "Our legal process 
is already susceptible to abuse ... Shielded by the "litigation privilege, " bad actors can defame opponents 
in court pleadings or depositions without fear of lawsuit and liability." Dershowitz is a victim of such 
abuse, and as such, he should be afforded the opportunity to seek relief by way of intervention. 
Finally, if permitted to intervene, Dershowitz will seek the imposition of sanctions against Farmer and BSF, 
and an award of attorney's fees and costs, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927 and/or F.R.C.P. Rule 11.

500 Pearl Street 
New York, NY 10007 
Re:      Farmer v. Indyke et al., 
Case No. 19-cv-10474 
Dear Judge Buchwald, 
Plaintiff Maria Farmer writes in response to non-party Alan Dershowitz’s request for a 
pre-motion conference to seek permission to file a motion for limited intervention, to strike 
paragraph 39 of Plaintiff’s complaint, and for sanctions.  Dkt. 9.   
Paragraph 39 of Maria’s complaint states that “[i]n her position at the front door” of 
Epstein’s mansion, “she observed that [Ghislaine] Maxwell was regularly bringing school-aged 
girls to the mansion,” and that Maria “observed Alan Dershowitz, a lawyer, on a number of 
occasions, and observed that he would go upstairs at the same time the young girls were there.”  
These allegations are directly relevant to establishing Maria’s claims, and bolster the plausibility 
of the complaint’s allegations as to the existence of a sex-trafficking conspiracy, the abuse Maria 
suffered, and how Epstein and his co-conspirators were able to coerce her to remain silent.  The 
allegations serve a legitimate purpose, and are in no way “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or 
scandalous.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  
For the following reasons, the Court should deny Dershowitz’s request for a conference 
and his proposed motions in their entirety. 
I. 
Dershowitz Is Not Entitled to Intervene in This Matter. 
Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs intervention as of right, and 
provides that “the court must permit anyone to intervene who . . . claims an interest relating to the 
property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the 
action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless 
existing parties adequately represent that interest.”  Dershowitz contends that he is entitled to 
intervene to protect his reputation, but he cannot show that these proceedings will impair or impede 
his ability to do so. 
As Dershowitz concedes, Plaintiff’s allegation concerning Dershowitz was not a surprise 
to him.  See Dkt. 9 at 1–2.  In April of 2019, Plaintiff filed an affidavit in Virginia Giuffre’s 
defamation case against Dershowitz.  See Affidavit of Maria Farmer, Giuffre v. Dershowitz, No. 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 10   Filed 12/11/19   Page 1 of 3

BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP 
Hudson Yards. New York. NY 10001 1 (t) 2 12.446.2300 I (f) 212.446.2350 I www.bsfllp.com 

Civ. 3377 (S.D.N.Y. April 16, 2019), ECF No. 1-12.  In that affidavit, Plaintiff swore to and 
affirmed the same allegations about Dershowitz as those in paragraph 39: 
Alan Dershowitz was an individual who came to visit Epstein at his New York 
mansion a number of times when I was working for Epstein.  Dershowitz was very 
comfortable at the home and would come in and walk upstairs.  On a number of 
occasions I witnessed Dershowitz at the NY mansion going upstairs at the same 
time there were young girls under the age of 18 who were present upstairs in the 
house. 
Id. ¶ 4.  Dershowitz has since filed a counter-claim for defamation against Giuffre, and will likely 
try to prove his innocence by taking discovery in that case.  Therefore, he has made no showing 
that he has a need to intervene in Plaintiff’s case in order to protect his reputation.  Dershowitz is 
thus not entitled to intervention as of right. 
Nor should the Court permit Dershowitz to intervene under Rule 24(b), which governs 
permissive intervention.  The Court may grant permissive intervention when an applicant “has a 
claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.”  Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 24(b)(1)(B).  In exercising its discretion, the Court must consider “whether the intervention will 
unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3), 
and “whether parties seeking intervention will significantly contribute to full development of the 
underlying factual issues in the suit.”  U.S. Postal Serv. v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191–92 (2d Cir. 
1978). 
Dershowitz contends that he has a “claim or defense”—protecting his reputation against 
alleged defamation—that shares “a common question of law or fact” with Plaintiff’s action.  Dkt. 
at 2–3.  But, in reality, Dershowitz seeks to use intervention and a threatened motion to strike to 
make this case about a single paragraph in the complaint that was meant to corroborate Plaintiff’s 
story.  His intervention would not contribute to the full development of the underlying factual 
issues in the suit—whether Epstein and Maxwell assaulted Plaintiff and the effect of that assault 
on her.  Instead, it would simply muddy the waters and perpetuate Dershowitz’s pattern of 
attempting to salvage his reputation by making himself—as opposed to the victims and their 
abuse—the focus of different women’s proceedings against Epstein.  And although Dershowitz 
contends that he seeks to intervene solely for the limited purpose of moving to strike paragraph 39, 
the last sentence of his letter indicates that he also seeks to file an unwarranted motion for sanctions 
against Plaintiff and her counsel simply for including in the complaint an allegation about him (to 
which Plaintiff previously swore) that makes him look bad.  Such a motion would unduly delay 
and prejudice the adjudication of Plaintiff’s claims against Epstein. 
II. 
A Motion to Strike the Allegation about Dershowitz in Paragraph 39 Would Fail. 
Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits the Court to strike from a 
pleading “any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.”  “[T]he courts should not 
tamper with the pleadings unless there is a strong reason for so doing.”  Donahue v. Asia TV USA 
Ltd., 208 F. Supp. 3d 505, 516 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (Buchwald, J.) (quoting Lipsky v. Commonwealth 
United Corp., 551 F.2d 887, 893 (2d Cir. 1976)).  Allegations that are “potentially relevant” to a 
plaintiff’s claim should not be struck from the pleadings.  Id. at 517; see also Roe v. City of New 
York, 151 F. Supp. 2d 495, 510 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“To prevail in such a motion [to strike], 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 10   Filed 12/11/19   Page 2 of 3
BSF 

defendants must demonstrate that . . . the allegations have no bearing on the issues in the 
case . . . .”).  Allegations may not be stricken based solely on a movant’s denial of their veracity.  
See Phelan v. Sullivan, 541 F. App’x 21, 25 (2d Cir. 2013) (denying motion to strike where 
“allegedly defamatory statements accurately reflect their interpretations of the facts underlying the 
case, and [a party’s] objections are primarily disagreements with whether the account of the facts 
on which [opposing parties] have chosen to rely is correct”).1    
Other victims of Epstein, including Giuffre, have also alleged that they witnessed 
Dershowitz visit Epstein’s New York City home numerous times.  Plaintiff’s allegation about 
Dershowitz is therefore relevant to the plausibility of her assault allegations.  The allegation would 
help a fact-finder conclude that her story is consistent with other women’s accounts, and that it is 
therefore more likely to be true than false.  Plaintiff’s allegation about Dershowitz is also relevant 
to why she did not file her complaint sooner.  The passage of time is a fact often weaponized 
against victims of sexual assault who do not immediately take legal action.  For the past several 
years, Dershowitz has been viciously and publicly attacking and defaming the women who claim 
that they witnessed him participate in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme.  This has dissuaded 
victims such as Plaintiff from accusing him of misconduct out of fear of the same treatment.   
Because Plaintiff’s allegations in paragraph 39 are relevant to her claims against Epstein, 
a motion to strike would be frivolous, and a pre-motion conference is unnecessary.2  To the extent 
that the Court disagrees, Dershowitz has provided no reason that this topic could not be handled 
at the same time as the initial pretrial conference in this matter, after an Answer is filed.

cc:  Counsel of Record (via ECF) 
Dershowitz cites a 2015 order from the CVRA case in the Southern District of Florida to 
support the proposition that the Court could strike paragraph 39 sua sponte.  Dkt. 9 at 3.  But that 
case’s holdings are inapposite to the facts here.  The CVRA court struck “lurid details,” 
including details of sexual acts, holding that those allegations were not pertinent to the motion 
being decided.  Jane Doe 1 v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla. April 7, 2015), ECF No. 
324 at 5, 7.  Here, however, the paragraph Dershowitz seeks to strike does not contain any “lurid 
details,” and is relevant to establishing Plaintiff’s claims.     
Any motion for sanctions against Plaintiff or her counsel would be frivolous as well.  Rule 11 
requires that “factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will 
likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or 
discovery.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3).  Here, Plaintiff swore to substantively identical allegations 
in a prior affidavit and re-reviewed the allegations contained in paragraph 39 prior to the 
Complaint’s filing, rendering any motion on that ground futile.  Dershowitz also seeks to invoke 
U.S.C. § 1927, which allows for attorneys’ fees and costs if an attorney “multiplies the 
proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.”  Plaintiff submits that her good faith 
allegations in no way invited these gratuitous filings from Dershowitz, which are wholly 
meritless.  If anything, it is Dershowitz’s filing that constitutes unreasonable and vexatious 
conduct that would warrant attorneys’ fees in favor of Plaintiff.

Maria Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the executors 
of the Estate Of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Civil Action No.19-cv-10474 
Dear Judge Buchwald, 
We are counsel to non-party Alan Dershowitz (hereinafter "Dershowitz"). We respectfully submit this letter 
in reply to Maria Farmer's (hereinafter "Farmer") response letter [Dkt. No. 10] and in further support of 
Dershowitz' s letter requesting a pre-motion conference [Dkt. No. 9] seeking permission to file a motion for 
limited intervention in order to move to strike redundant, immaterial, impertinent, and scandalous matter 
contained in Farmer's complaint pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(f), and separately, move for the imposition 
of sanctions, and an award attorney's fees and costs, against Farmer and her attorneys at Boies Schiller 
Flexner LLP (hereinafter "BSF"). 
Alternatively, Dershowitz requests that the Court exercise its authority pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(f)(l) 
to strike the offending content sua sponte, and thereby, render the instant request and proposed motion to 
strike moot. 
Farmer's response letter fails to justify the inclusion of the "redundant, immaterial, impertinent, 
scandalous" matter in paragraph 39 of Farmer's complaint which amounts to little more than a gratuitous 
defamatory "cheap shot" at Dershowitz. In fact, the hyperbolic contents of the response letter is itself 
evidence of the campaign of personal animus waged against Dershowitz by BSF and its clients in court 
filings and beyond. It is ofno importance whether the allegation contained in paragraph 39 of the Farmer's 
complaint was a "surprise" to Dershowitz as Farmer and her attorneys contend. Simply put, the salacious 
allegation has no place in the action filed by Farmer against the named defendants and serves no relevant 
purpose in light of the two causes of action she brings pursuant to New York law: Battery and Intentional 
Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
Under New York law a "civil battery 'is an intentional wrongful physical contact with another person 
without consent' (Rothman v City of New York, 19 CIV. 0225 (CM), 2019 WL 3571051, at *16 [SDNY 
Aug. 5, 2019] citing Charkhy v. Altman, 252 A.D.2d 413,414 [1st Dep't 1998]) and a successful claim for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress "requires a showing of (1) extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) 
intent to cause, or reckless disregard of a substantial probability of causing, severe emotional distress; (3) 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 11   Filed 12/16/19   Page 2 of 2
a causal connection between the conduct and the injury; and (4) severe emotional distress." (Scotto v. The 
City of New York, 18-CV-04228-LTS, 2019 WL 6701919, at *4 [SDNYDec. 9, 2019] citingBenderv. City 
of New York, 78 F.3d 787, 790 [2d Cir. 1996] Stuto v. Fleishman, 164 F.3d 820, 827 [2d Cir. 1999]). 
Therefore, the allegation against Dershowitz is irrelevant and is of no consequence to Farmer in meeting 
her burden of proof as to the causes of action brought against the defendants. 
In fact, confronted with this fact, Farmer's letter is devoid of any explanation on how the allegation against 
Dershowitz has any relevance to her claims. Plaintiff claims that the allegation is "meant to corroborate 
Plaintiff's story". No corroboration can be gleaned from the gratuitous allegation against Dershowitz. In 
fact, at the trial of this matter, such an allegation would likely be inadmissible on a number of evidentiary 
grounds. 
Farmer cites to Roe v. City of New York, 151 F.Supp.2d 495,510 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) which held "To prevail 
on a motion [to strike] [the movant] must demonstrate that ... the allegations have no bearing on the issues 
in the case ... " Dershowitz has satisfied this criteria. Serving no legitimate purpose, other than to defame 
Dershowitz, the Court should permit Dershowitz to move to strike the allegation from Farmer's complaint 
as it clearly is "redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous" material pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(:t). 
In the alternative, Dershowitz requests that the Court exercise its authority pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 
12(:t)(l) and strike the allegation sua sponte as the Honorable Kenneth A. Marra, United States District 
Court for the Southern District of Florida, did regarding allegations made against Dershowitz in Jane Doe 
and 2 v. United States of America, 08-CV-80736-KAM, (2015). 
Finally, Farmer claims that ifDershowitz seeks the imposition of sanctions against Farmer and BSF, and 
an award of attorney's fees and costs, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927 and/or F.R.C.P. Rule 11, it will cause 
undue delay. It should be noted, that a motion for sanctions pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 11 must be made 
separately from a F.R.C.P. Rule 12(:t) motion to strike, and therefore, one is not encumbered by the other. 
In any event, Farmer fails to articulate how such a motion would cause delay and prejll:dice as to her claims 
against the defendants. 
As cited in Dershowitz's initial letter, the Hon. Jose A. Cabranes stated: "Our legal process is already 
susceptible to abuse ... Shielded by the "litigation privilege, " bad actors can defame opponents in court 
pleadings or depositions without fear of lawsuit and liability." (Brown v Maxwell, 929 F3d 41, 47 [2d Cir 
2019]) Dershowitz is a victim of such abuse, and as such, he should be afforded the opportunity to seek 
relief by way of intervention.

ORDER 
Civ. 10474 (NRB) 
Non-party Alan Dershowitz ("Dershowitz") seeks permission to 
file a motion for limited intervention in order to move to strike 
the following allegation from plaintiff's complaint: 
"Among the 
guests that came to the mansion, Maria observed Alan Dershowitz, 
a lawyer, on a number of occasions, and observed that he would go 
upstairs at the same time the young girls were there." 
ECF No. 
<]I 39. 
In the alternative, Dershowitz requests that the Court 
strike the allegation sua sponte. 
Having considered the several letters on this issue, see ECF 
Nos. 9-11, the Court exercises its authority, pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12 ( f) ( 1) , to strike sua sponte the 
aforementioned language. 
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (f) (1) 
(" [O]n its 
own," a court may "strike from a pleading an insufficient defense 
or 
any 
redundant, 
immaterial, 
impertinent, 
or

matter."). 
The Court briefly addresses its reasons for doing so.

First, 
the allegation is neither material nor directly

Nor does Rule 
require plaintiff to plead credibility or to anticipate a

Re: 
Maria Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Executors of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:19-cv-10474 (NRB) 
Dear Judge Buchwald: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action.  We write 
pursuant to Your Honor’s Individual Rules 1(A) and 2(B) to request a pre-motion conference in 
connection with the Co-Executors’ anticipated motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to 
dismiss Plaintiff Maria Farmer’s (“Plaintiff”) Complaint (ECF No. 1) which is time-barred and 
impermissibly seeks punitive damages. 
1. Plaintiff is an Arkansas resident who alleges Decedent committed torts against 
her in Ohio in 1995 or 1996 when she was 26 years old. 
Plaintiff, who claims Arkansas citizenship and residency, alleges that Mr. Epstein (“Decedent”), 
now deceased, sexually assaulted her in 1995 or 1996 in Ohio.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 11, 35, 46, 48.)  
Plaintiff asserts two causes of action -- battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress -- 
and demands punitive damages. (Id. ¶¶ 59 – 68, p. 15.) 
2. Plaintiff’s causes of action are time-barred. 
CPLR § 202 provides that, when a non-New York resident such as Plaintiff sues on a cause of 
action accruing outside New York, the complaint must be filed timely under the statute of 
limitations of both New York and the jurisdiction where the cause of action accrued.1  A claim 
that is untimely under one or both of the two jurisdictions must be dismissed. 
The Complaint alleges torts that occurred between 1995 and 1996 in Ohio.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 11, 
35, 46, 48).  Under N.Y. law, causes of action sounding in battery must be commenced within 
one year of accrual (CPLR § 215(3)); or, if Plaintiff’s claims sound in personal injury, within three 
years (CPLR § 214(5)).  Thus, under N.Y. law, Plaintiff’s claims expired in 1999 at the latest.   
“In diversity cases in New York, federal courts apply … C.P.L.R. § 202.” Commerzbank AG v. Deutsche 
Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., 234 F. Supp. 3d 462, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (citation omitted).

Plaintiff’s claims are also time-barred under the laws of Ohio, where the statute of limitations for 
battery is one year (Ohio Rev Code Ann § 2305.111(B)) and four years for intentional infliction 
of emotional distress (Ohio Rev Code Ann § 2305.09; Riddick v Taylor, 105 N.E.3d 446, 451 
(Ohio Ct. App. 2018)).  Therefore, under Ohio law, Plaintiff’s claims expired in 2000 at the latest. 
3. Plaintiff’s attempts to plead around the statutes of limitations fail. 
Plaintiff erroneously alleges that her claims are timely pursuant to CPLR § 215(8)(a), her claims 
were equitably tolled, and that the Co-Executors are equitably estopped from asserting a statute 
of limitations defense. (Compl. ¶¶ 12-14.)  Each of these arguments fails as a matter of law. 
First, CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not apply here. CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides:  “Whenever it is 
shown that a criminal action against the same defendant has been commenced with respect to 
the event or occurrence from which a claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff shall 
have at least one year from the termination of the criminal action …  to commence the civil 
action” (emphasis added).  Decedent’s criminal indictment (the “Indictment”), which Plaintiff 
attaches to her Complaint, was not commenced with respect to Plaintiff.  Rather, the Indictment 
alleges that Decedent sexually abused “minor girls” (Compl., Ex. A at ¶ 1 (emphasis added)),  
stating throughout that it concerns sex trafficking of “minors” (Id., Ex. A at ¶¶2 - 4, 6, 8, 11- 15, 
- 20, 22) between 2002 and 2005 in New York and Florida (Id. , Ex. A at ¶¶2, 6, 7, 8, 20, 24).  
Because Plaintiff alleges she was 26 when Decedent assaulted her in Ohio in 1995 or 1996 (Id. 
¶¶ 1, 11, 35, 46, 48), this action and the Indictment arise from different events or occurrences. 
New York courts apply CPLR § 215(8)(a) narrowly.  See Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 
A.D.2d 595, 596 (2d Dept. 1999) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied only to claims based on events of 
February 26, 1993 and December 28, 1993, because it was only in connection with events of 
those two days that a criminal prosecution was commenced against defendant); Gallina v. 
Thatcher, No. 2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435 (Sup. Ct. Dutchess Cnty. Oct. 23, 
2018) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) inapplicable where incidents charged in criminal action and those 
alleged in civil action occurred on different dates); McElligott v. City of N.Y., 15-cv-7107 (LGS), 
2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201829, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2017) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) inapplicable 
to claims against civil defendants not charged as co-defendants in criminal action, 
notwithstanding same events gave rise to both actions).  Plaintiff’s connection to the Indictment 
is far more tenuous than the criminal-civil links unsuccessfully asserted in these cases. 
Moreover, even if CPLR 215(8)(a) applies to Plaintiff’s claims, which it does not, as discussed 
above, Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred under Ohio law, and thus under CPLR § 202. 
Second, Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances sufficient to 
justify tolling or equitable estoppel.  Equitable tolling is only applied where a plaintiff is 
“prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising h[er] rights.” Viti v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. 
of Am., 10-cv-2908 (ALC) (MHD), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189633, at *30 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 
2012), adopted by, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174145 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2013) (emphasis added) 
(citations omitted).  Under this doctrine, a court may, “under compelling circumstances, make 
narrow exceptions to the statute of limitations … ‘to prevent inequity.’” Id. (emphasis added) 
(citations omitted).  “That the doctrine is to be employed only sparingly -- in ‘extraordinary’ and 
‘compelling’ circumstances -- is reflected in the fact that the plaintiff bears the burden of 
persuasion to show that tolling is justified.” Id. (emphasis added) (citing Boos v. Runyon, 201 
F.3d 178, 185 (2d Cir. 2000)).  A late-filing party seeking equitable tolling must also demonstrate 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 13   Filed 01/24/20   Page 2 of 4

Page 3 
she acted with “reasonable diligence” in pursuing her claims during the period she seeks to toll.  
See id. at *32 (citation omitted).  Equitable estoppel only applies where a plaintiff knows her 
cause of action exists, but the defendant’s conduct causes her to delay bringing suit.  See Yesh 
Diamonds, Inc. v. Yashaya, No. 09-CV-2016 (DLI) (RER), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101744, at *5 
(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2010).  Equitable estoppel requires a plaintiff to show:  “(i) the defendant 
made a definite misrepresentation of fact, and had reason to believe that the plaintiff would rely 
on it; and (ii) the plaintiff reasonably relied on that misrepresentation to h[er] detriment.”  Id. 
(citation omitted).  Tolling is inappropriate where, as here, a plaintiff fails to articulate any acts 
by a defendant that prevented the plaintiff from timely commencing suit.  See id. at *6. 
Here, Plaintiff’s allegations regarding tolling and equitable estoppel allege no particularized acts 
or threats by Decedent in an effort to prevent Plaintiff from exercising her rights.  (Compl. ¶¶ 13-
14).  Nor has Plaintiff alleged (i) Decedent made a misrepresentation to her and had reason to 
believe she would rely on it, or (ii) Plaintiff reasonably relied on it to her detriment.   
Plaintiff’s own allegations refute any notion that she was prevented from exercising her rights.  
Rather, Plaintiff’s allegations establish she was both willing and able to come forward about the 
alleged wrongdoing almost immediately—she reported her alleged assault to three law 
enforcement agencies shortly after it occurred (Id. ¶¶ 49, 51) and disclosed it to Vanity Fair 
Magazine (Id. ¶¶ 53-54).  There is no “extraordinary” basis to toll the statute of limitations or 
estop the Co-Executors from asserting a statute of limitations defense given these allegations. 
4. Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law.  
Courts in this District regularly grant motions to dismiss claims for punitive damages.  See, e.g., 
SJB v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No.03 Civ. 6653, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13227, at *25-26 
(S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2004) (Buchwald, J.) (granting motion to dismiss punitive damages claims 
because punitive damages were not statutorily available).  Here, Plaintiff’s claim for punitive 
damages must be dismissed as a matter of law.    
The law in most U.S. jurisdictions, as reflected in the Restatement, is that “[p]unitive damages 
are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor.”  Restat. (Second) Of 
Torts § 908 cmt. a.  See also NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1)   (“For any injury, an action may be 
brought or continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but punitive damages 
shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought to recover damages for 
personal injury.” (emphasis added)). “[T]here is a strong policy against the assessment of 
punitive damages against an estate on account of wrongful conduct of the decedent.’”  Graham 
v. Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (quoting Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 
449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996)).   
Ohio law only permits punitive damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate “in cases in 
which liability has been determined while the tortfeasor is alive.”  Whetstone v. Binner, 57 
N.E.3d 1111, 1115 (Sup. Ct. Ohio 2016).  Plaintiff did not even file this action until after 
Decedent died.  Accordingly, the narrow holding in Whetstone is inapplicable.  
Because there are no facts that would render Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim proper, there is 
no reason to allow it to stand.

Southern District of New York  
500 Pearl Street 
New York, NY 10007 
Re:      Farmer v. Indyke et al., 
Case No. 19-cv-10474 
Dear Judge Buchwald, 
Pursuant to Individual Rule 2(B), Plaintiff Maria Farmer hereby responds to Defendants’ 
request for a pre-motion conference in connection with their anticipated motion to dismiss.  Dkt. 
13.  Plaintiff’s claims are timely under New York’s statutes of limitation and the doctrine of 
equitable estoppel, and Defendants’ proposed motion “to dismiss” Plaintiff’s request for punitive 
damages is procedurally improper.  For the following reasons, the Court should deny Defendants’ 
anticipated motion in its entirety. 
I. 
Plaintiff’s Claims Are Timely Under New York Law. 
Plaintiff’s claims are timely under New York’s CPLR § 215(8)(a), which provides: 
“Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same defendant has been commenced 
with respect to the event or occurrence from which a claim governed by this section arises, the 
plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of the criminal action . . . to commence 
the civil action.”  (Emphasis added).  Here, Epstein’s criminal action in this District terminated on 
August 29, 2019.  Compl. ¶ 34.  Because Plaintiff filed the Complaint less than three months later, 
the action is timely under CPLR § 215(8)(a).  Defendants’ arguments against CPLR § 215(8)(a)’s 
application to these facts are meritless.  
First, Defendants’ argument that CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not apply because Plaintiff was 
not named as a victim in Epstein’s indictment is incorrect.  New York courts have held that CPLR 
§ 215(8)(a) is “plain, clear and unambiguous” that it does not require that the plaintiff be “the 
victim or the specific person upon whom the crime had been committed.”  Clemens v. Nealon, 202 
A.D.2d 747, 749 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994).     
Second, Defendants’ narrow construction of § 215(8)(a)’s “event or occurrence” language 
is improper, especially in light of the breadth of Epstein’s indictment.  The charges were not limited 
to crimes committed against specific victims.  For example, the overt acts alleged for the sex 
trafficking conspiracy charge were enticing and recruiting multiple victims, “including minor 
victims identified herein.”  Compl., Ex. A (S.D.N.Y Indictment) ¶ 22(a) (emphasis added).  As 
another example, the Indictment’s sex trafficking count charged Epstein with the sex trafficking

of “numerous individuals . . . including but not limited to Minor Victim-1.”  Id. ¶ 24.  Nor did the 
Indictment describe the sex trafficking conspiracy as exclusively targeting minor victims—it 
explicitly acknowledged that some victims were not underage at the time of the sexual abuse.  Id. 
¶ 11 (“[Epstein] knew that many of his New York victims were underage.”).  The Indictment was 
targeted at Epstein’s sex-trafficking scheme as a whole, and that scheme is the event or occurrence 
from which Plaintiff’s civil claims arose.  See Kashef v. BNP Paribas S.A., 925 F.3d 53, 56–57, 
(2d Cir. 2019) (guilty plea conceding “knowledge of the atrocities being committed in Sudan” 
allowed victims of the atrocities in Sudan use 215(8)(a) because causes of action arose out of 
defendant’s general conspiracy with Sudan to violate U.S. sanctions put in place to stop atrocities).  
Because Plaintiff’s claims arise out of this common scheme, they fall within CPLR § 215(8)(a).    
The cases Defendants cite are inapposite because the criminal charges in those cases were 
much narrower than Epstein’s, and related to events that occurred on specified dates.  See 
Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 A.D.2d 595, 596 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999) (prosecution commenced 
only in connection with events on February 26, 1993 and December 28, 1993); Gallina v. Thatcher, 
No. 2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435, at *3 (Sup. Ct. Oct. 23, 2018) (indictment 
“charged [the defendant] for incidents occurring on three (3) specific dates”).  Epstein’s Indictment 
was much broader, covering sexual abuse that occurred “over the course of many years” “from at 
least in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005.”  S.D.N.Y. Indictment ¶¶ 1–
2, 8, 20, 24 (emphases added).  Plaintiff’s claims are therefore timely under CPLR § 215(8)(a) 
because the scheme the Indictment targeted is the event or occurrence from which Plaintiff’s civil 
claims arise. 
Defendants also assert that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely under New York’s borrowing 
statute, CPLR § 202.  This argument fails for two reasons.  First, CPLR § 202 only applies to non-
residents who are injured outside of New York, and the controlling date for determining a 
plaintiff’s residence is the date on which the cause of action accrued, not the date on which the 
action was commenced.  See, e.g., DeMartino v. Rivera, 148 A.D.2d 568, 570 (N.Y. App. Div. 
1989).  Under the borrowing statute, the phrases “resident” and “domicile” are not synonymous. 
“Rather, the determination of whether a plaintiff is a New York resident, for purposes of CPLR § 
202, turns on whether [she] has a significant connection with some locality in the State as the result 
of living there for some length of time during the course of a year.”  Antone v. Gen. Motors Corp., 
473 N.E.2d 742, 746 (N.Y. 1984).  The fact that Plaintiff currently lives in Arkansas is therefore 
irrelevant.  At the time of her sexual assault, Plaintiff was a resident of New York, and the 
Complaint sufficiently alleges that fact.  Plaintiff stayed in Ohio for a temporary artist in residence 
job at the time of her sexual assault, but worked in Epstein’s New York mansion immediately 
before going to Ohio, maintained her apartment in New York, and returned to New York 
immediately after the assault.  Compl. ¶¶ 39, 46, 50.  Because Plaintiff had a significant connection 
with New York at the time her cause of action accrued, she was a resident of New York, and CPLR 
§ 202 does not apply.   
Second, even if New York’s borrowing statute did apply and Plaintiff’s claims were 
otherwise untimely, they would still not be barred because CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides for civil 
actions to commence within “one year from the termination of the criminal action . . . 
notwithstanding that the time in which to commence such action has already expired.”

BSF 

II. 
Plaintiff Has Sufficiently Pled Facts Supporting Equitable Estoppel and Tolling. 
Even if Plaintiff’s claims were otherwise time-barred under New York’s statutes of 
limitation (they are not), they would still be timely under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  
Defendants assert that Plaintiff “fails to meet her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances 
sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel.”  Dkt. 13 at 2.  But the Complaint alleges in detail 
the methods of intimidation and control that Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators used to deter 
their victims from seeking justice.  Equitable estoppel applies “where it would be unjust to allow 
a defendant to assert a statute of limitations defense,” Zumpano v. Quinn, 849 N.E.2d 926, 929 
(N.Y. 2006), due to “deception, concealment, threats, or other misconduct,” Zoe G. v. Frederick 
F.G., 208 A.D.2d 675, 675 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994).  The Complaint alleges that Epstein and his 
co-conspirators manipulated their victims using “financial power, promises, and threats to ensure 
that the victim returned as directed and remained compliant with their demands”; threatened 
Plaintiff’s livelihood and threatened Plaintiff’s life when she attempted to go public about her 
abuse.  Compl. ¶¶ 25, 50, 54; id. at ¶ 55 (“I know you go to the West Side Highway all the time.  
While you’re out there, just be really careful because there are a lot of ways to die there.”).  The 
allegations concerning Epstein’s purposeful silencing of his victims (and Plaintiff specifically) 
easily provide the requisite “extraordinary circumstances” for equitable tolling. 
Because equitable estoppel and equitable tolling are fact-specific doctrines, Defendants’ 
attempt to resolve the issue at motion to dismiss is inappropriate, and any motion challenging 
whether or not those doctrines apply should be reserved until after the parties have conducted 
discovery.  See, e.g., Carelock v. United States, 2015 WL 5000816, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2015). 
III. 
The Court Should Address Punitive Damages After Discovery   
Federal Rule 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to file a motion to dismiss for “failure to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Defendants’ request for the Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s 
claim for punitive damages does not relate to either of Plaintiff’s clams (battery and intentional 
infliction of emotion distress) and does not relate to the sufficiency of the allegations in the 
Complaint.  The issue of what type of damages to which Plaintiff is entitled should therefore be 
dealt with at a later stage of this litigation.  See, e.g., Okyere v. Palisades Collection, LLC, 961 F. 
Supp. 2d 522, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying “motion to ‘dismiss’ plaintiff’s request for punitive 
damages as procedurally premature”).

UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE 
RD ER 
Civ. 10474 
Having reviewed the parties' pre-motion letters, see ECF Nos. 
13, 14, the Court has determined that the defendants may bring 
their motion without the necessity of a pre-motion conference. 
The 
Court notes that if , 
consistent with Rule 
11, 
the 
plaintiff can assert additional allegations to cure any alleged 
deficiencies raised by the defendants' letter, it would be in the 
best interest of both the parties and the Court for the plaintiff 
to assert them now, before briefing on the proposed motion. 
The 
plaintiff is thus granted leave to file an amended complaint within 
two (2) weeks of this Order. 
At that time, if no amended complaint 
has been filed, the parties should confer on a briefing schedule 
agreeable to both sides, in which no more than sixty (60) days 
elapse from the filing of the defendants' motion to the filing of 
the defendants' reply.

Dear Judge Buchwald, 
capacities as the executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, 
Civil Action No. 19-cv-10474 
We are counsel to non-party Alan Dershowitz (hereinafter "Prof. Dershowitz"). We respectfully 
submit this letter in regard to the Court's decision dated December 23, 2019 [ECF No. 12] in which the 
<;ourt exercised its authority pursuant to F.R.C.P. Rule 12(±)(1) to strike "redundant, immaterial, 
iinpertinent, and/or scandalous" content regarding Prof. Dershowitz sua sponte from the plaintiff Maria 
Farmer's complaint [ECF No. 1, ,r 39]. 
Although the Court's order provides the relief Prof. Dershowitz sought, plaintiff's complaint 
remains without amendment on the public docket with the stricken content intact. Dershowitz respectfully 
requests that the Court issue an order directing the plaintiff to file an amended complaint, with the stricken 
material contained in paragraph 39 omitted, lest this respected Court's order have no practical effect. 
CC: All Counsel of Record (via ECF)

defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. 
Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. 
In 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22-1   Filed 03/09/20   Page 3 of 15
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. 
EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
• age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Pa.lm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22-1   Filed 03/09/20   Page 4 of 15
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. 
EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. 
In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. 
Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22-1   Filed 03/09/20   Page 5 of 15
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." 
During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. 
Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasioni at the New York Residence. 
EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. 
In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22-1   Filed 03/09/20   Page 6 of 15
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. 
Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. 
When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. 
Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. 
In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. 
When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. 
In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22-1   Filed 03/09/20   Page 7 of 15
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruite~s to bring a specific minor girl fo~ EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. 
In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. 
EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. 
At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and' 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. 
Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. 
EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22-1   Filed 03/09/20   Page 8 of 15
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. 
In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. 
In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. 
At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. 
Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 

Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22-1   Filed 03/09/20   Page 9 of 15
19. 
Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence. 
STATUTORY ALLEGATIONS

Plaintiff, 
CASE NO:

v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN,  
in their capacities as the executors of the  
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN,

_____________________________________  
AMENDED COMPLAINT 
BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP  
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 1 of 17

Plaintiff Maria Farmer, by her attorneys Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, for her Complaint 
against Defendants, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn in their capacities as the executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein (“Epstein”), avers upon personal knowledge as to her own 
acts and status and upon information and belief and to all other matters as follows: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1. 
This suit arises out of Jeffery Epstein’s sexual assault of Plaintiff. 
2. 
Maria Farmer was sexually trafficked by Epstein and a co-conspirator as part of his 
organized ring of procuring young females for sex.  As an aspiring artist, Maria believed that 
Epstein’s connections to the art world would help further her career when he offered her a 
position to procure art for him.  Maria began working for Epstein in his Manhattan mansion, 
performing a variety of tasks including procuring art and manning the guest check in at the front 
door of the home.  Maria was employed by Epstein in the state of New York and permanently 
resided in New York at the time. During the course of her employment for Epstein, Epstein and 
Ghislaine Maxwell flew Maria to Ohio as part of her employment duties and violently sexually 
assaulted her while she was working on an art project at Epstein’s guest house on Leslie 
Wexner’s Ohio estate. Epstein and Maxwell then threatened to ruin her career and her life if she 
told anyone about the assault. 
3. 
Epstein’s trafficking scheme involved recruiting young females by making false promises 
and using his wealth, power and threats to intimidate the females into submission to his 
demands.  This same pattern was repeated numerous times with numerous young women. 
4. 
As United States District Judge Kenneth Marra found, “From between about 1999 and 
2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor girls . . . at his mansion in Palm Beach 
Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas. . . . In addition to his own sexual abuse 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 2 of 17

of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually.  Epstein used paid 
employees to find and bring minor girls to him.  Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain 
minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.”  
Doe 1 v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1204 (S.D. Fla. 2019) (internal citations omitted).   
5. 
Epstein organized this sex trafficking network to obtain hundreds of young females for 
himself for sex, and also lent these females out to other powerful and wealthy individuals to be 
sexually abused.  
6. 
Epstein conspired with others and hired staff to maintain and keep secret this network of 
sexual abuse for years, which sprawled throughout Epstein’s residences in New York, Florida, 
New Mexico, the United States Virgin Islands, and Paris.  Epstein’s preference was to have three 
different girls a day for his sexual pleasure. 
7. 
  Despite his significant criminal activity, in 2008 Epstein received a shockingly minimal 
charge pleading guilty to a single Florida state law charge of procuring a minor for prostitution 
and a non-prosecution agreement (a “NPA”) with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida.  Unknown to the public and the victims at the time, Epstein’s lawyers were pressuring 
the Government to commit to the NPA without informing the victims.  Epstein’s multiple 
victims were kept in the dark and told to be “patient” while Epstein’s lawyers worked to protect 
him and other potential co-conspirators from prosecution.  Epstein served one year in jail, but 
was afforded the privilege of being able to leave the jail to go to work for twelve hours per day, 
six days per week. 
8. 
The NPA allowed Epstein to escape proportionate punishment for his actions and to 
continue operating his sex trafficking enterprise with liberty.   
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 3 of 17

9. 
A few years later, Epstein flippantly referred to his sexual abuse of multiple minors, and 
the slap on the wrist he had received for it, in a 2011 interview with the New York Post: 
“Billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City – and making wisecracks about his 
just-ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl. ‘I am not a sexual predator, I’m an 
offender,’ the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a 
person who steals a bagel,’ said Epstein.”  Amber Sutherland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein:  I’m a 
Sex Offender Not a Predator, N.Y. Post (Feb. 25, 2011), 
https://nypost.com/2011/02/25/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-im-a-sex-offender-not-a-predator/. 
10. 
In August 2018, just one year before his death, Epstein told a New York Times reporter 
“that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it 
was perfectly acceptable.”  James B. Stewart, The Day Jeffrey Epstein Told Me He Had Dirt on 
Powerful People, N.Y. Times (Aug. 12, 2019), 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html. 
11. 
When Plaintiff was 26 years old, Epstein added her to his long list of victims by 
committing sexual assault and battery against her.  As such, Epstein is responsible for battery 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to New York common law.  The damage 
to Plaintiff has been severe and lasting. 
12. 
This action has been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of a criminal action against the 
same defendant to commence an action with respect to the event or occurrence from which the 
criminal action arose.  A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking 
enterprise from which Plaintiff’s claims arise was terminated on August 29, 2019. 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 4 of 17

13. 
Any statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiff’s claims, if any, is tolled due to the 
continuous and active deception, duress, threats of retaliation, threats of physical harm including 
death threats, and other forms of misconduct that Epstein and his co-conspirators used to silence 
his many victims, including Plaintiff.  Epstein’s actions deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity to 
commence this lawsuit before his death.  Until his death, Plaintiff feared that Epstein and his co-
conspirators would harm her or her family, or ruin her life, if she came forward. 
14. 
Defendants are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense.  
Allowing Defendants to do so would be unjust.  Epstein and his employees intimidated each of 
his victims into silence by threatening their lives and their livelihoods.  They therefore prevented 
Plaintiff from commencing this lawsuit before his death.  By using threats, along with his wealth 
and power, Epstein was able to escape punishment for his intolerable and brutal crimes against 
countless young women and underage girls for the duration of his life. 
PARTIES 
15. 
Plaintiff Maria Farmer is a citizen of Kentucky. At the time of her assault, Maria was 
employed by Epstein in New York and permanently resided in New York.  
16. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
17. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
18. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin Islands at 
the time of his death.  Jeffrey Epstein maintained a residence in the Southern District of New 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 5 of 17

York.  As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Darren K. Indyke and 
Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
19. 
The amount in controversy in this action exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.00 
excluding interests and costs and is between citizens of different states. Accordingly, jurisdiction 
is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  
20. 
Venue is proper in this Court as Epstein’s sexual abuse of Plaintiff began in New York, 
New York, where he recruited her to be a part of his organized sex trafficking ring.  Further, 
many of Epstein’s decisions and activities relating to Maria, including purchasing plane tickets, 
supervising her employment, and paying her, occurred in New York. 
21. 
Many of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the Southern District 
of New York, where a substantial amount of Epstein’s property is located.  The events giving 
rise to Plaintiff’s injuries occurred in New York, including her grooming, the planning of her 
sexual assault, threats against her, and harassing conduct.  Thus, venue in this district is proper.  
U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).

22. 
 Jeffrey Epstein was widely renowned as a billionaire who used his vast connections to 
powerful individuals, and seemingly unlimited wealth and resources, to create a web of 
transcontinental sex trafficking that served himself, his co-conspirators, and some of the most 
powerful people in the world. 
23. 
Epstein owned multiple residences and frequently travelled between them, including at 9 
East 71st Street, New York, New York 10021, and at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New 
Mexico 87056.  Epstein conservatively valued his New York townhome at $55,931,000.00.  
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 6 of 17

Epstein conservatively valued his New Mexico ranch at $17,246,208.00.  In addition, Epstein 
owned residences in the Virgin Islands, Florida, France, and even on his own island, Great St. 
James Island, where his transcontinental sex trafficking of hundreds of young girls servicing 
him, his co-conspirators, and wealthy and powerful individuals around the world also occurred. 
24. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein utilized his seemingly 
unlimited power, wealth, and resources, as well as his deep connections to powerful and 
politically connected individuals to intimidate and manipulate his victims of sexual abuse.  
25. 
Epstein and his co-conspirators had perfected a scheme for manipulation and abuse of 
young females.  As part of the scheme, a female “recruiter” would approach a young female and 
strike up a conversation in an effort to quickly learn about the young female’s background and 
any vulnerabilities they could expose.  The recruiter would then manipulate the young female 
into coming back to one of Epstein’s residences by offering the young female something she 
needed.  At times the recruiter’s lure would be a modeling opportunity, money for education, 
help for the young female’s family, and a whole host of other related offers depending on their 
target’s situation.  Once in the residence, the recruiter and Epstein would work in concert to 
impress and intimidate the young female with displays of vast wealth, including having 
employees that were butlers and maids formally dressed around the house.  They would also 
strategically place photographs of very powerful political and social figures amongst 
photographs and art displaying nude females in an effort to normalize the sexual abuse.  They 
would also normalize the sexual abuse by placing a massage table and spa related products 
around the massage area in an effort to legitimize the area where the abuse was set to occur.  
Once abused, Epstein and his co-conspirators continued to manipulate the victims, using their 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 7 of 17

financial power, promises, and threats to ensure that the victim returned as directed and remained 
compliant with their demands. 
B. 
The Arrest, Prosecution, and Death of Epstein 
26. 
The sexual trafficking ring described herein started at least as early as 1995 and 
continued up until at least July 2, 2019, when the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of New York (“SDNY”) charged Epstein with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. He was arrested on July 8, 2019, pursuant to the SDNY’s Sealed 
Two Count Indictment, which is attached as Exhibit A. 
27. 
The Indictment described Epstein’s conduct and his abuse and trafficking of females in 
the same trafficking operation he used to abuse and traffic Plaintiff. 
28. 
Epstein’s last will and testament (the “Will”) was executed on August 8, 2019, at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. The witnesses were Mariel Colón Miró and Gulnora Tali.  The 
Will included affidavits from Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in which they swear an 
“Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and Appointment of Local Counsel.” 
29. 
Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 
2019.  
30. 
Epstein’s last will and testament was filed on August 15, 2019, in the Probate Division of 
the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
31. 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court 
of the Virgin Islands for Epstein’s 1953 Trust on August 26, 2019.  See Certificate of Trust, In 
the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Aug. 26, 
2019). 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 8 of 17

32. 
Epstein’s will was entered into probate on September 6, 2019, and the Superior Court of 
the Virgin Islands accordingly authorized Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn to administer 
Epstein’s estate.  See Order for Probate, In the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate 
No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019); Letters Testamentary, In the Matter of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019). 
33. 
The Will’s first article directs Epstein’s executors “to pay from my estate all expenses of 
my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my estate and all 
of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate.”  The Will further directs that “after the 
payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST,” Epstein “give[s] all of my property, real 
and personal, wherever situated . . . to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust.” 
34. 
Following Epstein’s death, SDNY submitted a proposed nolle prosequi order in the 
criminal matter against him because it was required by law to do so after Epstein was deceased.  
On August 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman formally dismissed SDNY’s 
indictment against Epstein, terminating the criminal action against him.  Plaintiff’s claims are 
therefore timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
C. 
Maria Farmer 
35. 
Maria Farmer was born on November 28, 1969.  Her parents divorced when she was 
young, and her mother struggled to financially support Maria and her siblings.  In 1993, Maria 
moved to New York City to pursue art.  At the time of her assault, Maria was a permanent 
resident of New York City. 
36. 
In approximately 1995, Maria was an accomplished artist and graduate student at the 
New York Academy of Art.  She met Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite known 
for recruiting young girls for Epstein, at one of her art openings in New York.  Epstein noticed 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 9 of 17

Maria’s artwork and offered to help her art career if she sold a piece of artwork to him for half 
price.  Maria agreed and sold the painting to Epstein. 
37. 
Epstein asked Maria many personal questions, including if she had a father, and other 
questions about her life and family.  Maria told Epstein that her parents were divorced, and that 
she and her family were struggling financially. 
38. 
Epstein later offered Maria a job to purchase art for him in New York, and she accepted. 
39. 
Eventually, Epstein modified Maria’s job duties to focus on monitoring and keeping 
records of who entered Epstein’s New York mansion and a variety of other tasks for Epstein and 
Maxwell.  In her position at the front door, she observed that Maxwell was regularly bringing 
school-aged girls to the mansion and that the girls were always escorted upstairs.  
40. 
Maxwell described her role to Maria as recruiting models for Epstein, and told Maria that 
the girls were interviewing for modeling positions with Victoria’s Secret, a lingerie retailer.  
Maria witnessed Maxwell approaching young females on the street and talking to them outside 
of the mansion.  Maxwell would leave the mansion claiming she had “to go get girls for Jeffrey” 
and referred to the girls she was recruiting as “nubiles.” 
41. 
At the time, Maria was unaware of the sex trafficking conspiracy and believed the girls 
and young women were being recruited for modeling positions. 
42. 
Epstein also made very clear to Maria that he was incredibly wealthy, powerful, and 
regularly in contact with world leaders.  In fact, in his New York mansion, he had photographs 
displayed of significant political figures to ensure that any young female entering the home 
would know that he had extensive government connections.  Epstein was not to be disobeyed and 
he made clear by his words and actions that there would be consequences if Maria did not 
comply with his demands.   
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 10 of 17

43. 
Epstein and Maxwell asked Maria many questions about her family.  Maria often would 
use her family members as her subjects for her artwork so she had several photographs of her 
siblings, including her younger sister Annie.  Epstein and Maxwell started asking a number of 
questions about Annie, and Maria told them how smart Annie was and how she hoped to go to a 
great college.  After seeing photos of Annie, Epstein told Maria that he wanted to fly Annie to 
New York for a visit.  Maria thought Epstein was simply being generous since Maria had 
explained how much she missed seeing Annie.  What Maria did not realize was Epstein was 
intending to groom Annie for sexual abuse. 
44. 
Epstein paid for plane tickets to fly Annie to New York.  During the visit, Epstein took 
Annie and Maria to a movie.  During the movie, without Maria’s knowledge, Epstein groped 
Annie against her will.  Thereafter, Annie left New York to head home without telling Maria that 
Epstein groped her during the movie. 
45. 
After Annie’s visit to New York, Epstein began to call Annie and Maria’s mother to 
discuss Annie and to falsely claim that he was interested in helping Annie with her goal of going 
to a great college.  He eventually convinced Annie’s mother to allow Annie to fly to his ranch in 
New Mexico at the age of 16, where Maxwell and Epstein assaulted her.   
46. 
During the course of her employment with Epstein, and as part of the work she was 
performing for him, he directed Maria to travel to Ohio to use his 30,000 square foot guest house 
on billionaire Leslie Wexner’s Ohio estate so she could focus on creating paintings.  At the time, 
Wexner was the chief executive of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret.   
47. 
Maria worked on Wexner’s estate for two months over the summer of 1996.  While 
Maria worked in Ohio, she remained a New York resident.  She maintained her apartment in 
New York City while she was in Ohio.  Maria was also still employed by Epstein while she was 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 11 of 17

in Ohio, who continued to pay her salary from New York.  Maria intended to return to her home 
in New York permanently once she had completed her painting project in Ohio.  
48. 
While at Wexner’s estate, Wexner’s security staff discouraged Maria from going outside 
without getting permission from Wexner’s wife, Abigail Wexner.  Wexner’s security personnel 
guarded Epstein’s guest house at all times.  Wexner’s staff told Maria that armed guards, 
sharpshooters, and dobermans were guarding the estate, as well. 
49. 
During Maria’s time at Wexner’s estate, Epstein and Maxwell visited her.  On one 
occasion, Epstein requested a foot massage from Maria.  Maria found the request to be disturbing 
but complied because Epstein was her employer. 
50. 
After complying with his request for a massage, Epstein invited Maria to sit on the bed 
where he was watching television.  Maxwell bragged that Epstein was watching a show about 
math and that Epstein was very smart.  Maxwell then joined them on the bed.  Epstein and 
Maxwell proceeded to attack Maria physically against her will, including by violently sexually 
assaulting Maria. 
51. 
Maria fled from the room, barricaded herself in another room to prevent Maxwell and 
Epstein from further attacking her, and called the police twice.  The first time she called, the 
police hung up on her.  The second time she called, the police put her on hold and then told her 
that they worked for Wexner.  Maria did not know at the time that Wexner had contracted with 
the sheriff’s office to protect his property. 
52. 
Despite demanding to be allowed to leave the property, Wexner’s security personnel held 
Maria against her will for nearly 12 hours, even after she pleaded with them and told them about 
her assault.   
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 12 of 17

53. 
Epstein and Maxwell each called Maria, asking her not to report the sexual assault to 
anyone.  Soon after, one of Wexner’s security guards appeared at the house and told Maria that 
she would not be leaving the property. 
54. 
Eventually, Wexner’s staff let Maria leave with her father, who had driven from 
Kentucky to Ohio to get Maria away from Epstein and Maxwell.  Maria then returned to New 
York. 
55. 
After Maria returned to New York from Ohio, Maxwell called on behalf of Epstein and 
threatened Maria in order to keep her quiet: “We’re going to burn all your art.  And I just want 
you to know that anything you ever make will be burned.  Your career is burned.” 
56. 
Frightened by Maxwell’s and Epstein’s threat, Maria reported her assault in Ohio and the 
threat about Maria’s art to the Sixth Precinct of the New York City Police Department 
(“NYPD”).  The NYPD referred Maria to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”).  Maria 
followed the instruction and called the FBI to make a report of the abuse.  To the extreme 
detriment of Maria—and also countless other victims who came after her—authorities ignored 
Maria’s reporting efforts and took no action.  
57. 
Maria also called her younger sister, Annie, who was overseas studying at an educational 
seminar for high performing high school students.  During the call, Annie shared with Maria that 
she too had been assaulted by Epstein and Maxwell in New York and New Mexico.   
58. 
Frustrated that authorities did not appear to be taking any action and in the hopes of 
exposing the crimes that Epstein and Maxwell were committing, Maria and Annie decided to 
share their stories with Vanity Fair magazine. Tragically for Maria and Annie, Vanity Fair told 
Epstein about the interview and that Maria had reported Epstein and Maxwell to the FBI.  
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 13 of 17

Epstein threatened and intimidated the magazine, and Vanity Fair bent to those threats, 
ultimately publishing a profile of Epstein without mentioning the sisters or their allegations.  
59. 
Once Epstein and Maxwell learned that Maria had revealed their sexual abuse to Vanity 
Fair and the FBI, they embarked on a campaign to destroy Maria’s reputation and art career.  
They called Maria’s clients and other individuals in the art community in New York and were 
ultimately successful in shutting her out of all art-related opportunities. 
60. 
Maxwell also called Maria on Maxwell and Epstein’s behalf to threaten her life after 
Maxwell learned that Maria had attempted to speak out against them. She said, “I know you go 
to the West Side Highway all the time.  While you’re out there, just be really careful because 
there are a lot of ways to die there.”  Epstein was also seen stalking Maria in New York. 
61. 
Afraid for her safety, having informed the Ohio police, NYPD, FBI, and media to no 
avail, Maria moved several times to try to hide from Epstein and Maxwell.  Her fear of Epstein’s 
power was exacerbated by the fact that state and federal authorities, as well as the media, were 
not taking action against Epstein. 
62. 
But even after Maria left New York City, Epstein and Maxwell continued calling Maria 
to threaten her life.  Each time Maria moved, Epstein and Maxwell would somehow find out 
where Maria was living and threaten her, forcing Maria to move again.  This pattern continued 
for years.  Due to Epstein and Maxwell’s power and deep connections, when they threatened 
Maria, Maria believed them and relied on those threats in deciding to move and to not further 
discuss or report her assault. 
63. 
In 2006, the FBI contacted Maria about an investigation into new allegations about 
Epstein in Florida.  But the FBI never followed up with Maria and the investigation resulted in 
Epstein’s lawyers negotiating the 2008 NPA, which allowed Epstein to plead guilty to minor 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 14 of 17

state charges.  Maria was not told about the NPA before it was signed, nor were any of Epstein’s 
countless victims.  The failure of the Florida investigation was deeply demoralizing to Maria. 
64. 
Epstein’s and Maxwell’s threats against Maria’s life, paired with Epstein’s clear and 
overwhelming influence over the media and the law enforcement officials charged with 
protecting young women from sexual predators, caused Maria to believe that her life would be in 
tremendous danger if she attempted to file a civil  action. Accordingly, Maria did not file a civil 
lawsuit until after Epstein’s death. 
65. 
 Maria was deeply impacted by her harrowing time with Epstein.  She underwent breast 
reduction surgery because she was unable to forget Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual assault.  She 
also gave up art for many years after the assault. 
66. 
Maria suffers extreme emotional distress from an experience that has affected her for her 
entire life. 
67. 
Epstein’s sexual assault and battery of Maria continues to cause her significant distress 
and harm. 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Battery) 
68. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1–67 as if fully 
set forth herein.  
69. 
Epstein intentionally committed battery by sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was a 
young woman.  As described above, Epstein intentionally touched intimate parts of Plaintiff’s 
body in an offensive and sexual manner without her consent. 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 15 of 17

70. 
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from 
which Plaintiff’s first cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
71. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in 
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, 
loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION  
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress)  
72. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1–67 as if fully 
set forth herein.  
73. 
As a direct result of these allegations as stated, Epstein committed intentional infliction of 
emotional distress against Plaintiff.  
74. 
Epstein’s actions, described above, constitute extreme and outrageous conduct that 
shocks the conscience.  Epstein’s plan to recruit, entice, and assault Plaintiff goes beyond all 
possible bounds of decency and is intolerable in a civilized community. 
75. 
Epstein knew or disregarded the substantial likelihood that these actions would cause 
Plaintiff severe emotional distress.  
76. 
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from 
which Plaintiff’s second cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
77. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in 
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, 
loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 22   Filed 03/09/20   Page 16 of 17

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests judgment against Defendants, awarding 
compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at 
trial; costs of suit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just 
and proper. 
JURY DEMAND

Re: 
Maria Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Executors of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:19-cv-10474 (NRB) 
Dear Judge Buchwald: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. We write 
pursuant to Your Honor’s Individual Rule 2(B) to request a pre-motion conference in anticipation 
of moving to dismiss Plaintiff Maria Farmer’s (“Plaintiff”) Amended Complaint (ECF No. 22) 
because it is time-barred and impermissibly seeks punitive damages.    
As a matter of context, we previously requested a pre-motion conference in anticipation of 
moving to dismiss Plaintiff’s original Complaint, on the same grounds. Your Honor, after 
reviewing our request and Plaintiff’s response, determined that the Co-Executors could bring 
their motion “without the necessity of a pre-motion conference.” (Feb. 24, 2020 Order (ECF. No. 
16, p. 1).) Your Honor further Ordered:  “if, consistent with Rule 11, the plaintiff can assert 
additional allegations to cure any alleged deficiencies raised by the defendants' letter, it would 
be in the best interest of both the parties and the Court for the plaintiff to assert them now, 
before briefing on the proposed motion … if no amended complaint has been filed, the parties 
should confer on a briefing schedule.” (Id. (emphasis added).) Plaintiff’s amendments are 
sparse, vague and fail to cure any of her pleading deficiencies.   
First, Plaintiff’s causes of action are still time-barred. Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Epstein, now 
deceased, sexually assaulted her in 1996 in Ohio, when she was 26. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11, 47-
50.)  Plaintiff asserts two causes of action -- battery and intentional infliction of emotional 
distress -- and demands punitive damages. (Id. ¶¶ 68 – 77, p. 17.)  Plaintiff’s causes of action 
are time-barred under Ohio and New York law. 
Under New York law, causes of action sounding in battery must be commenced within one year 
of accrual (CPLR § 215(3)); or, if Plaintiff’s claims sound in personal injury, within three years 
(CPLR § 214(5)).  Thus, under New York law, Plaintiff’s claims expired in 1999 at the latest. 
Under Ohio law, the statute of limitations for battery is one year (Ohio Rev Code Ann § 
2305.111(B)); and for intentional infliction of emotional distress, four years (Ohio Rev Code Ann 
§ 2305.09; Riddick v Taylor, 105 N.E.3d 446, 451 (Ohio Ct. App. 2018)).  Therefore, under Ohio 
law, Plaintiff’s claims expired in 2000 at the latest.

Second, Plaintiff’s attempts to plead around the statutes of limitations still fail. Plaintiff 
still erroneously alleges that her claims are timely pursuant to CPLR § 215(8)(a), her claims 
were equitably tolled, and that the Co-Executors are equitably estopped from asserting a statute 
of limitations defense. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 12-14.)  Each of these arguments still fails.
CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not apply here. It provides:  “Whenever it is shown that a criminal action 
against the same defendant has been commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from 
which a claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff shall have at least one year from the 
termination of the criminal action … to commence the civil action.” Id. (emphasis added).  Mr. 
Epstein’s criminal indictment (the “Indictment”), which Plaintiff attaches to her Complaint, was 
not commenced with respect to Plaintiff.  Rather, the Indictment alleges that Decedent sexually 
abused “minor girls” (Am. Compl., Ex. A at ¶ 1 (emphasis added)),  stating throughout that it 
concerns sex trafficking of “minors” (Id., Ex. A ¶¶ 2 - 4, 6, 8, 11- 15, 18 - 20, 22) between 2002 
and 2005 in New York and Florida (Id. , Ex. A ¶¶ 2, 6, 7, 8, 20, 24).  Because Plaintiff alleges 
she was 26 when Decedent assaulted her in Ohio in 1996, this action and the Indictment arise 
from different events or occurrences. 
New York courts apply CPLR § 215(8)(a) narrowly. See Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 A.D.2d 
595, 596 (2d Dept. 1999) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied only to claims based on events of February 
26, 1993 and December 28, 1993, because it was only in connection with events of those two 
days that a criminal prosecution was commenced against defendant); Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 
2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435 (Sup. Ct. Dutchess Cnty. Oct. 23, 2018) (CPLR § 
215(8)(a) inapplicable where incidents charged in criminal action and those alleged in civil 
action occurred on different dates). Here, the connection to the Indictment is far more tenuous 
than the criminal-civil links deemed insufficient in those cases. 
Moreover, Plaintiff still fails to meet her burden on the pleadings to allege extraordinary 
circumstances sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel. Equitable tolling is only applied 
where a plaintiff is “prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising h[er] rights.” Viti v. 
Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 10-cv-2908 (ALC) (MHD), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189633, at *30 
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2012), adopted by, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174145 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2013) 
(emphasis added) (citations omitted).  “That the doctrine is to be employed only sparingly -- 
in ‘extraordinary’ and ‘compelling’ circumstances -- is reflected in the fact that the 
plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to show that tolling is justified.” Id. (emphasis 
added) (citation omitted).  A late-filing party seeking equitable tolling must also demonstrate she 
acted with “reasonable diligence” in pursuing her claims during the period she seeks to toll.  See 
id. at *32 (citation omitted).  Equitable estoppel only applies where a plaintiff knows her cause of 
action exists, but the defendant’s conduct causes her to delay bringing suit.  See Yesh 
Diamonds, Inc. v. Yashaya, No. 09-CV-2016 (DLI) (RER), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101744, at *5 
(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2010).  Equitable estoppel requires a plaintiff to show:  “(i) the defendant 
made a definite misrepresentation of fact, and had reason to believe that the plaintiff would rely 
on it; and (ii) the plaintiff reasonably relied on that misrepresentation to h[er] detriment.”  Id. 
(citation omitted).  Tolling is inappropriate where, as here, a plaintiff fails to articulate any acts 
by a defendant that prevented the plaintiff from timely commencing suit.  See id. at *6. 
Plaintiff still fails to adequately plead any particularized acts or threats by Mr. Epstein that 
prevented her from exercising her rights for the nearly 25 years since she was allegedly 
assaulted.  Nor has Plaintiff sufficiently alleged that: (i) Mr. Epstein made a misrepresentation to 
her and had reason to believe she would rely on it; or (ii) Plaintiff reasonably relied on it to her

detriment. Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint belies any notion by her counsel that she was 
prevented from exercising her rights until now. Rather, Plaintiff’s allegations firmly establish that 
she has been both willing and able to repeatedly assert her claims ever since she was allegedly 
assaulted nearly 25 years ago. Plaintiff alleges that: she “called the [Ohio] police twice” 
immediately after Mr. Epstein assaulted her (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51, 61); she later reported the 
alleged assault to the Sixth Precinct of the NYPD (id. ¶ 56); the Sixth Precinct referred her to the 
FBI (id.); she reported the alleged assault to the FBI (id.); she later reported the alleged assault 
to Vanity Fair (id. ¶ 58); and, now, she has clarified through her amendments that she went a 
step further, by speaking to the FBI years later, in 2006 (id. ¶ 63).  Given these allegations, any 
suggestion by Plaintiff that she could not have brought this action until 2018 is just not credible.  
Plaintiff’s few new allegations made in a transparent attempt to gin up “extraordinary” bases for 
avoiding the statute of limitations are highly suspect in light of her omission of them from her 
original pleading.  Moreover, they fail to overcome the fact that, per her own allegations, Plaintiff 
has been able to assert her rights ever since she was allegedly assaulted decades ago.  Plaintiff 
now claims that Mr. Epstein and another person threatened her and that Mr. Epstein was “seen 
stalking [her] in New York” (Am. Compl. ¶ 70, 72).  However, Plaintiff does not allege she was 
the one who witnessed the “stalking” or even when she learned of it. Nor does Plaintiff allege 
when or when the threats occurred. Accordingly, these vague allegations do not refute the 
years-long periods where she was, per her own allegations, repeatedly able to assert her rights. 
Still missing from Plaintiff’s Complaint is any credible allegation establishing that she was 
somehow prevented from bringing this action for nearly 25 years. She was not.  
Plaintiff previously asserted that whether she can invoke equitable tolling or estoppel is 
necessarily a fact issue which the Court should not decide on the pleadings.  This is wrong. 
Where, as here, a plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege “extraordinary circumstances” to invoke 
these doctrines, dismissal based on the statute of limitations is warranted. See Fairley v. 
Collins, 09-Civ-6894 (PGG), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26536, at *16 (Mar. 15, 2011 S.D.N.Y.) 
(Gardephe, J.) (finding equitable tolling did not apply and granting defendants’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6) motion to dismiss complaint on statute of limitations grounds); Abercrombie v. College, 
438 F. Supp. 2d 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“without adequate pleading, the issue is not properly 
raised and therefore cannot defeat a motion to dismiss based on statute of limitations grounds”).    
Third, Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages still fails as a matter of law.  Courts in this 
District regularly grant motions to dismiss or strike claims for punitive damages.  See, e.g., SJB 
v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No.03 Civ. 6653, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13227, at *25-26 (S.D.N.Y. 
July 14, 2004) (Buchwald, J.) (granting motion to dismiss punitive damages claims because 
punitive damages were not statutorily available).  Here, Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages 
must be dismissed as a matter of law because the law in most U.S. jurisdictions, as reflected in 
the Restatement, is that “[p]unitive damages are not awarded against the representatives of a 
deceased tortfeasor.”  Restat. (Second) Of Torts § 908 cmt. a.  See also NY EPTL § 11-3.2 
(a)(1) (“For any injury, an action may be brought or continued against the personal 
representative of the decedent, but punitive damages shall not be awarded nor penalties 
adjudged in any such action brought to recover damages for personal injury.” Ohio law only 
permits punitive damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate “in cases in which liability has 
been determined while the tortfeasor is alive.”  Whetstone v. Binner, 57 N.E.3d 1111, 1115 
(Sup. Ct. Ohio 2016). Plaintiff did not even file this action until after Mr. Epstein died.  
Accordingly, there is no reason to permit Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim, which she is using 
as misplaced settlement leverage, to stand.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES 
The Co-Executors, to the extent required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c), assert the following 
affirmative defenses.  By pleading these defenses, the Co-Executors do not assume the burden of 
proving any fact, issue, or element of a cause of action where such burden belongs to Plaintiff. 
Moreover, nothing stated herein is intended to or shall be construed as a concession that any 
particular issue or subject matter is relevant to Plaintiff’s allegations. 
1.
Plaintiff’s Complaint fails, in whole or in part, to state a claim upon which relief 
can be granted. 
2.
Plaintiff’s claims are barred to the extent Plaintiff has not suffered any damages; 
alternatively, Plaintiff’s claims are barred to the extent Plaintiff has not been damaged to the extent 
alleged, and failed to mitigate any damages she may have suffered. 
3.
Contributory Negligence. If Plaintiff suffered or sustained any loss, injury, damage 
or detriment, and the same was directly and proximately caused and contributed to by the conduct, 
acts, omissions, activities, carelessness, negligence, and/or intentional misconduct of Plaintiff, 
Plaintiff’s recovery herein is partially or completely barred. 
4.
Assumption of Risk.  Plaintiff’s claims are barred to the extent that, at the time and 
place of the incidents alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint, Plaintiff knew of and fully understood the 
danger and risks incident to their undertaking; but despite such knowledge, Plaintiff freely and 
voluntarily assumed and exposed herself to all risks of harm and the consequential injuries and 
resultant damages, if any.  
5.
Comparative Fault of Third Parties.  If and to the extent that the Co-Executors are 
subjected to any liability to Plaintiff due, in whole or in part, to the acts, omissions, activities, 
carelessness, recklessness, negligence, and intentional misconduct of persons or entities other than 
Case 1:19-cv-10474-NRB   Document 26   Filed 03/27/20   Page 15 of 17

- 16 - 
41907217v2
Decedent, any recovery obtained by Plaintiff against the Co-Executors should be reduced in 
proportion to the respective negligence and fault and legal responsibility of all such other persons 
and entities, and their agents, servants and employees who contributed to or caused any such injury 
or damages, in accordance with the law of comparative negligence; the liability of the Co-
Executors, if any, is limited in direct proportion to the percentage of fault actually attributed to 
Decedent. 
6.
Statute of Limitations. The Complaint, and each and every cause of action 
contained therein, is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, including without limitation 
because: (i) the New York Child Victims’ Act, including without limitation CPLR 214-g, violates 
the New York Constitution and the U.S. Constitution; (ii) CPLR § 215(8)(a) is inapplicable to this 
action; (iii) the doctrines of equitable tolling and estoppel are unavailable to Plaintiff and otherwise 
inapplicable to this action; and (iv) Decedent’s alleged conduct did not constitute an offense under 
New York Penal Law § 130, including without limitation because such alleged conduct occurred 
outside of New York.   
7.
Intervening/Superseding Causes. To the extent the injuries and damages which 
Plaintiff alleges were proximately caused by, or contributed to by, the acts of persons or entities 
other than Decedent, and said acts were intervening or superseding causes of the injuries and 
damages, if any, which Plaintiff alleges, Plaintiff is barred from any recovery against the Co-
Executors.  
8.
Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the doctrines of waiver, estoppel and laches. 
9.
To the extent Plaintiff seeks damages that are punitive in nature, they are barred 
including without limitation pursuant to N.Y. E.P.T.L. § 11-3.2.

41907217v2
10.
Plaintiff’s claims are barred to the extent she is simultaneously prosecuting her 
claims in the Southern District of New York and the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands Division 
of St. Thomas and St. John. 
The Co-Executors have not knowingly or intentionally waived any applicable affirmative 
defenses and reserve the right to assert and rely upon such affirmative defenses as may become 
available or apparent during discovery. The Co-Executors further reserve the right to amend their 
Answer accordingly.
