OVERVIEW 
OR\G\NAL 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
19CRW 490 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor 
rls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. 
Moreover, and in order to mainta 
and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of 
s victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. 
In 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 2     Filed 07/02/19     Page 2 of 14
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims 
r 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims 
scribed herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to explo 
ation. 
EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor vict 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims 
multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
. 
During all t 
periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
fendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 2     Filed 07/02/19     Page 3 of 14
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. 
EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. 
In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. 
Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 2     Filed 07/02/19     Page 4 of 14
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the nmassage." 
During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. 
Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasions at the New York Residence. 
EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. 
In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 2     Filed 07/02/19     Page 5 of 14
employees and associates, including a New York-based empl 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence 
r 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. 
Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "mass 
s" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. 
When a victim would recruit another gi 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both 
victim-recruiter and 
new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. 
Through these vict 
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
e to abuse 
13. 
In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to 
New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. 
When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. 
In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 2     Filed 07/02/19     Page 6 of 14
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruiters to bring a specific minor girl for EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. 
In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. 
EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. 
At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. 
Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. 
EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 2     Filed 07/02/19     Page 7 of 14
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. 
In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. 
In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. 
At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. 
Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 2     Filed 07/02/19     Page 8 of 14
19. 
Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE #1 AND JANE DOE #2, 
Petitioners, 
vs. 
UNITED STATES,  
Respondent. 
_______________________________/ 
UNITED STATES’ SEALED MOTION TO DISMISS 
FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION 
The United States hereby requests that this Court enter an order dismissing these 
proceedings and the Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 
3771 (DE 1, the “Petition”), through which Petitioners Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 have 
advanced claims pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction.1  This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Petition because 
See, e.g., Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. 567, 571 (2004) 
(“Challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction can of course be raised at any time prior to final 
judgment.”); United States v. Giraldo-Prado, 150 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir. 1998) (recognizing 
that “a party may raise jurisdiction at any time during the pendency of the proceedings”); Harrell 
& Sumner Contracting Co. v. Peabody Petersen Co., 546 F.2d 1227, 1229 (5th Cir. 1977) 
(“[U]nder Rule 12(h)(3), Fed.R.Civ.P., the defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be 
raised at any time by motion of a party or otherwise.”); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).  In the 
present motion, the United States seeks dismissal of Petitioners’ claims based on both a legal and 
factual challenge to the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction.  This Court may properly consider 
and weigh evidence beyond Petitioners’ allegations when evaluating such a challenge to the 
Court’s subject matter jurisdiction: 
Factual attacks [on a Court’s subject matter jurisdiction] . . . “challenge subject 
matter jurisdiction in fact, irrespective of the pleadings.”  In resolving a factual 
attack, the district court “may consider extrinsic evidence such as testimony and 
affidavits.”  Since such a motion implicates the fundamental question of a trial 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 205-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/05/2013   Page 2 of 20
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6-2     Filed 07/11/19     Page 2 of 15

Petitioners lack Article III standing and because the claims raised by Petitioners in these 
proceedings are not constitutionally ripe. 
I. 
The Claims Raised in the Petition Must Be Dismissed for Lack of Subject 
Matter Jurisdiction Because the Petitioners Lack Standing to Bring Those Claims. 
These proceedings pursuant to the CVRA must be dismissed for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction because Petitioners lack standing to pursue the remedies that they are seeking for 
alleged CVRA violations.  As the Supreme Court has explained, 
to satisfy Article III’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has 
suffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or 
imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the 
challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely 
speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. 
Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 
(2000); see also, e.g., Young Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, 529 F.3d 1027, 1038 (11th Cir. 
2008) (quoting Harris v. Evans, 20 F.3d 1118, 1121 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc)).  Moreover, “a 
plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.”  Friends of the 
Earth, 528 U.S. at 185. 
Here, the record incontrovertibly demonstrates that Petitioners cannot satisfy the third 
prong of the standing test, and the Petition and these proceedings must accordingly be dismissed 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.2  E.g., Florida Wildlife Federation, Inc. v. South Florida 
court’s jurisdiction, a “trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as 
to the existence of its power to hear the case” without presuming the truthfulness 
of the plaintiff’s allegations. 
Makro Capital of America, Inc. v. UBS AG, 543 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations 
omitted); see also, e.g., McMaster v. United States, 177 F.3d 936, 940 (11th Cir. 1999) (“[W]e 
determine whether this lawsuit survives the government’s factual attack [on subject matter 
jurisdiction] by looking to matters outside the pleadings, and we do not accord any presumptive 
truthfulness to the allegations in the complaint.”); Scarfo v. Ginsberg, 175 F.3d 957, 960-61 
(11th Cir. 1999). 
Although Petitioners also fail to satisfy the first and second prongs of the standing test,

Water Management Dist., 647 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011) (“If at any point in the litigation 
the plaintiff ceases to meet all three requirements for constitutional standing, the case no longer 
presents a live case or controversy, and the federal court must dismiss the case for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction.”); Phoenix of Broward, Inc. v. McDonald’s Corp., 489 F.3d 1156, 1161 (11th 
Cir. 2007) (“[T]he issue of constitutional standing is jurisdictional . . . .”); National Parks 
Conservation Ass’n v. Norton, 324 F.3d 1229, 1242 (11th Cir. 2003) (“[B]ecause the 
constitutional standing doctrine stems directly from Article III’s ‘case or controversy’ 
requirement, this issue implicates our subject matter jurisdiction, and accordingly must be 
addressed as a threshold matter regardless of whether it is raised by the parties.”) (citation 
omitted). 
In these proceedings, the only identified legal relief that Petitioners have sought pursuant 
to the CVRA is the setting aside of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that was entered into 
between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida 
(“USAO-SDFL”).  See, e.g., DE 99 at 6 (recognizing that the relief Petitioners seek “is to 
invalidate the non-prosecution agreement”).  But even assuming arguendo that Petitioners’ rights 
under the CVRA were violated when Epstein and the USAO-SDFL entered into the Non-
Prosecution Agreement, constitutional due process guarantees do not allow either the Non-
Prosecution Agreement – which by its terms induced Epstein to, inter alia, plead guilty to state 
criminal charges and serve an 18-month sentence of state incarceration3 – or the governmental 
this Court need not reach or address those issues because an analysis of the third prong of the 
standing test incontrovertibly establishes the Petitioners’ lack of standing.  Nonetheless, the 
circumstances which demonstrate Petitioners’ lack of a concrete injury traceable to government 
conduct are explored infra in Section II of this memorandum, which addresses how Petitioners’ 
claims and these proceedings lack constitutional ripeness. 
See also July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 20-21 (Petitioners’ acknowledgement that Epstein’s 
reliance on promises in Non-Prosecution Agreement led to his guilty plea to state charges and his

obligations undertaken therein to be set aside.4  See, e.g., Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 
262 (1971) (“[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the 
prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise 
must be fulfilled.”); United States v. Harvey, 869 F.2d 1439, 1443 (11th Cir. 1989) (“Due 
process requires the government to adhere to the terms of any plea bargain or immunity 
agreement it makes.”).  Indeed, even if this Court were somehow to set aside the Non-
Prosecution Agreement on the authority of the CVRA, and even if after consultation with 
Petitioners the United States determined that it would be proper and desirable to institute a 
criminal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida against Epstein on the criminal charges 
contemplated in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the United States would still be 
constitutionally required to adhere to the negotiated terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.  
See, e.g., Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262; Harvey, 869 F.2d at 1443. 
Due process considerations further bar this Court from setting aside a non-prosecution 
agreement that grants contractual rights to a contracting party (Epstein) who has not been made a 
party to the proceedings before the Court.  See, e.g., School Dist. of City of Pontiac v. Secretary 
of U.S. Dept. of Educ., 584 F.3d 253, 303 (6th Cir. 2009) (“It is hornbook law that all parties to a 
contract are necessary in an action challenging its validity . . . .”); Dawavendewa v. Salt River 
Project Agr. Imp. & Power Dist., 276 F.3d 1150, 1157 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[A] party to a contract is 
necessary, and if not susceptible to joinder, indispensable to litigation seeking to decimate that 
subsequent 18-month state incarceration). 
To the extent that the Petitioners’ requested invalidation of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement would implicitly reject and nullify the correctness of both the state court’s acceptance 
of Epstein’s guilty plea and the resulting judgment of conviction –which were induced in part by 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement – such judicial action might raise additional questions about this 
Court’s jurisdiction under the Rooker/Feldman doctrine.  See, e.g., Casale v. Tillman, 558 F.3d 
1258, 1260-61 (11th Cir. 2009); Powell v. Powell, 80 F.3d 464, 466-68 (11th Cir. 1996).

contract.”); Lomayaktewa v. Hathaway, 520 F.2d 1324, 1325 (9th Cir. 1975) (“No procedural 
principle is more deeply imbedded in the common law than that, in an action to set aside a lease 
or a contract, all parties who may be affected by the determination of the action are 
indispensable.”); see also National Licorice Co. v. NLRB, 309 U.S. 350, 362 (1940) (“It is 
elementary that it is not within the power of any tribunal to make a binding adjudication of the 
rights in personam of parties not brought before it by due process of law.”).5 
Additionally, a “favorable ruling” from this Court will not provide Petitioners with 
anything for the alleged CVRA violations that is not already available to them.  For the due 
process reasons already discussed above, the United States must legally abide by the terms of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement even if this Court should somehow set the agreement aside for 
Petitioners to consult further with the government attorney handling the case.  Moreover, as will 
be explained in greater detail below, see infra at 8-12, Petitioners already have the present ability 
to confer with an attorney for the government about a federal criminal case against Epstein – 
whether or not the Non-Prosecution Agreement is set aside – because the investigation and 
potential federal prosecution of Epstein for crimes committed against the Petitioners and others 
remains a legally viable possibility.6 
The present proceedings under the CVRA must accordingly be dismissed for lack of 
standing because Petitioners simply have no injury that is likely to be redressed by a favorable 
ruling in these proceedings.  See, e.g., Scott v. Taylor, 470 F.3d 1014, 1018 (11th Cir. 2006) 
(holding that there was no standing where it was speculative that remedy that Plaintiff sought 
Significantly, it is Epstein’s contractual rights under the non-prosecution agreement that 
Petitioners seek to void through these proceedings. 
Petitioners’ present, as well as past, ability to confer with an attorney for the government 
also demonstrates that Petitioners fail to satisfy the first two prongs of the standing test: 
Petitioners have simply not suffered a concrete injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged 
government conduct.

would redress claimed injury). 
II. 
The Claims Raised in the Petition Are Not Constitutionally Ripe, and These 
Proceedings Must Thus Be Dismissed for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction. 
This Court must also dismiss these proceedings for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
because the Petitioners’ claims are not constitutionally ripe. 
Ripeness, like standing, “originate[s] from the Constitution’s Article III requirement that 
the jurisdiction of the federal courts be limited to actual cases and controversies.”  Elend v. 
Basham, 471 F.3d 1199, 1204-05 (11th Cir. 2006).   “‘The ripeness doctrine keeps federal courts 
from deciding cases prematurely,’ Beaulieu v. City of Alabaster, 454 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir. 
2006), and ‘protects [them] from engaging in speculation or wasting their resources through the 
review of potential or abstract disputes,’ Digital Props., Inc. v. City of Plantation, 121 F.3d 586, 
589 (11th Cir.1997).”  United States v. Rivera, 613 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir. 2010); see also 
Pittman v. Cole, 267 F.3d 1269, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001) (“‘The ripeness doctrine prevent[s] the 
courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract 
disagreements . . . .’”) (quoting Coalition for the Abolition of Marijuana Prohibition v. City of 
Atlanta, 219 F.3d 1301, 1315 (11th Cir. 2000) (citations and quotations omitted))).  Under the 
ripeness doctrine, a court must therefore determine “‘whether there is sufficient injury to meet 
Article III’s requirement of a case or controversy and, if so, whether the claim is sufficiently 
mature, and the issues sufficiently defined and concrete, to permit effective decisionmaking by 
the court.’”  In re Jacks, 642 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cheffer v. Reno, 55 F.3d 
1517, 1524 (11th Cir. 1995)). 
When evaluating whether a claim is ripe, a court considers: “‘(1) the fitness of the issues 
for judicial decision, and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’” Id. 
(quoting Cheffer, 55 F.3d at 1524 (citing Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)));

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6-2     Filed 07/11/19     Page 7 of 15

see also, e.g., Association For Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. v. Conger, 899 F.2d 
1164, 1165 (11th Cir. 1990).  Under the doctrine, “[a] claim is not ripe when it is based on 
speculative possibilities,” In re Jacks, 642 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir. 2011), such as if the claim 
“‘rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur 
at all,’” Atlanta Gas Light Co. v. FERC, 140 F.3d 1392, 1404 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Texas v. 
United States, 523U.S. 296, 300 (1998)).  Indeed, “[t]he ripeness doctrine is designed to prevent 
federal courts from engaging in such speculation and prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily 
reaching constitutional issues.”  Pittman, 267 F.3d at 1280. 
In these proceedings, the Petitioners have sought to set aside the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement between Epstein and the USAO-SDFL so that Petitioners can “confer with the 
attorney for the Government” about the possible filing of federal criminal charges against 
Epstein and the potential disposition of any such charges.  See, e.g., July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 6-7 
(seeking an “[o]rder that the [non-prosecution] agreement that was negotiated is invalid” so that 
Petitioners can exercise the right to confer with the government); id. at 19-20, 24; 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3771(a)(5); see also DE 1 at 2 ¶ 5 (claiming that Petitioner was “denied her rights” under the 
CVRA because she “received no consultation with the attorney for the government regarding the 
possible disposition of the charges”). 
Notwithstanding the Non-Prosecution Agreement, Petitioners are and have been free to 
confer with attorneys for the government about the investigation and potential prosecution of 
Epstein.  At least one attorney for the government (Assistant United States Attorney Villafaña 
from the USAO-SDFL) had spoken to Petitioners about the offenses committed against them by 
Epstein prior to the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, see, e.g., July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. 
at 22 (acknowledging that prosecutors spoke to Petitioners “about what happened” to them); DE 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 205-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/05/2013   Page 8 of 20
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6-2     Filed 07/11/19     Page 8 of 15

at 6 ¶ 8; see also DE 99 at 3, and government attorneys have on multiple occasions offered to 
confer with Petitioners, see, e.g., July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 13 (“I will always confer, sit down 
with Jane Doe 1 and 2, with the two agents and Ms. Villafana.  We’ll be happy to sit down with 
them.”).  Indeed, on December 10, 2010, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, accompanied by supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL, personally 
conferred with Petitioners’ counsel and with Petitioner Jane Doe #1 and entertained discussion 
about Petitioners’ desires to see Epstein criminally prosecuted on federal charges.7  The United 
States Attorney and prosecutors in the USAO-SDFL have also corresponded with Petitioners’ 
counsel on multiple occasions about Petitioners’ desires to have Epstein criminally prosecuted on 
federal charges.8 
Additionally,
a number of districts outside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern 
District of New York and the District of New Jersey) share jurisdiction and venue with the 
Southern District of Florida over potential federal criminal charges based on the alleged sexual 
acts committed by Epstein against the Petitioners.  Epstein is thus subject to potential 
prosecution for such acts in those districts.  Furthermore, because of the nature of the allegations 
against Epstein, the filing of such potential charges against Epstein still remains temporally 
viable; charges for such sexual activities involving minors are not barred by the applicable 
The United States Attorney also offered to confer with Jane Doe #2, but Jane Doe #2 
declined the invitation and did not attend the meeting that was scheduled with the United States 
Attorney. 
Since that time, the USAO-SDFL has been recused by the Department of Justice from 
prospective responsibility for any criminal investigation or potential prosecution relating to 
Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with minor females.  The Department of Justice has reassigned 
responsibility for the investigation and potential prosecution of such criminal matters in the 
Southern District of Florida to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of 
Florida for consideration of any prosecutorial action that may be authorized and appropriate.

statutes of limitations.  See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3283, 3299.  Petitioners are free to contact the United 
States Attorney’s Office in those districts and seek to confer with government attorneys in those 
offices about investigating and potentially prosecuting Epstein based on the alleged federal 
crimes committed against them.9 
Petitioners nonetheless have appeared to contend throughout these proceedings that the 
many opportunities that they have been given to consult with the attorneys for the government 
about Epstein’s offenses and the potential charges against Epstein – opportunities which continue 
to be available to Petitioners – are not meaningful under the CVRA due to the existence of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement.  According to Petitioners, the Non-Prosecution Agreement has 
given Epstein a “free pass” on federal criminal charges for the offenses he committed against 
Petitioners and others.  See, e.g., DE 9 at 15 (characterizing Non-Prosecution Agreement as “a 
‘free pass’ from the federal government”), 2 (contending that the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
“allowed [Epstein] . . . to escape all federal prosecution for dozens of serious federal sex offenses 
against minors”), 7 (“the wealthy defendant has escaped all federal punishment”), 12 (“[T]he 
agreement prevents federal prosecution of the defendant for numerous sex offenses.”); DE 77 at 
(describing Non-Prosecution Agreement as “an agreement that blocked federal prosecution of 
Epstein for the multitude of sex offenses he committed again [sic] the victims”), 17 (“The [Non-
The USAO-SDFL has no present knowledge about whether the United States Attorney’s 
Offices in those districts have opened any investigations into the allegations that have been made 
against Epstein, whether those offices are even aware of those allegations or the evidence 
supporting them, or what investigative or prosecutorial actions, if any, those offices might take in 
the future.  Nonetheless, should any investigation be underway or should any investigation be 
initiated involving such allegations, the evidence gathered
in the Southern 
District of Florida could be disclosed to federal prosecutors and federal grand juries in New York 
or New Jersey.  See 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 205-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/05/2013   Page 10 of

Prosecution Agreement] barred prosecution of the federal sexual offenses that Epstein had 
committed against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 . . . .”).10  That is simply not so. 
Contrary to Petitioners’ contentions, there has been no disposition by the government of 
any federal criminal charges against Epstein.  No federal charges involving Petitioners have ever 
been brought against Epstein, and no such federal charges have been resolved.  The Non-
Prosecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of no federal criminal 
charges against Epstein, and that agreement does not bar the United States from bringing federal 
criminal charges against Epstein.  Instead, when addressing potential federal criminal charges 
against Epstein, the USAO-SDFL merely agreed in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that: 
on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be deferred 
in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the 
following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth below. 
and that 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no 
prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement, nor any 
other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses 
that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this 
District, and the charges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed. 
Non-Prosecution Agreement at 2 (emphasis added). 
Thus, the Non-Prosecution Agreement simply obligated the government not to prosecute 
Epstein in the Southern District of Florida for the offenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution 
This Court has also previously described the Non-Prosecution Agreement as “an 
agreement under which . . . the U.S. Attorney’s Office would agree not to prosecute Epstein for 
federal offenses.”  DE 99 at 2-3.  That description of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, however, 
was not based on the Court’s interpretation of the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, but 
was instead based on “allegations” by Petitioners that the Court concluded were “not yet 
supported by evidence” but upon which the Court nonetheless relied “solely to provide the 
context for the threshold issues addressed in” its September 26, 2011 Order.  Id. at 2 n.2. 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 205-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/05/2013   Page 11 of

Agreement.  The Non-Prosecution Agreement does not bar the United States from bringing 
federal criminal charges against Epstein for the offenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement in any other district in the nation.11  See, e.g., United States v. Cain, 587 F.2d 678, 
680 (5th Cir. 1979) (“Where . . . the prosecutor is not found to have made promises relating to 
nonprosecution of charges in another district and the [defendant] is not found to have relied on 
such alleged promises, this Court will affirm the trial court’s denial of a motion to dismiss the 
subsequent prosecutions.”).  Neither does the Non-Prosecution Agreement bar prosecution in any 
district for offenses not identified in the agreement. 
Petitioners contend that the CVRA gives a victim the right to confer with the attorney for 
the government before there is a disposition of contemplated, but-not-yet-filed federal criminal 
charges arising from offenses against the victim.  But, although the government disputes that the 
CVRA creates such a right,12 the Petitioners have never been denied any such right.  The 
Petitioners have had and still have the ability confer to with the attorney for the government 
about potential federal criminal charges against Epstein and about the potential disposition of 
any such charges, should they be filed.  In fact, Petitioners are free to approach the United States 
Attorney’s Offices in districts such as the Southern District of New York and the District of New 
Jersey – whose authority to institute criminal charges against Epstein in their districts has not 
Significantly, under the governing provision of the United States Attorney’s Manual, the 
USAO-SDFL did not have the authority to unilaterally bar Epstein’s prosecution in any other 
district in the country: 
No district or division shall make any agreement, including any agreement not to 
prosecute, which purports to bind any other district(s) or division without the 
express written approval of the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district 
and/or the Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division. 
USAM 9-27.641 (Multi-District (Global) Agreement Requests). 
The government acknowledges that this Court has nonetheless ruled that “as a matter of 
law the CVRA can apply before formal charges are filed,” DE 99 at 10; see also id. at 6-9, but 
has not yet determined “whether the particular rights asserted here attached,” id. at 10. 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 205-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/05/2013   Page 12 of

been curtailed by the Non-Prosecution Agreement – to discuss the possibility of pursuing federal 
criminal charges against Epstein.13  Nothing precludes Petitioners from doing so, and there is 
nothing to indicate that Petitioners’ wishes to confer with government attorneys in those districts 
would be rebuffed in any way.  Indeed, it would be rank speculation by Petitioners to contend 
otherwise. 
Here, Petitioners have acknowledged that the best relief they can hope to obtain through 
these proceedings is the ability to confer with the attorneys for the government.  See, e.g., July 
11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 7 (agreeing that “the best [Petitioners] can get” is the “right to confer”).  
Yet, under the circumstances, a claim that Petitioners have been denied the opportunity to confer 
with the attorney for the government about the filing and disposition of criminal charges against 
Epstein is premature and constitutionally unripe.  “This is plainly the type of hypothetical case 
that [a court] should avoid deciding.”  Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. 
v. Conger, 899 F.2d 1164, 1166 (11th Cir. 1990).  Any speculation by Petitioners that they might 
prospectively be denied the opportunity to confer with the government about still-legally-viable 
federal charges against Epstein simply cannot ripen Petitioners’ claims.  See id. (recognizing that 
courts “do not generally decide cases based on a party’s predicted conduct”). 
For these reasons, Petitioners’ claims in these proceedings should be dismissed for lack 
of subject matter jurisdiction.  See, e.g., In re Jacks, 642 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir. 2011) 
(holding that claims that are “based on events that may take place in the future” are to be 
“dismissed for lack of jurisdiction”) (citing Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, 881 F.2d 1570, 
1574 n.7 (11th Cir. 1989) (“[R]ipeness goes to whether the district court had subject matter 
Petitioners could also approach the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle 
District of Florida, but, due to that office’s recusal-based derivative prosecutorial responsibilities 
in the Southern District of Florida, see supra note 8, the Non-Prosecution Agreement would 
constrain the possible filing of federal charges by that office in the Southern District of Florida.

The Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
(212) 805-6715 
500 Pearl Street 
New York, NY 10007 
RE: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, Criminal No. 19-490 
Dear Judge Berman: 
We write to outline the grounds entitling Jeffrey Epstein to pretrial release, proposing a 
stringent set of conditions that will effectively guarantee his appearance and abate any 
conceivable danger he’s claimed to present. 
In essence, the government seeks to remand a self-made New York native and lifelong 
American resident based on dated allegations for which he was already convicted and punished – 
conduct the relitigation of which is barred by a prior federal nonprosecution agreement (the 
“NPA”). The government makes this drastic demand even though Mr. Epstein has never once 
attempted to flee the United States – despite a Florida federal judge’s stated belief that he could 
void the NPA in appropriate circumstances, possibly threatening new charges there, and 
notwithstanding legally erroneous government assertions in ancillary litigation that Mr. Epstein 
was subject to potential prosecution in other federal judicial districts, including this one 
specifically. Indeed, Mr. Epstein feared the toxic political climate might tempt the government to 
try and end-run the NPA – yet continually returned home from travel abroad, fully prepared to 
vindicate his rights under the agreement and otherwise mount a full-throated defense.  Finally, 
the government takes its extreme position in the teeth of Mr. Epstein’s perfect compliance with 
onerous sex offender registration requirements – pinpointing his exact nightly whereabouts – 
across multiple jurisdictions over a 10-year period.

Nonetheless, it is fundamental that pretrial detention is reserved for “a small but 
identifiable group of particularly dangerous defendants as to whom neither the imposition of 
stri[ct] release conditions nor the prospect of revocation of release can reasonably assure the 
safety of the community or other persons.” S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (1984), reprinted in 1984 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3189. And that’s true no matter how much rhetoric and hyperbole the 
government and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside, 
compelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations 
of conduct from 14 to 17 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act, 
U.S.C. § 3141 et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges 
who travel and own property abroad.   
The government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case.  Yes, the government 
may have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages – most over 18; some 
under; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s 
residence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet 18.1  But their 
anticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred 
within a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible 
despite the NPA, then within two residences.)  There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr. 
Epstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved 
anybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that 18 
U.S.C. § 1591 aims to eradicate.  No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct, 
but it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses – 
and at or outside the margins of federal criminal law. 
Mr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred 
in Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins – his father was a New York City 
municipal employee in the Parks Department – and earned every penny he’s made with nothing 
more than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knows no other languages. He 
owns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he 
maintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too. 
Until his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the 
2007 NPA (Exhibit 1) and a 2008 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct 
substantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment.  As a result of the state 
guilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 30-month sentence, 18 months of incarceration, and 12 
months’ probation under conditions including home confinement.  Mr. Epstein served 13 months 
in custody, 12 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was 
required to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered 
New York’s age of consent was 17 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.  
See N.Y. Penal Law § 130.05. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 2 of 16

in the U.S. Virgin Islands, his principal residence, Florida, and New York. Mr. Epstein has 
scrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register 
throughout the 10-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been 
meticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise 
location every single day for the past 10 years. Better still, the pending charges date back 14-17 
years, from 2002 to 2005. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the 
NPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2005-2019). 
Together, these unique factors are powerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to 
anyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.  
In sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the 
government in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional, 
and principled manner.  He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to 
contest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA 
which promised him immunity and a global settlement for offenses including those brought 
under 18 U.S.C. § 1591.  Any perception that Mr. Epstein poses any conceivable danger or flight 
risk may be readily dispelled by a slate of highly restrictive conditions, which amply suffice to 
secure his release: 
1. Home detention in Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan residence, with permission to leave only for 
medical appointments as approved by Pretrial Services, including (at the Court’s 
discretion) the installation of surveillance cameras at the front and rear entrances to 
ensure compliance. 
2. Electronic monitoring with a Global Positioning System.2 
3. An agreement not to seek or obtain any new passport during the pendency of this matter.3 
“A radio frequency (‘RF’) bracelet is the more conventional ‘ankle bracelet’ that has been used 
over time. GPS monitoring is a more recent phenomenon that is distinct from RF monitoring.  
While both units are placed on the ankle, the former tracks an offender’s movements in real time, 
while the latter is contingent upon proximity to a base unit connected to a landline at an 
offender’s home. Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at 
preventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. Supp. 3d 600, 617 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) 
(citations omitted). 
Mr. Epstein has only one active passport permitting current travel – not three, as the 
government fancies. That one active U.S. passport has now been surrendered. Mr. Epstein has no 
foreign passports. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 3 of 16

4. Consent to U.S. extradition from any country and waiver of all rights against such 
extradition.4 
5. A substantial personal recognizance bond in an amount set by the Court after reviewing 
additional information regarding Mr. Epstein’s finances, which Mr. Epstein will seek the 
Court’s permission to provide via sealed supplemental disclosure. 
6. The bond shall be secured by a mortgage on the Manhattan residence, valued at roughly 
$77 million. Mr. Epstein’s private jet can be pledged as further collateral. 
7. Mr. Epstein’s brother Mark will serve as a co-surety of the bond, which shall be further 
secured by a mortgage on Mark’s home in West Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Epstein’s 
friend David Mitchell will also serve as a co-surety and pledge his investment interests in 
two properties to secure the bond. 
8. Mr. Epstein shall deregister or otherwise ground his private jet.5 
9. He shall demobilize, ground, and/or deregister all vehicles or any other means of 
transportation in the New York area, providing particularized information as to each 
vehicle’s location. 
10. Mr. Epstein will provide Pretrial Services and/or the government random access to his 
residence. 
11. No person shall enter the residence, other than Mr. Epstein and his attorneys, without 
prior approval from Pretrial Services and/or the Court. 
12. Mr. Epstein will report daily by telephone to Pretrial Services (or on any other schedule 
the Court deems appropriate). 
13. A Trustee or Trustees will be appointed to live in Mr. Epstein’s residence and report any 
violation to Pretrial Services and/or the Court. 
14. Any other condition the Court deems necessary to reasonably assure Mr. Epstein’s 
appearance. 
I. 
Applicable law 
Echoing and reinforcing the presumption of innocence, our justice system’s bedrock, 
there is a “strong presumption against [pretrial] detention.” United States v. Hanson, 613 F. 
Supp. 2d 85, 87 (D.D.C. 2009). A person facing trial generally must be released so long as some 
“condition, or combination of conditions . . . [can] reasonably assure the appearance of the 
person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c). 
“Only in rare circumstances should release be denied.” United States v. Motamedi, 767 F.2d 
1403, 1405 (9th Cir. 1985). Any doubts as to the propriety of release are resolved in the 
defendant’s favor. See United States v. Chen, 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1207 (N.D. Cal. 1992).  
Mr. Epstein’s lone foreign residence is in Paris; France has an extradition treaty with the United 
States.  
Mr. Epstein owns one private jet.  He sold the other jet in June 2019. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 4 of 16

Though the Bail Reform Act contains a rebuttable presumption in favor of detention 
based on the crimes charged, the presumption shifts only the burden of production, not 
persuasion. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 (2d Cir. 1986). Accordingly, the 
statutory demand on defendants “is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-11-70756, 
2011 WL 3421321, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2011). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need 
only “show that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their 
individual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular 
case . . . ’” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 702, 707 (7th Cir. 1986) (quoting United States 
v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir.1985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the 
presumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. 16-CR-00019, 2018 WL 447331, at *2 
(M.D. Pa. Jan. 17, 2018) (citation omitted). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes 
within a category listed in § 3142(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including 
evidence of their marital, family and employment status, ties to and role in the community, clean 
criminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3142(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d 
at 707 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).   
In short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the 
presumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See 
Conway, 2011 WL 3421321, at *5 (§ 1591 defendant released pending trial). While not 
disappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining 
whether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See 
Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144; see also United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887, 891 (8th Cir. 1985) 
(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the 
government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the 
defendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight 
“risk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted).   
II. 
Mr. Epstein’s 14-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in 
favor of pretrial detention 
In this case, any danger presumption attending the § 1591 charges evaporates against Mr. 
Epstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2005 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous 
registration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege 
that Mr. Epstein committed any crime in the 14-year interval between the end of the alleged 
conduct and the initiation of this case.  The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is 
predictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless 14-
year record of walking the straight and narrow, complemented by an exemplary 10-year history 
of diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the 
prior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag 
between the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 5 of 16

future danger when viewed in the context of the unparalleled global media attention the case has 
garnered, including the creation of a website by the government requesting witnesses claiming 
abuse to come forward.  Accordingly, any danger that Mr. Epstein may have once posed to the 
community has long since abated.  At the very least, this enormous gap in time precludes a 
finding by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the 
community’s safety.6 
The rebuttable presumption of a risk of flight is negated by the evidence that the 
government had stated it believed it could prosecute Mr. Epstein for the very same conduct for 
which he was immunized, albeit in a second jurisdiction, despite the protections conferred upon 
him under the NPA.  Mr. Epstein’s continuous presence in the United States even while he had a 
residence out of the country reinforces the point.  As detailed below, Mr. Epstein understood the 
NPA as a global resolution of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here, 
including conduct in New York.  Indeed, the government, in a Southern District of Florida filing 
The government vastly overreaches in painting Mr. Epstein as dangerous based on musty plea 
discussions.  The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive 
behavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr. 
Epstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Attorney while they searched for a federal offense, 
at the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-
take of those of plea negotiations.  The communication from prior counsel about a potential 
proffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to 
charge such an offense.  These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately 
manifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein – nor in any agreement that probable cause 
existed to support any obstruction or assault charge.  And the documents from the Southern 
District of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this 
point expressly acknowledge this lack of substantiation.  See Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. 
United States, 08-CV-80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 361-10 (prosecutor stating, “[o]n the obstruction 
charges, many of the facts that I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our 
discussions and the agents’ observations of [redacted].  We will need to interview her to confirm 
the accuracy of those facts. . . .”), Dkt. 361-11 (prosecutor stating, “I know that someone 
mentioned there being activity on an airplane, I just wanted to make sure that there is factual 
basis for the plea that the agents can confirm”), Dkt. 361-9 (prosecutor stating, “I don’t know the 
factual basis for the alleged [redacted] because we have no independent evidence of that”).   In 
short, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not 
believe there was factual support for the allegations.  They do not provide a sufficiently reliable 
factual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence.  As to the suggestion by the 
prosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an 
investigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knowledge 
as to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not attributable to or 
authorized by Mr. Epstein. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 6 of 16

that was unsealed and became public in July 2013, specifically noted that “a number of districts 
outside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern District of New York and the District 
of New Jersey) share jurisdiction and venue with the Southern District of Florida over potential 
federal criminal charges based on the alleged sexual acts committed by Epstein against the 
Petitioners.  Epstein is thus subject to potential prosecution for such acts in those districts.”  
Exhibit 2, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, 08-CV-80736 (S.D. Fla. July 5, 2013), 
Dkt. 205-2, at 9.  The government went so far as to invite the alleged victims “to contact the 
United States Attorney’s Office in those districts and seek to confer with government attorneys 
in those offices about investigating and potentially prosecuting Epstein based on the alleged 
federal crimes committed against them.”  Id. at 10.  The Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office even 
offered to share the evidence gathered in its investigation with prosecutors and grand juries in the 
other relevant jurisdictions.  See id. at 10 n.9.  
 The defense strongly disagrees with the premise that the government can offer and 
execute an immunity or nonprosecution agreement with a citizen in the location of one of two 
venues where an interstate telephone call (or flight or any form of wire or mail communication) 
occurs and then circumvent the consequences of that immunity grant by having the very same 
prosecution office promote and motivate a prosecution by another office at the second venue of 
what in fact was a single criminal transaction.  What is significant for bail purposes is that 
notwithstanding this notice of the government’s illegal position, and his knowledge of the 
substantial penalties that he would face if charged and convicted, Mr. Epstein made no attempt to 
flee in the approximately six years preceding his arrest.  During that time, as noted by the 
government, he engaged in substantial international travel, always returning to his residences in 
the United States.  Mr. Epstein never sought to obtain dual citizenship or took any other steps 
indicative of an intent to flee.  This fact significantly undermines the government’s contentions 
regarding risk of flight and indicates Mr. Epstein’s good-faith intent to contest the charges 
pending against him. 
On September 24, 2007, after a year-long investigation, the Department of Justice, 
through the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”), entered 
into the NPA with Mr. Epstein.  The NPA immunized Mr. Epstein from five distinct potential 
federal charges that “may have been committed by Epstein . . . from in or around 2001 through 
in or around September 2007.”  Exhibit 1, NPA, at 1-2.  One of the federal charges was 18 
U.S.C. § 1591, the statute charged in this SDNY case.  The time period covered by the NPA 
subsumes the entire time period charged in this SDNY case.  The USAO-SDFL acknowledged in 
the NPA that the very premise for Mr. Epstein to enter into it was “to resolve globally his state 
and federal criminal liability . . . ”  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  Senior officials at the Department 
of Justice reviewed the NPA and either authorized or helped negotiate the resolution of the 
matter.  See, e.g., United States’ Second Supplemental Privilege Log filed as Dkt. 329-1 in Jane 
Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, No. 08-CV-80736 (S.D. Fla.) (the “CVRA litigation”) 
(illustrating the number of prosecutors involved in the decision-making over the NPA). 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 7 of 16

The NPA required Mr. Epstein to plead guilty to a state felony charge (Fla. Stat. 
§ 796.07), then pending in the State of Florida and to an additional state felony charge (not 
previously charged or required by the State) of violating Fla. Stat. § 796.03 (Case No. 2008-CF-
9381AXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender.  Mr. Epstein complied with all of 
his obligations under the NPA. 
Contrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several 
dozen victims identified in the prior investigation . . . .”  Gov’t Bail Letter at 6-7.  Indeed, the 
NPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein 
from prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly 
committed between 2001-07, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury 
investigation.”  NPA at 2 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the 
NPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other 
Office or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case.  This is especially so 
because Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the 
conspiracy count (Count 1, ¶¶ 14-19, ¶ 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the 
substantive charge (Count 2, ¶ 23).  
Beyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about 
the Department of Justice’s conduct in this case.  Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the 
pending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully 
complied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged 
alleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s 
commitment to a “global” resolution.  See Exhibit 2, at 8-12.  The United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL, 
corresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and 
their lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein 
prosecuted on federal charges.  See id. at 9.  Further, the Southern District of New York is likely 
relying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail 
Letter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . . 
. , and call records”).  In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly 
independent of the prior immunized conduct.  The evidence will show that Mr. Epstein’s 
reasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal 
criminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in 
the NPA – which he fully performed – has been unconstitutionally undermined by the 
government’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one 
that neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in 
the CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably 
intertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving 
submissions on remedy. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 8 of 16

  Finally, the government fails to consider the doctrine of pre-indictment delay, inasmuch 
as the statute of limitations does not fully define a defendant’s rights with respect to delays that 
occurred prior to the indictment.  See generally United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307 (1971).  
Here, the delays of 14 years from the last alleged act and 12 years since Mr. Epstein signed the 
NPA are extraordinary.  If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did, 
preclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it 
purposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex 
offender 10 years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement.  There is no legitimate 
explanation for the delay. 
III. 
The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of 
conditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety 
An analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release.  Even 
should the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant 
presents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his 
appearance as required.  Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory 
standard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear.  The 
conditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s 
passport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial 
personal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to 
guarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety 
minimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further.  The location where he could be detained – 
his residence on East 71st Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back) 
that can be easily monitored by video.  With all of his financial resources in the United States 
(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s 
forfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for – 
including any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance – if he were to flee 
and to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or 
for a bail violation. 
To the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous 
moral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and 
his close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr. 
Epstein’s appearance in Court as required.  Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge 
his family home, that he shares half the year with his 14-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son, 
in order to secure the bond.  It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living 
immediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his 
appearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has 
dominated the news cycle since his arrest. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 9 of 16

To reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “least restrictive” 
conditions that will assure both appearance and public safety.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B) 
(emphasis added).  Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards – a lesser 
restriction than pretrial detention – has proven effective in meeting those goals in many 
prominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as 
Bernie Madoff, Marc Dreier and David Brooks. 
To be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required 
without resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it. 
See United States v. Zarrab, No. 15-CR-867, 2016 WL 3681423 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2016). Still, 
Mr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it 
necessary or appropriate. 
More precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to 
custody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail 
pending trial. Id. at *2, *9-10, *13 (citation omitted).  Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our 
area have endorsed the procedure,7 and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.8 
For reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will 
virtually guarantee – not just reasonably assure – Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of 
this case.  Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we 
respectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the 
reservations expressed in Zarrab.  Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely 
held, raise substantial equal protection concerns.  They impair the statutory right to release on the 
least restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented – an inherently individualized 
determination – based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification. 
Avoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions – 
doing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike – are imperatives that run both ways. Id. (bolding 
deleted) (citation, footnote and internal quotation marks omitted).     
See, e.g., United States v. Esposito, 354 F. Supp. 3d 354 (S.D.N.Y. 2019); United States v. 
Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); United States v. Seng, No. 15-CR-706, 2017 WL 
2693625 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2015); United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009); United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); United States v. Schlegel, 
No. 06-CR-550, 2008 WL 11338900, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. June 13, 2008), modification denied, 2008 
WL 11339654 (E.D.N.Y. July 2, 2008). 
See United States v. Esposito, 749 F. App’x 20 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 
F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2007).  
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 10 of 16

Other than his 2008 guilty plea predicated on conduct substantially overlapping the same 
conduct charged here, Mr. Epstein has no criminal history. Congress specifically listed these 
factors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr. 
Epstein’s pretrial release.  Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background.  All 
of his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States. 
Through his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein 
employs people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally 
responsible for their livelihoods.  Mr. Epstein is admittedly wealthy with all of his financial 
resources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands) 
and will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed 
supplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a 
sealed supplement.  Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure 
on advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to 
the Court.  During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida 
guilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal 
misconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy.  At the 
Court’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations. 
Crucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever 
indicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal matter, which several 
courts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate.  See 
Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d at 90 (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence 
indicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d 
327 (D.C. Cir.1986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 715 F. 
Supp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.1988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested).  In 
fact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other 
legal requirements.  As a result of his 2008 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender 
designation, Mr. Epstein is required to (1) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify 
his address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his 
registry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel 
(both domestic and international) in which he engages.  Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with 
these requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years. 
The Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration 
classification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act.  And while it is true that the New 
York Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex 
offender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a 
Florida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2005 that were neither admitted-to 
nor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea.  See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 570, 571 
(N.Y. App. Div. 2011).  While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent attempt to challenge the 
continuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 11 of 16

significantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory 
classification.  Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various 
monitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any 
danger that he might otherwise pose.  It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a 
tier-one sex offender, the lowest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he 
maintains his primary residence.  The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin 
Islands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he 
was convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a 
danger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not. 
Mr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s 
congressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can 
assure the appearance of the defendant as required.9  Indeed, numerous courts have rejected 
government requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the 
charged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with 
substantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the following decisions: 
 United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2007) (reversing district court order of 
detention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite 
defendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of 
guilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted, 
despite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that 
defendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and 
professional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding 
that defendants “could, with relatively little disruption, continue to operate their highly 
lucrative business from any number of overseas locations”); 
 United States v. Hansen, 108 F. App’x 331 (6th Cir. 2004) (affirming district court order 
of pretrial release of defendant, a resident and citizen of Denmark-from where defendant 
could not be extradited-charged with bulk cash smuggling and forfeiture, noting that the 
This Court’s opinion in Zarrab stands only for the proposition that wealthy defendants should 
not be provided an unfair advantage.  It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants 
should bear a special disadvantage.  The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention 
in Zarrab are easily distinguishable.  The present case does not have national security 
implications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship), 
the only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition 
treaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States 
(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful 
information to Pretrial Services. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 12 of 16

“bail statute does not . . . require that foreign defendants be detained simply because their 
return cannot be guaranteed through extradition”); 
 United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.D.C. 2004) (ordering release of 
defendant, an Israeli national who had resided in South Africa for the 18 years preceding 
his arrest when he landed in Colorado for a family ski trip based on allegations he 
violated the Export Administration Act and the International Economic Emergency 
Powers Act by acquiring products capable of triggering nuclear weapons and exported 
them to Pakistan, despite defendant’s lack of any ties to the United States, despite finding 
that defendant had “no ties to the United States or the Washington, D.C. area,” despite 
finding that “no evidence [was] presented establishing that Defendant has ever lived in 
this country, owned property here, or that he has any family or community ties in the 
United States,” despite finding that defendant “was only in this country in order to 
participate in a ski vacation with his wife and daughter,” and despite finding that “the 
weight of the evidence against Defendant is substantial”); 
 United States v. Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C. 2009) (ordering release of 
defendant, a naturalized citizen of the United States, despite finding defendant “has 
strong ties to [her home country of] China,” finding that the defendant owned property in 
China, that the defendant spent almost all of her ten years of marriage living abroad with 
her husband, that during 2008 the defendant spent only 22 days in the United States, that 
the charges against the defendant (violations of International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act and the Export Administration Regulations) “were serious and carried a 
potential for a significant period of incarceration” and that the “government has strong 
evidence against” the defendant “including her own statement to investigators that she 
smuggled the UAV autopilot components out of the United States and knew there were 
licensing requirements for such items”). 
The fact that the government will potentially seek a significant sentence if Mr. Epstein is 
convicted on all counts similarly does not preclude pretrial release in this case – several courts 
have ordered pretrial release despite finding that the defendant faced serious charges carrying 
significant potential sentences. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (reversing district court order of 
detention despite finding that defendants, natives of Indonesia, faced “lengthy term of 
incarceration” and “strong” evidence of guilt existed); Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (ordering 
release of defendant, an Israeli national who had resided in South Africa for the 18 years 
preceding his arrest, despite finding that “the weight of the evidence against Defendant is 
substantial”); Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (noting that charges “were serious and carried a 
potential for a significant period of incarceration” and that the “government has strong evidence 
against” the defendant “including her own statement to investigators that she smuggled the UAV 
autopilot components out of the United States and knew there were licensing requirements for 
such items”).  As the government concedes, the increases in sentencing exposure enacted after 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 13 of 16

the alleged conduct at issue here do not apply retroactively to Mr. Epstein’s case (including a 
maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years). Mr. 
Epstein would, moreover, be subject to prosecution if he fled, which he now knows carries a 
maximum penalty of up to 10 additional years of imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(l)(A)(l), 
and/or the real risk of an enhanced sentence by the Court in this matter if not acquitted. 
It must further be emphasized that the allegations outlined within the indictment are just 
that – allegations – and the defendant anticipates substantial factual and legal challenges to the 
government case.  For one thing, Epstein has potent legal defenses to prosecution under 18 
U.S.C. § 1591, the sex trafficking statute driving the pending indictment. We front and briefly 
outline one of those defenses for the limited purpose of seeking bail. We will amplify it later, 
along with various other arguments, in full-blown dismissal motions. 
Section 1591 was passed as part of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 
(“TVPA”), Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464 (October 28, 2000).  In enacting the TVPA, 
Congress recognized that human trafficking, particularly of women and children in the sex 
industry, “is a modern form of slavery, and it is the largest manifestation of slavery today.” 22 
U.S.C. § 7101(b)(1); see also id. at § 7101(b)(2), (4).  “The TVPA criminalizes and attempts to 
prevent slavery, involuntary servitude, and human trafficking for commercial gain.”  United 
States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2007).  Importantly, “the entire language and 
design of the statute as a whole indicates that it is meant to punish those who are the providers or 
pimps of children, not the purchasers or the johns.”  Fierro v. Taylor, No. 11-CV8573, 2012 WL 
13042630, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2012) (quoting United States v. Bonestroo, No. 11-CR-40016, 
2012 WL 13704, at *4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2012)) (emphasis added).  In Fierro, the district court 
found § 1591 inapplicable to consumers or purchasers of sex acts.  Here, the principal conduct 
underlying the indictment is Mr. Epstein’s payment of money for massages that purportedly 
escalated to alleged sex acts.  Mr. Epstein’s conduct, however, is akin to consumer or purchaser 
behavior and should be outside the ambit of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.  See Fierro, 2012 WL 13042630, 
at *4 (“[T]he TVPA is inapplicable to individual purchasers of sex from trafficking 
victims…”).10 
While Fiero represents the law in this district, Mr. Epstein notes that there is a division of 
authority on the scope of § 1591.  See United States v. Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066, 1068 (8th Cir. 
2013).  The defense respectfully submits that the Fiero court’s approach to this issue is more 
persuasive and more consistent with the Congressional purpose to target commercial sex 
trafficking. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 6     Filed 07/11/19     Page 14 of 16

IV. 
Sixth Amendment 
Finally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is 
predicated on events allegedly occurring 14 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to 
provide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his 
defense, that Mr. Epstein be permitted pretrial release.  The Sixth Amendment “does not provide 
merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right 
to make his defense.  It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and 
cause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who 
must be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Faretta v. 
California, 422 U.S. 806, 819 (1975).  Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr. 
Epstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his 
pretrial detention. 
V. 
Conclusion 
Wherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct 
over the past 14 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the 
community.  Even if the Court should have concerns to the contrary, there clearly exist a 
combination of conditions that would be sufficient to assure his presence as required and/or the 
safety of the community, including but not limited to some or all of the conditions proposed 
supra, or any other conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate.

DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE 
SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE UNDER SEAL 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby respectfully moves 
this Honorable Court for leave to file under seal his supplemental financial disclosure.  As noted in 
Mr. Epstein’s bail submission, on advice of counsel, he has not yet provided a complete financial 
disclosure.  Counsel’s advice on this point was motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy and 
completeness of the information provided to the Court.  Mr. Epstein seeks leave to file his 
forthcoming supplemental disclosure under seal.  As grounds and reasons therefor, Mr. Epstein relies 
on the exceptional amount of publicity that has been generated by this case, much of which relates 
specifically to his finances.  Under the Bail Reform Act, financial information provided by a 
defendant to a pretrial services officer “shall be used only for the purposes of a bail determination 
and shall otherwise be confidential.” 18 U.S.C. § 3153(c)(1).  Here, in the event Mr. Epstein is 
required to publicly file his financial statement, the information contained therein will inevitably be 
widely disseminated in the news media, contravening the statutory requirement of confidentiality.

Re:  
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant’s motion for 
leave to file a supplemental financial disclosure under seal (the “Sealing Motion”) in connection 
with his motion for pretrial release (the “Bail Motion”). 
The Government takes no position on the defendant’s application, but notes that as of this 
filing the Government still has not yet received any financial disclosure or information from the 
defense in connection with the defendant’s application for bail.  It is now more than three days 
following the defendant’s initial presentment, more than seven hours after the defendant’s deadline 
to file his Motion, and less than 24 hours before the Government’s deadline to reply.  There is no 
reason that the defendant need have waited until this evening to submit his Sealing Motion, and 
the Government cannot meaningfully respond to a Bail Motion that contains no material financial 
information, either under seal or otherwise. 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that its deadline to respond to the 
defendant’s Bail Motion be extended to at least 24 hours following the defendant’s disclosure of 
any financial information upon which he intends to rely in connection with the Motion.  Should

DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR LEA VE TO FILE 
SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE UNDER SEAL 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby respectfully moves 
this Honorable Court for leave to file under seal his supplemental financial disclosure. As noted in 
Mr. Epstein's bail submission, on advice of counsel, he has not yet provided a complete financial 
disclosure. Counsel's advice on this point was motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy and 
completeness of the infmmation provided to the Comt. Mr. Epstein seeks leave to file his 
fmthcoming supplemental disclosure under seal. As grounds and reasons therefor, Mr. Epstein relies 
on the exceptional amount of publicity that has been generated by this case, much of which relates 
specifically to his finances. Under the Bail Ref01111 Act, financial information provided by a 
defendant to a pretrial services officer "shall be used only for the purposes of a bail determination 
and shall othe1wise be confidential." 18 U.S.C. § 3153( c)(l ). Here, in the event Mr. Epstein is 
required to publicly file his financial statement, the information contained therein will inevitably be 
widely disseminated in the news media, contrnvening the statutmy requirement of confidentiality.

Re:

Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's motion for 
leave to file a supplemental financial disclosure under seal (the "Sealing Motion") in connection 
with his motion for pretrial release (the "Bail Motion"), 
The Government takes no position on the defendant's application, but notes that as of this 
filing the Government still has not yet received any financial disclosure or infonnation from the 
defense in connection with the defendant's application for bail. It is now more than three days 
following the defendant's initial presentment, more than seven hours after the defendant's deadline 
to file his Motion, and less than 24 hours before the Government's deadline to reply. There is no 
reason that the defendant need have waited until this evening to submit his Sealing Motion, and 
the Government cannot meaningfully respond to a Bail Motion that contains no material financial 
information, either under seal or otherwise. 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that its deadline to respond to the 
defendant's Bail Motion be extended to at least 24 hours following the defendant's disclosure of 
any financial information upon which he intends to rely in connection with the Motion. Should

Re:  
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Pitman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled 
for July 8, 2019, in the above-captioned case.  For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should 
order that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. 
As set forth below, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is 
alleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years, 
and he now faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted 
evidence of his guilt.  In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the substantial 
incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of 
flight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ownership of and access to private 
planes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties.  Indeed, the arrest of 
the defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned 
from a multi-week stay abroad. 
Finally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past 
experience with this defendant—that if allowed to remain out on bail, the defendant could attempt 
to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and 
their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger 
to the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight.  
The defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this 
case, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.

Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge

BACKGROUND 
A. Overview 
On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed 
indictment (the “Indictment”) charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from 
a years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls.  In particular, beginning in at least 2002, the 
defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he 
paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. 
He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York (the “New York Residence”) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
“Palm Beach Residence”).  In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in 
similar ways.  Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the defendant, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with 
victims’ genitals.  The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate 
encounter. 
Moreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional 
girls to be similarly sexually abused.  He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying 
these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him.  In this 
fashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations 
including New York and Palm Beach. 
The defendant’s victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them.  Many of his 
victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation.  The defendant 
intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors.  Indeed, in some instances, his 
victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused 
them. 
In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant 
worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 
defendant, both in New York and in Florida. 
B. The Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant 
and through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his 
rampant abuse of underage girls.

Page 3 
As has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he owns and 
maintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhattan, New York; 
Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France.  Additionally, Epstein owns a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary 
residence in the United States.  His mansion in Manhattan alone—a multi-story townhouse 
reported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhattan, which previously housed a 
school and which he owns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.  
Entities controlled by the defendant also own at least two private jets in active service, at least one 
of which is capable of intercontinental travel. 
As described further below, the defendant possesses three active United States passports, 
and his international connections and travels are extensive.  For example, in addition to 
maintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past 18 months alone, the 
defendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately 
more than 20 occasions. 
C. The Prior Florida Investigation 
In or about 2005, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in 
connection with allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls.  The 
investigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews 
with victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count 
One of the instant Indictment.1   
In fall 2007, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in 
connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement 
identified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach 
area.  The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant 
was never charged federally.2  In June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count 
of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation 
of prostitution, a felony.  As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with 
registration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. 
The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed below, was entered into at the conclusion of 
the SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.  
As noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who 
were abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida. 
While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further below, it is well-established in the 
Second Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is 
not bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Attorney’s 
Office in another district.  See page 6, infra.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the community or a risk of flight.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) (“no condition or combination of 
conditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community”).  A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a 
preponderance of the evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); 
United States v. Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985).  A finding of dangerousness must 
be supported by clear and convincing evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 
542 (2d Cir. 1995); Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405.  In addition, a court may also order detention if 
there is “a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . attempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten, 
injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2)(B); see also United 
States v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988). 
The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] 
financial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See 
U.S.C. § 3142(g).  Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v. 
Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (same). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).  Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it shall be presumed, 
subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community.  18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
II. 
Discussion 
The defendant should be detained pending trial.  For the reasons set forth below, it is 
difficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released, 
and for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of 
detention in this case.   
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 11-1     Filed 07/12/19     Page 4 of 10

Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019  
Page 5 
A. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk – the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant – 
counsel strongly in favor of detention.   
1. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
The “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(g)(1) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a 
factor in bail applications).  Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a 
defendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the 
community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E).  Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s 
conduct was committed serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.   
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which 
include up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.3  As the Second 
Circuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of 
flight.  See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 618 (10th Cir. 
2003) (defendant was a flight risk because her knowledge of the seriousness of the charges against her 
gave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Townsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 1990) 
(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even 
greater incentive to consider flight.”).  Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades 
in prison.  Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail below, the defendant has 
in abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.  
It is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real 
prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.   
The likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is buttressed by the strength of the 
evidence.  As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong.  The Indictment alleges 
that the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists 
numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.4   
The current penalties for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 include a 10 year mandatory minimum 
sentence. However, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2006.  
The penalty for a violation of Section 1591 during the period charged in the Indictment, and 
therefore relevant here, was a maximum of 40 years’ imprisonment. 
With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the 
Indictment is sufficient, on its own, to establish probable cause that the defendant committed the 
crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy.  Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were an 
evidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3142(e) case in 
which an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering 
that which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 11-1     Filed 07/12/19     Page 5 of 10

Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019  
Page 6 
Multiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information 
against the defendant.  That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances, 
by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as 
further detailed below, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the 
defendant’s arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude 
young women or girls.  Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials, 
such as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant’s residence that include 
names and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and 
his agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period.  Put simply, 
all of this evidence – the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually 
abused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence – will be 
devastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
Finally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant’s previous non-
prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with a different federal district pose any impediment to his 
conviction.   As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the 
date of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim.  See United States v. 
Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because Congress extended the statute 
of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still 
running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 
WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). 
Moreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New 
York was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL 
investigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude 
prosecution in this District for at least two reasons.  First, it is well settled in the Second Circuit 
that “a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney’s office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind 
another.”  United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) (“A plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”) (citing United States 
v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam)).  This is true even if the text of the 
agreement purports to bind “the Government.”  See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672.  This analysis 
similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement.  See United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 
854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement 
to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States 
Attorney that are not parties to the agreement.  This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, 
which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can 
affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 
771 F.2d at 672).  Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely 
the presumptions and the § 3142(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be 
detained.”).

conduct that occurred in New York.  The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims 
identified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of 
whom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment. 
Each of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee.  And as further 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
2. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention.  The 
defendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any attempt 
to flee.  Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.   
As the defendant acknowledged in his most recent New York State sex offender 
registration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own 
private island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and 
Stanley, New Mexico.  The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion 
alone is more than $77 million.  The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach 
estate is more than $12 million.  The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.  
Moreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee.  His sex registration 
documentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven 
Chevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade, 
and a Hummer II.  These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin 
Islands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico.  The defendant also has access to two private jets, 
giving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually 
anywhere he wants to travel.  He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to 
and from the United States by private plane.  In particular, between January 1, 2018, and the 
present, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 20 flights in which 
Epstein was traveling to or from a foreign country.  Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport 
arriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks 
abroad.  Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of 
flight.  See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005).  There can be 
no assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel. 
Finally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country.  The 
defendant has no known immediate family.  He is not married and has no children.  He has friends 
and associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his 
professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the 
defendant remotely.  Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain 
in the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee. 
Nor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the 
defendant’s presence as required.  At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would

merely reduce his head start should he decide to flee.  See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 
2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application 
for bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing 
defendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, 
at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 
2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
Finally, there can be little doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of 
dollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of 
his life.  These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the 
reach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to 
this District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered 
in conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant 
could receive if convicted.  
B. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in 
Obstruction of Justice 
The release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the 
community and to the ongoing investigation.  
As described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has 
committed an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it is presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3).  Here, not 
only is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already 
previously admitted to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct.  Specifically, in 
June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under 
classification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of committing another 
sex crime and harm to the community.  While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the 
2008 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released. 
Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida, 
there were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or 
other obstructive behaviors.  In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were 
discussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the 
defendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with 
reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or 
informant.”  For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors 
in SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant 
had “attempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to attend an 
official proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both 
[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to 
attempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally

Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019  
Page 9 
harassed both [redacted] in connection to this attempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process 
all in violation of 18 USC 1512(d)(1).”5  Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts. 
361 at 3-4, 361-7 through 361-11.  In addition to 18 U.S.C. § 1512(d), prosecutors also proposed 
that the defendant could plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 403, that is, a knowing or intentional violation 
of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-
counsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.”  Id. Dkt. 361-11.  They also discussed 
a possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private 
investigators followed [redacted] father, forcing off the road.”  Id. Dkt. 361-10. 
The defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or 
tamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc[ed] off the road” the father of an 
individual relevant in the investigation is alarming.  It should especially weigh on the Court’s 
consideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even 
being charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s 
case here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater.  And as discussed 
above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so. 
Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage 
victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking 
women or girls in his Manhattan mansion.  In a search of the New York Residence on the night of 
his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers 
discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the 
mansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at 
least hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-
nude females.  While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some 
of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl 
who, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.  
Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which 
law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels including the 
following: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes 1,” and “Girl pics nude.”  The defendant, a 
registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;6 rather, he is a 
continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting 
deeply serious charges. 
The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document. 
See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, 
N.Y. Post (2011) (“‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an “offender,” the financier told The Post 
yesterday.  ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.’”); Philip 
Weiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2007) (“‘It’s the Icarus story, someone who flies too 
close to the sun,’ I said.  ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”).

CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real.  The 
defendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious 
offenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction 
of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail.  In 
sum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive 
international travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and 
ownership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a 
successful fugitive.  Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse 
dozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass, 
intimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his 
dangerousness readily apparent. 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not 
be able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there 
are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this 
case or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.

The Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
500 Pearl Street 
New York, New York 10007 
Re:  
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant’s Motion for 
Pretrial Release (the “Release Motion”), dated July 11, 2019 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its 
Memorandum in Support of Detention (the “Detention Memo”), submitted to Magistrate Judge 
Pitman on July 8, 2019, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for 
years.  A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of 
minors, including girls as young as 14 years old, in New York and Florida.  To this day, he is a 
registered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend, 
despite unsuccessfully attempting to have that classification lowered.  And any doubt that the 
defendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered 
hundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhattan 
mansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime 
involving a juvenile. 
The defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated 
testimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to 
prison for the rest of his life.  The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which 
remain largely concealed from the Court.  He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation 
of witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports 
about his conduct reemerged.  And he continues to show a shocking lack of understanding of the 
gravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and 
casual disparagement of victims in his arguments. 
Against this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges, 
and the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions 
that are woefully inadequate.  The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant

law, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s 
appalling sexual abuse, and utterly fails to meet its burden of rebutting the presumption that no 
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as 
required and the safety of the community.  Rather than even attempting to address the grave risks 
of releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors, 
the defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to little more than a barely-secured 
bond masquerading as a 14-point plan.  The Court should reject the defendant’s application and 
order him detained pending trial. 
Among other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the 
principal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to 
forfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value  as collateral.  His 
proposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be little 
comfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to 
this country.  The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given 
his wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel.  The two co-signers he proposes only 
further highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the 
District.  Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—
and does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has 
continued to hoard nude images of young women and girls.  And the private security force he 
proposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar 
circumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he 
can be secured at all times: a federal correctional center. 
The defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended 
detention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention.  Because there are no set of conditions 
short of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably 
protect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained. 
BACKGROUND 
As previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the 
“Indictment”) charging the defendant with violating Title 18, United States Code Section 1519, 
and conspiracy to commit the same. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long 
scheme to sexually abuse underage girls.  Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens 
of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, in at least two different states.  Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the 
defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual 
in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect 
contact with victims’ genitals.  To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant 
actively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused.  He 
paid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him, 
creating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.

The defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for 
the gravity of the offenses with which he is charged.1  As an initial matter, there can be no plausible 
suggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they 
involve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse committed over a period of many years.  And 
following the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the 
defendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young 
subjects.  The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young 
as 14 years old when he abused them.  The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including 
because victims told him directly they were underage.  And he preyed on his victims habitually 
and repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.   
The defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”2  Mag. Tr. 12:12; see 
also D. Tr. at 6:15-19 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was 
investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”).  That 
characterization is not only offensive but also utterly irrelevant given that federal law does not 
recognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child 
cannot legally consent to being exploited.  Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the 
Government’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at 12 
(“There was no coercion.  There were no threats.  There was no violence.”), 17 (“there was no 
coercion.  There was no intimidation.  There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (“There are 
no allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—is equally 
irrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.   
See, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2016) (“We hold that § 1591(a) 
criminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than 18 years old) with or without any force, fraud, 
or coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (18 or older), but only if done by 
force, fraud, or coercion.”). 
Far more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will 
be able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the 
defendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage.  See Release Motion 
at 2.  On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be 
detained pending trial.  He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and 
he cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. 
Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person 
who steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure.  See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey 
Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2011) (“‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an 
“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday.  ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a 
person who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2007) (“‘It’s the Icarus 
story, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said.  ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”).

ARGUMENT 
The Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory 
presumption in favor of detention in this case for the following reasons, among others: 
I. 
Victims Seek Detention 
Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be 
reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings 
involving release.  18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4).  Consistent with that requirement, the Government has 
been in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with 
the argument regarding bail. 
Multiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to 
inform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons.  First, they believe that the 
defendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected 
from the accused.  18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1).  They have specifically conveyed to the Government 
that they would be fearful for their safety if the defendant were released.  For the reasons articulated 
herein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded. 
Additionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are 
specifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that 
included home detention and full-time private guards.  They believe it would be unfair to victims 
of a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be 
in similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.  
They specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement 
could result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. 3 
II. 
The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—
counsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing 
whatsoever to mitigate those risks. 
A. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee  
It might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant 
is extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently 
obtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-1”), more than $500 million. 
The Government is aware of at least one additional attorney for a victim who has publicly stated 
that her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant.  The Government is unaware of any 
victim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.

Indeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of 
perjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances 
makes painfully clear the need for detention.  The defendant reports having an extraordinary 
amount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings.  And while the 
defendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,” 
there is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that. 
Indeed, and as discussed further below, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently 
in the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from 
transferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The 
defendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry 
and significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world.  He could easily transfer 
funds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as 
to ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.  
But perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all of his current 
assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or 
tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States.  He already earns at least 
$10,000,000 per year, according to records from Institution-1, while living in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be little to 
stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown assets abroad, and then continuing to do 
whatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of 
extradition.4   
That the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which 
he is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the 
risk of flight.  See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987).  So too is the strength of 
the evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo.  Indeed, that evidence, 
already robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is growing stronger by the 
day.  Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions, 
have identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when 
they were minors.  Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government 
has discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young 
women and girls in the defendant’s Manhattan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens 
of electronic discs that contain still more such photos.5  And dozens of individuals have called the 
Government in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations 
As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly 
travels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 20 flights in which he 
traveled to or from a foreign country since 2018 alone.  Extensive international travel of this nature 
further demonstrates a significant risk of flight.  See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 
2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). 
The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.

contained in the Indictment.  All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that 
already alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida. 
B. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention 
The defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to 
secure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient.  Rather, they are effectively 
standard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s 
assets—broken out into 14 pieces.  The Government will address the most concerning and salient 
elements of the defendant’s proposal below. 
1. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security 
The defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhattan mansion as the primary 
security for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the 
defendant’s brother and a friend.  Release Motion at 4.  This is plainly insufficient. 
As an initial matter, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhattan mansion has been 
identified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to 
commit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there.  See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1594(c)(1).   Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property following a 
conviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(4) (“In 
considering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer . . . shall decline to accept 
the designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably 
assure the appearance of the person as required.”).  And while the defendant offers to also pledge 
his private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant 
would not readily trade his private plane for his freedom.  Indeed, the defendant, who has a net 
worth of more than $500 million, by his own admission recently sold a second plane and thus 
presumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be. 
Nor does the proposed security of properties owned by two identified co-signers 
meaningfully change the calculus.  As further described below, the defendant provides no 
information about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach 
Property”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s own net worth.6  
Similarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr. 
Mitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr. 
Mitchell, let alone the defendant.  More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the 
defendant could easily make his co-signers whole – and even reward them – were he to flee.   
The proposed security, in sum, should give the Court little comfort the defendant would 
appear in Court if released on bail.  
In fact, the defendant’s own submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his 
brother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.

Page 7 
2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community 
The dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his 
brother or friend, further shows the hollowness of the proposal.  The Court cannot possibly 
evaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers 
to exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could 
easily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the 
defendant’s flight from justice.  The defendant provides no information about his brother other 
than that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information 
about Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of 
decades,” and his “close personal friend.”  Release Motion at 4, 9.  Their willingness to “guarantee” 
his appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information. 
Moreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for 
this defendant strains credulity.  Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight, 
any bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to 
even be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release.  The 
defendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much 
less these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently 
insufficient. 
3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical 
The defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional 
reassurance whatsoever.  As an initial matter, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the 
defendant before such a waiver would even come into play.  Moreover, even assuming the 
Government could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such 
purported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs 
such a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of 
the waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose 
to flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. 
Dec. 23, 2016); United States v. Kazeem, No. 15 Cr. 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug. 
3, 2015); United States v. Young, Nos. 12 Cr. 502, 12 Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, at *7 (D. Utah 
Aug. 27, 2013); United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. 
Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v. Bohn, 330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. 2004); United 
States v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000); United States 
v. Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1028, 1035 (S.D. Fla. 1985).  .  The Department of Justice’s Office of 
International Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an 
anticipatory extradition waiver binding.  And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a 
jurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty. 
Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and 
expensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real 
deterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would 
be required to wait years for his return.

4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance 
The defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the 
Court.  In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio 
frequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.  
At best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide 
to cut the bracelet and flee.  See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 
(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention 
with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United 
States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United 
States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 
Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here 
The defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from 
court under the threat of deadly force.  This proposal should be rejected. 
At the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of 
a government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that 
implicates the Bail Reform Act.  “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant, 
if she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her own home at her own cost, has a right to do 
so under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.”  United States v. Valerio, 9 F. 
Supp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases).  The Second Circuit has never 
directly addressed this issue.  See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.18 (2d Cir. 2007) 
(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would 
be ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allow wealthy defendants ‘to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omitted)).  Indeed, a decision by this Court 
reasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not 
appear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or 
detention.”  United States v. Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681423, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2016). 
Courts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at 
best ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility 
instills.’”  United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Gotti, 
776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F. 
Supp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use 
force against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether 
the guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the 
imperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more 
secure option of an actual jail.”).  A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled 
environment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner 
can be attended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed 
private jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-
flight-risk circumstance.  The risk of a public escape attempt while in the community and involving 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 11     Filed 07/12/19     Page 8 of 14

Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019  
Page 9 
armed private guards attempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—rather than the 
defendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the 
defendant’s flight to the public.  See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y. 
2019).  “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in 
facilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities.”  Id. at 258 (citing Sabhnani, 
493 F.3d at 74 n.13 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force 
may need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ... [s]uch a conclusion would, in fact, 
demand a defendant's detention”)). 
The Second Circuit has held it is not legal error “for a district court to decline to accept,” 
as “a substitute for detention,” a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him.  United 
States v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x 152, 153-54 (2d Cir. 2010).  In the same decision, the Second 
Circuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allow[ing] wealthy defendants to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Id.; accord, e.g., 
United States v. Cilins, No. 13 Cr. 315 (WHP), 2013 WL 3802012, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013) 
(“‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise 
ineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by 
security guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully 
selected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, 136 F. Supp. 2d 125, 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001))); Valerio, 9 
F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (“There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would 
suggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has 
a statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location.”). 
The defendant’s payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having 
the defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding 
him, leaving the company’s incentives entirely aligned with the defendant.  See, e.g., Boustani, 
356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the 
appearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an 
inmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant 
“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a 
total of 160 hours in a 30-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in 
Chinatown with his private guards in tow”); see also United States v. Tajideen, 17 Cr. 046, 2018 
WL 1342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, 2018) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further 
noting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's 
security detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's 
jurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the power of money and its potential to corrupt or 
undermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they 
also cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”). 
Finally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard 
proposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a 
very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.”  2016 
WL 3681423, at *13; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 (“although this Defendant has vast 
financial resources to construct his own ‘private prison,’ the Court is not convinced ‘disparate 
treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act’”) (quoting United States v. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 11     Filed 07/12/19     Page 9 of 14

Bruno, 89 F. Supp. 3d 425, 432 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (“”Even if Defendant had the financial capacity 
to replicate a private jail within his own home, this Court is not convinced that such a set of 
conditions would be sufficiently effective in this case to protect the community from Defendant, 
or that such disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Act.”)); Borodin, 
136 F. Supp. 2d at 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (Nickerson, J.) (“It is contrary to underlying principles of 
detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately 
accountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”). 
If the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards, 
the defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that 
effectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself.  It is 
frankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to 
duplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the 
requirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehow “bear a special disadvantage.”  Release 
Motion at 12 n.9.  Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a 
case in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the 
defendant’s appearance?”  Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681432, at *12 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9 
F. Supp. 3d at 295). 
III. 
The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a 
Risk to Obstruct Justice 
A. Danger to the Community 
In the first instance, the defendant’s argument that 14 years without a criminal conviction 
eliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected.  Were that the case—which is certainly 
is not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption 
applicable to crimes such as sex trafficking.  That is manifestly incorrect.  See United States v. 
Artis, 607 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was 
“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s 
determination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against 
dangerousness and the risk of flight”).  Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal 
record, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor. 
But the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further 
demonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies 
of his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through 
its search warrants.  As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s 
residence included those with hand-written labels including the following: “Young [Name] + 
[Name],” “Misc nudes 1,” and “Girl pics nude.”  Not surprisingly, the Government has found that 
such discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude 
females appearing to be underage.

Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019  
Page 11 
B. Danger to Obstruct Justice 
The defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and 
aggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation.  Far from being “musty,” Release 
Motion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually 
abusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being 
charged with sexually abusing children.  For example, in the incident the defendant now claims 
was not attributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that 
pressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.  
See Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report”) (Ex. B).  According to the Police Report, the 
parent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator.  The 
Police Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation 
reported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant, 
followed “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the 
defendant’s businesses and associates.   
Separately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and 
tampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant following his 2008 
conviction.  See Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 291-15 at 21-23, 31.  
Moreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence 
during the course of the prior investigation.  Specifically, one victim reported that “she was 
personally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured 
[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating 
with law enforcement.”  Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will 
be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”  See Palm Beach Police Report 
(Ex. C).   
And Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day.  As in the past, within 
recent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to 
him during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.  
By way of background, on or about November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald began publishing a 
series of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior 
conviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”).  Records obtained by the Government 
from Institution-1 appear to show that just two days later, on or about November 30, 2018, the 
defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible 
co-conspirator in the NPA.  The same records appear to show that just three days after that, on or 
about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to another 
individual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the 
defendant’s employees in the Indictment.  Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or 
repeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the 
Government.  This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was 
attempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light 
of the recently re-emerging allegations

IV. 
The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here 
Finally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the 
appropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail.  None is meritorious, and 
certainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted 
bail, refrain from fleeing so he could attempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.  
Nevertheless, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn. 
A. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution 
As an initial matter, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this 
week, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond 
the scope of the NPA – that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New 
York based victims.  D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2.   For present purposes, that alone is sufficient 
to put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious 
challenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and 
additional charges brought based on New York conduct. 
But more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District 
of New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold.  The language of the NPA 
overwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to 
the SDFL.  The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander 
Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for 
these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”7  The final 
paragraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms 
of the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this 
Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses that 
arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.” 
In its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed 
as an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as 
to any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA, 
and additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil 
settlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver 
of any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.”  These provisions show the parties 
contemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not 
initially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere).  The final 
substantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.” 
It is well settled in the Second Circuit that “a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney’s office 
does not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.”  United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 
All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 11     Filed 07/12/19     Page 12 of 14

Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019  
Page 13 
(2d Cir. 2010) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney for the 
district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates 
a broader restriction.”) (citing United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per 
curiam)).  Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not 
abrogate these principles.  Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal 
prosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought 
to bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the 
agreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . However, the law has evolved to the 
contrary.”).  “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an 
affirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular 
district entering into the agreement.”  United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Brown, No. 99-1230, 
2002 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2002) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement, 
reiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to 
bind ‘the Government’” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, 159 F. 
Supp. 3d 311, 321 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the 
phrase ‘United States’ shows an intent to bind all United States Attorney’s Offices.  Rather, the 
plea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). 8 
In sum, this issue is a distraction that has little relevance to the bail determination and does 
nothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community. 
B. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking  
Next, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges 
is his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under 
the charged statutes.  As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at 14, this is an issue 
for a motion to dismiss.  Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons. 
First, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he 
was also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit 
additional victims.  He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states, 
including with co-conspirators.  The fact that he did so for his own eventual and frequent sexual 
gratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements 
of the offense with which he is charged.  The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking 
enterprise, not a mere consumer. 
This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement.  See United States v. Laskow, 
688 F. Supp. 851, 854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is 
an explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices 
of the United States Attorney that are not parties to the agreement.  This position is at odds with 
the law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement 
unless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was 
contemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672). 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 11     Filed 07/12/19     Page 13 of 14

Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019  
Page 14 
Second, he is also wrong on the law.  Courts have found that Section 1591 applied to both 
suppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts.  See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 702 F.3d 
1066, 1069 (8th Cir. 2013) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who attempted to pay for oral 
sex from an underage girl and explaining:  “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain 
and unambiguous provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 apply to both suppliers and consumers of 
commercial sex acts.’  We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original).  The lone case cited by the 
defendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. 11 Civ. 8573, 2012 WL 13042630 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2012), relied 
heavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South 
Dakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. 11 Cr. 40016, 2012 WL 13704 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2012), and 
United States v. Jungers, 11 Cr. 40018, 2011 WL 6046495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2011), both of which 
were explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066.  In the seven 
years since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.  
Additionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or 
customers.  See United States v. O’Connor, 650 F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2011) (upholding convictions 
under Section 1591 of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983 
(8th Cir. 2015) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section 1591 would be void for vagueness 
if applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. 09 Cr. 036, 2009 WL 4798900 (W.D. 
Mo. Dec. 7, 2009) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, 18 U.S.C. § 1591 clearly applies to those 
who attempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing 
United States v. Roberts, 174 F. App’s 475 (11th Cir. 2006) (in which defendant was convicted 
under sections 1591(a) and 1594(a) even though no actual children were involved)). 
CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.  
Pretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual 
and concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth, 
demonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd 
photographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.

SOMAPI Report Highlights 
SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT 
ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING INITIATIVE 
smart.gov/SOMAPI 
Adult Sex Offender Recidivism 
Observed recidivism rates of sex offenders are 
underestimates of actual reoffending. 
Sex crimes are one of the most underreported crimes 
and are often unseen by anyone other than the victim 
and perpetrator. Low reporting levels make it extremely 
difficult to estimate actual sexual recidivism rates. 
Additionally, only a small portion of sex offenses 
reported to law enforcement result in the offender's 
arrest. Therefore, it's generally recognized that observed 
recidivism rates are underestimates of the true reoffense 
rates of sex offenders. 
Sex offender recidivism is difficult to measure. 
Recidivism rates are measured differently from one study 
to the next, with different results. Studies differ in how 
recidivism is defined (i.e., rearrest vs. reconviction), how 
long offenders are followed and what types of offenders 
are included (i.e., rapists vs. child molesters). 
Recidivism rates of sex offenders range from 5 percent 
after 3 years to 24 percent after 15 years. 
Relatively low rates are reported in studies using observed 
sexual recidivism rates over follow-up periods shorter 
than 5 years. For example, a 2003 study (Langan, P., 
Schmitt, 
& Durose, M., "Recidivism of Sex Offenders 
Released From Prison in 1994," Bureau of Justice Statistics) 
found a sexual recidivism rate of about 5 percent using a 
3-year follow-up period for a large sample of sex offenders 
released from prison. Studies employing longer follow-up 
periods consistently report higher rates of recidivism. For 
example, a 2004 study (Harris, AJ.R., & Hanson, R.K., "Sex 
Offender Recidivism: A Simple Question," Public Safety 
and Emergency Preparedness Canada) reported sexual 
recidivism rates of 20 percent and 24 percent for a sample 
of sex offenders based on a 10-year and 15-year follow-up 
period, respectively. 
Sex offenders -
regardless of type -
have higher 
rates of general recidivism than sexual recidivism. 
Recidivism studies have consistently found that adult sex 
offenders have much higher rates of general reoffending 
than sexual reoffending. A 2004 study (Hanson, R.K., & 
Morton-Bourgon, K., "Predictors of Sexual Recidivism: An 
Updated Meta-Analysis," Public Safety and Emergency 
Measuring sex offender recidivism is 
difficult due to underreporting and different 
methods used in research studies. Studies 
with longer follow-up periods show that 
recidivism increases over time. Furthermore, 
different "types" of sex offenders have 
different recidivism rates. 
Preparedness Canada) analyzed findings from 95 studies 
and found that sex offenders had an average overall 
recidivism rate of 37 percent compared to an average 
sexual recidivism rate of 14 percent, based on follow-up 
periods of 5 to 6 years. This suggests that policies aimed at 
protecting the public from sex offender reoffense should 
be concerned with the likelihood of any form of serious 
recidivism, not just sexual recidivism. 
Female sex offenders reoffend at significantly lower 
rates than male offenders. 
Five- to six-year rates of sexual recidivism for female sex 
offenders may be as low as 1 to 3 percent. The empirical 
evidence regarding the different recidivism rates of female 
and male sex offenders suggests that intervention and 
management practices need to differentiate between 
female and male sex offenders, and that methods for 
assessing risk of male sex offenders are unlikely to be 
accurate when applied to female sex offenders (Cortoni, 
F., Hanson, R.K., & Coache, M.E., "The recidivism rates 
of female sex offenders are low: A Meta-Analysis," Sexual 
Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 22; 2010). 
Different types of sex offenders have different 
recidivism rates. 
Research examining the recidivism of rapists and child 
molesters indicates that the highest observed recidivism 
rates are found among child molesters who offend against 
boys. Comparatively lower recidivism rates are found 
for rapists, child molesters who victimize girls and incest 
offenders.

         (Case called) 
THE COURT:  Good afternoon.  
I think I'm pretty much up to speed as to where you 
are in the sense that I am aware that you have been before 
Magistrate Judge Pitman earlier this morning and up to some few 
minutes ago for purposes of presentment, arraignment, and some 
preliminary discussion of bail.  Is that accurate? 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  That's correct, your Honor.  I don't
want to speak for defense counsel, but my understanding is they
expect to put in some sort of written submission and return to
argue the rest of the bail hearing on Thursday before Judge
Pitman at 2:00.  That is, if your Honor refers the bail hearing
to Judge Pitman on that basis as well.
THE COURT:  I might just take that bail application
before me.  We'll figure out a time when that would be
comfortable for all of you.  How is that?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  That's fine with the government, your
Honor.
THE COURT:  I have a few items on my list.  I want to
make mention, I'm sure Magistrate Judge Pitman did, of our
presumption of innocence.  Even though in some of these
discussions, and probably more so when we get to bail, it may
sound like we are talking about merits of the case, it's
important that we underscore that the presumption of innocence
pertains to Mr. Epstein, now and until such time, if it comes,
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 2 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
that there is a guilty determination by a jury or by the Court,
that he is presumed to be innocent.
I did have these questions.  One has to do with
persons who are categorized as victims.  I want to get some
assurance from the U.S. Attorney's office that they have been
notified about this case and that you will keep them abreast of
developments in this case.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor, we are acutely aware
of our obligations to the victims in this case.  We have
notified them and we expect to continue to do so as the case
moves forward.
THE COURT:  Second, for my background, I am aware that
there are certain conditions that attach to Mr. Epstein's sex
offender status resulting from his Florida state prosecution in
or about 2008.  One result is that under New York law --
correct me if I'm wrong about any of this -- he is considered
to be at high risk of committing another sex crime with minors.
Is that a fair characterization of his sex offender status?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, as the government set
forth in its submission to Judge Pitman, and we copied this
Court, it is our understanding that the defendant is a tier 3
sex offender in New York and that that is characterized as
high-risk individual.
THE COURT:  The question that I have is what are the
implications, if any, of the search conducted by the U.S.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 3 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
Attorney's office over the weekend of Mr. Epstein's residence
on East 71st Street for the terms and conditions of his sex
offender status, if any?  Are there any consequences or
relationship between what was uncovered and what he is obliged
to do?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  May I have one moment, your Honor?
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, in response to that
question, at the outset I should say that we don't have
particular interaction with state authorities with respect to
those types of notifications.  We are, I would say, in the
early stages of reviewing those materials.  With respect to the
defendant's obligations or potential consequences in the New
York State system, we certainly will notify whichever
authorities are appropriate.  I don't think that we have a role
other than that.
I will say that they are extremely concerning with
respect to bail here, with respect to the conduct here, and I
expect we will get into that more in our submissions and bail
argument.
THE COURT:  By the way, if defense counsel wants to
jump in at any point, feel free to do that?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  On that, we have not seen the
pictures.
THE COURT:  I haven't either.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 4 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
MR. WEINGARTEN:  I understand.  It is our expectation
that they are ancient, that they are pre his spending time in
prison, and/or they are erotic pictures of adults who
voluntarily engaged in that conduct.
THE COURT:  I have a question about the Southern
District of Florida nonprosecution agreement dated probably in
2008 -- is that correct?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  It's dated in 2007, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Is that a public document?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  It is, your Honor.  It's been
publicly filed in connection with other civil litigation.
THE COURT:  Does that agreement bear on in any way the
search and results of the search that were conducted at Mr.
Epstein's townhouse over the weekend?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Not in ways that I am aware of now,
your Honor.  Again, we are very much in progress on the search.
We will continue to consider any other implications beyond this
case as we continue to review those materials.
On a separate note, your Honor, I want to add the
government noted it is aware of its victim obligations.  In
terms of notification, we have made notification to individuals
that we are in particular aware of.  We also have listed a
phone number for victims to be in touch with the FBI, with the
U.S. Attorney's office.  We have also put a website up and have
asked victims to be in touch with us through those sources as
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 5 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
well.  That is just to round out the notification that the U.S.
Attorney's office has made.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  May I be heard briefly on that?
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  For us, your Honor, the NPA is the
center of the universe for everything, search included, because
the NPA was the result of an extensive 3-year investigation by
law enforcement in Florida.  In essence, the Feds made Mr.
Epstein plead to a state offense and they declined prosecution
federally, and that is translated in the NPA.  Mr. Epstein did
his time, Mr. Epstein is on the registration list, and Mr.
Epstein paid the alleged victims.
As I am sure you have noted from the indictment, that
conduct too is an ancient history.  That conduct is 2002 to
2005.  It is our belief that this is basically a re-do.  This
is basically the Feds today, not happy with what happened in
the decision that led to the NPA, redoing the same conduct that
was investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of
prostitution, calling it sex trafficking.  We think that is the
heart of everything, and that will be the centerpiece of our
defense, at least legally.
THE COURT:  My understanding of what the government is
asserting is that the episodes that occurred in Manhattan were
not included in the nonprosecution agreement in Florida and
that there is a separate basis not only for a sex trafficking
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 6 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
count but also for a sex trafficking conspiracy count.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  We have had good conversations with
the prosecutors, and we like and respect them.  We are looking
forward to getting discovery.  We are interested to see whether
the prosecutors in Florida, who are now under severe criticism
years later, steered the alleged victims to New York,
whether or not they violated their responsibilities under the
NPA.
THE COURT:  Whether the federal prosecutors in Florida
violated their terms and conditions?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  That will certainly be germane.
THE COURT:  Is that the point?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.
THE COURT:  Got it.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, if I could very briefly
respond to those points?
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  I expect this will be briefed and
argued on Thursday.  I don't intend to go into extensive
details about that.  I just want to flag for the Court that
defense counsel is saying that this conduct is ancient.  What
he is not saying is it is beyond the statute of limitations,
because it is not.
Second, the allegation that this is some kind of a 
conspiracy within the Department of Justice is just false.  
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 7 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
There is no evidence to support that.  The investigation was 
begun and conducted entirely separate from any other district.  
It began in the Southern District of New York.   
Certainly there is evidence that was gathered that is 
consistent with and even overlapping with the prior 
investigation.  But as the Court noted, in particular an entire 
count of this indictment is with respect to New York victims.  
And that is before we even get to the fact that the 
nonprosecution agreement does not bind the Southern District of 
New York. 
THE COURT:  I was going to ask you about that too.
Now that you have mentioned the topic, explain that, would you.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.  I do expect that we
can brief this, but the short version is that this prosecution
is not precluded by the nonprosecution agreement entered into
by the defendant in the Southern District of Florida.  That
agreement expressly referred to that federal district.  It
didn't purport to bind any other office or district.
It is well-settled in the Second Circuit that a plea 
agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not bind another 
unless otherwise stated.  That is even if, based on case law, 
the agreement refers generally to "the government."  Again, 
additionally, as set forth in the indictment returned by the 
grand jury, the substantive count alleges acts occurring in New 
York and alleges New York-based victims.   
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 8 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
That is in spite of the fact that the Southern 
District is not bound, is not a signatory to, and otherwise has 
no connection to the NPA.  And there is no evidence that we 
have come across that the Southern District of New York was 
consulted, asked, involved, notified as far as we have seen.   
For those reasons and others I'm sure we will brief, 
we don't think the NPA applies to us. 
MR. WEINBERG:  If I may reply briefly, your Honor?
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. WEINBERG:  I have been one of Mr. Epstein's
counsel through the CVRA litigation which started in 2008 and
continues.  In fact, our briefing is today.  The NPA provided
him with immunity for any offenses arising from a joint
FBI/grand jury/U.S. Attorney investigation that led to a
decision by Mr. Epstein to plead to a higher state offense than
the state prosecutors contemplated.  He went to jail, signed an
agreement, and has lived up to its terms 100 percent.
We have seen in the paperwork of the CVRA, in the
Southern District of Florida, in writing at docket 205-2 the
government's motion to dismiss CVRA, urging that the witnesses
there go to the Southern District of New York and essentially
try to motivate them to prosecute for the very same conduct, in
other words, the conduct that Mr. Epstein was immunized,
including travel between two states, telephonic communications
between two states.  Florida immunized him for the same travel
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 9 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
and telephonic communications as well as the 1591 category.
In addition, the Department of Justice reviewed the
NPA on several occasions in 2008 and essentially confirmed that
the exercise of discretion shown in Florida was appropriate.
But the most important thing is that there was communication
between the prosecutors in Florida, perhaps through prosecutors
in Georgia that took over the case because the Florida
prosecutors were recused as a result of Judge Marrah's
decisions in the CVRA case.
We know the government is relying in part on evidence
that was generated by the Southern District of Florida case
back in 2007.  They have talked about message pads, telephone
records.  They are the same message pads and telephone records
that reflect conduct that was exclusively 15, 16, 17 years ago.
So we do have a principal position that we will put to the
Court at the appropriate time regarding the legality of this
prosecution and whether or not it is appropriately barred.
I can say as a criminal defense lawyer of 45 years, 
when there is an interstate wire, mailing, travel, and there is 
one district that is conducting an investigation, you negotiate 
with that district and count on the Department of Justice to 
what it does every day decade after decade after decade, which 
is not to go to the second jurisdiction that received the mail 
that was sent from the immunizing jurisdiction and have a 
prosecution on the very same conduct.  We will be briefing 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 10 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
that. 
THE COURT:  Do you anticipate that there is going to
be any discussion here about the legality of the NPA?
MR. WEINBERG:  Not the legality of the NPA.  I think
the discussion here is going to be about its scope.
THE COURT:  From the defense, yes.  You don't think
you expect to hear anything from the government, for example?
MR. WEINBERG:  In the Southern District case, the CVRA
case, maybe two weeks ago the Northern District of Georgia
prosecutors, who are proxy for the Southern District of
Florida, filed the submission before District Judge Marrah in
the CVRA case totally supporting the constitutionality and
legality of the NPA, their discretion to enter into it, and
that there absolutely has never been a charge that Mr. Epstein
ever did anything other than fully perform his end as a citizen
who is expecting the benefits of a contract that he lived up
to.
THE COURT:  I thought there had been some contention
that the way that the victims vis-a-vis the Florida NPA were
dealt with or not dealt with was one basis for attacking the
legality of that arrangement.
MR. WEINBERG:  The petitioners are vigorously and have
vigorously for many years challenged, many years starting quite
frankly after Mr. Epstein performed his obligations to go to
jail and challenged it, claiming that there was no consultation
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 11 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
prior to the government's entering the agreement.
The Department of Justice at the time did not believe 
the CVRA extended absent a federal charge.  The predicate is a 
federal crime that harms a victim.  The petitioners have 
vigorously asserted a different position.  Judge Marrah, in a 
summary judgment motion, agreed with the petitioners as to the 
fault of the government in not conferring.  The issue of remedy 
is before Judge Marrah at the present time, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, if I may very briefly?
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  The crux of the defense argument here
I think cuts precisely the other way.  They are arguing that
the Southern District of Florida has sort of sent up a flag
that these prosecutions could be undertaken elsewhere.  That's
true.  The Southern District of Florida has argued in papers
that they believed, the Southern District of Florida believed,
that the nonprosecution agreement was limited to that district.
They have said that out loud and in public and in their
positions in filing.
So certainly this investigation was not shoveled to 
the Southern District of New York from anywhere else, including 
the Department of Justice.  We expect that the nonprosecution 
agreement will not be an impediment, in particular because the 
defendant certainly did not lack for sophisticated counsel in 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 12 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
negotiating that agreement, which again did not include the 
Southern District of New York.  We don't expect that to be any 
impediment at all here. 
THE COURT:  Got it.
This is a small item.  In the pretrial services report
which was prepared today -- how many, if more than one,
passports does Mr. Epstein have?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Mr. Epstein reported today one.  Two
others were rescinded.  As we understand it, there is one
effective passport today.
I would like to make one other point about the
pretrial that is extremely important.
THE COURT:  Go ahead.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  The way it reads is that we have
refused to provide information about income and assets.
THE COURT:  I didn't really read it that way myself.
I thought it was incomplete in some places and I thought it
could be beefed up, so to speak.  But I imagine that in the
bail application those matters may be dealt with.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Exactly.
THE COURT:  For Mr. Rossmiller:  In your letter you
describe some obstruction or harassment, witness tampering,
alleged, by Mr. Epstein.  That, I take it, is going to be
included in any response or any bail submission made by the
government?
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 13 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, I think we addressed that
in our initial submission.  To the extent defense counsel has a
response to it, we will evaluate that response and see whether
additional submission from the government is required or
appropriate.
THE COURT:  I think that's it for me in terms of
questions that I might have had.
There is, of course, a conspiracy charge here, one of
the two counts.  It may be early in your investigation to know.
Do you anticipate that there may be other defendants in this
proceeding?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, we don't expect any
imminent superseding indictments in this case.  It certainly is
possible down the road.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  May I make one point, your Honor?
These obstruction allegations we find very nettlesome and
bothering.  My understanding is that the Feds and Mr. Epstein's
attorneys back in the early 2000s, or 2007 and 8, when they
were negotiating were looking desperately for an appropriate
statute.  They finally settled on a state statute that Mr.
Epstein pled to.  We all know how unusual that is.  There was
some consideration of a federal statute, including obstruction.
So lawyers in good faith were having discussions back 
and forth whether or not they could squeeze Mr. Epstein's 
conduct into a particular statute, and they concluded they

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
couldn't because the facts didn't fit.  That is my 
understanding of how those obstruction discussions arose. 
THE COURT:  Got it.
In terms of bail application, it would be helpful, and
maybe this is your anticipation, to file written submissions.
If you could do that.  What I'm getting to is Thursday
afternoon is not a good time, in my opinion.  I would prefer to
do it, if you would go along with this, Monday morning at, say,
9:30.  That would give everybody more time to make these
submissions and to study them.  Is that agreeable?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes.
THE COURT:  Why don't we say Monday at 10:00.  Have
you arranged written submissions on any time schedule with
Magistrate Judge Pitman?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  May we have just a moment, your
Honor, with defense counsel?
THE COURT:  Yes, would you.  And also determine if one
party or the other is going first and that the other is
responding or they are simultaneous.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.
         (Pause) 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, the government is
prepared to rely on its initial submission at least for its
first argument.  I expect defense counsel will respond to that

J78repsc                 
and propose a package.  Then the government would like an
opportunity to reply to that submission.
The parties would be happy to make those deadlines 
Thursday and Saturday respectively.  However, we are also happy 
to back that up a little bit if the Court prefers not to 
receive the government's submission over the weekend.  We could 
do an earlier deadline on Thursday for defense and a late 
Friday deadline for the Court from the government, depending on 
what the Court prefers. 
THE COURT:  I was going to propose defense Thursday at
noon.  Is that okay to get your submission in?
MR. WEINBERG:  We can do that, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thanks.
And if you could respond Friday by 5:00 p.m. 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  We will, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Then we can have oral presentations.  I
take it everybody wants to have oral presentations in addition
to the written.  I'll set aside as much time as we need on the
15th at 10:00.  
I ask the government if there is a speedy trial issue 
or application that takes us to Monday at 10:00 a.m. 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.  The government asks
that speedy trial time be excluded until Monday.  We do expect
to begin the process of working on producing discovery, to
include discussions with defense counsel about a protective
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 18     Filed 07/16/19     Page 16 of 18

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J78repsc                 
order.  I think, frankly, the outcome of that will be effected
by the coming week.  But we do expect to have those
conversations and therefore request that speedy trial time be
excluded until Monday.
THE COURT:  I am going to find under 18 United States
Code 3161 that the request for adjournment, joined in by both
sides, to and including Monday the 15th at 10:00 a.m., is
appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned time from
speedy trial calculations.
I further find that the exclusion is designed to 
prevent any possible miscarriage of justice to facilitate these 
proceedings and, initially at least, so that counsel has time 
to prepare written bail submission and to guarantee effective 
representation of and preparation by counsel for both sides.  
Thus, the need for exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh 
the interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B). 
Does anybody want to add anything to today's session?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor.  May we have one more
moment with defense counsel?
THE COURT:  Sure.
         (Pause) 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Nothing from the government.  Your
Honor.
THE COURT:  Defense?

(Case called)
THE DEPUTY CLERK:  Counsel, please state your name for
the record.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  For the
government, Alex Rossmiller, Alison Moe, and Maurene Comey.
With us are Special Agent Amanda Young of the F.B.I. and
Detective Paul Byrne, NYPD task force officer.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  For
Jeffrey Epstein, Reid Weingarten from the law firm of Steptoe &
Johnson.
MR. WEINBERG:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Martin
Weinberg.  I'm an attorney from Boston, Massachusetts; and,
with your Honor's permission, I will be filing a pro hac vice
to represent Mr. Epstein.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. FERNICH:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Marc
Fernich, New York, New York, also for Mr. Epstein.
THE COURT:  All right.  I have spoken to Judge Berman.
The matter has been referred to me for the initial appearance,
arraignment, and bail.
Mr. Epstein, my name is Magistrate Judge Pitman.  The
purpose of this proceeding is to inform you of certain rights
that you have, to inform you of the charges against you, to
consider whether counsel should be appointed for you, and to
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 2 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

j782epsC kjc
decide under what conditions, if any, you should be released.
Can I have the date and time of arrest, please? 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.  The defendant was
arrested on Saturday, July 6, at approximately 5:30 p.m.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Mr. Epstein, you have the right to remain silent.  You
are not required to make any statements.  Even if you have made
any statements to the authorities, you need not make any
further statements.  Anything you do say can be used against
you.
You have the right to be released, either 
conditionally or unconditionally, pending trial unless I find 
that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that 
would reasonably assure your presence in court and the safety 
of the community.   
You have the right to be represented by counsel during 
all court proceedings, including this one, and during all 
questioning by the authorities.  If you cannot afford an 
attorney, I will appoint one to represent you.   
It is my understanding that you are being represented 
by retained counsel.  I want to advise you that the right to 
the appointment of counsel is an ongoing right that you possess 
throughout these proceedings.  If at any time you are unable to 
continue with retained counsel for financial reasons, you can 
apply to the court at any time for the appointment of counsel.

            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
Do you understand that?
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Mr. Epstein, you are charged in an
indictment in two counts.
Count One charges you with a sex trafficking 
conspiracy in violation of Title 18 United States Code § 371.   
Count Two charges with you with the substantive 
offense of sex trafficking in violation of Title 18 United 
States Code § 1591. 
Mr. Weingarten, are you going to be lead counsel here
today?  
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Mr. Weingarten, have you received a copy
of the indictment?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Have you reviewed it with your client?  
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Do you waive its reading?  
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes, your Honor.  
THE COURT:  Mr. Epstein, how do you plead?
THE DEFENDANT:  Not guilty, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Because the defendant has been indicted,
there will be no preliminary hearing, and that takes us to the
question of bail.  In that regard, I have received the Pretrial
Services report.  I have also received a letter from the
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 4 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300

government dated July 8, 2019.
I take it all counsel have the same documents? 
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  I will hear from the government first, and
then I will hear from defense counsel.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.  
The government intends to seek detention, and I am 
happy to explain the reasons why.  Would the court prefer that 
I speak from the table or from the podium? 
THE COURT:  Whatever your pleasure is.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, the defendant poses an
extraordinary risk of flight and danger presented by him.
Given the charges and the characteristics of the defendant, he
simply cannot reasonably be expected to appear in court if he
is granted bail.  Accordingly, the government joins the
recommendation of Pretrial Services that the defendant be
detained pending trial for a number of reasons.
Starting with the conduct alleged, the defendant is 
charged with trafficking minors for sex acts, as the court 
explained, in violation of 18 United States Code § 591, and is 
charged with a count of conspiracy to traffic minors for sex 
acts in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371.   
In particular, the indictment charges that the 
defendant engaged in a years-long scheme to sexually abuse 
underage girls, paying minor girls to themselves be abused, and

also paying certain victims to recruit other girls to be 
subject to the defendant's sexual abuse.   
The indictment alleges that the defendant undertook 
this conduct at at least two locations, including his mansion 
in Manhattan and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida.  In both 
locations, victims were initially recruited to provide massages 
to the defendant, which would be performed nude or partially 
nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would 
typically include one or more sex acts, including contact with 
the victims' genitals.  These victims, who were often 
particularly vulnerable, were as young as 14, and the defendant 
knew he was abusing underage girls.  The indictment further 
alleges that the defendant perpetrated these crimes by working 
with others, including employees and associates who facilitated 
these abusive encounters.   
Regarding the defendant himself, your Honor, he is 
extraordinarily wealthy, mobile, and unattached to the Southern 
District of New York.  He maintains at least six residences in 
the United States and abroad, including the ownership of a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and a residence in 
Paris, France.  Among other things, the defendant owns two 
private jets and routinely uses them to travel abroad.  He is a 
man of nearly infinite means, your Honor; and, as set forth in 
our submission, he has tremendous incentives to use those means 
to flee prosecution.

The government notes as an initial matter that this is
a presumption case because sex trafficking is charged; and,
moreover, each of the four factors to be considered in the
detention analysis strongly militates towards pretrial
detention.
So starting with the nature and seriousness of the
offense, as previously discussed, the nature and circumstances
of the crime are the most serious crime that this court sees.
The defendant is alleged to have spent years sexually abusing
minors in multiple locations and with dozens of victims.
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the 
potential penalties, which include up to 45 combined years of 
incarceration on Counts One and Two, and the likelihood of a 
substantial period of incarceration is supported by the fact 
that the government's evidence is strong.  There are multiple 
individual identified victims in the indictment, numerous 
specified overt acts, and dozens of overall victims alleged.   
In order to protect the privacy of the victims, your 
Honor, I'm not going to go into detail about particular 
victims, but we can say that information provided by victims 
has been detailed, it has been credible, and it has been 
corroborated by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents 
and records, including from a recent search of the defendant's 
Manhattan mansion, as I will discuss further in a moment. 
Separately, your Honor, in just the last 36 hours,
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 7 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
that is, post charge, we have been contacted by multiple
attorneys and several additional individuals who have
identified themselves as victims and are interested in speaking
with the government, none of whom the government has previously
spoken with.
Your Honor, the defendant is 66 years old.  He is 
charged with appalling crimes, and those charges are supported 
by significant evidence, including victim and witness testimony 
and damning record evidence.  He faces the very real prospect 
of spending the rest of his life in prison.  He has every 
motivation in the world to flee, and he has the means to do it.   
And I will note for the court that this is a case 
where the government has really put its money where its mouth 
is on the risk of flight.  This district took extraordinary 
efforts to maintain the covert status of its investigation for 
many months due to the risk of flight of the defendant -- not a 
single media report, not a single public statement, no appeals 
for victims to come forward because of precisely the flight 
risks we are discussing now.   
Turning to the characteristics of the defendant, your 
Honor, some individuals who face significant charges lack the 
means to flee.  Not this defendant.  As set forth in the 
government's submission, in the defendant's most recent sex 
offender registration, he lists six residences worth tens or 
hundreds of millions of dollars, including a residence abroad.   
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 8 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
The defendant has refused to answer any questions 
about his income or assets for the Pretrial Services report, so 
the scope of his wealth and his assets remains entirely 
concealed to the government and to the court.  But the 
defendant certainly has access to endless means to flee, 
including two private jets.  He has no meaningful family ties, 
and any argument that his properties would keep him in the 
United States ignores his ability to simply leave those 
properties behind in favor of moving beyond the reach of U.S. 
authorities to live off his extensive wealth abroad, extensive 
wealth, I should add, that the court doesn't even have any 
accounting of.  He travels abroad extensively, has a residence 
in France, and all of those factors further contribute to the 
risk of flight. 
With respect to danger and obstruction, again, this is
a presumption case, and not only is the defendant charged with
the sexual abuse of minors, he has previously pled guilty to
solicitation of an underage girl.  This court knows that
defendants are routinely detained in this district when facing
such charges and that this is not an unusual position for the
government to take.
It is further concerning that there are credible 
allegations from the prior investigation that the defendant or 
his agents engaged in witness tampering and harassment, and in 
fact there is evidence that he was contemplating pleading 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 9 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
guilty to that kind of offense in Florida.  Those allegations 
include verbal harassment, evasion of legal process, and 
forcing off the road the father of an individual relevant to 
that investigation. 
THE COURT:  Can you elaborate on that last point about
forcing somebody off the road?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, what we have is the
record evidence from an underlying civil dispute in Florida
that discusses this incident and discusses it in the context of
a potential plea of the defendant to obstruction or harassment
charges.  The government sets before this court that if the
defendant was willing to undertake such measure simply as a
result of an investigation, the potential for dangerous and
obstructive activity in an indicted case is alarming and very
real.
Despite having been previously convicted of a sex
offense involving an underage victim and being a registered sex
offender, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove
of lewd photography of young-looking women or girls at his
mansion.  Your Honor, pursuant to judicially authorized
warrants, law enforcement agents searched his home on Saturday
and found at least hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of sexually
suggestive photographs of nude females, many of whom appear to
be underage.  
I also want to note that the search revealed specific 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 10 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
evidence from his home consistent with victim accounts.  Even 
the room where the abuse occurred, your Honor, the massage 
room, was still set up in the same way it was 15 years ago, 
with a massage table and sex paraphernalia.   
And with respect to the photographs -- 
THE COURT:  When you say the evidence was consistent
with victim accounts, is it limited to the massage table and
massage room or is there something else?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Descriptions of the massage room and
the massage table, that's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  With respect to the photographs, your
Honor, some of those were found in a locked safe which also
held electronic disks with labels that included the words
"Young Miscellaneous Nudes 1" and "Girl Pics Nude."  
Your Honor, this is not an individual who has left his 
past behind.  He is a continuing danger to the community and an 
extraordinary risk of flight and, for those reasons, the 
government joins the pretrial recommendation that the defendant 
be detained pending trial. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Mr. Weingarten. 
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Thank you, your Honor.  I will use
the podium, if that's okay.
THE COURT:  That's fine.

j782epsC kjc
MR. WEINGARTEN:  So your Honor, I would like to start
by providing some context, and then I'm going to make a
suggestion as to how we proceed.
The beginning here is 2005 in Florida.  That's when an
allegation was received by the local police that Mr. Epstein
was engaged in sexual conduct for money, prostitution.
Thereafter, there was a very sophisticated three-year
investigation by law enforcement, including locals and feds,
into Mr. Epstein's conduct.  Numerous girls were interviewed,
employees were interviewed, and it is fair to say that a
significant segment of the law enforcement community in Florida
thought what we had in hand was simple prostitution.  There was
no coercion.  There were no threats.  There was no violence.
And it is also fair to say that a significant portion of the
law enforcement community in Florida believed that a local
misdemeanor was the appropriate sanction.
Now, it is also --
THE COURT:  Did you represent Mr. Epstein in the
Florida investigation?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  No, but I'm familiar with the
records.
THE COURT:  All right.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  It is also true that there was a
contrary view largely taken by the feds, and what ensued was a
complex set of discussions and negotiations and finally an
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 12 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
agreement, an agreement that was consummated and agreed to all
the way up to main justice at a very, very high level.
The agreement involved a plea in state court to 
soliciting an underaged girl, which would require registration, 
compensation paid to alleged victims, and an NPA from the feds, 
in other words, a declination by the federal government, an 
agreement that was approved all the way up in main justice and 
it sure seemed like a global solution at the time to everyone 
involved, including my client. 
What happened since then?  Mr. Epstein continued a
life of success, generosity, creativity and, more important, a
law-abiding life from 2008 forward.  How do we know?  Because
when you are in registration the way he is, every single night
his whereabouts are known.  There is constant reporting,
constant monitoring, and absolutely, to our knowledge, no
complaints by anybody from that moment forward about his
conduct until we have arrived in court here.
Now, what has happened in court from that moment?
There have been lawsuits, many of them ludicrous, dismissed out
of hand.  But when something like this happens, a lot of stuff
comes out of the woodwork, and there were lawsuits that
Mr. Epstein settled also in the normal course.
There was one particular litigation that leads to this 
occasion, and that is, under the Crime Victims Rights Act, that 
act simply says that victims have a right to be consulted by 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 13 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
the United States, and there are alleged victims in this case 
who complain that they were not, and there has been extensive 
litigation in the Southern District of Florida before      
Judge Marra on that very subject.  In fact, the judge concluded 
that the prosecutors from the Southern District of Florida did 
not adequately notify some of the victims about the ongoing 
discussions and the consummation of the deal and, in 
particular, the NPA.  The United States took the position that 
they had no responsibility to do so, that they had treated the 
victims properly, and that matter continues to this day. 
The consequences of that matter are overwhelming,
because the judge suggested, I think three times, that the NPA,
the declination, could be voided.  And we think about that for
a second.  So a defendant negotiates what he thinks is a global
solution with the feds.  He does his time --
THE COURT:  Does the nonprosecution agreement in
Florida -- the nonprosecution agreements in the Southern
District routinely say they are limited to the Southern
District of New York.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Obviously --
THE COURT:  Is there a similar provision in the
Florida agreement?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  I don't want to misstate.  It is not
before me.  It is obviously going to be an important part of
the pretrial motions.  What is for sure is that there was --
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 14 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
the negotiation with the Southern District included
negotiations with main justice.  What's also true is the
investigation extended into the Southern District of New York
and elsewhere in terms of girls being interviewed.
So obviously your question is relevant and will be 
part of the pretrial litigation for sure.  But what matters 
here and for now is there certainly was a belief that there was 
a global solution based upon the facts on the ground. 
THE COURT:  Have you seen the Florida nonprosecution
agreement?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.
THE COURT:  And --
MR. WEINGARTEN:  I don't have it before me.  I don't
want to make a specific representation and not be completely
accurate.
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  The consequences of this are huge in
that if in fact there is a negotiation with a defendant, the
defendant does his time, the defendant pays his victim, and the
defendant spends ten years on the registration list and
prosecutors don't adequately notify the victims, how in the
world can that deal be undone?  Every prosecutor in the world
has to oppose that possibility.  No defense attorney in their
right mind would negotiate a deal with that potential
consequence.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 15 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
So this is a huge problem for the department and what 
solution ensues, and I suggest the solution that ensued is this 
indictment.  To us, this indictment is essentially a do-over.  
The allegations are from 2002 to 2005.  This is old stuff.  
This is ancient stuff.  This is the very stuff that was 
investigated by the feds in Florida, a sophisticated three-year 
investigation.  Two of the alleged victims in this indictment 
are from Florida.  The indictment here tracks the conduct that 
was investigated in Florida back before the agreement was 
reached.  Obviously we need to get discovery to find out just 
how inextricably linked the investigation back in Florida is 
with what's going on here.  We do know we are talking about 
ancient conduct.  We do know we are talking about facts that 
are from 2002 to 2005, facts that were known to the United 
States prosecutors before they entered into the NPA, the 
declination.  This is essentially a redo.  That's how it feels 
to us.  And if we are correct, that should chill the blood of 
every defense attorney who negotiates a deal with the United 
States. 
In addition, we have -- the central allegation here is
trafficking, and obviously it is useful and relevant to make
inquiry as to why the trafficking law was passed.  It is to
cover abhorrent conduct, where young girls are kidnapped, they
are fooled, they are forced to come usually to unfamiliar
places, work in brothels where they service 15, 20 guys in a
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 16 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
day.  They can't leave or else their families are threatened.
This is dreadful conduct.
I remember an occasion when the Attorney General Eric 
Holder and I think Director Comey had a press conference 
establishing this as a law enforcement priority.  Every 
sensible person in the world would think that this is the exact 
right thing law enforcement should do.   
This is not this case.  There was no violence.  There 
was no coercion.  There was no intimidation.  There is no 
deception.  The bottom line, if you take a fair look at the 
facts of this case as alleged and in the record, you may come 
to the conclusion there was prostitution involved and maybe a 
lot of it, but that doesn't mean that the person involved is a 
pedophile, a rapist or, heaven knows, a trafficker.  Just -- 
THE COURT:  Well, if the women involved were under 18,
isn't that rape?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  My understanding --
THE COURT:  Legally they are incapable of consent, are
they not?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Well, it could be statutory rape.  
But what I am talking about is trafficking and why the 
statute was passed, and obviously the statute was passed to 
protect women from the horrors that occur in such settings, and 
that is light years removed to what happened in this case. 
So what about bond?  I would suggest that the
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 17 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
traditional issues that we look at, the issues involved, let's
start with that, we believe we have extremely powerful motions
relating to the government seeking two bites at the apple and
for due process reasons, double jeopardy reasons, we don't
think that will stand.  We also think fundamentally what's at
issue here is not trafficking.  That's not why the statute was
passed.
The risk to others, what we have here is at least ten
years post incarceration in the State of Florida of conduct
that has never been challenged by anyone until now.  The
registration requirements are onerous.  He is under constant
surveillance.  Law enforcement knows, if they choose to look,
exactly where he is at any time.
The risk of flight, what is true is from the moment of 
Judge Marra's litigation in the Southern District of Florida, 
the defendant knew that there would be challenges to the NPA.  
From 2013 on, there were representations made in court that 
that challenge was ongoing, and the defendant never sought to 
flee, never anticipated a time when he would flee, continued to 
live his law-abiding life.  So the risk of flight, I think, is 
dramatically overstated in the government's presentation.   
I think the traditional remedies that the court finds 
appropriate in case after case -- a large cash bond; passport 
relinquished; waiving extradition; a bracelet on; some form of 
supervision that is adequate to guarantee his appearance, it 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 18 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
will be child's play to find that; bonds from other people, 
surety bonds from other people.   
Because we have not had an opportunity to see our 
client until today and because we have just received the 
government's submission, what we would like to do is have the 
opportunity to sit down and put together a bail package, a 
coherent bail package in writing and provide it to the court.   
I would point out on the obstruction allegation -- 
THE COURT:  Let me ask you this -- sorry to interrupt
you -- do you want to adjourn the detention hearing?  Under the
statute, you have up to three days.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  What I would like is to have until
the end of the week to provide something in writing, a specific
recommendation in writing.
THE COURT:  So you want to adjourn a determination of
bail?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.
THE COURT:  Is there any objection to that from the
government?  The defendant is detained in the interim under
3142(f).
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Right.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, we certainly don't object
if the defendant is consenting to detention with leave to make
a further application.
I think the government would like at least a brief 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 19 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
opportunity to respond to some of those points, to the extent 
that the defense is arguing that Mr. Epstein should be granted 
bail as a general matter and the court is going to consider 
those arguments. 
THE COURT:  Well, the court always considers the
parties' arguments.  
But let me just come back to Mr. Weingarten for a 
minute.  Mr. Weingarten, under the Bail Reform Act you are 
entitled to a continuance of three days, which I guess would 
take us to Thursday. 
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Right.
THE COURT:  The other alternative, I guess, if you
want to de facto extend that three days is consent to detention
without prejudice.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  We estimated that by Thursday we
could get you something in writing and then appear back before
you at your convenience.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Do you want to schedule it -- well,
I think Thursday's proceedings right now would be in front of
Judge Berman unless he wants to send it back to me for bail,
but do you want to put this down for detention hearing on
Thursday?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Can I make one point that I don't
want to forget that I think is extremely important?
THE COURT:  Go ahead.

j782epsC kjc
MR. WEINGARTEN:  The last thing we did today was
refuse to answer questions.  What we said at Pretrial is heaven
forbid we make a mistake, and in terms of assets, we wanted to
be precise.  So there was no refusal.  There was a request for
time to supplement.  That was accepted.  And that's part of the
reason we want to sit down and make sure we get our information
correct to provide to the court.
THE COURT:  All right.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Can I make one other point?
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  In terms of the obstruction, I think
it is such a significant part of our argument that the conduct
at issue is ancient.  It is from 2002 to 2005.  So obviously if
the defendant is a threat to obstruct justice, the court needs
to take that into account.  The allegations raised -- and I
just read them briefly because we just got the government's
letter -- relate to negotiations between the feds and the
defendant.  Back when the Southern District of Florida was
attempting to find an appropriate remedy, there were
discussions going back and forth:  Can we squeeze you into this
statute?  And it didn't work, and it didn't work because there
is no factual basis.  That is the reference to the alleged
obstruction.  Not obstructive acts.  Instead, the feds in
Florida agreed to the plea to the state offense because there
was no appropriate statute that covered conduct that was
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 21 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
proveable.  That is the answer to the obstruction issue.
THE COURT:  All right.  So you want to adjourn the
detention hearing until Thursday?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.
THE COURT:  All right.  Is there any objection to that
from the government?  I think under the statute he is entitled
to three days.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  That is, of course, fine, your Honor.  
I think we would like just a very brief opportunity to 
respond to some of those arguments so that they don't sort of 
hang with the court for three days unresponded to. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Just very briefly, your Honor, I
think a lot of that discussion was entirely orthogonal to the
issues here.  
But just very briefly, with respect to the charges 
here, there is simply no force required for underage victims.  
A grand jury has properly returned an indictment, and these are 
fact issues that are being presented in large part.   
Certainly the concept of child prostitution is, 
frankly, offensive and not recognized in federal law.  The idea 
that children can consent to sex and be prostitutes is beyond 
the realm of federal law which contemplates trafficking, which 
is what has been charged here.  Mr. Weingarten is free to argue 
to a jury that trafficking minors was only statutory rape or 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 20     Filed 07/16/19     Page 22 of 24

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j782epsC kjc
that those victims weren't treated as badly as the parade of 
horribles he has in mind.  But for now the question is whether 
the defendant's attendance can be assured.   
And with respect to the nonprosecution agreement -- 
THE COURT:  I'm not sure I would refer to something as
only statutory rape.  The use of the word "only" before
"statutory rape" I'm not sure sits well.  But go ahead.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  And I agree, your Honor.
With respect to the actual substance, the Southern
District of Florida has represented in public filings that the
nonprosecution agreement was limited to the Southern District
of Florida, and we can litigate that in a motion to dismiss,
but it is simply not relevant here.
With respect to the statute of limitations, 
Mr. Weingarten says that the conduct is old.  He did not say 
that that it is beyond the statute of limitations because it is 
not.   
And, finally, it is not the same conduct.  Some of the 
conduct overlaps.  Some of the conduct does not.  And in 
particular, one of the two counts of the indictment is 
predicated exclusively on New York victims.   
So for all of those reasons, we just ask the court to 
consider those responses as it awaits the defendant's filings 
later this week. 
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Can I just make one point to clarify?

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300

THE COURT:  Go ahead.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  On the statutory rape thing, I had a
senior moment.  There is no statutory rape because there is no
penetration, and that is the answer to that question.
THE COURT:  All right.
We will set this down for a detention hearing on
Thursday, July 11, for the continuation of the detention
hearing.  Thursday, July 11, at 2 p.m.
The defendant is detained at least until the 
continuation of the detention hearing pursuant to 18 United 
States Code 3142(f).   
I have been advised by Judge Berman that he wants to 
see counsel right after these proceedings.  Judge Berman's 
courtroom is 17B.  So counsel and Mr. Epstein should go to 17B.   
All right.  Anything else from the government? 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, ordinarily we would ask
to exclude speedy trial time, but I think because we are going
directly to Judge Berman, we have no such application.
THE COURT:  Mr. Weingarten, anything else?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  No, thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Mr. Weingarten, anything else?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you all.

New York, NY 10007 
Re: US v. Epstein, 19 CR 490 (SDNY) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
In response to requests from the Court and certain arguments made 
yesterday by the government, we write to supplement Jeffrey Epstein’s 
request for bail.   
First, make no mistake about the crux of the government’s 
detention argument and its necessary implications. Stripped to its core, 
the government’s position – as urged in its letters and echoed again 
yesterday – distills to this: the nominally rebuttable remand 
presumption (connected with 18 USC § 1591 charges) 1  plus Mr. 
To be clear, Epstein contends that § 1591 and the concomitant remand presumption 
do not contemplate or cover the core conduct at issue here: performing sexual 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 22     Filed 07/16/19     Page 1 of 9

Hon. Richard M. Berman 
July 16, 2019 
Page 2 
Epstein’s wealth creates an irrebuttable presumption whereby no 
condition(s) can reasonably assure personal appearance or protect the 
public. The Court should reject the government’s misguided effort to 
effectively create a per se rule.2 Indeed, for the government, there’s 
literally nothing a person of Epstein’s means could say, do or pledge to 
rebut the operative presumption and make himself eligible for release. 
That cannot be the law. Such a construction turns the statute’s 
massages for money. See Fierro v. Taylor, No. 11-CV8573, 2012 WL 13042630, at *3 
(SDNY July 2, 2012) (holding that sex purchasers from minors fall outside § 1591’s 
ambit). 
E.g., 7/15/19 Tr. 11 (“even if the defense were able at some point to rebut the 
presumption by providing some more information, there simply is no way that they 
can meet the standard here”); 7/12/19 Ltr. 5 (“even assuming the defendant’s assets 
are presently in the United States, nothing … would prevent the defendant from 
transferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or 
relocation. The defendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades 
of experience in the industry and significant ties to financial institutions and actors 
around the world. He could easily transfer funds and holdings on a moment’s [notice] 
to places where the [g]overnment would never find them so as to ensure he could live 
comfortably while a fugitive.”); id. (“even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all 
of his current assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to 
resume making … tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States…. 
[T]here would be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown 
assets abroad, and then continuing to … earn his vast wealth from a computer 
terminal beyond the reach of extradition.”) (footnote omitted); id. 7 (“the notion that 
any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for this defendant strains 
credulity”). 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 22     Filed 07/16/19     Page 2 of 9

Hon. Richard M. Berman

Page 3 
plain text – expressly providing that the presumption is “[s]ubject to 
rebuttal,” and otherwise mandating bail on the “least restrictive” 
conditions that reasonably assure the defendant’s presence and 
community safety – on its head. It defies legislative intent. It thwarts the 
presumption of innocence. And it violates the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
amendment rights to due process, counsel, a defense and equal 
protection, not to mention the Eighth Amendment guarantee of bail – all 
based on a suspect if not invidious classification. To be sure, wealthy 
defendants do not deserve preferential treatment. But they certainly 
shouldn’t be singled out for worse treatment – in effect, categorically 
disqualified from bail, at least in a presumption case – on the basis of 
their net worth. 
Second, it bears emphasis that the presumption is hardly an 
insurmountable bar to release in a § 1591 prosecution.3  To the contrary, 
courts have determined that there are suitable conditions under which 
E.g., US v. Brinson, No. 13-CR-04-GKF, 2013 WL 11305792 (N.D. Okla. Feb. 8, 
2013); US v. Afyare, No. 3:10-cr-00260, 2011 WL 1397820 (M.D. Tenn. April 13, 2011); 
US v. Gardner, 523 F. Supp. 2d 1025 (N.D. Cal. 2007).

Hon. Richard M. Berman

Page 4 
defendants accused of trafficking minors are bailed – notwithstanding 
the remand presumption. 
Third, as apparent from Mr. Epstein’s initial financial disclosure, 
Mr. Epstein’s finances are fairly complex. It would be impossible for Mr. 
Epstein – given, among other impediments, his detention, inability to 
quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly make a precise 
valuation of particular assets – to provide a sufficient financial statement 
by the Court’s 5pm deadline. Mr. Epstein certainly recognizes the Court’s 
request for further transparency and is committed to providing a 
complete and accurate disclosure. Accordingly, we propose that the Court 
preliminarily accept the initial disclosure proffered last Friday and, if 
intending to grant bail, include a release condition directing Mr. Epstein 
to tender a comprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as 
expeditiously as practicable. Joel Podgor, Partner Emeritus at prominent 
Manhattan accounting firm Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, has 
agreed to conduct the forensic investigation and prepare a report rapidly. 
As counsel said during the July 15 argument, Epstein will agree to any 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 22     Filed 07/16/19     Page 4 of 9

Hon. Richard M. Berman

monetary condition – consistent with his Sixth Amendment need to 
retain counsel and pay ordinary expenses, which, at the Court’s 
discretion, could be subject to supervision by a Court-appointed trustee – 
that collateralizes his assets as a condition of release. 
Fourth, to the extent the government complains Epstein lacks 
meaningful domestic ties, we clarify and emphasize that his brother 
Mark, a U.S. resident, stands prepared to co-sign and secure a release 
bond in the full amount of his “own net worth,”4 which exceeds $100 
million – tangible proof of his certainty that Epstein will appear as 
necessary. 
Fifth, in response to the Court’s inquiry about Epstein’s New 
Mexico registration status, the state’s Public Safety Department formally 
advised in August 2010 that “you are not required to register with the 
State of New Mexico … for your 2008 Florida conviction of Procuring 
Person Under 18 for Prostitution.” Nonetheless, in an abundance of 
caution and as an extra precaution, Epstein consistently notified the 
7/12/19 Ltr. 6 (footnote omitted).

appropriate New Mexico official, Detective Deborah Anaya, when he 
spent any time at his ranch there. (The underlying documents are 
available upon request.) 
Sixth, though some studies may well indicate that sex offender 
recidivism rates “actually go[] up at 15 years,” as Your Honor suggested 
from the bench,5 others reach the opposite conclusion. For example, a 
respected study found that the relapse risk drops substantially the longer 
a person remains sex-offense free in the community. 6  Another 
determined that it’s mistaken to think of anyone who’s been offense-free 
for 15 years as high-risk.7  
Seventh, to the extent third-party counsel (Mr. Boies) speculated 
that the alleged November 28 and December 3, 2018 payments8 were 
7/15/19 Tr. 34.

made to “witnesses who were cooperating with us”9 in civil litigation, he  
is wrong. As explained in Court, the recipients were “long-time [Epstein] 
friends and employees” 10  – not putative victims – and they never 
cooperated with Mr. Boies. To the contrary, each invoked the Fifth 
Amendment and refused to testify when civilly deposed, respectively, in 
prior New York federal and Florida state civil proceedings. Subject to the 
protective orders in these proceedings, we would be pleased to provide 
relevant deposition transcripts.

certainly no evidence – that Epstein ever used it. In any case, Epstein – 
an affluent member of the Jewish faith – acquired the passport in the

Ninth, the Court is undoubtedly aware of the highly charged 
context surrounding this prosecution. In November 2018, media reports 
suggested that Epstein received a plea deal that amounted to a “slap on 
the wrist.” Putting aside the robust negotiations leading to the non-
prosecution agreement (NPA) and the prison sentence that Epstein 
completed, there can be no dispute that certain witnesses through their 
attorney representatives,11 the media – e.g., The Miami Herald – and 
the public were all clamoring for his re-prosecution, Epstein traveled 
extensively over these eight months and invariably returned to the 
United States. That inescapable reality emphatically proves he won’t flee 
and entitles him to release – on any and all conditions the Court deems 
appropriate.

REQUEST TO FILE PARTIALLY   
UNDER SEAL 
The Honorable Richard M. Berman  
United States District Judge 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
500 Pearl Street 
New York, New York 10007 
Re:  
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide the Court with additional 
information in response to the Court’s questions at the detention hearing held on July 15, 2019 
(the “Detention Hearing”).   
I. Payments to Potential Witnesses1  
In a July 12, 2019 letter, the Government informed the Court that the Government had 
recently obtained records from a financial institution (“Institution-1”) that appeared to show the 
defendant had made suspicious payments shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing, on 
approximately November 28, 2018, a series of articles relating to the defendant, his alleged sexual 
misconduct, and the circumstances under which he entered into a non-prosecution agreement 
(“NPA”) with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2007.  The same 
series highlighted the involvement of several of Epstein’s former employees and associates in the 
alleged sexual abuse.  At the Detention Hearing, the Court asked the Government to provide 
additional information about the individuals to whom these payments appear to have been made.  
First, records from Institution-1 show that on or about November 30, 2018, or two days 
after the series in the Miami Herald began, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he 
controlled to 
, an individual named as 
a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein obtained protection in—the NPA.  This 
individual was also named and featured prominently in the Herald series.  
Second, the same records show that just three days later, on or about December 3, 2018, 
the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to 
, who was 
For the reasons set forth at the Detention Hearing, and with the consent of the Court, the 
Government is redacting the identities of these individuals in the publicly filed version of this 
letter.

also named as a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein also obtained protection in—the 
NPA.  This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that 
she and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant’s trafficking of minors by, among 
other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his 
residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.  This individual was also named and featured 
prominently in the Herald series. 
II. Police Report 
During the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach 
police report, which was annexed to the Government’s July 12, 2019 detention memorandum.  At 
the Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report 
previously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted.  The updated copy of the 
police report is attached as Exhibit A.  
III. Foreign Passport 
During the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently 
learned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the 
“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhattan residence during the execution of a 
search warrant on or about July 6, 2019.  The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to 
depict the defendant, but lists a different name.  Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto 
as Exhibit B.  In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States 
passport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign 
Passport.  A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the 
Court may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant.  Because Exhibits 
B and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the 
ongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under 
seal.  
The Government is attempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport, 
including how it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated.  But the 
defendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to 
the inference the defendant knows how to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other, 
foreign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.2 
The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has 
been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States.  To 
date, defense counsel has declined to respond.  Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen 
or permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming 
evidence of risk of flight.

IV. Cash and Diamonds  
At the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash 
were seized from a safe in the defendant’s Manhattan residence.  The Court inquired as to the value 
of these items.  After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials 
from the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $70,000 in cash.  In 
addition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately 1 carat 
to 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring.  The Government is currently unaware of whether 
the defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other 
locations.  Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the 
jurisdiction at a moment’s notice.  
V. Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2019 and July 12, 2019 
detention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the 
defendant be detained pending trial.  The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.

Re: US v. Epstein, 19 CR 490 (SDNY) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
In response to requests from the Court and certain arguments made 
yesterday by the government, we write to supplement Jeffrey Epstein’s 
request for bail.   
First, make no mistake about the crux of the government’s 
detention argument and its necessary implications. Stripped to its core, 
the government’s position – as urged in its letters and echoed again 
yesterday – distills to this: the nominally rebuttable remand 
presumption (connected with 18 USC § 1591 charges)1 plus Epstein’s 
To be clear, Epstein contends that § 1591 and the concomitant remand presumption 
do not contemplate or cover the core conduct at issue here: performing sexual

Hon. Richard M. Berman

Page 2 
wealth creates an irrebuttable presumption whereby no condition(s) can 
reasonably assure personal appearance or protect the public. The Court 
should reject the government’s misguided effort to effectively create a per 
se rule.2 Indeed, for the government, there’s literally nothing a person of 
Epstein’s means could say, do or pledge to rebut the operative 
presumption and make himself eligible for release. 
massages for money. See Fierro v. Taylor, No. 11-CV8573, 2012 WL 13042630, at *3 
(SDNY July 2, 2012) (holding that purchasers of sex from minors fall outside § 1591’s 
ambit). 
E.g., 7/15/19 Tr. 11 (“even if the defense were able at some point to rebut the 
presumption by providing some more information, there simply is no way that they 
can meet the standard here”); 7/12/19 Ltr. 5 (“even assuming the defendant’s assets 
are presently in the United States, nothing … would prevent the defendant from 
transferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or 
relocation. The defendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades 
of experience in the industry and significant ties to financial institutions and actors 
around the world. He could easily transfer funds and holdings on a moment’s [notice] 
to places where the [g]overnment would never find them so as to ensure he could live 
comfortably while a fugitive.”); id. (“even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all 
of his current assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to 
resume making … tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States…. 
[T]here would be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown 
assets abroad, and then continuing to … earn his vast wealth from a computer 
terminal beyond the reach of extradition.”) (footnote omitted); id. 7 (“the notion that 
any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for this defendant strains 
credulity”). 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 24     Filed 07/16/19     Page 2 of 9

Hon. Richard M. Berman 
July 16, 2019 
Page 3 
That cannot be the law. Such a construction turns the statute’s 
plain text – expressly providing that the presumption is “[s]ubject to 
rebuttal,” and otherwise mandating bail on the “least restrictive” 
conditions that reasonably assure the defendant’s presence and 
community safety – on its head. It defies legislative intent. It thwarts the 
presumption of innocence. And it violates the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
amendment rights to due process, counsel, a defense and equal 
protection, not to mention the Eighth Amendment guarantee of bail – all 
based on a suspect if not invidious classification. To be sure, wealthy 
defendants do not deserve preferential treatment. But they certainly 
shouldn’t be singled out for worse treatment – in effect, categorically 
disqualified from bail, at least in a presumption case – on the basis of 
their net worth. 
Second, it bears emphasis that the presumption is hardly an 
insurmountable bar to release in a § 1591 prosecution.3 To the contrary, 
E.g., US v. Brinson, No. 13-CR-04-GKF, 2013 WL 11305792 (N.D. Okla. Feb. 8, 
2013); US v. Afyare, No. 3:10-cr-00260, 2011 WL 1397820 (M.D. Tenn. April 13, 2011); 
US v. Gardner, 523 F. Supp. 2d 1025 (N.D. Cal. 2007).

Hon. Richard M. Berman 
July 16, 2019 
Page 4 
courts have determined that there are suitable conditions under which 
defendants accused of trafficking minors are bailed – notwithstanding 
the remand presumption. 
Third, as apparent from Epstein’s initial financial disclosure, his 
finances are fairly complex. It would be impossible for Epstein – given, 
among other impediments, his detention, inability to quickly access 
pertinent records, and inability to quickly make a precise valuation of 
particular assets – to provide a sufficient financial statement by the 
Court’s 5 pm deadline. Epstein certainly recognizes the Court’s request 
for further transparency and is committed to providing a complete and 
accurate disclosure. Accordingly, we propose that the Court preliminarily 
accept the initial disclosure proffered last Friday and, if intending to 
grant bail, include a release condition directing Epstein to tender a 
comprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as expeditiously as 
practicable. Joel Podgor, Partner Emeritus at prominent Manhattan 
accounting firm Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, has agreed to conduct 
the forensic investigation and prepare a report rapidly. As counsel said 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 24     Filed 07/16/19     Page 4 of 9

Hon. Richard M. Berman 
July 16, 2019 
Page 5 
during the July 15 argument, Epstein will agree to any monetary 
condition – consistent with his Sixth Amendment need to retain counsel 
and pay ordinary expenses, which, at the Court’s discretion, could be 
subject to supervision by a Court-appointed trustee – that collateralizes 
his assets as a condition of release. 
Fourth, to the extent the government complains Epstein lacks 
meaningful domestic ties, we clarify and emphasize that his brother 
Mark, a U.S. resident, stands prepared to co-sign and secure a release 
bond in the full amount of his “own net worth,”4 which exceeds $100 
million – tangible proof of his certainty that Epstein will appear as 
necessary. 
Fifth, in response to the Court’s inquiry about Epstein’s New 
Mexico registration status, the state’s Public Safety Department formally 
advised in August 2010 that “you are not required to register with the 
State of New Mexico … for your 2008 Florida conviction of Procuring 
Person Under 18 for Prostitution.” Nonetheless, in an abundance of 
7/12/19 Ltr. 6 (footnote omitted).

Page 6 
caution and as an extra precaution, Epstein consistently notified the 
appropriate New Mexico official, Detective Deborah Anaya, when he 
spent any time at his residence there. (The underlying documents are 
available upon request.) 
Sixth, though some studies may well indicate that sex offender 
recidivism rates “actually go[] up at 15 years,” as Your Honor suggested 
from the bench,5 others reach the opposite conclusion. For example, a 
respected study found that the relapse risk drops substantially the longer 
a person remains sex-offense free in the community. 6  Another 
determined that it’s mistaken to think of anyone who’s been offense-free 
for 15 years as high-risk.7

Seventh, to the extent third-party counsel (Mr. Boies) speculated 
that the November 28 and December 3, 2018 payments8 were made to 
“witnesses who were cooperating with us”9 in civil litigation, he is wrong. 
As explained in Court, the recipients were “long-time [Epstein] friends 
and employees”10 – not putative victims – and they never cooperated 
with Mr. Boies. To the contrary, each invoked the Fifth Amendment and 
refused to testify when civilly deposed, respectively, in prior New York 
federal and Florida state civil proceedings. Subject to the protective 
orders in these proceedings, we would be pleased to provide relevant 
deposition transcripts.   
Eighth, as for the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it 
expired 32 years ago. And the government offers nothing to suggest – and 
certainly no evidence – that Epstein ever used it. In any case, Epstein – 
an affluent member of the Jewish faith – acquired the passport in the 
7/12/19 Ltr. 11.

1980s, when hijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East 
travel. The passport was for personal protection in the event of travel to 
dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers, hijackers 
or terrorists should violent episodes occur.  
Ninth, the Court is undoubtedly aware of the highly charged 
context surrounding this prosecution. In November 2018, media reports 
suggested that Epstein received a plea deal that amounted to a “slap on 
the wrist.” Putting aside the robust negotiations leading to the non-

there’s no denying that although certain witnesses through their 
attorney representatives,11 the media – e.g., The Miami Herald – and the 
public were all clamoring for his re-prosecution, Epstein traveled 
extensively over these eight months and invariably returned to the 
United States. That inescapable reality emphatically proves he won’t flee 
and entitles him to release – on any and all conditions the Court deems 
appropriate.

Re:  
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to briefly respond to one aspect of the 
defendant’s July 16, 2019 letter (ECF No. 24), and to provide the Court with additional information 
regarding the defendant’s foreign passport.  The defendant’s July 16, 2019 letter asserts: “[A]s for 
the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it expired 32 years ago. And the government offers 
nothing to suggest—and certainly no evidence—that Epstein ever used it.” (ECF No. 24 at 7).  In 
fact, the passport contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use 
of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s.   
The Government further notes that the defendant’s submission does not address how the 
defendant obtained the foreign passport and, more concerning, the defendant has still not disclosed 
to the Court whether he is a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United 
States.

Re: 
US v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 CR 490 (SDNY) (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
Jeffrey Epstein replies to yesterday’s government letter. 
Epstein was given the passport at issue by a friend. Some Jewish-Americans were informally 
advised at the time to carry identification bearing a non-Jewish name when traveling internationally in 
case of hijacking. He never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any 
immigration or customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do 
not reflect Mr. Epstein’s entries or exits. His expired US passports, seized by the government and in 
its possession, would verify his true travel. The defense has asked the government to bring the original 
document to court for examination and inspection. 
As Mr. Epstein truthfully reported in his Pretrial Services interview, he is a life-long American 
citizen. He has no other citizenship or legal permanent residency. 
Respectfully,

Draft Agreements? 
Hi Jay 
I was hoping there would be things for me to read this moming, but I will try to remain patient. 
I believe there are only two types of agreements that would apply to this case: ( 1) a plea agreement to a federal 
charge or charges; and (2) a non-prosecution agreement (which is really a deferred prosecution agreement 
because the defendant agrees that if he violates the agreement, the U.S. can prosecute him). 
A plea agreement is part of the court file. It is not accessible on-line via PACER, but someone can go to the 
Clerk's Office to obtain a copy. 
A non-prosecution agreement would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our 
case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would distribute 
without compulsory process. 
On the obstruction charges, many of the facts I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our 
discussions and the agents' observations of•••■ We will need to interview her to confirm the accuracy of 
those facts. On a second count, we could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private investigators 
followed-father, forcing him off the road. Or, if there is something more recent related to any -
• 
we could consider that 
ope that helps.

CR. 490 (RMB) 
DECISION & ORDER 
REMANDING DEFENDANT 
This ruling follows the Court's bail hearing held on July 15, 2019. The issue before the 
Court is whether the Defendant should continue to be remanded (incarcerated) pending trial or 
whether he should be granted release while the case proceeds. No matter the answer to this 
question and no matter what has been said in Court in analyzing the matter, this is a criminal 
case and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is innocent of the Federal charges alleged against him 
now and until such time, if it comes, that a jury or the Court finds ( after fair and thorough 
consideration of the facts and the law) that he is guilty. 
Transcript, dated July 8, 2019 
("7/8/19 Tr."), at 2-3; Transcript, dated July 15, 2019 ("7/15/19 Tr."), at 40. It should also be 
borne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the 
Indictment. 
This is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal 
rules. The key federal statute that applies here is 18 U.S.C. § 1591 which sets forth the crime of 
sex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged ,vith conspiring 
with others to commit sex trafficking under 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
With respect to the issue of remand versus release, 18 U.S.C. § 3142 applies. It sets forth 
a presumption in favor of remand, an exception to the presumption in most cases which favors 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 2 of 33
pretrial release. § 3142 states that: "if there is probable cause to believe that the person 
committed ... an offense involving a minor victim under section ... 1591," then "it shall be 
presumed that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the person as required and the safety of the community." 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(e)(3)(E) (emphasis added); 
United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 (2d Cir. 
1986). The Indictment in this case was returned by a grand jury thus establishing probable cause 
that the defendant committed the crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. See 
United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 51, 55 (2d Cir. 1985) ("[A]n indictment returned by a duly 
constituted grand jury conclusively establishes the existence of probable cause for the purpose of 
triggering the rebuttable presumptions set forth in § 3142( e )"). In most federal cases the 
rebuttable presumption that applies favors pretrial release, not remand. 
There is another very important issue to be considered in this case. It has to do with 
"victims" of the crimes charged in the Indictment. Victims refer to the "minor" girls who are 
alleged to have been sexually trafficked by the Defendant. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3771, victims are 
entitled to be heard in court, including on the question of whether the defendant is to be released 
or remanded. Victims have, among other things, been given the opportunity to testify at the bail 
hearing. 
B. Counsels' Submissions 
The Government's letter application, dated July 8, 2019, requests that the Court remand 
Mr. Epstein. It argues that Mr. Epstein "poses [] an acute danger to the community" and, 
grounded in past experience with this Defendant, that "if [Mr. Epstein is] allowed to remain out 
on bail, the defendant could attempt to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses 
in this case, including victims and their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice." Dkt. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 3 of 33
11, Ex. I at 1. The Government also contends that "[i]n light of the strength of the Government's 
evidence and the substantial incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction [45 
years], there is an extraordinary risk of flight, particularly given the defendant's exorbitant 
wealth, his ownership of and access to private planes capable of international travel, and his 
significant international ties." Id. 
The Government also provides the following background information: "In or about 2005, 
the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in connection with 
allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls. The investigation 
ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of Florida and the FBI' s Miami Office, and included interviews with victims based in the 
Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count One of the instant 
Indictment. In the fall of 2007, the Defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement ("NPA") 
with the Southern District of Florida in connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, 
which the non-prosecution agreement identified as including investigations into the defendant's 
abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach area." Id. at 3. "In June 2008, the defendant pied guilty in 
[Florida] state court to one count of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a 
felony, and one count of solicitation of prostitution, [also] a felony. As a result, the defendant 
was designated as a sex offender with registration requirements under the national Sex Offender 
Registration and Notification Act." Id. 
The Defense moved on July 11, 2019, for pretrial release of Mr. Epstein, arguing that 
"Mr. Epstein's strict compliance with the various monitoring requirements associated with his 
sex-offender registration actually decrease[s] any danger that he might otherwise pose" and also 
that "Mr. Epstein has never once attempted to flee the United States." Dkt. 6 at 1, 12. The 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 4 of 33
Defense proposes what they describe as "a stringent set of [14] conditions that will effectively 
guarantee [Mr. Epstein's] appearance and abate any conceivable danger he's claimed to present." 
Id. at 1. The 14 conditions do not include private security guards 24/7. The 14 conditions do 
include: (1) "Home detention in Mr. Epstein's Manhattan residence, with permission to leave 
only for medical appointments as approved by Pretrial Services, including (at the Court's 
discretion) the installation of surveillance cameras at the front and rear entrances to ensure 
compliance"; (2) "Electronic monitoring with a Global Positioning System"; (3) "An agreement 
not to seek or obtain any new passport during the pendency of this matter"; (4) "Consent to U.S. 
extradition from any country and waiver of all rights against such [e]xtradition"; (5) "A 
substantial [unspecified] personal recognizance bond in an an1ount set by the Court after 
reviewing additional information regarding Mr. Epstein's finances .... "; (6) "The bond shall be 
secured by a mortgage on the Manhattan residence, valued at roughly $77 million. Mr. Epstein's 
private jet can be pledged as further collateral"; (7) "Mr. Epstein's brother Mark will serve as a 
co-surety of the bond, which shall be further secured by a mortgage on Mark's home in West 
Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Epstein's friend David Mitchell will also serve as a co-surety and 
pledge his investment interests in two properties to secure the bond"; (8) "Mr. Epstein shall 
deregister or otherwise ground his private jet"; (9) Mr. Epstein "shall demobilize, ground, and/or 
deregister all vehicles or any other means of transportation in the New York area, providing 
particularized information as to each vehicle's location;" (10) "Mr. Epstein will provide Pretrial 
Services and/or the government random access to his residence"; (11) "No person shall enter the 
residence, other than Mr. Epstein and his attorneys, without prior approval from Pretrial Services 
and/or the Court"; (12) "Mr. Epstein will report daily by telephone to Pretrial Services (or on any 
other schedule the Court deems appropriate)"; (13) "A Trustee or Trustees will be appointed to 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 5 of 33
live in Mr. Epstein's residence and report any violation to Pretrial Services and/or the Court"; 
(14) "Any other condition the Court deems necessary to reasonably assure Mr. Epstein's 
appearance." Id. at 3-4. The Defense also proposes as a "fallback" "round-the-clock, privately 
funded security guards [which] will virtually guarantee - not just reasonably assure - Mr. 
Epstein's presence in the circumstances of this case." Id. at 10. The bail package originally was 
not accompanied by a financial statement reflecting Mr. Epstein's finances. However, on July 
12, 2019, the Defense filed a one-page document which includes five groups of assets owned by 
Mr. Epstein totaling $559,120,954. Dkt. 14 at 18. 
The Government responded to the Defense motion on July 12, 2019, arguing, among 
other things, that Mr. Epstein "has a history of obstruction and manipulation of witnesses, 
including ... as recently as within the past year, when media reports about his conduct [in 
Florida] reemerged." Dkt. 11 at 1. The Government filing was made against a "backdrop of 
significant-and rapidly-expanding--evidence, serious charges, and the prospect of a lengthy 
prison sentence." Id. It contends that the defendant's proposed conditions of release are 
"woefully inadequate." 
The Court also received a letter from the Government, dated July 16, 2019, providing, 
among other things, details about allegedly suspicious payments made by the Defendant in 2018; 
a Palm Beach, Florida police report; Mr. Epstein's expired Austrian passport in another name but 
with Mr. Epstein's photo; and a pile of cash and diamonds found in Mr. Epstein's safe. For 
example, the Government says: "[R]ecords from Institution-I show that on or about November 
30, 2018, or two days after the series in the Miami Herald began, the defendant wired $100,000 
from a trust account he controlled to ... , an individual named as a potential co-conspirator." 
Dkt. 23 at 1. And, "on or about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from the same 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 6 of 33
trust account to ... , [an individual] who was also named as a potential co-conspirator." Id. at 1-
2. According to the Government, the second individual "is also one of the employees identified 
in the Indictment, which alleges that she and two other identified employees facilitated the 
defendant's trafficking of minors by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their 
sexual encounters with the defendant at his residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida." 
Id. at 2. 
By letter, dated July 16, 2019, Defense counsel states, among other things, that the Court 
should reject the idea that "there's literally nothing a person of Epstein's means could say, do or 
pledge to rebut the operative presumption and make himself eligible for release." Dkt. 24 at 2. 
"Epstein contends that§ 1591 and the concomitant remand presumption do not contemplate or 
cover the core conduct at issue here: performing sexual massages for money." Id. at 1-2 n.l. 
Defense counsel also states that "Epstein certainly recognizes the Court's request for further 
transparency and is committed to providing a complete and accurate disclosure. Accordingly, 
we propose that the Court preliminarily accept the initial [financial] disclosure proffered last 
Friday and, if intending to grant bail, include a release condition directing Epstein to tender a 
comprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as expeditiously as practicable." Id. at 4. By 
letters, dated July 16 and July 17, 2019, Defense counsel also submitted information regarding 
Epstein's New Mexico sex offender registration status. Defense counsel also stated that Epstein 
traveled extensively over the last eight months and "invariably returned to the to the United 
States. That inescapable reality emphatically proves he won't flee and entitles him to release -
on any and all conditions the Court deems appropriate." Id. at 8. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 7 of 33
C. Indictment 
A grand jury voted to indict Mr. Epstein on or about July 2, 2019. The Indictment 
charges Mr. Epstein with two felonies involving minor girls some as young as 14. Count I 
includes conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minor girls, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and 
Count II includes sex trafficking of minor girls, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. It states: 
"[F]rom at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, Jeffrey Epstein, . 
. . enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion 
in Manhattan, New York ... and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, ... to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash." Indictment, dated July 
2, 2019 ("Indictment"), , 2. "Moreover, and in order to maintain, and increase his supply of 
victims, Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused 
by Epstein. In this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually 
exploit in locations including New York and Palm Beach." 
The lndictment also charges that "the victims ... were as young as 14 years old at the 
time they were abused by [Mr. Epstein] ... and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation." Id . ., 3. "Mr. Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that 
many of his victims were in fact under the age of 18, [] because, in some instances, minor 
victims expressly told him their age." Id. 
Following his arrest, on Monday, July 8, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arraigned and presented 
with the Indictment by Magistrate Judge Henry Pittman. 
D. Legal Principles Governing Release Versus Remand 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3142, a Court can order a defendant's detention 
if it determines that the defendant is either ( 1) a danger to the community or (2) a risk of flight. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 8 of 33
U.S.C. § 3142(e). A Court does not need to find both bases are proven to order a defendant's 
detention. See id.; United States v. Blanco, 570 F. App'x 76, 78 (2d Cir. 2014). Dangerousness 
means that the defendant is a "danger to the safety of any other person or the community." 18 
U.S.C. § 3142. A finding of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. 
See. e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540,542 (2d Cir. 1995). "Where there is a strong 
probability that a person will commit additional crimes if released, the need to protect the 
community becomes sufficiently compelling that detention is, on balance, appropriate." United 
States v. Chimurenga, 760 F .2d 400, 403 (2d Cir. 1985). "[E]ven a single incident of witness 
tampering ... [ may be] sufficient to revoke bail." LaF ontaine, 210 F .3d at 134. 
To order detention based upon risk of flight, the Court must find by a preponderance of 
the evidence that "that no conditions could reasonably assure the defendant's presence at trial." 
See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); 18 U.S.C. § 3142. "[T]he 
constitutional limits on a detention period based on dangerousness to the community may be 
looser than the limits on a detention period based solely on risk of flight. In the former case, 
release risks injury to others, while in the latter case, release risks only the loss of a conviction." 
United States v. Millan, 4 F.3d 1038, 1048 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Orena, 986 
F.2d 628, 631 (2d Cir. 1993)). A bail package that "may reasonably assure the appearance of [the 
defendant] at trial will not [necessarily] assure the safety of the community." United States v. 
Rodriguez, 950 F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. 1991). 
The Bail Reform Act sets forth the following four factors to be considered in the 
release/remand analysis: (1) the nature and circumstances of the crime(s) charged; (2) the weight 
of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including 
the person's character and financial resources; and ( 4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 9 of 33
defendant's release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). "The weight afforded to each factor under section 
3142(g) is within the 'special province' of the district court." United States v. Paulino, 335 F. 
Supp. 3d 600,610 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting United States v. Shakur, 817 F.2d 189, 196 (2d Cir. 
1987)). 
"The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the 
presentation and consideration of information at the [ release/remand] hearing." 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(£)(2) (emphasis added). For example, the Government is entitled to present evidence 
supporting remand by way of proffer, among other means. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(£)(2); see also 
United States v. Lafontaine, 210 F.3d 125,131 (2d Cir. 2000) ("bail hearings are typically 
informal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery"). 18 U.S.C. § 3 l 42(f)(2)(B) 
expressly states that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at bail hearings; thus, courts 
often base detention decisions on hearsay evidence. United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 309, 
21 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2004) "District courts [ are afforded] wide discretion regarding the scope of such 
hearings .... " United States v. Bartok, 472 F. App'x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2012). 
E. The Presumption of Remand in 18 U.S.C. § 1591 Cases 
A 18 U.S.C. § 1591 case involving sexual victimization of a minor is unusual in that it 
includes a presumption in favor of pretrial detention, reflecting the significant harm caused by 
such a crime. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E). The presumption is that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure against flight or danger to the community. United States v. 
English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011 )(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may 
rebut the presumption by "coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the 
community or a risk of flight." United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433,436 (2d Cir. 2001). The 
Government retains the "ultimate burden of persuasion" that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 10 of 33
community (by clear and convincing evidence) and that Mr. Epstein presents a risk of flight (by 
a preponderance of the evidence). Id. Even ifrebuttal evidence is presented, "the presumption 
favoring detention does not disappear entirely." Id. at 436. "[It] remains a factor to be considered 
among those weighed by the district court." Id. 
F. Mr. Epstein Poses a Danger To Others And To the Community 
The Court begins with "dangerousness" because that concept is at the heart of this case. It 
finds that the Government has shown by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein 
threatens the safety of another person and of the community, as follows on pages 10-21: 
• 
Victims Have Advised The Court That They Would Fear For Their Safety If Mr. 
Epstein Were Released 
Victims have "specifically conveyed" to the Government that any form ofrelease of the 
Defendant, including home detention with full-time private guards, could "result in [their] 
harassment and abuse." Dkt. 11 at 4. At the bail hearing on July 15, 2019, two victims movingly 
testified about their past sexual encounters with Mr. Epstein when they were minors aged 14 and 
16, respectively. 7/15/19 Tr. at 72; see also S. REP. 108-191 ("CVRA Legislative History"), at 
(In enacting the CVRA, Congress stated that "[V]ictims deserve the right to be heard at 
specific points in the criminal justice process," including bail hearings. "Giving victims a voice 
not only improves the quality of the process but can also be expected to often provide important 
benefits to victims."). Ms. Annie Farmer was introduced by her counsel, David Boies, and stated 
that she was 16 years old when she "had the misfortune of meeting Jeffrey Epstein [in] New 
York." 7/15/19 Tr. at 72. Ms. Farmer said that Mr. Epstein "flew [her] to New Mexico" and was 
"inappropriate" with her. Id. She was reluctant to go into details about her experience with Mr. 
Epstein. Id. at 73. Ms. Farmer opposes Mr. Epstein's pretrial release because she believes other 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 11 of 33
Epstein victims would "continu[e] to be victimized" and that Mr. Epstein's wealth and privilege 
and notoriety would make it difficult for "[other] victims to come forward." Id. at 72. 
Ms. Courtney Wild was introduced by her counsel, Brad Edwards, and said she was 
"sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein starting at the age of 14." Id. at 73-74. She asked the Court 
to "keep [Mr. Epstein] in detention[] for the safety of any other girls out there that are going 
through what [she's] going through." Id. at 74. Ms. Wild said that Mr. Epstein is a "scary person 
to have walking the streets." Id. 
• 
Mr. Epstein Poses A Threat to Additional Young Girls If He Is Released 
At the remand/release hearing on Monday, July 15, 2019, as noted, the Court heard 
poignant testimony from two of Mr. Epstein's alleged victims about their fears and anxiety over 
his potential release, even if under strict conditions of home confinement. The Court is also 
concerned for new victims. 
Mr. Epstein's alleged excessive attraction to sexual conduct with or in the presence of 
minor girls - which is said to include his soliciting and receiving massages from young girls and 
young women perhaps as many as four times a day appears likely to be uncontrollable. See 
United States v. Minnici, 128 F. App'x 827, 829-30 (2d Cir. 2005) (defendant's alleged sex 
crimes were "of an addictive sexual nature that cannot be suppressed simply by a restrictive set 
of bail conditions"). Accordingly, Mr. Epstein's past sexual conduct is not likely to have abated 
or been successfully suppressed by fierce determination, as his Defense Counsel suggests. 
Defense Counsel contends that: "[H]e wasn't a predator that couldn't control his conduct. He 
disciplined himself." 7 /15/19 Tr. at 31-32. Defense Counsel also argues that "appreciating the 
gravity of these charges ... putting aside the age of these witnesses and putting the consent issue 
aside, it's not like [Epstein is] an out-of-control rapist." 7 /15/19 Tr. at 36. It seems fair to say that 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 12 of 33
Mr. Epstein's future behavior will be consistent with past behavior, including the trove of "lewd 
photographs of young-looking women or girls," which were recently uncovered during the July 
6-7, 2019, search of Mr. Epstein's East 71st Street mansion. See Dkt. 11, Ex. 1 at 9. The search 
results suggest the "possibility that defendant could target another vulnerable victim." See 
United States v. Baker, 349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, 1135 (D.N.M. 2018) (where the defendant was 
alleged to specifically target "vulnerable women" and where he attempted to contact an alleged 
victim, the court was persuaded that the defendant "would be a danger to society if released"). 
Despite having been convicted of the above mentioned (two) Florida sex crimes (in 2008) 
involving an underage girl, Mr. Epstein, as noted, maintained at his New York residence a "vast 
trove" of sexually suggestive photographs of nude underage and adult girls. Dkt. 11, Ex. 1 at 9. 
That is, during the July 6-7, 2019 authorized search of Mr. Epstein's NYC residence, the FBI 
found a "substantial collection of photographic trophies of his victims and other young females." 
Dkt. 11 at 10. This evidence includes compact discs labeled "Young [Redacted Name]+ 
[Redacted Name]," "Misc nudes l," and Girl pies nude." Id. The Government contends that this 
evidence includes hundreds or perhaps thousands of "sexually suggestive photographs" of nude 
underage girls and women, and that it is corroborative in nature. Id. And, it is consistent with 
victim recollections of the inside of Mr. Epstein's residence. Dkt. 11, Ex. 1 at 9. This newly 
discovered evidence also suggests that Mr. Epstein poses "ongoing and forward-looking danger." 
See Dkt. 11 at 10; see also Baker, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 1135; United States v. Goodwin, 2015 WL 
6386568, at *3 (W.D. Ky. Oct. 21, 2015). 
• 
The § 1591 Presumption Of Pretrial Remand Reflects The Seriousness Of Mr. 
Epstein's Alleged Crimes 
The significant harms and dangers of sex crimes involving minors "animated [] Congress 
to create the statutory presumption of detention." United States v. Hardy, 2019 WL 2211210, at 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 13 of 33
*10 (D.D.C. May 22, 2019). The presumption ofremand "reflects Congress's substantive 
judgment that particular classes of offenders should ordinarily be detained prior to trial." United 
States v. Stone, 608 F.3d 939,945 (6th Cir. 2010). Other serious offenses that are accompanied 
by the presumption ofremand are: Kidnapping (18 U.S.C. § 1201); Aggravated Sexual Abuse 
(18 U.S.C. § 2241); Sexual Abuse (18 U.S.C. § 2242); Offenses Resulting in Death (18 U.S.C. § 
2245); Sexual Exploitation of Children (18 U.S.C. § 2251); Selling or Buying of Children (18 
U.S.C. § 2251 ); Production of Sexually Explicit Depictions of a Minor for importation into the 
United States (18 U.S.C. § 2260); Coercion and Enticement (18 U.S.C. § 2422); Transport of 
Minors (18 U.S.C. § 2423); Use oflnterstate Facilities to Transmit Information About a Minor 
(18 U.S.C. § 2425). 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E). 
The presumption ofremand does not disappear even when rebutted. Martir, 782 F.2d at 
1144. If the defendant comes forward with evidence that he will not endanger the community or 
flee the jurisdiction, the presumption "is not erased." See United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 
702, 707 (7th Cir. 1986). "Rather, the presumption remains in the case as an evidentiary finding 
militating against release, to be weighted along with other evidence." United States v. Hir, 517 
F.3d 1081, 1086 (9th Cir. 2008); see also Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144 ("The concern underlying the 
presumption applies to the general class of defendants charged with one of the specified 
offenses-not merely to defendants who fail to produce rebuttal evidence. Were the presumption 
... to vanish upon any showing ... , courts would be giving too little deference to Congress' 
findings regarding this class) ( emphasis in original). 
• 
The U.S. Pretrial Services Department Recommends To The Court That Mr. 
Epstein Continue to Be Remanded 
The Pretrial Services report, dated July 8, 2019, concludes, following Pretrial Services' 
interview of Mr. Epstein, that "[t]here is no condition or combination of conditions that [can] 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 14 of 33
reasonably assure ... the safety of the community" if Mr. Epstein is released. Pretrial Services 
Report, dated July 8, 2019, at 4. Pretrial Services also concluded that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk 
and recommends that he be detained for that reason as well. Id. 
In support of its assessment of Mr. Epstein's dangerousness, Pretrial Services cites the 
following: the "Nature of [Mr. Epstein's currently charged] Instant Offence," i.e., sex trafficking 
and conspiracy involving minor girls; Mr. Epstein's "Prior Arrests," u.,., in Florida in 2006; Mr. 
Epstein's "History [and] Conviction Involving [a] Sex [Offense]," which principally refers to 
Defendant's 2008 conviction(s) for procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution (a 
felony) and for solicitation of prostitution (also a felony); Mr. Epstein's status as a registered sex 
offender in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands; and Mr. Epstein's "Pattern of Similar 
Criminal Activity History." Id. 
• 
The Seriousness Of The Crimes That Mr. Epstein Has Been Charged With Is Also 
Reflected In The Fact That The Crimes Involve Minor Children 
Mr. Epstein is said by the Government to be ''a serial sexual predator" who allegedly 
victimized dozens (or more) of minor girls, including a 14 year old. 1 He was involved in and 
undertook the alleged sexual activity in several locations, including, his mansion in Manhattan 
and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Indictment -i 2. By "actively encourage[ing] certain of his 
[minor] victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused," Mr. Epstein is said to 
have "created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit." Dkt. 11, Ex. 1 at 2. 
The Government alleges that Mr. Epstein "intentionally sought out-and knew that he 
was abusing-minors. Indeed, in some instances, his victims expressly told him they were 
Mr. Epstein is reported to have remarked that: "I'm not a 'sexual predator,' I'm an 'offender' . 
. . It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel." Amber Southerland, 
Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I'm a sex offender, not a predator, New York Post, Feb. 25, 2011. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 15 of 33
underage before or during the period in which he abused them." Id. The crimes with which Mr. 
Epstein is charged carry a maximum sentence of 45 years of incarceration. Id. at 5. "[T]he 
deprivation of liberty imposed by imprisonment makes that penalty the best indicator of whether 
the legislature considered an offense to be ... 'serious."' United States v. Dugan, 667 F.3d 84, 
(2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Lewis v. United States, 518 U.S. 322,326 (1996)). 
And, the crimes Mr. Epstein has been charged with are among the most heinous in the 
law principally, in the Court's view, because they involve minor girls. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 
(e)(3)(E); see also Roger Przybylski, Chapter 5: Adult Sex Offender Recidivism, Sex Offender 
Management Assessment and Planning Initiative ("[R]esearchers widely agree that observed 
recidivism rates are underestimates of the true reoffense rates of sex offenders. Hidden 
offending presents significant challenges for professionals working in sex offender management 
as it is difficult to know whether offenders who appear to be nonrecidivists based on official 
records are truly offense free.") (emphasis in original). 
• 
Mr. Epstein Or His Representatives Have Intimidated, Threatened, And/Or Made 
Payments To Potential Witnesses 
The Government's evidence includes: (i) Florida police reports describing harassment 
and intimidation of witnesses involved in the Florida state criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein 
in 2006, and (ii) emails, dated September 13, 2007 and September 19, 2007 (attached hereto), 
from Mr. Epstein's former counsel to Federal prosecutors in Florida discussing the "option" of 
Mr. Epstein pleading guilty to witness tampering, harassment, and/or obstruction of justice. 
A Palm Beach Police Incident Report, dated July 19, 2006, states that one of Mr. 
Epstein's victims reported that Mr. Epstein's representative said to her: "Those who help [Mr. 
Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt [Mr. Epstein] will be dealt with." Dkt. 11, 
Ex. 3 at 2 (emphasis added.) The Report also states: "[Mr. Epstein's representative] assured [the 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 16 of 33
victim that] she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating with 
law enforcement." 
Another (undated) Palm Beach Police Incident Report states that the 
parent of one of Mr. Epstein's alleged victims contacted the Palm Beach Police to report that Mr. 
Epstein's private investigator had aggressively driven the parent's car off the road. Dkt. 11, 
at 1. This same Report states that the parent of another victim reported being "followed 
aggressively" by Mr. Epstein's private investigator. Id. 
The Government contends that these reports together "suggest that an associate of 
Epstein's was offering to buy victims' silence during the course of the prior investigation," and 
demonstrate Mr. Epstein's "willingness to use intimidation and aggressive tactics in connection 
with a criminal investigation." Dkt. 11 at 11. 
The Government also submits e-mail evidence ( attached to this Order as Exhibit 1) of 
plea discussions in 2007 between Florida federal prosecutors and Mr. Epstein's attorneys that 
confirm that Mr. Epstein considered pleading guilty to witness tampering, harassment and/or 
obstruction of justice in a case involving alleged sex crimes with minor girls. On September 13, 
2007, prosecutors wrote to Mr. Epstein's counsel that they have been "spending some quality 
time ... looking for misdemeanors [that Mr. Epstein could plead guilty to]," including 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1512(d), a Federal witness tampering statute (a felony) and 18 U.S.C. § 403, a Federal statute 
criminalizing the violation of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses ( a 
misdemeanor). Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80756, (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 361-11. Epstein's counsel 
replied: "Already thinking about the same statutes." Id. On September 18, 2007, a Federal 
prosecutor told Mr. Epstein's counsel that if Mr. Epstein pied guilty to obstruction of justice, the 
factual proffer "could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private investigators followed [a 
victim's] father, forcing [him] off the road." Id., Dkt. 361-10; see also supra p. 15. On September 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 17 of 33
19, 2007, Mr. Epstein's counsel proposed that Mr. Epstein admit that he verbally harassed 
victims or the family of victims in connection with his "attempt to delay their voluntary receipt 
of process" in a civil action against Mr. Epstein, in violation of a Federal witness tampering 
statute. Doe, Dkt. 361-9. 
And, the Government has recently contended that, on November 28, 2018 and on 
December 3, 2018 - very soon after the publication of a 3-part investigative report in the Miami 
Herald (authored by Julie K. Brown) relating to Mr. Epstein's Florida Non-Prosecution 
Agreement, dated September 24, 2007 - Mr. Epstein paid $100,000 to "a company founded and 
run by [Individual I]," and he paid $250,000 to [Individual II]. Dkt. 23 at 1. The Government 
states that Individual I was "a potential co-conspirator-[] for whom Epstein obtained protection 
in [] the NP A." Id. Individual I was named and featured prominently in the Miami Herald. See, 
~, Julie K. Brown, "Even From Jail, Sex Abuser Manipulated The System. His Victims Were 
Kept in The Dark, Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018. 
The Government states that Individual II was also "a potential co-conspirator-[] for 
whom Epstein also obtained protection in[] the NPA." Dkt. 23 at 2. She is "one of the 
employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that she and two other identified 
employees facilitated the defendant's trafficking of minors by, among other things, contacting 
victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his residences in Manhattan 
and Palm Beach, Florida." Id. at 2. Individual II was also named and featured prominently in the 
Miami Herald report. 
The Government states there is good reason to infer that Mr. Epstein was attempting to 
"influence [these two] individuals who were close to him during the time period charged in this 
case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial." Dkt. 11 at 11. "Neither of these 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 18 of 33
payments appears to be recurring or repeating during the approximately five years of bank 
records presently available to the Government. This course of action, and in particular its timing, 
suggests the defendant was attempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide 
information against him in light of the recently re-emerging allegations." Id. 
A court may order detention if there is a serious risk that the defendant will attempt to 
threaten, injure, or intimidate a prospective witness or juror. 18 U.S.C. § 3 l42(f)(2)(B). Even a 
single incident of witness tampering has been a "traditional ground for pretrial detention by the 
courts." Lafontaine. 210 F.3d at 132-34 (affirming then-U.S. District Judge Michael B. 
Mukasey's denial of bail to a defendant who had met with a prospective witness in an effort to 
persuade the witness to give untruthful testimony and where there was "no evidence of influence, 
harassment or intimidation"); see also United States v. Singh, 2012 WL 3260232, at *3 
(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 2012). 
• 
Mr. Epstein Has Not Always Been Compliant With His Legal Obligations As A 
Registered Sex Off ender 
Defense counsel has contended that Mr. Epstein has been "scrupulously fulfill[ing] his 
obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register [ as a sex offender]," since 
his 2008 Florida convictions. Counsel argues that this shows that he "is no longer a danger to 
anyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered." Dkt. 6 at 3. 
The record shows that Mr. Epstein has challenged his sex offender "level" in at least one 
jurisdiction since 2008 in an effort to minimize his reporting obligations. And, one recent press 
account states that Epstein is not in compliance in New York State. See Elizabeth Rosner, Tina 
Moore, Larry Celona, and Bruce Golding, NYPD let convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein skip 
judge-ordered check-in, New York Post, July 10, 2019 ("July 10, 2019 NY Post Article") 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 19 of 33
("Jeffrey Epstein never once checked in with City cops in eight-plus years since a Manhattan 
judge ordered him to do so every 90 days"). 
Mr. Epstein is a Level III sex offender in New York State which is the highest category 
of risk to reoffend. This designation requires that Mr. Epstein report his presence in New York to 
law enforcement authorities every 90 days. As discussed at the July 15, 2019 bail hearing, 
counsel for Mr. Epstein made an application in New York State Supreme Court in 2011 to 
reduce Epstein's sex offender registration status from Level III to Level I. If granted, this 
reduction would have allowed Mr. Epstein to avoid his reporting obligations. In a Sex Offender 
Registration Act Hearing on January 11, 2018, held before the Honorable Ruth Pickholz, Mr. 
Epstein's application was (firmly) denied, principally because it had been established by the 
Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders. See People v. Epstein, Indict.# 30129/2010, (N.Y. Sup. 
Ct.), SORA Hearing Transcript, dated Jan. 18, 2011. 
At the hearing, N cw York County Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Gaffney joined in 
Defense Counsel's appeal to review and overturn the decision of the Board of Examiners of Sex 
Offenders and achieve a do\\nward modification of Mr. Epstein's sex offender status. Id. at 2-15. 
Judge Pickholz appeared to be stunned by the joint Defense Counsel/District Attorney 
application, stating: "I am just a little overwhelmed that the People are making this application .. 
. . I have done many SORAs much less troubling than this one where the People would never 
make a downward [adjustment] argument like this .... I have never seen the prosecutor's office 
do this. I have to tell you, I am shocked." Id. at 4-5. Judge Pickholz also ordered Mr. Epstein to 
report as a Level III sex offender every 90 days in N cw York. Id. at 12. "I am sorry [Mr. Epstein] 
may have to come here every 90 days. He can give up his New York home [on East 71st. St.] if 
he does not want to come every 90 days." Id. Epstein appealed but Judge Pickholz's decision 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 20 of 33
was unanimously affirmed, on November 17, 2011, by a panel of five judges of the Appellate 
Division of the New York State Supreme Court. People v. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d 570,933 N.Y.S.2d 
239 (N.Y. App. Div. 2011). 
Notwithstanding Judge Pickholz's order, according to a July 10, 2019 investigative report 
by the New York Post, as noted, Mr. Epstein has never reported as a sex offender to New York 
law enforcement. See July 10, 2019 NY Post Article. "The NYPD cop assigned to monitor 
Epstein has repeatedly complained to [the New York County District Attorney's] Sex Crimes 
Unit that Epstein wasn't in compliance, according to a source familiar with the matter." Id. Mr. 
Epstein's alleged failure to comply with his New York sex offender obligations would appear to 
undermine defense counsel's premise that Mr. Epstein's "perfect compliance" and "meticulous 
obedience," Dkt. 6 at 1, 5, to his sex offender registration obligations should lead to his release. 
See Lafontaine, 210 F.3d at 135 n.6 (where the Court ordered detention noting that the 
defendant "had previously disregarded court orders"). 
The Court has also read the story in the July 17, 2019, New York Post in which attorney 
Brad Edwards contends that while Epstein was serving his Florida state sentence ( after pleading 
guilty to procuring a minor under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution), Epstein was 
allowed to leave the jail on work release. While on work release "[h]e was having ... female 
visitors ... and continuing to engage in ... [sexual] conduct ... while he was in 'jail'." Mr. 
Edwards is counsel to one of Mr. Epstein's victims. See Reuven Fenton and Kate Sheehy, Jeffrev 
Epstein had sex den while serving time: lmvver, New York Post, July 16, 2019. The Court is also 
aware of an article published by Palm Beach CBS local news which reports that the Palm Beach 
County Sherriffs Office "disputes [the] claim that Jeffrey Epstein had sex on work release." A 
spokeswoman for the sheriffs office is quoted as saying "If he violated any conditions of his 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 21 of 33
release he would have been brought back to the Stockade and work release would have been 
terminated." Chuck Weber, PBSO disputes claim that Jeffrey Epstein had sex on work release, 
CBS 12 News, July 17, 2019. 
• 
New Mexieo, Florida And The Virgin Islands 
With respect to Mr. Epstein's sex offender status in New Mexico, Defense Counsel has 
submitted a letter, dated August 19, 2010, from Regina Chacon, Assistant Bureau Chief, Law 
Enforcement Record Bureau of the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, which states that 
Mr. Epstein "is not required to register [as a sex offender] with the State of New Mexico at this 
time for [his] 2008 Florida conviction of Procuring [a] Person Under 18 for Prostitution." 0kt. 
25, Ex. A. The Court requested from the Defense all application materials that Mr. Epstein may 
have submitted to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, believing that the Department 
would not initiate the waiver of Mr. Epstein's sex offense registration on its own. No such 
materials have been received by the Court as of this date. 
The Court understands that Mr. Epstein is also registered as a sex offender in the Virgin 
Islands (Level I) and in Florida (Level I). It has received no materials from the Defense 
regarding sex offender applications or proceedings in those two jurisdictions. 
In sum, based upon all of the proffers and evidence set forth at pp. 10-21 above, the Court 
finds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein poses a danger to other persons and to 
the community. 
G. Mr. Epstein Also Poses A Risk Of Flight 
In the section that follows, the Court considers ''risk of flight" even though it has already 
determined that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the community. "[A] finding of either danger 
to the community or risk of flight will be sufficient to detain the defendant pending trial." 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 22 of 33
United States v. King, 849 F.2d 485,488 (11th Cir. 1988) (quoting United States v. Portes, 786 
F.2d 765 (7th Cir. 1985)). The Court finds that the Government has shown by a preponderance 
of the evidence that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk. 
The factors to be considered in analyzing risk of flight are the same factors that apply 
when analyzing dangerousness. They are: ( 1) the nature and circumstances of the crimes 
charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the defendant; (3) the history and characteristics 
of the defendant, including the person's character and financial resources; and (4) "the 
seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). "The weight 
afforded to each factor under section 314 2(g) is within the 'special province' of the district 
court." Paulino, 335 F. Supp. at 610. 
At the outset, it should be noted that the Pretrial Services Report, dated July 12, 2019, 
concludes that: "The defendant poses a risk of nonappearance for the following reasons: 
1. [Mr. Epstein's] Extensive foreign travel and possession of travel documents 
2. [Mr. Epstein's] Residential and Financial Ties outside this District and Country 
3. [Mr. Epstein's] Employment ties outside this country 
4. [Mr. Epstein's] Unexplained assets 
5. [Mr. Epstein's] Criminal History including [his] conviction for a[] sex offense [with 
minors in Florida in 2008]." Pretrial Services Report, dated July 12, 2019 at 4.

The Crimes Charged Against Mr. Epstein 
Mr. Epstein has been charged with among the most serious crimes recognized by U.S. 
Federal law. The Government has alleged that Mr. Epstein intentionally sought out and sexually 
abused minor girls, including those "particularly vulnerable to exploitation." Dkt. 11, Ex. 1, at 2. 
He did this in multiple locations, including New York and Palm Beach. Id. And, Mr. Epstein 
allegedly "worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 23 of 33
his [unlawful] conduct, by ... contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters." 
Indictment ,I 4. These crimes, as already noted, carry a maximum sentence of 45 years of 
incarceration and give rise to a presumption of pre-trial remand. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E); see 
United States v. Hardy. 2019 WL 2211210, at* 10 (D.D.C. May 22, 2019) (''The significant 
harms and dangers of these crimes animated the Congress to create the statutory presumption of 
detention."). The nature and circumstances of the crimes charged and the severity of the potential 
punishment support a finding that Defendant poses "a serious flight risk and that no conditions 
can be set to reasonably assure his appearance for trial." United States v. Cilins, 2013 WL 
3802012, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013). 
• 
Weight Of The Evidence 
The Government's evidence against Mr. Epstein appears strong. The evidence includes 
testimony of victims, some of whom were minor girls when they were allegedly sexually abused 
by Mr. Epstein; other witnesses, including potential coconspirators; physical evidence, including 
passports reflecting extensive foreign travel; sexually suggestive photographs of nude underage 
girls; plea discussions; and police reports describing witness tampering and intimidation. 
~, United States v. Fama, 2013 WL 2467985, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 7, 2013) ("the Court 
recognizes the difficulty inherent in assessing the Government's case before trial, and is mindful 
not to reach any conclusions about [the Defendant's] guilt or innocence. Indeed, some courts 
have described the weight of the evidence factor as the 'least important' of the§ 3142(g) factors 
for these reasons."); see also Hir, 517 F.3d at 1090. 
• 
History And Characteristics Of The Defendant Including His Financial Resources 
Mr. Epstein pied guilty to two state felonies involving minor girls in Florida. He also 
held plea discussions regarding witness tampering in Florida in 2008. He is a registered Level III 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 24 of 33
sex offender in New York and a registered sex offender in Florida (Level I) and the Virgin 
Islands (Level I). Mr. Epstein is 66 and is reported to be a self made multi-millionaire. He did 
not graduate from college. Mr. Epstein's vast wealth, including substantial liquid assets, multiple 
residences, private plane(s), a $8,672,823 residence in Paris, France, and relatively limited 
family ties to the United States in the sense that he is single with no children and his parents are 
deceased. He has a brother who Defense counsel asserts has offered to serve as a guarantor for 
Mr. Epstein by pledging his home in West Palm Beach, Florida. (The Court notes that the 
Pretrial Services Report, dated July 12, 2019, states that "[t]he defendant stated he maintains 
minimal contact with his brother, Mark Epstein, and that his exact location is unknown at this 
time." Pretrial Services Report at 2.) 
Mr. Epstein engages in extensive overseas travel often relying on his own plane(s). The 
Government argues persuasively that "there is an extraordinary risk of flight, particularly given 
the defendant's exorbitant wealth, his ovvnership of and access to private planes capable of 
international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of the defendant 
occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned from a 
multi-week stay abroad." Dkt. 11, Ex. 1 at 1. "[I]n the past 18 months alone, the defendant has 
traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately more than 20 
occasions." 
at 3. 
In a recent search of Defendant's New York City home, law enforcement seized an 
expired Austrian passport bearing Mr. Epstein's photo but not his name. (The passport is in 
another name.) The Austrian passport lists residence in Saudi Arabia. According to the 
Government, Defense counsel declined to respond when asked by the Government if the 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 25 of 33
"Defendant is currently, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country 
other than the United States." Dkt. 23 at 2. 
Defense counsel contends that Defendant has one active passport that was surrendered 
and that "Mr. Epstein has no foreign passports." Dkt. 6 at 3 n. 3. With regard to the Austrian 
passport, the Defense explains that "Epstein ... acquired the passport in the 1980s, when 
hijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East travel. The passport was for personal 
protection in the event of travel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers, 
hijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur." Dkt. 24 at 8. Details about how the 
passport was procured by Mr. Epstein in the name of another individual were not provided and 
are not known to the Government. See Dkt. 23 at 2 ("The Government is attempting to obtain 
additional information about the Foreign Passport, including how it was obtained and whether 
the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the defendant's possession of what purports to be a 
foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to the inference the defendant knows how to 
obtain false travel documents and/or assume other, foreign identities. This adds to the serious 
risk of flight posed by the defendant."). The Government also argues that "the passport contains 
numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter 
France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s." Dkt. 30. By submission 
dated July 18, 2019, the Defense explains: "Epstein was given the passport at issue by a friend .. 
. He never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any immigration 
or customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do not reflect 
Mr. Epstein's entries or exits." Dkt. 31. 
Defense counsel has submitted a one page document called "Asset Summary - June 30, 
2019." It indicates that Epstein has cash in the amount of $56,547,773; fixed income valued at 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 26 of 33
$14,304,679; equities valued at $112,679,138; hedge funds and private equity valued at 
$194,986,301; properties located at 9 East 71st Street NY, NY 10021 valued at $55,931,000, 49 
Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New Mexico 87056 valued at $17,246,208, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm 
Beach, Florida 33480 valued at $12,380,209, 22 Avenue Foch, Paris France 75116 valued at 
$8,672,823, Great St. James Island No. 6A USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, and C) valued at 
$22,498,600 and Little St. James Island No. 6B USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, and C). Dkt. 14 at 
18. The Court has advised Defense counsel that this "cursory" asset statement is insufficient to 
support a bail package for the reasons, among others, that it is not verified and does not show 
expenses, indebtedness, or liabilities. 
Law enforcement has informed the Government that a safe in the Defendant's New York 
home very recently contained "more than $70,000 in cash ... 48 loose diamond stones, ranging 
in size from approximately 1 carat to 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The 
Government is currently unaware of whether the Defendant maintains similar [amounts] of cash 
and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other locations. Such ready cash and loose 
diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the jurisdiction at a moment's notice." Dkt. 
at 3. 
The Defendant's vast wealth and influential contacts have provided him with the means 
to pay individuals to assist him in unlawful endeavors, including potentially fleeing the 
jurisdiction. In the past, "the Defendant worked with others, including employees and associates 
who facilitated his exploitation of minors, by among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant, both in New York and in Florida." Dkt. 
11, Ex. 1 at 2. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 27 of 33
David Boies, who, as noted, represents identified victims in this case, advised the Court 
that while a civil case was proceeding against the Defendant "we had situations in which we had 
witnesses who were cooperating with us and then were contacted by either Mr. Epstein or his 
lawyers and who then stopped cooperating with us." 7/15/19 Tr. at 71; see also United States v. 
Boustani, 356 F.Supp.3d 246 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) ("[T]he combination of Defendant's alleged 
deceptive actions, access to substantial financial resources, frequent international travel, 
complete lack of ties to the United States, and extensive ties to foreign countries without 
extradition demonstrates Defendant poses a serious risk of flight"); United States v. Epstein, 
155 F.Supp.2d 323,326 (E.D. Penn. 2001) ("The crucial factor, however, is defendant's lack of 
ties to the United States and his extensive ties to Brazil with which no extradition treaty exists. 
In our view, his forfeiture of $1 million worth of assets in the United States would not deter him 
from flight when in Brazil he has significant wealth, a lucrative job, the presence of his family, 
and insulation from ever being forced to stand trial."). 
Viewing the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the Government has shown 
by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant is a serious risk of flight and that no 
conditions can be set that will reasonably assure his appearance at trial. "While other judges in 
this district have found that an armed security guard may be sufficient to assure a defendant's 
appearance, even when he is a serious risk of flight ... this Court does not believe that that 
condition, even coupled with the additional conditions proposed, would be sufficient." United 
Cilins, 2013 WL 3802012, at *3. 
• 
The Danger Posed By The Defendant's Release 
As demonstrated infra, Mr. Epstein's dangerousness is considerable and includes sex 
crimes with minor girls and tampering with potential \Vitnesses. The discussion at pp 10-21 is 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 28 of 33
incorporated here by reference. See MinnicL 128 F. App'x at 829-30 ("the alleged activities 
[ we ]re of an addictive sexual nature that cannot be suppressed simply by a restrictive set of bail 
conditions"); see also Millan, 4 F .3d at 1049 ("[T]he protection of the community can be assured 
only by continued detention."). 
The Court has carefully considered the issue of Defendant's ability and motivation for 
fleeing U.S. jurisdiction. The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of 
the evidence that, among other things, the Defendant's limited family ties to the United States, 
his residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial 
resources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be 
imposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to 
flee. Indeed, these factors render him a "classic" flight risk. See, e.g., United States v. Abdullahu, 
488 F.Supp.2d 433,445 (D.N.J. 2007) ("After reviewing the totality of the evidence, the Court 
has reached the inescapable conclusion that the government has proved by a preponderance of 
the evidence that no condition or combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure the 
defendant's appearance at trial. The defendant faces serious criminal charges ... The defendant 
faces a potential ten year prison sentence and involuntary deportation. The defendant does not 
have permanent and longstanding ties to this area, he has the means and incentive to flee and he 
has family ties and a place to live in an overseas country that will not extradite him to the United 
States."). 
H. Defendant's Proposed Bail Package 
Having determined that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk (and also a danger to the community), 
the Court next examines the Defendant's proposed bail package. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b)-(f)(2). 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 29 of 33
The Court finds that the Defendant's proposed bail package is inadequate. Among its 
deficiencies are these: 
(1) The bail package is not accompanied or supported by audited or certified financial 
statements, including details of income and expenses and debt obligations. There is no affidavit 
from Mr. Epstein. As noted, Defense counsel submitted a cursory one page "Asset Summary -
June 30, 2019" on Mr. Epstein's behalf in which he discloses several categories of assets totaling 
$559,120,954. The Defense states that it "would be impossible for Epstein given, among other 
impediments, his detention, inability to quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly 
make a precise valuation of particular assets - to provide a sufficient financial statement by the 
Court's 5 pm deadline." Dkt. 23 at 4. 
The absence of accurate and comprehensive financials, sworn to by the Defendant, does 
not allow the Court meaningfully to assess Defendants' own proposed bail package nor would it 
enable the Court to fashion a bail package on its own. The Court would not be able to determine 
what level of bail - in relation to Epstein's finances - would reasonably assure the Defendant's 
appearance. Defense counsel proposed at the bail hearing on July 15, 2019 that it would take a 
few days to prepare accurate financials for Mr. Epstein. He also suggested that he would do so 
(only) if the Court were agreeable to granting bail. This "offer" appears disingenuous for a 
person as wealthy and experienced in financial matters as Mr. Epstein. See Tr. 7/15/19 at 50 
(Court: "There needs to be a fuller financial picture to know what would be appropriate." 
Defense Counsel: "Let me be blunt. It was our first effort .... "). That Mr. Epstein does not have 
a financial statement, including liabilities and expenses, readily available is difficult to 
understand. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 30 of 33
(2) The defense bail package proposes excessive involvement of the Court in routine 
aspects of Mr. Epstein's proposed home confinement. This is not the Court's function. See 
United States v. Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681423, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2016) ("The [bail 
package] ... proposed by the defense is not reasonable because, in too many respects, it 
substitutes judicial oversight and management for (more appropriate) reliance upon trained, 
experienced, and qualified professionals from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals 
Service."). The Defense package components would embroil the Court in issues, among others, 
relating to the level of force that may be used to secure the Defendant, who may enter the 
residence, daily reporting by Mr. Epstein, and reporting by so-called Trustee(s) designated to live 
with and supervise Mr. Epstein. 
United States v. Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d 283,295 (E.D.N.Y. 
2014) ("The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use force 
against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether the 
guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties - indeed, the 
imperfections - of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more 
secure option of an actual jail."). 
(3) The Defense proposal to give advance consent to extradition and waiver of extradition 
rights is, in the Court's view, an empty gesture. And, it comes into pay only after Mr. Epstein has 
fled the Court's jurisdiction. According to the Government, "The Department of Justice's Office 
of International Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an 
anticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a 
jurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty." Dkt. 11 at 7. 
(4) Although the Defense has stated that Mr. Epstein would be agreeable to putting up 
"any amount" of collateral or signing "any bond" the Court would require, there has, to date, 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 31 of 33
been no concrete pledge of any real assets or any concrete proposal to turnover deeds to real 
property, or to provide a specific amount of cash. See 7/15/19 Tr. at 50 ("I am authorized to say 
to the Court that whatever bond you want Mr. Epstein to sign, whether it's $100 million or an 
amount close to the amount of the assets that we have provided, Mr. Epstein is prepared to sign 
it."). 
The Court, as noted, has no detailed information regarding the extent of the Defendant's 
assets, including the nature, value and location of all of his assets. There is no mention of any 
expenses, liabilities, or indebtedness. And, there has been no persuasive Defense counter to the 
Government's argument that "even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all of his current 
assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or 
tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least 
$10,000,000 per year, according to records from Institution-I, while living in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be little to 
stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown assets abroad, and then continuing to 
do whatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of 
extradition." Dkt. 11 at 5 (emphasis omitted). The Defendant, it should also be noted, is already 
at risk of losing some of his real property because the Indictment contains a forfeiture allegation 
regarding any property that was used or intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the sex 
trafficking offenses and that includes, but it is not limited to, the property located at 9 East 71st 
Street, New York, New York. 
(5) The appointment and role of "trustees" who will presumably live with Mr. Epstein 
and monitor his compliance with bail conditions are unacceptably vague. They do not, for 
example, address the conflict that is created by the salary the "trustees" are earning from the 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 32     Filed 07/18/19     Page 32 of 33
Defendant and their purported role as independent monitors. (The same problem arises in 
relation to private 24/7 security guards.) This is especially problematic where, as here, it is 
alleged that employees of the Defendant may have engaged in unlawful acts with and on behalf 
of the Defendant. According to the Government, "the defendant worked with others, including 
employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors, by among other things, 
contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant, both in New York 
and in Florida." Dkt. 11, Ex. 1 at 2. 
(6) "As a fall back," the Defense suggests the utilization of and the funding of a private 
security guard agency to "virtually guarantee" Mr. Epstein's presence in court and, presumably, 
also to supervise his behavior. This contingency plan is not a part of Mr. Epstein's 14 point 
proposal. Nevertheless, the Court is asked by the defense to "revisit" its legal viewpoint as 
expressed in an earlier decision concerning 24/7 private home security guards. 
Each bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the 
Court. And, in view of the Comi's finding of dangerousness, a new bail proposal likely would be 
futile. See, e.g., United Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 544 ("No conceivable conditions could ensure the 
safety of the community."); Orena, 986 F.2d at 632 ("We do not agree that the bail conditions set 
by the district court eliminate the danger to the community or are superior to detention for 
purposes of the Bail Reform Act."); United States v. Colombo, 777 F.2d 96, 100 (2d Cir. 1985) 
("These conditions are clearly inadequate to protect the public from one found for bail purposes 
to be a danger to the community.").

Conclusion & Order 
Based upon the forgoing, the Government's motion for remand (detention) is granted and 
the Defense motion for pretrial release is denied.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
THE COURT:  Good morning, everyone.  Please be seated.
For your information and for the people sitting in the
overflow courtroom, we have tried to accommodate everybody into
this proceeding either here in my usual courtroom or in the
overflow room.  So I hope everybody can hear me.
The purpose of today's proceeding, as I'm sure you're
all aware, is to conduct a bail hearing.  In this matter, as I
think you know, the government is seeking continued pretrial
remand of Mr. Epstein and the defense is arguing for pretrial
release.  The parties have submitted helpful written
submissions, and they have been placed on the docket.
You should also be aware, if you weren't -- I don't
think you are -- that there is what's called a pretrial
services report.  One has been filed with me today.
Typically the purpose of such a report is to make a 
recommendation to the Court as to whether there should be bail 
or detention. 
There was an additional report -- I think they've
gotten additional information in today's report -- and the
representatives of pretrial services are here in the court
today.
The report itself is typically not filed on the
docket, but it does conclude as follows.  This is a quote.  It
says that "There is no condition or combination of conditions
that will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 3 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
required and the safety of the community."  It goes on to
conclude that:  "Therefore, pretrial services respectfully
recommends the defendant be detained."
Now, of course this ultimately is the issue that I
have to decide and will do so with your help.
You should be aware, incidentally, that I have not yet
reached a decision on this matter, and I do not intend to do so
today.  I need a little bit more time to absorb everything
that's been submitted, and I will probably do so, that is to
say, give my decision here in the courtroom, on Thursday,
July 18, at 9:30 here in Courtroom 17B.  I will endeavor to
finish by then and to be able to share with you my
determination.
We also have in the court today several persons who
are contending that they are victims in the legal context of
Mr. Epstein's conduct.  They're welcome in these proceedings.
Indeed, they have the right to be present, and they also have
the right to be heard under federal law.
As I understand it, they have advised the Court,
through counsel and through the government counsel, that they
oppose bail for Mr. Epstein.  They may also be heard today in
court if they wish to be heard.
So for today, I thought, if this is agreeable to the
government and the defense, I would give each side say up to 20
minutes, if they wish to have it and if they do wish to be
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 4 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
heard on their respective issues.
The government always has the burden of proof.  So I
would start with them.  They made the first application which
was for remand.
I should tell you -- and I will right now -- that I
have some questions for each side.  And I'm going to go over
them with you right now so that before the government and the
defense speaks, they will know what questions I would like them
to address, if they wish to.  Otherwise, they can say whatever
they wish.  But these are questions that I have on my mind.
So the first question is this.  It involves some
discussion that I would like each side to address.  As you
know, this case involves two counts or two charges.
These are allegations contained in the indictment.  
One is conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.  And the other, 
the second count, is the substantive count of sex trafficking.  
The referenced statute is 18 U.S. Code, Section 1591.  And for 
our purposes, since this is a bail proceeding, also the Bail 
Reform Act. 
Section 1591, as is relevant here -- those cases are
unusual in the criminal law insofar as they carry with them a
presumption that "No condition or combination of conditions
will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required
and the safety of the community."
As you probably know already, most cases carry a
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 5 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
presumption that bail will be granted.  That is not true with
respect to the charges here.
The presumption of remand, as in this case, may be
rebutted by the defense.  And if it is, the government has the
burden of proving that remand is nevertheless warranted.
Indeed, the government bears this burden of persuasion
throughout.
The burden with respect to the safety of the community
is clear and convincing evidence, and the burden with respect
to risk of flight is preponderance of the evidence.
The defense argues that the presumption of remand is
rebutted here.  And I refer to several places where they say
that, but one is at page 6 and following of their letter
application for release of Mr. Epstein.
So my question as relates to this burden and
presumption is for the defense particularly, how was the burden
rebutted in this case which is something that they contend
they've been able to do.
And my question for the government is whether that
presumption has been rebutted and, if so, how has the
government been able to prove remand is appropriate, if it has.
So here is another question.  Actually, I have a lot
of questions.  But the ones that are on top of my mind are
five.  We have all the time in the world.  So if you have more
questions, I'd be happy to have them answered.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 6 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
So the question is the following:  Mr. Epstein has
been required to register as a sex offender in several states
going back I believe to 2008 when he pled guilty to an offense
in Florida.
Those states include New York, Florida, and the Virgin
Islands.  So one question I have for each side is what about
New Mexico.  That's half of the question.
The rest of the question is as follows:  Mr. Epstein 
has applied in New York state to lower his sex offender status 
from what's called a level 3, which is the highest level which 
I think carries with it a high risk of recidivism, according to 
these levels and to sex offender regulation.   
And he sought to have that lowered to level 1.  His 
application was denied, as I understand the proceedings, by the 
Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders New York state and then in 
state court by the courts and, particularly, a decision of the 
Honorable Justice Ruth Pickholz on our about January 18, 2011.  
I believe that decision was appealed to the New York State 
Appellate Division and was unanimously upheld. 
I read this morning a copy of the transcript of the
proceedings before Judge Pickholz which I'm likely to place on
the docket after today's session.  And the question is for each
side.  First of all, they're free to comment on my description
of the proceeding before Judge Pickholz.
But the question is whether there were or are other
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 7 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
legal or administrative proceedings in Florida, the Virgin
Islands, New Mexico, and any other jurisdiction comparable to
the one before Judge Pickholz in which she ruled on 1-18-2011.
So I'm not suggesting that there are, although I think 
I did read someplace that there may be some proceeding pending 
in New Mexico.  I'm not quite sure.  That's what I hoped you 
could help me out on.   
It doesn't have to be precisely the same proceeding 
that Judge Pickholz had.  I'm looking for any transcripts in 
particular and administrative or legal proceedings in other 
states relating in any way to Mr. Epstein's sex offender 
status. 
The third question on my mind is this:  The defense
has submitted a brief financial summary to the Court of
Mr. Epstein's assets.  And I, as you know, permitted that it be
submitted under seal for, among other reasons that were on my
mind, not to slow the proceedings down.
The summary is cursory I would say, short, less than a
page and does not fully assist me in rendering the bail/remand
decision, that is to say, in its detail or absence of detail.
And moreover, the information provided in that summary seems to
be known already to the government in other ways.  They seem to
have gotten that information from other sources.
So I am inclined to place the summary on the docket,
but I want to hear from both sides whether I should or should
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 8 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
not do that.
Four, the government, as you probably know, has
conducted a search of Mr. Epstein's home on East 71st Street on
the Upper East Side a little over a week ago in tandem, as it
were, or in connection with Mr. Epstein's arrest.
The government contends in its submission that the
information uncovered as a result of that search supports
detention, pretrial detention, in this proceeding.
And I would like to know from the government
particularly what that information is and whether it would be
feasible -- it certainly would be helpful if there is such
information, that a sample of that evidence in some form be
included in this bail remand proceeding.
Lastly for now, this fifth question.  The government
contends that there is evidence of recent what appears to be or
what could be alleged witness tampering or obstruction of
justice in connection with two recent payments, one in the
amount of $250,000 and another in the amount of $100,000 to, as
I understand it, to two employees or associates of Mr.
Epstein's.
Those payments were made soon after a Miami Herald 
story about this case and particularly the role of the Florida 
United States Attorney, Mr. Acosta at the time, and the U.S. 
Attorney's Office. 
And I would like to hear from the government and/or
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 9 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
the defense what additional insight about this episode they can
share with us to support their position in these proceedings.
So, as all good lawyers, I reserve the right to have
more questions, and I probably will.
But I'm happy to begin with Mr. Rossmiller and have
you heard on the issue of remand versus bail.  If you can
include some or all of these questions in your presentation,
that would be great.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.
Your Honor, the government seeks pretrial detention in
this case due to the extraordinary risk of flight and the
danger presented by the defendant to the community, a danger
that is not speculative but, rather, is evident from his prior
actions.  As a result, we join with the recommendation from
pretrial services and the requests of the victims that the
defendant be detained.
As the Court pointed out, with the sex trafficking
offense charged here, there is a presumption that no
combination of release conditions could reasonably assure the
defendant's appearance and the protection of the public.
The Court asked whether the presumption has been
rebutted, and the answer is no.  There has been no information
provided by the defendant to rebut that presumption in this
case.
And in particular, as the Court noted, the defendant 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 10 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
provided no specific detailed financial information in its 
submission.  I'll get into that in a little bit more in a 
moment.   
But certainly the first question for a defendant of 
this tremendous means is how much money does he have, where is 
it, what are the accounts, is it in foreign accounts, how much 
is in diamonds or art.  These are all details that would be 
necessary for the Court to even begin to consider this type of 
application.   
So, no.  The presumption has not been rebutted.  
However, your Honor, even if the defense were able at some 
point to rebut the presumption by providing some more 
information, there simply is no way that they can meet the 
standard here. 
The evaluation of the Bail Reform Act suggests that
all of those factors counsel in favor of remand, which we'll go
into in a little more detail.
THE COURT:  It is accurate to say that you as the
government has the burden of persuasion or proof in this
instance.  Right?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.  There are good
reasons why sex trafficking has a presumption of detention and
even more so where a defendant, as this defendant has, has
previously been convicted of a sex offense.
And in connection with that, his dangerousness is
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 11 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
clear from his willingness to tamper with witnesses and victims
as the Court can see from the two police reports produced to
the Court and from the defendant's payments just months ago to
individuals associated with the defendant during the relevant
time.  The Court asked a question about that.
Your Honor, we just became aware of those payments 
late last week.  We, frankly, don't have additional information 
other than that they were paid, that they were paid to two 
individuals who were associated with the defendant at the time, 
and that those two individuals are both listed in the 
non-prosecution agreement.   
So there is certainly an inference there that the 
defendant was attempting to influence them right around when he 
came back into public consciousness. 
Your Honor, the victims in this case seek detention
and fear his release.  And most of all, he is an extraordinary
flight risk.  As the government has discussed, he has six
homes.  He owns two private islands.  He owns a residence in
France.  And he has told his own financial institution that he
is worth more than $500 million.
In the government's filing last Monday, we described
the defendant as being extraordinarily wealthy which was
confirmed by the defense even in his very minimal financial
disclosure.  
Since the government's initial filing, we have 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 12 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
obtained records from a financial institution that has been 
associated with the defendant confirming that the defendant 
represented his net worth as more than $500 million.  
Your Honor, just as one example, the defendant had a single 
account at that financial institution totaling more than $110 
million. 
There can be no dispute whatsoever that this defendant
has vast assets and every incentive in the world to use those
assets to flee from justice.
Your Honor, the government seeking detention in this
case is not unusual.  Defendants are routinely detained in this
district when facing such charges, and this defendant should be
treated no differently.  The fact that he has considerable
resources to flee prosecution only makes the case for his
detention stronger.
On that note, with respect to the strength of the
evidence, again, last Monday, the government described its
evidence as "strong."  Just a week later, after seven days of
this case being public following months of a covert
investigation, the evidence is already significantly stronger
and getting stronger every single day.
Many individuals identifying themselves as victims and
witnesses have contacted the government, and we are in the
process of receiving and corroborating this additional
evidence.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 13 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
Your Honor, with a case that's no longer covert, we
have been able to dramatically expand the scope of our
investigation in just the last week.  And that additional
evidence builds on a case that was already indicted by a grand
jury, that already included evidence of dozens of alleged
victims, that already included significant corroborated
evidence, evidence that led to the charges for which this
66-year-old defendant could serve up to 45 years in prison.
The defendant has essentially conceded that the
government will be able to prove the elements of the crimes
currently alleged.  They acknowledged in their submission that
the government likely will be able to show that the defendant
engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were under
age.
Now, in the face of all of this evidence and the
extraordinary incentives for the defendant to flee, what does
the defendant propose?  Nothing that would meaningfully
mitigate the risks of danger and especially flight.
THE COURT:  Are you talking about the bail package
now?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.
So in the first instance, the defendant's one-page 
financial disclosure form is more significant for what it does 
not include than what it does.  It is cursory, as the Court 
said, at best.   
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 14 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
It does not include a list of accounts.  It does not 
include a list of financial institutions.  It does not identify 
what types of currencies the defendant holds.  It does nothing 
to identify the location of his holdings.  It does nothing to 
identify high-value property such as diamonds or art, both of 
which were observed in abundance in just the government's 
search of his Manhattan mansion. 
The other thing, your Honor, is we're just relying on
the defendant's word for all of this.  This is not sworn.  It's
not under penalty of perjury.  There are no account statements.
There are no bank records.  There is nothing to validate this.  
That's not to say that if this were validated, that 
this would somehow rise to the level of being granted bail, but 
it's notable with respect to the presumption in particular and 
also with respect to how the Court evaluates the defendant's 
assets that we are relying on him. 
The defendant's financial disclosure form should alarm
the Court, your Honor, not give it comfort that there are
conditions that would keep the defendant from fleeing and
prevent him from being a danger.
With respect to the proposed package, the defendant
proposes the Court accept his Manhattan mansion as security for
a bond.  Now, the government has already designated that
property for seizure making it worthless to the defendant.  He
proposes cosigners who couldn't possibly secure a package
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 15 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
representing even a fraction of his wealth.
THE COURT:  I don't know that we know that because we
don't really know what their financial situation is.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  I suppose that's true, your Honor.
Based on the government's preliminary research, it seems like
they wouldn't be able to, but we have no idea.  That's exactly
right.
The defendant's proposal of home confinement and
electronic monitoring is also meaningless for an individual
with his financial resources.  Reducing this defendant's head
start in fleeing should be of no comfort whatsoever.
In connection with that factor, your Honor, just this 
morning, the government became aware that in a locked safe in 
the defendant's mansion there were piles of cash, dozens of 
diamonds, and a passport appearing to be issued from a foreign 
country with a photo of the defendant and a name on that 
passport that is not the defendant's name. 
THE COURT:  Say that again.
You found that today? 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  We became aware of it today.  It was
seized in connection with a warrant, and we became aware of it
just this morning, the particular details this morning.
THE COURT:  When you say "piles of cash," did you
count it?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  No.  We have not counted the cash,
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 16 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
your Honor.  It does raise the question of how many other safes
are there in how many other locations with items like these.
The defendant also makes proposals that highlight,
rather than mitigate, the dangers of granting bail.  His offer
to consent to extradition is unenforceable, and it highlights
his extensive connections abroad.
I should say, your Honor -- I forgot to mention -- the
passport that I just referenced listed at the time his
residence as Saudi Arabia, and this was from the 1980's.
THE COURT:  Would you describe that passport again.
I'm not sure I caught it.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  I can, your Honor.
The passport was issued in the name of a foreign 
country.  It appears to have been issued sometime in the 
1980's.  It is expired currently.  It has a photo that appears 
to be the defendant, and it has a name that is not Jeffrey 
Epstein. 
In connection with that, I also want to note that the
defendant's proposal for private security is inadequate and
impractical and would put the defendant in the position of
having complete financial control over the people who are
supposed to guard him.
As this Court has written:  "What more compelling case
for an order of detention is there than a case in which only an
armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 17 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
assure the defendant's appearance."So that's just on flight,
your Honor.
With respect to danger to the community, none of the
defendant's proposals address the very significant danger this
defendant proposes, both to victims and witnesses and to the
proper administration of justice.
The government has heard from more than one victim
that in connection with the prior investigation, they believed
they were being instructed by the defendant or his associates
to avoid or lie to law enforcement.
The defense said in its submission that it was without
knowledge as to the basis of the incidents referenced by the
government in our initial filings.
So, as the Court saw, we submitted the underlying 
police reports.  Those police reports are detailed, they're 
credible, and they're supported by corroborating evidence such 
as phone records. 
THE COURT:  These are from Florida; right?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  That's correct, your Honor.  These
are very real concerns, and they cannot be mitigated if the
defendant is released.
And as the government noted in its submission and as
the Court asked about, even recently the defendant has sent
hundreds of thousands of dollars to two individuals just days
after the publication of significant news articles about the
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 18 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
defendant.
THE COURT:  Could you go back to those Florida police
reports and tell us what you think they demonstrate.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.
They certainly suggest that there were individuals who 
believed that they were being harassed and interfered with by 
the defendant or his agents.  That was investigators or other 
individuals working on behalf of or at the behest of the 
defendant.   
Now, those aren't charges proven in court.  Those 
aren't convictions.  But they certainly are factual occurrences 
that people reported contemporaneously and that are significant 
and concerning. 
With respect to just a couple of the Court's
questions, bouncing around just slightly, with respect to the
financial information which, again, is limited at best, the
government took no position on the defendant's sealing
application for, among other reasons, the fact that we did not
know what they were going to submit.  We imagined that it would
be more detailed.
Secondly, the government obviously had just hours to 
respond to the defendant's at that point.  So we took no 
position and of course defer to the Court as to whether there 
is a valid reason to seal such limited and summary information. 
We will confer, your Honor, on whether we're able to
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 19 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
provide a sample of the search warrant materials.  Those
materials remain under review.  They are, generally speaking,
many, many, many photographs of nude and partially nude women
and girls who appear to be young.
The government has identified at least one individual
in those photos who has self-identified as a victim of the
defendant.  And, frankly, it is a lot of material that we are
continuing to work through.
With respect to the sex offender registration of the
defendant in other states, your Honor, following up on the
Court's question last week, we did confer with New York state
authorities.
There is no particular result from this case in terms 
of his registration in New York.  He remains registered, but 
there is no specific consequence as to him being charged or 
arrested in this case and no change of his status.  He is 
already, of course, at the highest status of risk for 
re-offense. 
Just very briefly, your Honor, with respect to some of
the other arguments that defense counsel made --
THE COURT:  Are you familiar with whether or not there
are other proceedings in other jurisdictions of a similar
nature to Judge Pickholz's decision?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  We are not aware of any similar
proceedings.  That's not to say that there aren't any, but the
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 20 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
government is not aware of any at this time, your Honor.
Now, turning just very briefly to some of the legal
arguments that defense counsel raised in their submission, the
defendant raised legal arguments that he says he intends to
argue later.
The Court should have no confidence whatsoever that
the defendant would stick around to pursue long-shot, dubious
legal arguments at some future time.  As set forth in the
government's submission, the non-prosecution agreement does not
preclude this prosecution.
And even if that agreement were applicable to this
district, which it is not, the defense itself acknowledges that
the indictment included evidence beyond the initial
investigation.  That effectively moots this issue for the bail
argument.  This case will go forward.
The defendant will lose any argument about due
process.  He will lose any argument about pre-indictment delay.
And if he choses to be tried before a jury of his peers, we are
confident he will be convicted.
The Court should ensure he is here when that time
comes by ordering his detention.
THE COURT:  Counsel.
MR. WEINBERG:  Thank you, your Honor.
If I can, your Honor, before responding to the Court's
questions, put this case in some context.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 21 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
Before 1984, before the Bail Reform Act, there was an
Eighth Amendment that the United States Supreme Court
guaranteed bail to anyone who wasn't charged with a capital
offense, and the justices wrote continuously that was because
detention impairs a defendant's ability to prepare a defense.
In this case, the government has told us there's going
to be an enormous amount of discovery.  The stakes are grave,
and one of the most important reasons for Mr. Epstein's release
is to permit him the right to fully prepare a defense.
The second reason that before 1984 there was an
entitlement to bail was because of the presumption of innocence
and because of the basic premise of the American criminal
justice system that you don't punish first and have a trial
second; that non-convicted citizens don't get detained which is
essentially a label for punishment.
There is no way to replace the freedom if Mr. Epstein
is to prevail on these charges.  If the government's over a
decade of delay is found prejudicial by the Court which
thereafter dismisses the charges, if the Court determines that
the nonpros agreement was circumvented by the prosecutors in
Florida when they encouraged their witnesses and their
witnesses' lawyers to go to the Southern District and catalyze
and create a case.  That's unique.
These were not two silos, the Southern District of 
Florida and the Southern District of New York.  It is more than 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 22 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
coincidental that on the Saturday before the Monday filing by 
Mr. Epstein in Florida in the CVRA case Mr. Epstein is 
arrested. 
We have evidence not only of an enormous amount of
overlapping evidence, but we have evidence of the involvement
of the Department of Justice; the CEOS unit, the Child
Exploitation Unit, both before the nonpros agreement was
executed, they were involved with the Southern District of
Florida.  And after, they volunteered essentially to be part of
a team in the event that Mr. Epstein did not conclude his
obligations under the CVRA.
THE COURT:  You mentioned in your submissions -- and I
think you mentioned or your colleague mentioned the last time
that we were in court -- that high-level Department of Justice
officials approved the non-prosecution agreement.
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Who are they?
MR. WEINBERG:  First, the agreement was executed on
September 24, 2007.  Appeals were taken by Mr. Epstein
challenging the federal interest in what was a potential state
prosecution.
The first level was the criminal division.  The head 
of the criminal division, Alice Fisher, assigned to Sigal 
Mandelker.  I may be mispronouncing her name, but she is the 
current Undersecretary of the Treasury.   
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 23 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
She received submissions from the defense that this 
was essentially a local crime without the necessary interstate 
elements that constitute the foundation of federal prosecution.   
We had a meeting in Washington with a number of the
defense team with representatives of the criminal division and
the representatives of the CEOS, the Child Exploitation Unit.
They recognized that their position was not squarely
within the precedence that had preceded this March 2008
meeting.  They recognized the arguments were novel; that some
of the provisions in the NPA were novels.  But they endorsed
the exercise of prosecutorial discretion that was at the heart
of the NPA.
THE COURT:  Was there any proceeding at which their
position is documented or any correspondence?
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.  There are submissions
by the defense to the criminal division in Washington that I
believe were dated in March.  And then there was a response in
May which in essence authorized --
THE COURT:  May of what year?
MR. WEINBERG:  May of 2008.
THE COURT:  What did it say?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  It endorsed the exercise of
discretion after recognizing in about a six- or seven-page
letter that the facts and circumstances surrounding the NPA
were unusual; that these allegations were not within the
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 24 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
heartland of federal jurisprudence or the federal statutes that
were targeted for Mr. Epstein.
THE COURT:  They actually said that and then endorsed
the agreement --
MR. WEINBERG:  They said that they were unusual
arguments; that they essentially understood the arguments we
were making.  They didn't denounce the federal case.
They, instead, said that they believed, after a 
review, that there was authority and that there was a 
sufficient discretion that should be accorded to the U.S. 
Attorney. 
An appeal was then taken to the Deputy Attorney
General who at the time was Mr. Filip, F-i-l-i-p.  Again, I may
be butchering his name.
THE COURT:  That's his last name?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  That's his last name.  Mark I think
is his first name.
He assigned John Roth, who was a former Florida 
prosecutor and was his deputy or the deputy to the Deputy 
Attorney General.  And Mr. Roth received further written 
submissions.  Again, there was the second endorsement of the 
discretion that Mr. Acosta in Florida exercised when he 
approved.   
And this was not a single-man approval.  The 
negotiations in the Southern District of Florida included the 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 25 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
head of the first assistant, Mr. Sloman. 
THE COURT:  In New York.
MR. WEINBERG:  Right.  In the Southern district, there
were six or seven prosecutors, including New York City
prosecutors, in what was either the largest or second largest
U.S. Attorney's Office.  I don't know how the manpower compares
to the Southern District of New York.
This was well thought through.  Again, it was with
consultation of the Department of Justice before September 24
and then again after where the government continued to
investigate.
THE COURT:  Is Mr. Filip the highest level official in
the Department of Justice?
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes.  He was just one step below the
Attorney General.
THE COURT:  He was Deputy Attorney General?
MR. WEINBERG:  Deputy Attorney General.
In May or June of 2008, he approved the discretion to 
enter the NPA and to essentially endorse the decision and 
implicitly endorsed that there was some federal interest in 
this case because we were contesting whether or not this was a 
case that warranted the weight of the federal government which 
required Mr. Epstein to go to the state which had returned an 
indictment for solicitation and actually urged the state of 
Florida to bring a second charge that would subject Mr. Epstein 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 26 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
to registration which was part of the obligations that he 
accepted, and no one quarrels with his performance.   
He went to the state.  They returned the higher 
charge.  He went to jail.  He did his strict probation with 
home detention.  And he's been registered since 2010. 
I think these facts are important, not just because
they are the cornerstone of a potential legal defense, and I
won't go through all of the different factors that we believe
on a principal basis will distinguish this case from the
precedence that Mr. Rossmiller is relying on.
These were not two silos.  The Southern District 
didn't stand completely detached from the activities and the 
events in Florida.  But that's a motion to dismiss that will be 
brought later.  The premise is if we're right and they're wrong 
and he's detained, he's lost freedom without punishment. 
Your Honor asked about the rebuttable presumption, and
I think this also goes back to the events of the 2007 and 2008
era.
THE COURT:  So the presumption, first of all, the
people who wrote that presumption into law clearly know about
bail and history and the need for defendants to consult with
their counsel, etc.
But in this rather narrow class of cases, almost all
of them I think relating to children or young people, there are
a whole series of cases, exceptions to be sure, where the
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 27 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
presumption of remand maintains.  And this is one of those
cases.
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  So why is that?
MR. WEINBERG:  Interestingly, if I can point out
another provision in the Bail Reform Act, and this is 3142(c).
At the very end of the set of conditions, the Congress in 1984,
which was essentially revolutionizing the criteria for release,
says that:  "In any case that involves a minor victim under" --
and they quote a series of statutes, including 1591 -- "any
release order shall contain at minimum a condition of
electronic monitoring, a curfew, and other conditions."
So Congress recognized that despite the presumption,
which the law says is rebuttable and is more a burden of
production than an ultimate burden of persuasion issue,
Congress understood that defendants charged with 1591 would be
released under conditions at the discretion of the court and
that if they were --
THE COURT:  I think they understood that they could be
released, not that they would be, otherwise, they wouldn't have
written that presumption.
MR. WEINBERG:  Absolutely.
THE COURT:  So could you share any insight why,
notwithstanding -- and I don't disagree with you.  Bail is the
norm rather than the exception.  But we totaled up -- I don't
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 28 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
know if there are more -- 12 cases, all of which involve a
minor victim -- kidnapping, sex trafficking of children,
aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, offenses resulting in
death, sexual exploitation of children, selling and buying of
children, the production of sexually explicit depictions of a
minor for importation into the United States, crimes involving
the transportation of minor victims, coercion and enticement,
transport of minors, and use of interstate facilities to
transmit information about a minor.
All of those -- there may be others, but those are the
ones we found -- also carried this presumption of remand
instead of bail.
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Presumption.
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.  If we're looking at
1591 -- and I'm not here today to in any way diminish the
gravity of the allegations against Mr. Epstein, but it's far
away from the heartland of 1591 commercial sex trafficking that
deals with servitude and deals with enslavement and deals with
pimps, if I can use that word, selling women for commercial
profit.
We've provided the Court with some of the division in
the law, including decisions by this Court, by Judge Jones
relying on a South Dakota opinion, by the chief justice that
finds the statute inapplicable.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 29 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
THE COURT:  Is that the Fiaro (phonetic) case?
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.  Again, today is not
the day to be arguing Rule 29 issues or even the construction
and scope of the statute.  But I think lots of the detentions
are for your quintessential traffickers.
And I understand we don't have consent and, therefore, 
the government substitutes that language.  But this is not 
quintessential commercial sex trafficking to third parties for 
profit. 
But more important or as important, if I can say that,
the presumption is rebuttable.  Even in those cases that
your Honor listed, the statute contemplates that some 1591
defendants will be released under conditions, and I believe
that the rebuttal to the presumption -- one is the danger
prong; one is the flight prong.  If I can address them
separately.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. WEINBERG:  I apologize if I'm using the time.
THE COURT:  No.  You have the right.
MR. WEINBERG:  Thank you, Judge.
THE COURT:  I think that is interesting.  So those
prongs have different burdens of proof for one thing, clear and
convincing in one instance and preponderance in the other.
It's either/or or both one could find.  But if one 
found one of those, either a danger to the community or flight 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 30 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
risk, that would suffice. 
MR. WEINBERG:  I think I have to bear the burden of
rebutting the presumption as to each prong, although I think
once rebutting the burden falls on the government, and then
they have different substantive burdens of proof.
So danger.  There are two categories of the dangers
that have been identified by the government.  Number one is
simply the danger of recidivism which is the classic danger
that results in detention when detention is predicated on
danger.
And Congress was very clear that they -- because the
danger prong is predictive.  It is not just was he a bad guy.
Did he do things in the past.  That's what a trial is for.
That's what legal issues are for.  It's can we infer from the
past that he is a future danger and can we do it by clear and
convincing evidence.
In terms of rebutting and the burden of production as
to that part of the danger prong, 14 years, since 2005 until
2019.  And the government, despite a website, despite their
enormous ability to investigate -- and they've been
investigating for months -- there is no allegation that
Mr. Epstein, after 2005, engaged in illegal sexual activity
with a minor.
Again, I'm not diminishing the gravity of the
allegations in 2005 and 2004, but once he knew that he was

being investigated, he wasn't a predator that couldn't control
his conduct.  He disciplined himself.
There has been no allegation since the commencement of 
that investigation that Mr. Epstein again endangered a minor.  
Putting aside consent, there is just no allegation.   
The witnesses that Mr. Rossmiller will offer to the 
Court in the future, at least to the extent that they've been 
characterized by the government, are more witnesses with a kind 
of a parallel group of witnesses to the 2002 and '05 
allegations.  So I think a 14-year gap is an eloquent rebuttal 
to a burden of production presumption as to danger.   
THE COURT:  So I have a question about that too
because I'm not so sure.  I don't purport to know, but I'm not
so sure.
So in your letter to the Court -- I think it's at page
-- is one of a series of strong statements.  This one in
particular says:  "Any danger that Mr. Epstein may have once
posed to the community has long since abated."  Another
sentence used the word "evaporates," but let's say "abated."
The defense submission goes on to say:  "At the very 
least, this enormous gap in time precludes a finding," 
"precludes a finding by clear and convincing evidence that no 
conditions of release can reasonably assure the community's 
safety." 
Right?  That's your position as a matter of law.  You
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 32 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
don't find any case where that says 14 years, and it's over or
it evaporates, etc.
The argument though is that 14 years ought to be 
enough of a period of time.  Right? 
MR. WEINBERG:  I think the premise is that when the
man was not under conditions of release, if your Honor was to
exercise your power to release him, he didn't re-engage in this
activity that constitutes the heart of both the Florida and the
current New York prosecutions.
And at a certain point, when you're dealing with the 
government's burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence 
going forward in the future, the idea that he would abandon his 
years of self-discipline when he's under conditions of bail 
that can result in his rearrest and re-detention -- I don't 
think the government can carry that weight or carry that 
burden. 
THE COURT:  So I'm very interested in this question.
It's a very interesting question.  As you may or probably know,
there are studies of recidivism, studies of recidivism directly
related to sex offenders.
I'll share with you what I've looked at because I
don't want you to think I'm researching on my own anything that
you are not aware of.  These are, I think, government-supported
studies that measure recidivism beyond 10 or 14 or 15 years and
that purport, if I read these studies, to show that the nature
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 33 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
of recidivism is not always that, oh, I'm not going to do this
conduct anymore.  It's more of a psychological aspect I would
say.
But they measure recidivism rates -- for example, one
study that I saw -- and I'll put this up on the docket so
you'll know what I was looking at -- measures recidivism at
five years, at ten years, and at fifteen years.
And the response, the percentage of recidivism
actually goes up at 15 years.  I'm not going to quote the
percent.  I know it, but I don't know how accurate it is, but
it is substantially higher than the recidivism rate at five
years, for example.
So all I'm saying is I don't think it's so clear that
with the passage of time, the presumption, so to speak,
evaporates or disappears.
There is other discussion in some of these studies 
that sex crimes are the most difficult to evaluate in relation 
to recidivism and a lot of other concepts because in sex 
crimes, victims very often don't come forward. 
This is not a phenomenon when we hear in this case or
even in another case on the news that where was the victim
then, didn't come forward.  That's not an uncommon phenomenon
having to do with a whole complex number of factors.  So a lot
of these cases are never reported.
I don't know that you can just draw the conclusion
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 34 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
that -- by the way, you're suggesting that the measure of
recidivism is a reported classic case by the prosecutor, state
or federal, indictment, etc., etc.
That may not even occur in most instances because a 
lot of cases that are even referred to prosecutor offices are 
never formalized or never brought. 
So I'm not sure that the passage of time, without more
and without more study and with let's say discipline of a
defendant -- I'm not sure that that gets us there.
MR. WEINBERG:  I guess I would have two responses.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. WEINBERG:  One, that the level of publicity
brought to Mr. Epstein and brought in this case and even
brought before the bringing of this case, his wealth which
makes him an attractive civil defendant as well as a criminal
defendant -- and there have been a number of complaints or
threats or notices or demands by different civil lawyers.
But there is an unprecedented amount of publicity that 
would mobilize and motivate people who were victimized by him.  
If there were any people victimized by him after 2005, it is 
utterly lacking in the average case where some victim doesn't 
know that they've got an ear, whether it's an ear of the civil 
bar or an ear of the United States Attorney, to receive, 
positively receive, and embrace an allegation against 
Mr. Epstein. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 35 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
And, two, again, without getting into in any way of
appreciating the gravity of these charges, the government
writes on page 2 of its submission, this was not a case --
again, putting the age of these witnesses and putting the
consent issue aside, it's not like he's an out-of-control
rapist.
He doesn't fit within the paradigm of many of the sex 
offenders that are the subject of the research that your Honor 
is accessing.   
THE COURT:  And I don't mean this personally directed
because I don't have any way of knowing one way or another of
Mr. Epstein, but the question is:  How do you know that?
MR. WEINBERG:  I know that because --
THE COURT:  You may say, he's my client, and I know
he's a good fellow and all that.
MR. WEINBERG:  I actually do think that if he was
unable to control his conduct, given the level of publicity,
we'd know it.  The government would know it.
But secondly, these 15 years have not been uneventful.
I think this goes also to rebut the notion that he is a flight
risk.  His house was searched in 2005 giving him notice that
the state authorities were conducting an investigation.
It was an intensive investigation.  It led in 2006 to 
the U.S. Attorney's investigation that itself was intensive.  
There were grand jury subpoenas.  There was an enormous amount 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 36 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
of attention by the FBI.   
He didn't flee.  This was all before the NPA while he 
was facing the very same 1591 and even additional statutes that 
carried additional potential federal penalties, interstate 
travel, interstate communications. 
Again, we have to infer from the past what the future
conduct would be.  I think it's important that he hired lawyers
to defend him.  He didn't run away.  
Despite the fact there was no bail, no conditions, he 
didn't have the publicity he has now, he could have, if he was 
a fleer, left at that time and done what the government fears 
he would do today if released under an enormous set of 
conditions that I will ask to supplement. 
Two is the next period was the NPA period.  Again, he
signed up to go to state jail, county jail.  He went to county
jail.  He got out in 2010.  He was subject to the
registrations.  
And if I can go back in to try and answer your Honor's 
questions on registration.  He has not reapplied challenging 
the New York Appellate Division or the New York Supreme Court 
decision.   
There was a legal dispute.  Mr. Epstein's counsel at 
the time believed that the classification in New York should be 
restricted to the offense of conviction.  And the Court 
determined that it would rely instead on an affidavit that it 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 37 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
had presented in the state of Florida that talked about other 
allegations leading to the tier three classification.   
New Mexico, as I understand it -- 
THE COURT:  Before you get to New Mexico, the court,
as I read -- and I did this morning.  So it's fresh in my
mind -- Judge Pickholz -- she relied on the state
administrative body that imposed, so to speak, or who in the
first instance said that a level 3 was the appropriate level,
after considering the series of factors which are reflected in
this transcript.
You know, judges often do just that.  She says in this
transcript that she's had many of these cases.  They're called
SORA hearings.  I must say it's -- I don't know what the word
is I'm looking for, but you'll read it yourself.
She was taken aback I have to say, really taken aback,
Judge Pickholz was, that this application was being presented
to her.  She says things like, I have never even the
prosecutor's office do this.  So the prosecutor joined in with
defense counsel.  I think Kirkland & Ellis and the ADA from
Vance's office joined together, and they both argued for
lowering the offense level from a 3 to a 1.
She says a few things like that which are pretty
unusual for a judge to say, in effect -- first of all, she said
the board made a recommendation.  And second, she seemed to be
suggesting that this was unique.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 38 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
The prosecutor, the DA's office, and the defense 
joining together in making such an application is very unusual 
I think is what she said.  And then on appeal, I think it was 
affirmed 5 to 0 actually.  They sit on panels of five.  So I 
was surprised. 
MR. WEINBERG:  It was, to my recollection, a legal
issue about whether or not the premise for a classification
decision should be the offense of conviction which would have
been consistent with a tier 1 or the overall investigation as
reflected by a probable cause affidavit that ultimately six
judges, the five on the appellate division and one on the
Supreme Court, believed was the appropriate barometer of sex
offender registration.
What's important is that Mr. Epstein has complied with 
the registration imperatives of each state of his residence.  
He's got the unusual circumstance of having multiple 
residences. 
His principal residence is the Virgin Islands which
has him at a tier 1 or the lowest level of classification.  New
Mexico he tried to register, and my understanding is that they
said that his nexus to the state did not require further
registration because his travels, his daily occurrences, were
being monitored by his principal residences.
THE COURT:  That goes back to the question I have, but
before I get there, we've gone far along.  Normally by this
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 39 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
time I would have said -- and I will say it now -- as you
pointed out, what I said the other day at our conference is
that when we get to the bail issue, we're going to have
conversations and discussions that sound like merits
discussions, and they aren't.
And I very much agree with you that the presumption of 
innocence everybody has to bear in mind, although sometimes 
it's a little difficult when we have these conversations to 
separate them out. 
It's just fundamental that Mr. Epstein is presumed to
be innocent now and until such time, if it comes, that a jury
or a court makes a determination of guilt.  So we always have
to remind ourselves of that, even though we're having these
conversations that seem to touch on merits discussions.
Back to Judge Pickholz, she says, among other things,
but the board found a level 3.  Then she goes on to say:  "I
have to tell you, I'm a little overwhelmed because I have never
seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this.  I have
never seen it."
So I read it today.  It came up, and I thought I'd
share it with all of you.  She's suggesting, although you're
making plausible legal arguments, that there is really no
basis, at least in her opinion, to reduce the level from level
to level 1.
What is the practical difference between a 3 and a 1
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 40 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
in terms of the registrant's obligations to appear or submit
reports or whatever?
MR. WEINBERG:  I don't think I can reliably respond
except to say that there was some discussion about whether or
not he was required to physically appear in New York.
And my understanding from the lawyers with personal 
knowledge is he was told that unless he was here nine or more 
days a month, he was not required to conform to the physical 
90-day appearance, despite being a tier 3. 
THE COURT:  He wouldn't have to come.
MR. WEINBERG:  Right.  Nobody has ever given him or
noticed a violation in almost ten years of daily monitoring.
He's not someone that just stays at one location.
I've got a stack from one of his lawyers that I won't 
burden the Court with about putting on record with the Virgin 
Islands, which is the principal monitor of his travels every 
day, what is the transportation, where is he going to be.  I 
see letters saying, we're delayed one day.  We'll be coming 
into Palm Beach on a certain day. 
The point being, I think, two:  One, there's been no
violation in nine years; that he's being carefully monitored.
He himself is extraordinarily careful not to trigger a federal
SORA or a state SORNA violation, and he hasn't.
Two, I think that speaks to his ability to be
disciplined, his ability to regulate his conduct consistent
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 41 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
with the mandates, whether it's an administrative agency or a
court's bail release order.
Three, I know of no other proceedings, in answer to 
the question your Honor asked -- I think it was question two -- 
like the proceedings in New York.   
I will verify that with the counsel in the different 
jurisdictions who can provide primary rather than secondary or 
hearsay evidence so we can give you in an additional submission 
some meaningful and particularized responses to your Honor's 
questions of this morning. 
THE COURT:  That would be helpful.
There are two things.  One is another disclosure on my
part.  I did happen to read in the New York Post a story about
the New York state sex offender registration.
The thrust of that story was that Mr. Epstein -- or at 
least it appeared to me to be the thrust -- was not in 
compliance with his obligations in New York. 
Again, it's a newspaper story.  I did see it.  I share
it with you.  You probably saw it too.
MR. WEINBERG:  I think I did.  I think that's where I
checked with counsel, and that's where I learned of this
nine-day rule which I was not familiar with before checking.
But what I can say is nobody on the New York side has 
ever informed Mr. Epstein, despite the now ten-day deluge of 
publicity, that he has ever been in violation.   
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 42 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
There has been no notice to his New York counsel.  And 
he has done everything in his power to meticulously conform to 
these multiple registrations and inform, through the Virgin 
Islands, of travel whether it's to Paris, whether it's to 
Florida, whether it's to New York.  I don't think there is a 
complaint in nine years that he has been in violation. 
THE COURT:  So is the point or one point that if he is
not here for ten consecutive days or more, he does not have to
report?
MR. WEINBERG:  Again, I don't want my credibility
resting on what I haven't personally verified.  I am told that
that is the criteria for physical appearance, whether that's
correct or not.  
I can tell you that from talking to counsel, there has 
been no notice that he should appear and no notice that he's 
been in violation, despite the recent media. 
THE COURT:  When you put together the supplemental
submission particularly about New Mexico, it was hard for me to
imagine, would New Mexico reach out to someone and say, oh, you
don't have to register here?
Or was there some form of application to be exempt or 
excused?  I don't know for sure. 
MR. WEINBERG:  My best knowledge is that registration
kicks in when your criminal justice sentence ends.  Therefore,
as soon as he was within weeks or months of ending the Florida
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 43 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
probation or community control part of the Florida state
sentence, he tasked lawyers to go to these different
registration boards in the states where he had residence.
It was complicated because of the multiple residences.  
And the ultimate decision in New Mexico -- and I can't tell you 
whether there was a period where he did register, but I can 
tell you that at a point in time very close to the beginning, 
New Mexico said, you don't need to register.   
I know he made an effort to register because the 
concern was that the federal registration statute requires that 
you contact the states where you reside. 
It was complicated because of the multiple residences,
and the last thing he wanted to do was to create a new offense
through an omission of the obligations under the federal SORNA.
So he went to New Mexico.  And I will particularize
the names of the people and the names of the lawyers, but he is
not required to register.  New Mexico knows he's there because
the Virgin Islands tells the different places where he travels
that he's coming.  He's under close supervision.
THE COURT:  I got it.
I think I sort of assumed something like that, that
counsel in different jurisdictions would have had a meeting or
filed an application or a letter or something or rather causing
the administrative agency to respond.
This is really now stretching my recollection.  I
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 44 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
thought I read in all of these papers somewhere that New Mexico
was examining its decision that he needn't be registered in
that state.
MR. WEINBERG:  It may be.  And if they advise that he
is to register --
THE COURT:  He would I'm sure.
MR. WEINBERG:  -- it is just an incremental additional
registration obligation because he's under so many in Florida,
New York, and the Virgin Islands.
The so other part of danger -- and I apologize.  I
will get to flight --
THE COURT:  No apology needed.
MR. WEINBERG:  -- is the government allegation that as
a result of the incident reports in Palm Beach dating back to
2006 that Mr. Epstein is a danger to others and should be
detained.
What I would respond to that is that the report -- and 
I showed Mr. Rossmiller a slightly better, unredacted version 
of page 86 of an incident report of Detective Recarey from the 
Palm Beach Police -- reflected that the date of the complaints 
by the parents was May 22 or May 23, 2008. 
It was the week that Mr. Epstein had hired new counsel
there which was a Mr. Jack Goldberger from West Palm Beach.
And Mr. Goldberger was scheduled, according to the incident
report, to meet with the representatives of the State
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 45 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
Attorney's Office.  So Lanna Belohlavek who was the head of the
sex offender unit of Mr. Kirshner's state attorney's office.
Mr. Goldberger -- again, this is hearsay, and
Mr. Goldberger can attest to it, if it's necessary -- was never
asked about this alleged incident.
The investigators, certainly not authorized by
Mr. Epstein, to go and drive people off the road.  There is
simply no proof that he authorized it or until discovery knew
it.  There was no charge against an investigator which I
contend there would be, given the intensity of this
investigation in Florida.
I can't explain what the facts are.  I see the report.
I see the claim.  But if the state attorney believed that a
representative of Mr. Epstein drove a parent off the road, I
don't think that would be missing in the negotiations between
his new counsel.
Then Mr. Goldberger was joined by Roy Black, a Miami 
attorney who I know well.  Mr. Black has never been asked about 
it or told about it and does not know the investigator.  
Mr. Goldberger doesn't know the investigator.  I have no other 
explanation, other than it doesn't rise to clear and convincing 
evidence. 
In terms of the wires that the government -- I think
that the government's language on page 11 of their submission,
your Honor, is most telling in terms of whether these wires
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 46 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
constitute the predicate of detention and the predicate --
THE COURT:  The $250,000 and the $100,000?
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.
The government says -- and I think they're being
candid in their language in the last sentence on page 11 --
that "Given the timing, it suggests" -- and I underline that
word -- "the defendant was attempting to further influence
coconspirators who might provide information."
So the government -- and I think they've been candid
today -- has not confirmed the witness testimony through
corroboration, through any other corroborative mechanism
whether this was an act of generosity or an act that somehow
was connected to what the government suggests might have been a
motive.
But this occurring when there was no pending judicial 
proceeding and no knowledge of a pending investigation doesn't 
rise to the level of a federal obstruction which requires the 
pendency or the foreseeability of a federal investigation under 
the Supreme Court's decision in Aguilar, A-g-u-i-l-a-r, a judge 
in California.   
We just contend that even when you look backwards to 
whether this constitutes an obstruction, the payment of an 
employee or the payment of a friend is simply not witness 
tampering because the Miami Herald ran an article.   
It simply doesn't rise to the level of a past crime 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 47 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
that your Honor has clear and convincing proof occurred, much 
less the predictive factor that if Mr. Epstein was released 
under the kind of combination of conditions, there would be any 
risk of his influencing adversely a witness, now that there is 
a federal prosecution.  That would be self-destructive.  It 
would constitute a crime with a nexus to what the statutes 
require.  
But the conditions also, your Honor, radically
limit -- we've asked your Honor for home detention, and I will
get to the monetary conditions and the risk of flight in a
moment.
We've asked for home detention.  We've asked for the
visiting list to be approved by pretrial, meaning almost nobody
except Mr. Weingarten and myself, Mr. Fernich, lawyers on our
defense team.
We would rip out the cell phones.  There is one line.
We consent to the monitoring of that line.  We consent to the
waiver of search and seizure.  These are the conditions that
have been accepted and, again, not always, Judge.  There are
detention orders.
I'm a Boston lawyer.  I remember arguing before the
Former Chief Judge Mark Wolf on behalf of a defendant who was
arrested about two months after an induction ceremony for
organized crime about 20 years ago.
And Judge Wolf found that along with financial 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 48 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
conditions, along with monetary conditions, the combination of 
home detention, monitoring, video cameras, a visiting list 
approved by pretrial, a waiver of search and seizure were more 
than sufficient to abate any danger, either of obstruction or 
of underlying criminal behavior in a case called, U.S. v. 
Patriarca. 
THE COURT:  That reminds me of another question.
Do you think that bail conditions equally apply to
risk of flight and/or danger to the community?  It strikes me
that they're different kind of concepts.
MR. WEINBERG:  I think your Honor is completely
correct.  There is an overlap.  I think the danger to the
community is abated more by a lesser list of conditions that I
don't even think the government would quarrel with, were they
not seeking detention.
We could work with the United States Attorney and
agree to conditions that would essentially eliminate danger
because he'd have no way to communicate, so long as the
government trusted that the lawyers who were visiting him were
not going to go and engage in license threatening misbehavior
which I assure you that Mr. Weingarten, myself, and Mr. Fernich
are not.
The conditions for flight, if I can turn to flight, I
contend deal directly with some of your Honor's questions about
the monetary conditions and some of the government's objections
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 49 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
to those that are offered.
So let me be as clear as I can.
THE COURT:  You might as well know what I'm thinking.
So respectfully, I don't think that the financial summary tells
me anything really.  For one thing, it's some unverified list
of assets, not audited, not certified, and not very detailed
either.
Mr. Epstein may be unusual, but there are no
obligations, for example, no debts, no expenses.  That,
depending on if that's true -- maybe he's debt free and
obligation free.  But that would impact whatever the list of
assets were if that were known too.
It seems to me you have to know a -- there needs to be
a fuller financial picture to know what would be appropriate.
MR. WEINBERG:  Let me be blunt.  It was our first
effort, and I am authorized to say to the Court that whatever
bond you want Mr. Epstein to sign, whether it's $100 million or
an amount close to the amount of the assets that we have
provided, Mr. Epstein is prepared to sign it.
He intends to appear.  Once he appears, the prejudice 
of a large bond is extinguished.  He's met its conditions.  The 
same with collateral.  Whatever collateral your Honor believes 
would disincentivize him -- again, it's a temporary lien on 
property that would be extinguished upon his appearance in 
court, and he fully intends to appear.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

Whereas, in our bail submissions -- and they were
admittedly rushed -- we did what we could amongst defense
counsel.  We want the Court to know that whatever monetary
conditions, Judge, you believe are necessary and appropriate to
meet the imperatives of the Bail Reform Act, which is to
reasonably assure his appearance.  
And I would go farther, to virtually guarantee his 
appearance, in combination with the home detention and 
monitoring and limitation of communications he would accept.  
He would sign any bond, and he would give your Honor and the 
United States District Court clerk whatever collateral the 
Court ordered. 
Likewise, were your Honor to consider monetary
conditions, we would provide a more particularized list
believing that monitoring his accounts and making sure that
they didn't fall beneath the level of the personal recognizance
bail would be appropriate.
Again, I think to some extent, I'm backing into the
answer to question three which is the sealing question and
whether the financial information should be public.  
I think if your Honor is to grant bail that includes 
the monetary conditions, then this becomes a judicial document 
that is at the heart of a bail release order, and the public is 
entitled to it. 
I think if your Honor is to determine that release is
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 51 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
not appropriate, despite all of the conditions that we argue
provide a compelling basis for both safety and appearance, that
I don't think the financial conditions information should be
other than confidential because it wasn't at the heart of the
judicial ruling that the public would want to understand.
THE COURT:  I'm not sure I understand why it comes in
sort of heads, I win/tails you lose.  Or no?
If it's a public interest and no harm in releasing it
and if you were to get bail you would happily release it.  But
if you didn't, you wouldn't, I don't really get why it wouldn't
just be disclosable in either case.
MR. WEINBERG:  It's two reasons really.  One is that
the financial information, if provided to pretrial, is
confidential and to be used by the Court for bail
determinations.  Two is there is an enormous public interest --
THE COURT:  That's true even if I determined that
there should be bail.
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.  But I do think, as
much as I'm not urging the Court to disclose it, I think there
are overriding considerations that if your Honor were to
release a man on bail, the public has a right to know the your
bail conditions -- how they correlate to a man's wealth.
If a man has a billion dollars -- and he doesn't.  If 
your Honor were to set a $20 million bail, that's an enormous 
bail for someone with $21 million but not an enormous bail for 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 52 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
someone with more.   
I think in the First Amendment common law it would be 
a judicial document of importance to explain a judicial 
decision.   
However, there are countervailing weights, not only 
the bail, the pretrial statute and its confidentiality but also 
that we are facing a trial some day.  And I know it's early, 
but there's an enormous amount of publicity, and every fact 
that is generated by this proceeding becomes the bases of an 
enormous amount of articles. 
It's one thing to say Mr. Epstein is wealthy.  That's
a kind of generic.  It's another thing to be chasing down
values and accounts.  And for that reason, we ask the Court not
to publish it unless it's a predicate for your Honor's release
decision.
And, similarly, if the government is to give you a 
sample of the seizures, we would make the same request, that 
this may be evidence some day and that it's the kind of 
evidence that would burden his future right to a fair and 
impartial jury in the Manhattan venue. 
Judge, unless there are other questions, I would just
conclude by saying that in my many years at the bar, I've read
many detention requests and I've heard many detention
arguments.
Mr. Rossmiller writes eloquently and speaks 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 53 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
eloquently.  I've heard the government in different venues, 
including this one, talk about extraordinary risks of flight 
and extraordinary danger and to diminish the persuasiveness of 
the set of combination of conditions. 
Madoff was released on bail.  He surrendered.  Dryer
called the colossal fraud by Judge Rakoff -- he surrendered and
went to jail.  Mr. Skilling from the Enron fame went to jail
for 24 years.  
I recently had a case with Judge Furman where the 
government was arguing for detention that were associated with 
somebody in a different country.  And he granted bail over 
detention, and those defendants came to court and were 
sentenced and went to jail.   
I'm sure there are examples that the government here 
can point to that certain people that can't comply with 
conditions.  But an enormous amount of people facing detention 
requests honor their obligations, particularly when conditions 
are set such as the conditions that Mr. Weingarten, 
Mr. Fernich, and I have just mentioned to the Court. 
THE COURT:  Of the cases you just mentioned, were any
of them presumption cases like this one?
MR. WEINBERG:  I can't say they are, your Honor, but I
do believe that presumption becomes just a factor when the
burden of production is negated by in this case the 14 years of
non danger to the community and the danger prong and by
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 54 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
Mr. Epstein's compliance and not fleeing an almost elaboratory
setting where in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, Mr. Epstein was
facing the same vigorous U.S. attorneys.
It wasn't until the negotiations that he knew that 
they were open to a negotiated resolution.  But until then, he 
was facing the same power of a very large, very resourced 
United States Attorney's Office.   
I did want to address the last point which is the
private security point, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. WEINBERG:  I'm familiar with your Honor's
decision.  I've read it several times regarding the citizen of
Turkey and Iran and Macedonia that had foreign passports and no
ties to the United States except he was arrested while visiting
Disneyland, who lied to pretrial about his background which
Mr. Epstein did not.
He's not that man.  Before we even get to the issue of
whether or not your Honor would reconsider your strongly felt
feelings about whether or not the additional condition, on top
of all of the other conditions of money and home detention, the
additional conditions -- I could frame it as a trustee, which
is somebody that the U.S. Attorney would respect, be credible,
living at Mr. Epstein's home, and making sure that there were
no violations.
I know the government would say that's like a
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 55 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
bracelet.  It's just a head start.
THE COURT:  I was going to ask about that.
So there is a suggestion in the bail package that two
trustees would be living with him.  I have not experienced
anything like that before, either in reality or in an
application.
Mr. Weingarten reminds me that a representative of the
company that has been approved by other courts for the security
prong is here and could speak to that condition, whether it's a
trustee condition or whether it's a private guard condition.
But I did want to make one point about the law because 
I know your Honor knows the law better than I.  Judge Bianco 
and your Honor and maybe several other judges are on one side 
of a debate.  Judge Rakoff and maybe other judges on another.   
I read carefully the Second Circuit decisions.  There 
are three of them.  The most recent one actually is the 
Esposito decision where the court says that a private guard in 
that case is appropriate because he wouldn't be a flight risk 
but for his wealth.   
So there isn't this kind of invidious discrimination 
between somebody who is poor and someone who is wealthy because 
if a person is poor, even someone in Mr. Epstein's position, 
the government would not be making the same kind of flight 
arguments that are predicated upon his wealth.   
So they uphold the private guard saying it doesn't 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 56 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
reach the decision some day the Second Circuit may have to 
address about whether or not a wealthy person should be denied 
release because the private guard condition somehow is more 
like detention than release. 
We need him released, Judge.  This is an enormously
challenging case for his defense counsel.  The government is
hugely resourced.  They've got over a million pages of
discovery.
He's in the SHU unit.  It's not a condition that 
somebody can defend themself.  And Mr. Epstein's goal, like it 
was before, is to hire counsel to defend him and to work with 
counsel closely to exercise his presumption of innocence, to 
defend himself in a principled way in a courtroom, and not to 
flee.  And I would urgently ask your Honor to consider our bail 
application. 
THE COURT:  I will.
MR. WEINBERG:  Thank you, Judge.
THE COURT:  I will consider and reconsider.
On that point, I noticed that was the last paragraph I
think in your letter -- I'll examine that again too -- here is
my reaction.  I don't know if this is legally sustainable or
not.  I will look at the cases.
You have all these people or have had on Rikers Island
who can't make a thousand dollars bail, for example, and they
have every right to consult with their lawyer, perhaps even
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 57 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
more so than someone who is educated and privileged, and they
might need it more.
I think everybody has the same right, but it's very 
hard.  If the test is consult with counsel, well, then all this 
other conversation we've been having is out the window because 
everybody has a right to consult with counsel, and we have to 
come up with a new set of cases and a new set of tests. 
By the way, don't think I don't appreciate that a
defendant should be counseled and should be able to consult
with counsel.  But if that's the standard, then what are we
going to tell all those people who can't make a $500 or $1,000
bail who say, I want to talk to my lawyer because the
immigration authorities are going to come and take my wife
away, etc., etc., separate the kids.
MR. WEINBERG:  I have three answers to that too.
THE COURT:  I'd like them.
MR. WEINBERG:  That's an important question.  The
first is that the defendants in Rikers Island, or at least the
vast majority of them, are not facing a prosecution team as
well resourced and as talented as this one.  They're not facing
a million pages of discovery.  There may be exceptions.
THE COURT:  They might be facing a lot more serious
consequences in terms of jail or incarceration for let's say
assault or murder or rape or whatever, and many of them do face
those consequences.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 58 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
MR. WEINBERG:  I do understand, but it's the
complexity and the magnitude of the pretrial preparation, not
just the sentencing consequences that requires us to put that
issue before the Court.
Second, I'm not here to say there should be those kind
of monetary conditions.  I know, at least in my state, the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, there's a movement that I read
regularly about in the Boston Globe -- maybe it's similar
here -- to stop that state practice.
THE COURT:  It is.
MR. WEINBERG:  Third, the Bail Reform Act, the federal
Bail Reform Act of 1984, has a provision saying that a
defendant should not be denied release based on their inability
to satisfy a monetary condition.  So I think to some extent
Congress disapproves of locking someone up because there's a
$500 bail that they can't make.
I'm 73 years old.  I grew up in the Warren Court
where life was different, and the criminal justice system got
politicized to some extent.  I think there is almost the
reaction to the excess, the overcriminalization, the
overimprisonment that characterized the 1980's and the war on
crime and the war on drugs.
So I at least stand here, as someone with over 45 
years of observation, and believe and hope that one of the 
areas that we begin to reverse the excess is in keeping so many 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 59 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
presumed innocent people in jail, whether it's Rikers Island or 
the MCC.   
I again passionately urge your Honor to consider 
Mr. Epstein's release.  Thank you so much for the time, Judge. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Anybody else?  Did you want to comment?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  If we could just briefly respond,
your Honor.
THE COURT:  Also I know if there are going to be any
more submissions in response to today, can you do them by noon
tomorrow?  Is that reasonable?
MR. WEINBERG:  5:00 would be easier, given my travel
obligations, Judge.  And I do want to meet the government's
reference today to a 1982 passport when he was 28 years old
that expired over 30 years ago.  I'd rather address that when I
have some more time.
THE COURT:  5:00.
What about you, Mr. Rossmiller?  Are you going to
respond?
I don't know if there are open issues, but there are 
some instances where you're entitled to rest on the record,  
but the search of the East 71st mansion, there might be some 
evidence from that. 
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, I can tell you certainly
we'd be prepared to file anything additional by tomorrow at
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 60 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
5:00.  That's no problem.
THE COURT:  Fair enough.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  I can't say whether we will, but
we'll certainly re-examine the record.
THE COURT:  So you'll look at the record, so to speak,
and what we discussed here today and see where there could be
some more strength in terms of evidence.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Yes, your Honor.
Just very briefly to respond, and I'll try to go sort
of lightning round through some of these.
Starting at the very beginning with this issue of
being able to prepare a case having access to counsel, the idea
that detention impairs the ability to prepare a defense -- this
is certainly a challenging case.  It's a significant case.
This Court has significant experience with precisely
that type of case with a detained defendant in Zarrab.  In that
case, I think the Court saw -- and the country and the world
saw -- that it is eminently possible for a defendant to have
excellent, excellent counsel and every opportunity to consult
with that counsel while detained and while detained here.
I'm not specifically familiar with the conditions of
Mr. Zarrab's detention, but my general understanding is that
there were concessions made with respect to his ability to
review documents and have space.
Those are certainly factors that we're willing to be 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 61 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
in touch with the defense about.  But there is a proven, 
existing example for how that works and how that works well. 
What the defendant is asking for here is for special
treatment to build his own jail, to have his own private jail
that he gets to stay in away from everybody else who is in jail
and have him be limited in his own gilded cage surrounded by
people with guns, surrounded by trustees with cameras on all
sides of his house.  A person who needs those conditions should
be detained.
Second, the issue of whether the case was brought to
us, whether this was funneled to the Southern District of New
York from anywhere else, your Honor, it was not.  It was not
brought to us by anyone else.
We opened the case.  We investigated the case.  By 
"we," I mean the FBI, CBP, the NYPD, and of course the U.S. 
Attorney's Office.  We opened the case.  We investigated the 
case.  And I can tell you that not one of the prosecutors 
sitting at this table has spoken with anyone at the Southern 
District of Florida. 
The issue of the Department of Justice appeal by the
defendant is a distraction from the bail determination,
your Honor.  The chain of events that defense counsel describes
makes clear that the Department of Justice did not have a role
in negotiating the NPA.
It didn't have any role in confirming if other 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 62 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
districts were aware of it, which there is no evidence that 
they were.  The approval of jurisdiction to contemplate federal 
charges and a federal NPA, as the defendant tried to wiggle out 
of this agreement after it had been signed, is different from 
having the NPA apply outside of the Southern District of 
Florida which it does not.   
What they're describing is a normal appeal process, 
and there is an entirely separate process for getting coverage 
outside of the relevant district, and what they're describing 
ain't it.  It didn't happen here. 
Your Honor, the defense has kept coming back to this
idea of 1591 being enslavement, of pimping people out, of
people servicing individuals 15 to 20 times a day as they
mentioned in one of its submissions.  Quintessential sex
trafficking is sex trafficking that is met by the elements of
the crime which we have here.
The defense said we don't have consent here or putting
the issue of consent aside.  Your Honor, it's underage girls.
It's underage girls that are involved in this case, and it's
underage girls who are the victims.  To say that consent is
some sort of a separate issue that we should ignore is
offensive, frankly, and it's not supported by the law.
Moving along, with respect to compliance following a
prior conviction rebutting the presumption, it's easy to figure
out why that's not the case, your Honor.  I'll explain why.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 63 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
Here's how we know that it's not the case that someone 
who doesn't commit a crime for 15 years, if that is the case 
here, but for someone who has not been convicted of a crime for 
years, that that establishes the rebuttal of presumption.  
The reason we know that's not the case is because 
someone who is 70 years old who is arrested for the very first 
time who's lived a law-abiding life for 70 years is still 
subject to the presumption. 
So the idea that if you're convicted of a crime and
then you're not convicted of a crime for a while, that that
itself rebuts the presumption, really turns the presumption on
its head.  That simply doesn't make any sense, your Honor.
With respect to the idea that it's old conduct which
is related, the statute of limitations goes very far back.  And
in fact, there is no explanation for this type of crime.
Congress has decided that if you commit sex crimes 
against children, you will have to look over your shoulder for 
the rest of your life.  And that's as it should be, your Honor.  
Certainly there is no argument here from the defense regarding 
the statute of limitations. 
The defense has argued a couple different times about
a couple different things that if there was a crime, it would
have been charged.  So in discussions of obstruction, in
discussions of witness tampering.
Your Honor, the idea that if there was misconduct it
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 64 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
would have been charged is particularly rich in this case.
There are plumes of smoke as to those particular issues, and
the Court can reasonably infer that there is fire.
The idea that Mr. Epstein was feeling particularly 
generous to his old friends and associates days after the Miami 
Herald published a series of articles about his misconduct and 
the circumstances leading to his non-prosecution agreement is 
not credible, and the Court shouldn't find it to be credible.  
Finally and most importantly, this idea that the
defendant has disciplined himself, the defendant is asking the
Court to risk the safety of the community on the
self-discipline of a man they appear to concede has a
preference for underaged girls.  
This idea that he has disciplined himself is a 
concession that the defendant has a problem, that he has an 
appetite for children.  Your Honor, the defendant keeps telling 
on himself here.   
They concede that the government will be able to show 
the elements of the crime.  They concede that he has to 
discipline himself to avoid committing the types of crimes he 
has before.   
They say that he didn't flee because he thought that 
there was the potential he would be -- I'm sorry.  They say he 
didn't flee despite the fact that he thought there was a 
potential to be charged.   
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 65 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
That's not consistent with the explanation that he had 
no idea that there was a federal case that would be brought 
when he made the payments to his old associates. 
The fact is, your Honor, the defendant thought he'd
gotten away with it.  And the government really put its money
where its mouth is on this issue of notice and of the covert
nature of the investigation.
This investigation was going on for months, and the 
government took extraordinary efforts not to have the defendant 
find out about it, and he didn't.  And neither did anyone else 
until the case was unsealed. 
Any number of people in this court who would have
loved to have reported the fact of this investigation, and it
didn't get out because the government was concerned that the
defendant would flee as we continue to be now.
Your Honor, this is the Southern District.  The
defendant is indicted.  He is in a grave position, and he has
every motive and every means to flee if he's released.
THE COURT:  I have one question of you.
In your submission -- I think it was in your most
recent submission -- you mentioned that you had been contacted
by victims or their counsel probably or perhaps and that they
were of the view that there should not be any bail, any
release.
Are you aware if any of them wish to be heard?
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 66 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
Mr. Boies?
MR. BOIES:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Hold on one second.  Mr. Boies, just wait
until we finish with them.
I take it that the answer is yes? 
MR. BOIES:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Go ahead.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, my understanding,
including from representatives of the Boies, Schiller law firm,
is that victims have expressed the views that we conveyed to
the Court.
I was not aware of any victims or victims' counsel who 
wished to be heard today, though we have made efforts to reach 
out to a variety of victims and counsel. 
THE COURT:  That's fine.  I'm just asking you, and
Mr. Boies wishes to be heard on behalf of them.  I think that's
perfectly fine.  I think it's just fine.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Understood, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Counsel, did you want to get the last
word?
MR. WEINBERG:  Just two brief matters.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. WEINBERG:  First, the government has been
repeatedly saying that Mr. Epstein concedes the elements or the
evidence.  That's simply not so.  He's going to defend this
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 67 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
case.
Second, there's an inherent contradiction between the
government's tying these two payments by Mr. Epstein in
November and early December of 2018 to witnesses as if these
are akin to an attempt to influence a witness.
If the government's position has any reality to it,
that Mr. Epstein reads an article and perceives that a friend
may be a witness, then that provides pretty strong evidence
that Mr. Epstein was concerned about an investigation.  
Even if the government kept it secret and yet he 
repeatedly flew not just out of the country but into the 
country with the knowledge, with the belief, again, if the 
government can tie these payments to an understanding, an 
intent to effect a future investigation, that provides fairly 
eloquent evidence, your Honor, that Mr. Epstein does not intend 
to flee.   
And his conduct between November and December 3, 2018, 
and the present is the antithesis of a defendant who wants to 
flee.  He was arrested flying into Teterboro from Europe. 
Lastly, Mr. Joseph Jaffe is here, your Honor.  If
your Honor in any way wanted him to inform the Court what
services he and his company can provide to better or to be one
of the multiple conditions that we've offered the Court as a
condition of release, he is here.
THE COURT:  I could ask you through him or him

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
directly.
MR. WEINBERG:  I'd rather you ask him, your Honor.
Thank you.
THE COURT:  Then we'll get to Mr. Boies.
By the way, before we do, does everybody here except
me know who the two people are who got the $250,000 and
$100,000 checks?
MR. ROSSMILLER:  Your Honor, we've advised defense
counsel who those individuals were.  Yes.
THE COURT:  Can you tell us.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  We're not prepared to make that
statement currently, your Honor.
MR. WEINBERG:  Generically, your Honor, they're
long-time friends and employees of Mr. Epstein.  One is a
friend.  One is an employee.
THE COURT:  Okay.  The only question I really have --
MR. ROSSMILLER:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I apologize
for interrupting.
I should say the government is more than happy to 
advise the Court of that information in a sealed submission.  I 
just don't want to reveal the names of potential witnesses and 
frankly potential victims in open court at this time. 
THE COURT:  So you know them, and the defense knows
them as well.
MR. ROSSMILLER:  We're happy for the Court to know
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 69 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
them, but that's not something that we're prepared to file
publicly.
THE COURT:  Is that okay with you if he submits
something?
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  So the only question I have of you is
these trustees or guards -- are they armed?
MR. JAFFE:  They will either be armed or unarmed as
the U.S. Attorney and defense counsel agree, and we will follow
that order, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Got it.
Mr. Boies, you're going to get the last word here.
MR. BOIES:  May it please the Court, your Honor.  I'll
be very brief, and I apologize.  I wasn't planning to speak
today.
But there was one thing that I wanted to clarify for
the Court that came up, and I would like one of the victims
that I represent who is here in court to be able to just speak
to you for 60 seconds.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. BOIES:  The matter that I wanted to clarify is
that counsel for the defendant indicated that there was no
proceeding pending at the time that the payments of $250,000
and $100,000 were made.
It's true that there was no federal criminal 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 70 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
proceeding against him pending, but we had a case pending 
against him at that time.  And we were in the middle of 
discovery, and we had situations in which we had witnesses who 
were cooperating with us and then were contacted by either 
Mr. Epstein or his lawyers and who then stopped cooperating 
with us.  So I thought the Court ought to have that piece of 
information. 
THE COURT:  So that sort of supports the idea that
payments were made or at least the inference that one could
draw to keep people silent.
MR. BOIES:  Yes.  I don't personally know to whom they
were made, and I have been given no explanation as to why they
were made.  
What I do know is that this was a time when we had 
intensive evidence to take depositions and discovery and 
interview present and former employees of Mr. Epstein.   
We had experience where if we contacted somebody and 
we actually had some conversations with them, then Mr. Epstein 
would get them a lawyer, and they would stop cooperating.  That 
proceeding was still going on at the time that these payments 
were made. 
If I could just introduce you to Annie Farmer who is
one of our clients who would just like to speak very briefly to
the Court.
THE COURT:  Sure.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
MS. FARMER:  Hello, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Could you help us out and spell your first
and last name.
MS. FARMER:  Yes.  Annie Farmer, A-n-n-i-e
F-a-r-m-e-r.  
I was 16 years old when I had the misfortune of 
meeting Jeffrey Epstein here in New York.  He later flew me to 
New Mexico to spend time with him there.   
I wanted to voice my support for the government's 
request that his bail not be set and also just my reaction to 
the fact that the defense was claiming that it would be perhaps 
easier for victims or more likely for victims to come forward 
given the publicity and some of the other issues surrounding 
this case.   
Well, I would say that it would be quite the opposite; 
that his wealth and privilege and the notoriety of the case 
would actually make it I think often more difficult. 
Also that they now were arguing that the discipline of
this time, but yet we know that they have found photos of young
women in his home and that if he's continuing to engage with
pornography of young women, I would say that would be quite the
opposite of disciplining.
Also those victims in the photographs are continuing
to be victimized.
THE COURT:  Are you in a position to answer this
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 72 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
question?  Are you saying that Mr. Epstein engaged in sexually
inappropriate conduct with you?
MS. FARMER:  He was inappropriate with me.  He was
inappropriate with me.  I would prefer not to go into the
details of that at this time.  Yes.
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.
MS. FARMER:  You're welcome.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, may I also be heard?
THE COURT:  Absolutely.
MR. EDWARDS:  Brad Edwards.  I represent Courtney Wild
who wishes to make a statement today to the Court.  Let me just
give you a brief context.
THE COURT:  Could you just for a minute spell her
name.
MR. EDWARDS:  Sure.  Courtney, C-o-u-r-t-n-e-y, Wild,
W-i-l-d.
Just for context, I have represented her since 2008 in
a civil action as lead counsel that we filed against the
United States Attorney's Office under the Crime Victims' Rights
Act where we have alleged and now proven that the previous
non-prosecution agreement was structured in violation of the
rights of many of the victims.
Courtney Wild was the Jane Doe in that lawsuit.  And
for that reason, she has a particular interest in this case.
We want to first say we appreciate your Honor's acknowledgment
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 36     Filed 07/24/19     Page 73 of 74

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
of the Crime Victims' Rights Act and the rights of the victims,
particularly the way in which they're being treated in this
particular process which is different than last time.
So with that, if your Honor had any questions to
educate the Court on the CVRA case, I would answer them.  But
otherwise, she would just like to make a statement.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Absolutely.
MS. WILD:  Hi, your Honor.  My name is Courtney Wild.
I was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein starting at the age of
14.  And I would just like to ask the Court to not grant him
bond, to keep him in detention just for the safety of any other
girls out there that are going through what I'm going through.
It is a public case, and it's just -- he's a scary person to
have walking the streets.
THE COURT:  Where did that occur?  The sexual
inappropriateness.
MS. WILD:  In Palm Beach, Florida.
THE COURT:  Great.  Thank you so much.
MS. WILD:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  I think that concludes our work for today.
I'll hopefully see you all on Thursday.  Thanks very much.

letter, index, folder title, or other identifying designation, 
are deemed "Highly Confidential Information." 
10. 
Highly Confidential Information contains images 
of nude or partially-nude individuals. 
The Government's 
designation of material as Highly Confidential Information will 
be controlling absent contrary order of the Court.

course of proceedings in this action: 
a) 
Shall not be disseminated, transmitted, or 
otherwise copied and provided to Defense Counsel or the

member of the defense team (i.e., attorneys, experts, 
consultants, paralegals, investigators, support personnel, and 
secretarial staff involved in the representation of the 
defendants in this case), all of whom are nonetheless bound by 
this Protective Order.

the record of this case, Defense Counsel shall return to the 
Government or securely destroy or delete all Discovery,

(212) 805-0300
J7irepsd                 
         (Case called) 
THE COURT:  I had hoped to have a written decision and
order by now, which I don't, one that is regarding the
release/remand of Mr. Epstein, which has been the subject of
multiple written submissions and, as you all know, an in-court
hearing on Monday, July 15, 2019.  It is not quite physically
produced yet and it needs to be cite checked, but I should have
it on the docket in the next hour, two hours at most.  What I
will do, however, is state the conclusions in the decision and
order, which I had said I would do, and summarize very briefly
the contents of the ruling for you.
Starting with my conclusions, the government's
application for continued remand is hereby granted and the
defense application for pretrial release is respectfully hereby
denied.  Written opinion to follow.
In that opinion I will deal with all, I'll try to, all
the principal issues which have been briefed.  Even though it
is not entirely necessary or legally required to consider both
dangerousness to others and to the community as well as risk of
flight, I have done so.  I also deal with the defense's
proposed bail package.  There is obviously significant public
interest in all of these legal issues, so I tried to cover them
all as best I could.
There are the following headings in the decision and
order.  First is a background section, followed by counsel's
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 40     Filed 07/26/19     Page 2 of 6

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J7irepsd                 
submissions.  Those are the written submissions: principally
the indictment, the legal principles governing release versus
remand, the presumption of remand in 18 U.S.C. section 1591
cases, danger to others and the community.  This topic has
seven subsections and fills over ten pages of the decision and
order.  I think it is fair to say that it is the heart of this
decision, that is to say, dealing with danger to others and to
the community.
Then I deal with risk of flight.  That has four
subsections or factors, which are substantially the same
factors that are used to analyze dangerousness.
Then, finally, the bail package proposed by the
defense.  Specifically, I find in the decision and order that
the government has established dangerousness to others and to
the community by clear and convincing evidence and also that
the government has established risk of flight by a
preponderance of the evidence.  I also reject the proposed bail
package as irretrievably inadequate and go on in some detail
concerning what I consider to be its deficiencies.
Incidentally, I am not suggesting that a different
bail package would be appropriate because I doubt that any bail
package can overcome danger to the community.
I focus then on dangerousness to others, most
certainly including the minor victims in this case and
prospective victims as well.  I cite and quote, for example,
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 40     Filed 07/26/19     Page 3 of 6

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
(212) 805-0300
J7irepsd                 
the compelling testimony of Annie Farmer and Courtney Wild, who
testified that they fear for their safety and the safety of
others if Mr. Epstein were to be released.
I also point out that the presumption of remand, as
opposed to the presumption of release, is unusual in our
jurisprudence and that it attaches only to very serious crimes,
such as sex trafficking involving minor victims, as in this
case some allegedly as young as age 14.
I also discuss evidence of intimidation and threats
and compensation paid to potential witnesses and the facts
surrounding whether or not Mr. Epstein has been compliant with
his legal obligations as a registered sex offender.
When discussing risk of flight, which you obviously
can tell comes after, in my analysis, dangerousness to the
community, when discussing that aspect, risk of flight, the
decision speaks to the seriousness of the charged crimes, to
Mr. Epstein's great wealth and his vast resources, which
include private planes and frequent international travel and
also a foreign residence in Paris.
I mention the items very recently seized from Mr. 
Epstein's New York City mansion pursuant to lawful search 
warrants, which include sexually explicit photos and discs, 
some $70,000 in cash, diamonds, and an expired Austrian 
passport with Mr. Epstein's photo but with a name that is 
different from Jeffrey Epstein, and also contains a reference

to Saudi Arabia as a residence. 
I think I have given you a fair account of the
decision and order.  As I said before, the written version in
its complete form, which will be about 30 to 34 pages long I
imagine, I hope will be available reasonably soon.
One piece of business in light of today's ruling.  I
thought I would schedule a conference with the parties for
Wednesday, July 31, at 11:00 a.m.  That is not fixed in stone.
If you all want to meet and confer and let me know if that is a
convenient date, or I'm happy to accommodate you with another
date as well.
For the moment, I'll tentatively schedule a conference
for July 31st at 11:00 a.m. and ask if there is an application
for exclusion of speedy trial.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  The government moves to
exclude time under the Speedy Trial Act from today's date until
July 31st.
THE COURT:  I am going to find under 18 United States
Code section 3161 that adjournment to and including July 31 at
11:00 a.m. is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the
adjourned time from speedy trial calculations.  I further find
that the exclusion is designed to prevent any possible
miscarriage of justice, to facilitate these proceedings, and to
guarantee effective representation of and preparation by all
counsel for both parties, both sides.  Thus, the need for
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 40     Filed 07/26/19     Page 5 of 6

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of the
public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18
U.S.C. section 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B).
Finally, a word about the proposed conference.  From
my point of view, it would be more or less a scheduling/case
management type conference, but I'm happy to consider any
issues that you might have at that time.
I think that's it.  Everybody, thank you for being
here.  We are adjourned.

THE COURT:  So, today's conference was scheduled at
the end of the July 18 court conference hearing on that date.
I thought that we would devote at least the -- well, probably
most of today's proceeding to talking about the schedule in
this case, and I asked the lawyers to get together and see if
they could come up with a mutually agreeable schedule, which
would include trial date, motion practice, discovery, etc.
Does anybody want to let me know how you made out?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
We have conferred with defense counsel and talked 
about a proposed schedule for this case.  So we are prepared to 
propose to the court today a schedule for discovery, for 
discovery-related motions, for pretrial motions, and we are 
also prepared to talk about setting a possible trial date. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  What have you got in mind?
MS. MOE:  So, with respect to discovery, we would
propose a discovery deadline of October 31 to complete
discovery, with one exception.  There are materials from
devices seized from the defendant's residence in New York, and
the F.B.I. is beginning the process of reviewing that data.
In discussing that with defense counsel, we have begun 
to discuss a process for a privilege-review protocol.  It's 
possible that process may take longer than October 31.  But 
aside from that universe of documents, we would propose setting 
a schedule of October 31 as a deadline for discovery. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 42     Filed 08/06/19     Page 2 of 10

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j7v2espC kjc
For discovery-related motions, we would propose that
the defense file any motions that they are aware of relating to
discovery, to include motions relating to the nonprosecution
agreement, by September 13 --
THE COURT:  By when?
MS. MOE:  September 13, your Honor.
-- that the government be permitted to respond by
October 4; with any reply due on October 11, as necessary.
Of course we understand that if the defense comes to
have additional motions related to discovery based on the
ongoing discovery process that we will confer and propose an
additional briefing schedule beyond that, as necessary.  But
with respect to motions that the defense is already aware of,
including the NPA, that is the schedule that we would propose
at this time.
Regarding pretrial motions, your Honor, we would
propose that the defense file their motions by January 10, that
the government be permitted to respond by February 10, and that
any replies be due on or before February 24.
THE COURT:  Got it.
MS. MOE:  And finally, your Honor, we are prepared to
discuss a trial date in this case.  The government is asking
the court to set a trial date in this matter.  We would propose
that the court schedule this matter for trial in June of next
year, and we estimate that the trial would take approximately
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 42     Filed 08/06/19     Page 3 of 10

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j7v2espC kjc
four to six weeks, and so that trial date would carry into
July.  And I understand that the defense has some comments
about that proposal, but that's the government's proposal with
respect to a trial date.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me hear from the defense.
Do I understand it correctly that, with the exception
of the trial date, those dates are agreeable?
MR. WEINBERG:  Those dates are agreeable, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Counsel, whatever you wish to add, that
would be fine.
MR. WEINBERG:  We would ask the court to set a
preliminary trial date immediately after Labor Day.  I say
preliminary because we want time to assess Mr. Epstein's --
THE COURT:  This year?
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes.
THE COURT:  This Labor Day.  Okay.
MR. WEINBERG:  We want time to assess Mr. Epstein's
ability to . . .
(Counsel confer) 
MR. WEINBERG:  I'm sorry.  I am being told that your
Honor was inquiring as to the year.  Let me --
THE COURT:  Yes.  I thought you wanted a speedy trial,
and so --
MR. WEINBERG:  Not with a four- to six-week trial with
discovery coming in October, Judge.  I apologize for being
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 42     Filed 08/06/19     Page 4 of 10

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j7v2espC kjc
imprecise.  Labor Day 2020 or immediately thereafter.  And I
make that recommendation -- we haven't received the discovery
yet.  Understandably, it is coming, and I'm not in any way
contesting that there has been a delay, but we haven't had an
opportunity to start reviewing what the government has
predicted to be over a million pages of discovery with
Mr. Epstein and to assess Mr. Epstein's ability to exercise his
constitutional right, while at MCC, in assisting counsel
prepare for a very difficult case that addresses events that it
is alleged occurred 14 to 17 years ago.
THE COURT:  Okay. 
MR. WEINBERG:  So, we need time to receive a million
pages of discovery and to prepare to defend a four- to six-week
trial, when a lot of the immediate attention is going to be on
the very unique and complex constitutional issues connected to
the nonprosecution agreement, our contention that the
government's allegations are inextricably intertwined and
constitutionally barred by the NPA.  There are double jeopardy
issues both connected to the conspiracy count, which looks to
be an overlap with one of the charges that was expressly within
the immunity provisions in the NPA.  We are going to be
spending a lot of time, and that's why I agreed with the
government that we should make early discovery motions on the
NPA-related issues, on double-jeopardy-related issues, so that
we could not only facially brief the motion to dismiss, but
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 42     Filed 08/06/19     Page 5 of 10

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j7v2espC kjc
have the discovery, the subfacial discovery, if you will, so
that we could make a comprehensive briefing along the lines of
the schedule for motions.
THE COURT:  That's what I was going to suggest, if
there is a time period when you could put it all together, as
it were, and there is a lot of flexibility.  So I will leave
these dates, you know, for now.
With respect to the trial date, I could accommodate
either June or September of 2020.  The issue is not so much as,
from my point of view, when you are all ready, but what part of
the calendar I block out.  So is it realistic to block out time
in June?
MR. WEINBERG:  I think it is -- I don't want to have
the court block out a six-week time and then come to the court
in March and say we need a continuance and risk a September
date.
THE COURT:  Got it.  Okay.  So a September date, you
are saying, sounds like it certainly is realistic.
MR. WEINBERG:  Thirteen months sounds like the amount
of time that we would ordinarily need to prepare a case of this
magnitude and scope.
THE COURT:  All right.  That is fine for me.
Just while we are taking care of details, a speedy 
trial issue or application?  Why don't we extend it to 
September of 2020? 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 42     Filed 08/06/19     Page 6 of 10

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j7v2espC kjc
MR. WEINBERG:  This case certainly meets all of the
statutory criteria for complexity and we would agree to that
extension, Judge.
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, may I briefly be heard with
respect to the trial date?
THE COURT:  Oh, sure.  You know, it does sound like it
is kind of premature, but I'm happy to hear you.  It is often
the defense that is ahead of the government, or not often, but
equally, but here it is the other way around.  So if the
defense is not ready, it would be my practice to defer to the
defense, but I don't know that it is fixed in stone either way.
But, sure, I am happy to hear you.
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, by way of background, we had
initially proposed to the defense a May trial date.  We think
that there is a public interest in bringing this case to trial
as swiftly as manageable.  We understand, given their concerns
in wanting to have more time, we proposed a date in June as a
compromise position.  We understand if the defense has
indicated that they need additional time.  We are sensitive to
those concerns.  But we do have a concern about the notion of
setting a September trial date and that that trial would be
preliminary or as a placeholder.  Thirteen months is a
considerable amount of time for a case of this nature to go to
trial; and, again, given the time period of the charged conduct
and the length of time that's passed, we do think that there is
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 42     Filed 08/06/19     Page 7 of 10

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j7v2espC kjc
a public interest in scheduling a fixed trial date in this
case.  Of course we understand if issues arise in the interim,
we will address that as it occurs, but we do think it makes
sense at this juncture to set a firm trial date.  We don't
think that any delay in this case is in the public interest.
THE COURT:  Counsel.
MR. WEINBERG:  We think that the delay in bringing
this charge, your Honor, the natural corollary of that is to
make it more difficult, not easier, for us to defend
Mr. Epstein.  For instance, there are certain sealed files for
potential witnesses that we would have to go to other courts to
seek to unseal.  There is an NPA to litigate.  This case is not
your ordinary 1591 case.  A case of four to six weeks is not
the ordinary amount of time the government takes to prosecute,
whether it is old or new cases.  We need 13 months.  I'm trying
to make a principled argument, Judge, that that would be a
schedule that we would try our best to meet, conditioned on our
ability to work with Mr. Epstein under the current conditions.
Thank you, sir. 
THE COURT:  Okay.
So, we are going to monitor the case from now until 
then anyway, so I think everybody will be in a better position 
to know what is realistic with respect to a trial date.  I will 
exclude time from today through, let's say, June 8, but that, 
of course, is without prejudice to hearing from the defense and 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 42     Filed 08/06/19     Page 8 of 10

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j7v2espC kjc
the government as to actually where things stand.  Long before 
then we will know.  So we will have a conference, or several, 
between now and then.  Let's see where everybody is as the 
months go by, and then we will know when we can effectively 
hold the trial. 
So I am going to find, under 18 United States Code §
3161, that the request for adjournment, joined in by both
sides, is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned
time from Speedy Trial calculations.  I further find that the
exclusion is designed to prevent any possible miscarriage of
justice, to facilitate these proceedings, including extensive
pretrial preparation, and to guarantee effective representation
of and preparation by counsel for both sides, and thus the need
for exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of
the public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18
United States Code § 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B).  So that exclusion
goes to June 8, 2020 preliminarily.
Counsel, is it your thought that these motions would
be on submission or did you want to have oral argument with
respect to any aspect of them?
MR. WEINBERG:  We would seek oral argument, your
Honor.
THE COURT:  So let's set October 28, 2019 for oral
argument, and I am tentatively reserving some time on my
calendar, as I said before, on June 8, 2020, but I will have a
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 42     Filed 08/06/19     Page 9 of 10

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
j7v2espC kjc
much better feel for where things are long before that and
certainly I would say on October 28 we would have a much
clearer picture of how things stand.
So there you have it.  Did you have -- go ahead.
MS. MOE:  Just to clarify, your Honor, what time would
the court like the parties to appear on October 28?
THE COURT:  10 a.m.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  And the June 8 date is 9 a.m.  Okay?
MR. WEINBERG:  Would your Honor want to schedule an
argument on the substantive motions that will be fully briefed
before the court on February 24?
THE COURT:  Yup.
So let's schedule that oral argument for March 12,
2020, at 10 a.m.
Great.  So anything anybody else has to talk about?
MR. WEINBERG:  Not from the defense, your Honor.
MS. MOE:  Not from the government, your Honor.  Thank
you.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. WEINBERG:  Thank you very much, sir.
THE COURT:  Nice to see you all.

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, 
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m. 
Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and 
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a 
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at 
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. 
At this time, there are no preliminary repo11s identifying the exact cause of death. An 
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the 
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively 
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has 
requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter 
as well. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 44     Filed 08/14/19     Page 2 of 2
MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and 
the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. 
Sincerely, 
Warden

Thank you for your letter of Augu~t l 0, 2019 rcgarcHng the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. 
Epstein's death iis a tragedy to everyone involved in his case. 
One open question, among others, is whether the investigations referenced in your 1.etter 
will include th~ incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23,2019., To my 
knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what the BOP concluded abo\lt that incident.

Indictment 
Cr.

(the 
"Indictment") 
was 
returned, 
charging 
JEFFREY

while the above-

Because JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died while

issued, 
the Indictment must be dismissed under the rule of 
abatement. See United States v. Wright, 160 F.3d 905, 908 (2d Cir. 
1998) .

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
As the Court is aware, on the morning of August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein died while in 
custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On August 16, 2019, and after conducting an 
autopsy, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York issued a statement 
identifying the cause of death as hanging, and the manner of death as suicide. In light of the death 
of the defendant prior to a conviction becoming final, the Government must request the Court 
approve the attached proposed order of nolle prosequi. 
Consistent with our practice throughout this case and our obligations under the Crime 
Victims' Rights Act, the Government has made efforts to contact all identified victims since 
learning of the death of the defendant and will similarly notify all known victims of the attached 
order, once entered. As this Office has previously stated publicly, it remains committed to doing 
its utmost to stand up for the victims who have already come forward, as well as for the many 
others who have yet to do so.

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 51     Filed 08/27/19     Page 2 of 4
RELIEF REQUESTED 
Relator/ Intervenor requests seizure of the politically corrupt organization USDOJ; associated 
with abuses of prosecutorial discretion, fraud, and public corruption. Intervenor has witnessed the 
same pattern of political/ judicial corruption at work in his own case; and has now identified the same 
conspiracy at work in this case. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
• 
Intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2012/2013, 
Intervenor filed a whistleblower complaint with the Washington State Auditor's Office. The 
complaint was escalated to Michael Horowitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A 
Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration). OIG refused to investigate the 
complaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges 
that Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered 
that State of Washington concealed this information so that "Democrats" and Republicans could 
launder $70 billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through 
intervenor's attorneyz. 
• 
On 12/27 / 19, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the 
False Claims Act, seeking $1 billion in damages and qui tam bounty against "Democrats", 
Republicans, and his former attorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby 
attached by Declaration (first 2 pages only)). 
• 
On 5/1/13, USDOJ submitted a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor's claim (See EXHIBIT C Case 
1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration), falsely stating that intervenor's allegations 
"lack sufficient factual and legal support." 
• 
On 5/13/19, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against Bill Barr and other USDOJ attorneys 
for conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby 
attached by Declaration). 
• 
On 5/14/19, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct., 
after fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case 1:19-CR-
00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration).

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 51     Filed 08/27/19     Page 3 of 4
• 
On 5/15/19, Intervenor had his petition for quo warranto against USDOJ for fraud/ obstruction/ 
perjury dismissed as "moot" (See EXHIBIT F Case l:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by 
Deel a ration). 
• 
On 6/6/19, Intervenor identified the conspiracy (the same conspiracy at work in this case) to the 
District Ct. (Freemasonry/ Rotary; See EXHIBITS G and H (EXHIBIT H affidavit 1112-17) Case 1:19-CR-
00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration). The conspiracy is subject to the unequal application of 
the laws; and the conspiracy monopolizes the judiciary. 
• 
On 6/26/19, the District Court refused to vacate its decision, and threatened Intervenor with 
sanctions if Relater appealed the decision (See EXHIBIT I Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached 
by Declaration). Relater appealed. 
• 
On 7 /27 /19, Intervenor sent USDOJ attorneyz the 9th Circuit mediation form (See EXHIBIT J Case 
1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration), showing the course of action Intervenor 
intended to pursue on appeal. Intervenor also indicated that he intended to write about USDOJ's 
unlimited "prosecutorial discretion" to fraudulently dismiss False Claims complaints, as this 
"prosecutorial discretion" was the same "prosecutorial discretion" exercised by USDOJ and Alex 
Acosta in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Intervenor also attached an article by the former Deputy 
Attorney General of the United States (Donald Ayer), indicating that Barr was a "fierce advocate of 
unchecked presidential power''. Intervenor also identified the judge in the District Ct. (formerly 
presiding over Intervenor's case), as being associated with the conspiracy. 
• 
According to newspaper reports, on 7 /29/19, Jeffrey Epstein was taken off suicide watch. 
• 
According to newspaper reports, on 8/10/19, Epstein was found dead. 
ARGUMENT 
Intervention in criminal matters "have been granted in limited circumstances where 'a third party's 
constitutional or other federal rights are implicated by the resolution of a particular motion, request, or 
other issue during the course of a criminal case.
111 United States v. Col/yard, case no. 12cr0058, 2013 
WL1346202 at *2 (D. Minn. April 3, 2013 quoting United States v. Carmichael, 342 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 
1072 (M.D. Ala 2004). 
Here, just 3 months prior, Relater filed a petition of quo warranto against Bill Barr/ USDOJ for fraud, 
perjury, and treason. The judge in the District Ct. denied Relater (and the People) the right to quo 
warranto, and dismissed Relator's complaint to "moot" the quo warranto proceedings (Relater is 
entitled to this right under the 9th/10th Arndt.). Further, Relater has been denied constitutional and 
other legal rights as provided for under the pt, 41\ 5th, and 14th amendments, the Crime Victims Act, 
MOTION TO INTERVENE - 3

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 51     Filed 08/27/19     Page 4 of 4
and the substantial law. Intervenor has been denied these rights so that the conspiracy can continue 
laundering tax money. Intervenor has already proven that USDOJ/ OIG are politically corrupt federal 
agencies, as intervenor filed a whistleblower complaint with WA State Auditor and OIG in 2012/2013 
because he was worried about structural bridge collapse. As a result of filing this complaint, intervenor 
had his career and reputation destroyed by OIG, State of WA, and his attorneyz. Relator has already 
shown that OIG/ USDOJ agencies cannot be trusted as they specialize in fraud and deception (see 
complaint No CV 18-6051 on Pacer for the entire complaint). 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, and the fact that USDOJ and OIG have already been proven by relator to be 
politically corrupt agencies, G. respectfully requests that the Court approve his motion, and surrender 
USDOJ to relator. 
The obstruction of the quo warranto proceedings and the "apparent acquittal" for USDOJ, has resulted 
in the "apparent suicide" of Jeffrey Epstein while under USDOJ / Bill Barr watch. Relator has already 
demonstrated/ proven that USDOJ/ OIG are corrupt and assisting Republicans and "Democrats" to 
launder tax money. Intervenor's motion should be granted.

So just some housekeeping.  We have a podium here for
both attorneys and others who may be speaking, and so we would
like you, attorneys and others who are speaking, to come up to
the podium.  This room is a little cavernous.  We thought the
podium over there would be more comfortable.
For starters, and for this you don't have to go up to
the podium, if you could just indicate your names.  This table
in front to my left, your right, are defense counsel, and that
table to my right, your left, are government attorneys.
If we could just ask the attorneys to introduce 
themselves. 
MS. COMEY:  Good morning, your Honor.  Maureen Comey
and Alison Moe for the government.  Joining us at counsel table
are Special Agent Amanda Young of the FBI and Detective Paul

THE COURT:  Great.
Again, good morning to all of you.  This hearing that 
we're having today considers the government's motion to dismiss 
the indictment in this case.   
I must add that it also serves as the opportunity for 
me to thank all of you, the attorneys and the victims who are 
here today, among others, for your very hard work and 
dedication in this case. 
We also have here today the U.S. Attorney for the
Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, who has also
been very helpful and indispensable in this matter.
The news on August 10, 2019, that Jeffrey Epstein had
been found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center, at the MCC, was certainly shocking.  Most of you, and
myself for that matter, were anticipating that the next steps
in this case would be defense motion practice, including a
motion to dismiss, followed by a trial on the merits before a
jury, if the motions were not successful, and through which the
accusers and the accused would come face to face, allowing
everyone to get their day in court.  Mr. Epstein's death
obviously means that a trial in which he is a defendant cannot
take place.  It is a rather stunning turn of events.
The government's motion to dismiss the indictment
because of Jeffrey Epstein's death on August 10, 2019, is
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 3 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
relatively straightforward.  In my view, a public hearing
clearly is nevertheless the preferred vehicle for its
resolution.
Incidentally, while I'm on this subject, I got some
help today from the New York Law Journal from two professors
who write that a hearing is -- let me tell you exactly what
they said.  They say, in part, that this is an odd moment for
transparency in a criminal case.  I think that is an odd
sentence to hear about, transparency in a criminal case.
They go on to say that normally, if a prosecutor seeks 
to dismiss an indictment for such an obviously worthy reason, 
the court would simply grant the request.  As to that 
statement, I respectfully say it is incorrect as a matter of 
law. 
They go on to say the judge would not schedule a
hearing and he definitely would not allow the victims to speak.
If he did hold a hearing, whatever informational interests the
victims may have would be served by affording them a chance to
attend the hearing, not by giving them a speaking role.
I read it.  It was incredulous.  I'm still
incredulous.  I don't quite understand at all.  There is a
suggestion in the article that the reason they are making these
suggestions has to do with minimization of drama in this case.
In the Jeffrey Epstein case, there has not been much a
minimization of drama, and what little drama might happen
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 4 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
today, I don't think it would be very significant.
On a somewhat more serious note, don't quote me on
this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of
that article is himself counsel in one of the Epstein-related
cases.  I was surprised to learn that very recently.  I'm
certain it is true.  I was also surprised that that aspect was
not disclosed in the Law Journal.
But in any event, I think you know where I'm heading.
I respectfully disagree with the Law Journal piece.  I was
saying that the government's motion is relatively
straightforward, and in my view, a public hearing is clearly,
nevertheless, the preferred vehicle for its resolution.  I'm
still convinced of that.
A few may differ on this, but public hearings are
exactly what judges do.  Hearings promote transparency and they
provide the court with insights and information which the court
may not otherwise be aware of.
The victims have been included in the proceeding today
both because of their relevant experiences and because they
should always be involved before rather than after the fact.
Indictment 19 CR 490 charges Jeffrey Epstein with sex 
trafficking and with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.  The 
U.S. Attorney, on August 19, 2019, requested that the court 
approve the government's proposed order of nolle prosequi.  I 
think that's a rough justice.  That means nolle prosequi, 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 5 of 86

J8RsEPS1                           
discontinuance by the prosecutor of all or of a part of the 
case that he or she has commenced. 
The government in its motion concludes that Epstein's
death abates these proceedings.  In accordance with Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b), I determined to hold a public
hearing and I notified the victims that they would be given the
opportunity to be heard before any final action on the motion.
That is the purpose also of today's proceeding.  I would do
that every time.
Also, recognized that Epstein, Mr. Epstein died before
any judgment of conviction against him had been obtained, and
that the government's proposed order appears, in form and
substance, to be appropriate.
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a) codifies the
nolle prosequi process.  It is entitled dismissal, and it
states in relevant part that the government may, with leave of
the court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint,
and that leave of the court proviso, you should know, was added
as an amendment to the original draft of Rule 48, which had
originally provided for automatic dismissal upon the motion of
the government.
This proviso, in my judgment, is clearly directed 
toward an independent judicial assessment of the public 
interest in dismissing the indictment.  Thus, even whereas, in 
this case, the standard of court review is deferential, the 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 6 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
court must still make its own independent determination.  A 
conclusory statement from the government that dismissal is 
appropriate does not satisfy the court's obligations. 
It is also, in my view, required that the court
consider the views of the victims in the case at the hearing
and before deciding whether to grant the motion.  This is being
done here both as a matter of law and as a measure of respect
that we have for the victims' difficult decisions to come
forward in this matter.
In a case called United States v. Heaton,
H-e-a-t-o-n-, the government filed a Rule 48 motion for leave
to dismiss a charge against a defendant who allegedly committed
a sexual offense against a young victim.  Although I should
point out, very importantly, that that defendant was still
alive, which distinguishes it from our case.  
Nevertheless, I think it is irrelevant because in 
evaluating the Rule 48 motion, then district Judge Paul G. 
Cassell -- who is now a law professor at the University of Utah 
and is regarded to be a noted expert in victims' rights -- 
concluded that under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, victims 
have broad rights that extend to a court's decision whether to 
grant a government motion to dismiss under Rule 48. 
I completely share that viewpoint in these
circumstances, even though the facts of our case, as I said,
are somewhat different from those in Heaton.  I believe it is
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 7 of 86

the court's responsibility, and manifestly within its purview,
to ensure that the victims in this case are treated fairly and
with dignity.
The fundamental substantive principle which applies in
considering the government's motion is termed the rule of
abatement.  This principle originated in the English common
law.  It was adopted by most U.S. federal courts, but more
recently, it has faced some appropriate criticism.  The rule of
abatement is best explained in the Second Circuit case of
U.S. v. Wright.
In that Wright case, two defendants had pled guilty to 
embezzlement and tax evasion.  Both defendants appealed, but 
one of the defendants died while his appeal was pending in the 
Second Circuit.  The Court of Appeals rule that under the rule 
of abatement, the judgment of conviction against the deceased 
defendant was required to be vacated and the indictment was to 
be dismissed.  The Wright court held that when a convicted 
defendant dies while his direct appeal as of right is pending, 
his death abates not only the appeal, but also proceedings had 
during the course of the prosecution. 
The Second Circuit incidentally has also held that
when a criminal conviction abates upon the death of a
defendant, any restitution ordered as a result of that
conviction must also abate, and it is also ruled the same with
respect to associated forfeiture orders.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 8 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
This latter application of the rule of abatement
regarding forfeiture has not been universally accepted among
federal courts, but it certainly is the law in this circuit.
Some of you may be interested to know that some United States
courts, state courts, have criticized the rule of abatement,
particularly in the face of growing recognition of victims'
rights in the criminal justice system, including the Crime
Victims' Rights Act.
It has been written and contended in the Brooklyn Law
Review -- I can give you the cite later -- that when courts
abate criminal convictions, they reimpose a burden on victims
that legislatures intended to alleviate through these victim
rights statutes.  The state Supreme Court has even concluded
that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides
the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of
abatement.  It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and
its constitution now require the criminal justice system to
accommodate the rights of crime victims.  Further, that the
abatement of criminal convictions has important implications
for these rights.
But coming back to our case, which is what you are
concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude
that if the rule of abatement applies to a convicted defendant
as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the
Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 9 of 86

J8RsEPS1                           
Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction.
So that's just some background I wanted to share with
you.  At this point in time, I would like to turn to the
government prosecutors to hear from them in support of their
Rule 48 application to dismiss the Epstein indictment.
MS. COMEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
Would you like me to address the court from the 
podium? 
THE COURT:  If you wouldn't mind.
MS. COMEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
I believe your Honor has accurately summarized the
state of the law, as set forth in our papers, in light of the
clear Second Circuit law, that upon the death of a defendant
before a final entry of a judgment of conviction, all
proceedings must be abated.
In light of that clear law, the government is legally 
obligated to seek dismissal of the pending indictment against 
Jeffrey Epstein, and we respectfully submit, likewise, that the 
entry of the proposed order is similarly required by law. 
A few notes to make about that, though, your Honor.
To be very clear, dismissal of this indictment as to Jeffrey
Epstein in no way prohibits or inhibits the government's
ongoing investigation into other potential coconspirators, nor
does it prevent the bringing of a new case in the future or the
prosecution of new defendants.
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 10 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
It also does nothing to prevent the government from
continuing to explore the possibility of seeking civil
forfeiture of any assets that were used to facilitate the
crimes charged in this indictment.  Indeed, as has been stated
publicly, investigations into those matters have been ongoing,
remain ongoing, and will continue following dismissal of the
indictment here.
I would also like to note that, as the government has
previously mentioned, this dismissal in no way lessens the
government's resolve to stand up for the victims in this case,
both those who have come forward and those who have yet to do
so.  We agree with your Honor's sentiment that those victims
should be respected, and we appreciate your Honor's recognition
of that.
One housekeeping matter that I did want to reference
for your Honor.  The protective order in this case requires
destruction or return of any and all discovery material upon
conclusion of the case.  We have been in communication with
defense counsel, who have confirmed that they have returned all
physical copies that they have of discovery that the government
has produced to date, and they are in the process of deleting
any copies that they may have made.  So the parties are in
compliance with the protective order.
Finally, I just wanted to say a word about the victims
in this case, and particularly those who are here in court
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 11 of 86

J8RsEPS1                           
today.  I'll note that in light of the court's order indicating
that the victims and their counsel would be permitted to be
heard in court here today, the government has endeavored to
provide notice to all known victims of today's proceeding.  We
did so either directly where a victim was not represented by
counsel or through counsel where a victim is represented by an
attorney.
The government does not know exactly how many victims
or their attorneys are here today and we do not know how many
of them or their counsel would like to speak.  To the extent
any individuals do wish to speak, we do not know the substance
of what they would like to say.  We have left that entirely up
to the individual decisions of the victims and their attorneys.
I will note, though, that throughout this case, the
government has endeavored and done our utmost to fulfill our
obligations under the Crimes Victims' Rights Act.  We have done
so by trying to keep as many victims as we are aware of up to
date about the ongoing case and about any developments in the
case.
We will continue to provide services and offer 
services to any of the victims in this case, even after the 
indictment is dismissed.  Both the U.S. Attorney's office and 
the FBI have been in touch with all known victims or have 
attempted to be in touch with all known victims, either again 
directly where victims are not represented by counsel or

through counsel where they have attorneys.  We have expressed 
to them that services are available for those who wish to take 
advantage of them. 
Unless the court has any questions for me, the
government will otherwise rest on its papers.
THE COURT:  I just have one question.
The protective order, is that self-executing or do I 
need to do something? 
MS. COMEY:  It is self-executing, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thanks very much, Ms. Comey.
MS. COMEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Yes.
I'll turn to counsel for the defense at this time.
Mr. Weingarten, I'm happy to hear from you.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Thank you.
Your Honor, I think it is an understatement of the
year to say the world looks and feels differently today than it
did the last time I was before you.  For us, the elephant in
the room is what happened to our client.  I would like to tell
you how we see the world and where we are on that subject.
We start with the Attorney General's statements,
public statements, that there were very serious improprieties
in the jail.  We obviously read the press.  We see that the
warden has been taken out.  We see that the guards on duty at
the time have been put on leave.  We understand guards are
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 13 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
refusing to cooperate with the investigation.  We have heard
allegations that people at the time who had responsibility for
protecting our client falsified information.  We understand
that there were orders out there that Jeffrey Epstein was never
to be left alone and that the orders were ignored by many of
the employees of the prison.
In a word, yikes.  In addition, obviously we followed
the medical examiner's report, or we haven't followed the
report, we haven't seen it, but heard conclusions, initially
not enough evidence to come to a conclusion, wanted to see
more.  We assumed she was talking about the videotapes, but
then came to the conclusion that it was suicide.
We report to the court that -- 
THE COURT:  Suicide by hanging --
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.
THE COURT:  -- was her conclusion?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.  
And we report to the court that we had a doctor there 
at the time, and we also have been in receipt of a tremendous 
amount of medical and scientific evidence volunteered to us 
opining that the injuries suffered, as reported, were far more 
consistent with assault than with suicide, and we are happy to 
supply the court with all the information that we have. 
Now, in addition, as the court noted, we were underway
with our pretrial motions, and as the court obviously
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 14 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
understands, the NPA and the role of the NPA was going to be
critically important.  And I would simply like to report that
we went pretty far along.
We interviewed all of the relevant lawyers on the 
defense side who participated in the NPA, and we were satisfied 
that we had a very strong argument that every one of those 
lawyers believed with an objective basis that the deal was 
global.  That is, at the time -- 
THE COURT:  I'm sorry, that?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  The deal of the NPA was global.  That
is, more specifically, at the time, the Florida prosecutors and
agents knew of conduct in New York, and that no competent
defense counsel negotiating in good faith with the prosecutors
would have ever agreed to a deal back then that allowed New
York prosecutors to indict for precisely the same conduct in
the future, which, of course, is what happened.
In addition, we have come up with very powerful
evidence, we believe, that Florida prosecutors, who
participated in the deal, steered the victims and the alleged
victims to New York on more than one occasion because they did
not want to suffer the sleights of attacks against them.  So we
have advanced the ball on this very subject and we are prepared
to completely report to the court as to where we are and what
we've done.
Another point.  We obviously had contact with our
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 15 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
client at or around the time of his death, and obviously the
attorney-client privilege survives death and we are not going
to forfeit the privilege, but we will report to the court, with
as much specificity as the court may want, that at or around
the time of his death, we did not see a despairing, despondent
suicidal person.  Details to follow, if the court wishes.
The 800-pound gorilla, for us, of course, are the
video surveillance tapes.  Obviously we assume there is a tape
that leads directly to the door where Jeffrey Epstein was
housed.  If that tape reports for 12 hours before his death
that no one went in and out of that room, then the suggestion
that there was something other than a suicide seems
preposterous.
But there is no such evidence that has surfaced to 
date.  Just the opposite.  We have heard, and we actually read 
in the press, that the tapes were either corrupted or not 
functioning.  Talk about a yikes.  If, in fact, the system was 
broken for six months before Jeffrey Epstein was housed, I 
mean, that would be stunning incompetence.  If it was allowed 
to continue to be inoperative when Jeffrey Epstein was housed, 
it would be incompetence times ten.  But what if the tapes only 
broke down or were inoperative or were corrupted on the day he 
was killed or the day he died?  Then we're in a completely 
different situation. 
So where does this lead?  I think where it leads,

J8RsEPS1                           
Judge, is there are incredibly important questions that remain
open.  The public interest in this matter is obvious from this
courtroom.  There are conspiracy theories galore.  We are all
for finding the truth.  We believe this court has an
indispensable role to play.
Whether or not this indictment is dismissed, I think
this court has the inherent authority to find out what happened
on its watch.  Obviously, when the court detained Jeffrey
Epstein, the court did not anticipate that weeks later he would
be dead in his cell.  I think given the inherent authority of
the court, the court should make inquiry.
This could come in many forms.  Obviously the court 
made inquiry as to what happened in the first incident.  When 
there was an allegation of an attempted suicide, the court made 
inquiry.  The court obviously was interested. 
I recall your language.  You talked about that being
one of the several open questions indicating an interest on the
court for the others as well.  Obviously, the ultimate question
is what happened to the client.
THE COURT:  You're talking about the July 23, 2019
incident?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.
The court obviously could hold hearings.  The court
could assign a lawyer to help the court.  I think this is an
area where there is intense public interest.  We have complete
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 17 of 86

J8RsEPS1                           
confidence in the prosecutors in the Southern District and the
FBI to do a competent investigation.  But these are allegations
against serious components of the United States Department of
Justice.  Sometimes the appearance of justice is just as
important as justice itself.
I think the court supervising, or at least keeping an
interest in this proceeding, is incredibly important for the
public to have confidence in the ultimate findings, and
certainly for us to have confidence in the ultimate findings.
One more issue, Judge.  The conditions of the jail, in
a word, they were dreadful.  Not just for Jeffrey Epstein, but
for many of the prisoners over there.  This is a prison within
the shadows of this courthouse.  The situation is rife with
vermin.  The abuse and the conditions in that prison, in a
word, are a disgrace and everybody knows it.
A person with authority told us, someone with 
knowledge, that the prisoners in Guantanamo -- and he spoke 
with personal knowledge -- are treated better than the 
prisoners right across the way.  The feds certainly know how to 
run a disciplined, clean prison.  I've been in 20 of them.  
They know how to do it just fine.  And the question is, why in 
the world does it not happen down the road?  I think that is a 
perfectly legitimate subject for the court to make inquiry.   
In a word, we want the court to help us find out what 
happened.  The court has a role to play.  It is the institution

J8RsEPS1                           
that most people have confidence in in these very troubled 
times.   
So whether or not you dismiss the indictment, to us, 
is beside the point.  We want you to stay on the case, we want 
you to conduct an investigation, and we want to know what 
happened here. 
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Just so it is clear, so your view on the
motion directly on its merits of the nolle prosequi order and
application by the U.S. Attorney, do you have a view on that?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  I think if the court felt that the
case had to stay alive for the court to continue, we would
oppose it.  I think --
THE COURT:  I'm sorry, if what?
MR. WEINGARTEN:  If the issue, if you took the
position for you to conduct the investigation or lead the
investigation or participate in the investigation, then we
want, the role we want you to play, if the indictment has to be
alive, we would oppose the motion.
I don't think you need to do that.  I think you can
dismiss the indictment.
THE COURT:  So you're suggesting that you support the
government's motion, just viewed in the context of --
MR. WEINGARTEN:  Yes, of course.

MR. WEINBERG:  Judge, if I can just supplement?
THE COURT:  Absolutely.
MR. WEINBERG:  Thank you, sir.
Thank you, as an out-of-town lawyer for the privilege
to appear in front of you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  It's my pleasure.
MR. WEINBERG:  First, as to the conditions, we think
your Honor trusted the government, the Bureau of Prisons, to
keep our client safe and keep him in civilized conditions.  The
government will again ask, as to other defendants, that they be
detained at the MCC, some subset of them will end up in the SHU
unit.
It is a horrific.  I've called it medieval.  There's
vermin on the floor.  There is wet from the plumbing.  There is
no sunlight.  There is limited exercise.  It is simply
conditions that no pretrial detainee -- and I would go farther
as a criminal defense lawyer -- no United States defendant
should be subjected to.
Certain judges have taken views of the conditions.  We 
would urge your Honor, the government talks about and we talk 
about transparency, to see what kind of conditions there exist 
within 50 or 100 yards of one of the great United States 
district courts. 
Second, in terms, we have a profound problem with the
conclusions of the medical examiner.  There are for three
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 20 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
reasons, your Honor.
One is the timing of Mr. Epstein's demise.  It was on
August 10.  On August 12, a bail pending appeal motion was
being filed in the Second Circuit.  On August 12 or 13, the
United States Attorneys were going to respond to our request
for the preservation and production of documents that would
have facilitated and furthered our efforts to demonstrate
communications between the Southern District of Florida, the
Northern District of Georgia, which was standing in the shoes
of the Southern District of Florida main justice and the
Southern District.
In other words, we were beginning the process 
discharging our responsibilities.  There had been no new 
evidence that Mr. Epstein had committed any offense against a 
minor after 2005.  The subject matter of the New York 
prosecution was squarely within the heartland of the Florida 
NPA.  We had a significant motion to dismiss.  This was not a 
futile, you know, defeatist attitude. 
Third, we had all the discovery motions that your
Honor had scheduled.  So the timing for a pretrial detainee to
commit suicide on August 10, when his bail pending appeal
motion is being filed on August 12, strikes us as implausible.
Second, we had an independent doctor who was present
at the autopsy which occurred on August 11.  On August 11, the
city medical examiner's findings were inconclusive.  We are
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 21 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
told by a very experienced forensic pathologist that the broken
bones in Mr. Epstein's neck, in his larynx, are more consistent
with external pressure, with strangulation, with homicide, if
you will, than with suicide.  It doesn't exclude suicide, but
the pure medical forensic evidence creates profound issues
about what happened to him.
Also the time of death.  Our medical examiner's
opinion is it occurred at least 45 minutes and probably hours
before 6:30 a.m. on August 10, when he was first found, if you
will, according to the reports.  Yet he was moved, something
that is not ordinary in these circumstances.
I would also --
THE COURT:  Excuse me.  He was moved?
MR. WEINBERG:  Instead of having the cell in the
condition it was found, if he had been dead for 45 minutes or
two hours or four hours, there were efforts to move him and,
therefore, make it more difficult to reconstruct whether or not
he died of suicide or some other cause.
I spoke to Stacey Richmond, who is a responsible
member of this court who represents the family of Mr. Epstein.
She spoke to the medical examiner on the Friday after
Mr. Epstein's death and asked why, if the conclusion was made
late in the afternoon on Friday that week.  She specifically
asked about what extrinsic nonmedical evidence caused the
medical examiner to go from uncertain to suicide, and she was

            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
told that the medical examiner had seen nine minutes of one
video which was on a stairwell between floors at the MCC.  She
was told that the principal video that would have showed the
whole hall was corrupted.  It was in DC with the FBI to see if
they can reconstruct it.  
And I asked the same questions that my co-counsel did, 
you know, was the dysfunction of the critical pivotal video, in 
the most secure prison east of Florence, out in Colorado known 
to the MCC before August 10, or was this corruption occurring 
on August 10, which would again cause us to be skeptical of the 
servitude of the medical examiner's conclusions that this was 
suicide rather than some other cause. 
So with my co-counsel, we ask your Honor, it is not a
question of trust or not trust.  They ask you to detain people
and you trust the Bureau of Prisons.  And it is within your
inherit authority, your Honor, to find out what happened to our
client.
We are angry about the conditions he was held in.  And 
we're also angry, quite frankly, your Honor, that the only 
source of information that we get as to what happened to him is 
through the media rather than through the United States 
Attorney's office.  We've made requests informal.  We have 
made Touhy requests.  We've been told there is a pending 
investigation.   
But we trust your Honor and the judiciary, and with

all due respect, we believe there is an inherent and central 
role, a pivotal role in your Honor to find out what happened to 
a defendant in a case before the court, whether or not the 
court grants the nolle pros today or whether it holds it 
pending an investigation into Mr. Epstein's death. 
We're not here without significant doubts regarding
the conclusion of suicide.  We are not here to say what
happened.  We don't know what happened.  But we deeply want to
know what happened to our client.
Thank you, sir.
THE COURT:  And you, as Mr. Weingarten, have the same
view of the nolle prosequi motion?
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  OK.
MS. COMEY:  Your Honor, may I respond to some of those
points?
THE COURT:  Sure.
MS. COMEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
Just briefly.  With the exception of the noting that
the defense does not have an objection to the government's
motion, virtually everything else that defense counsel just
argued, respectfully is completely irrelevant to the purposes
of today's proceeding and to the motion that is pending before
your Honor.
As an initial matter, the question --
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 24 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
THE COURT:  Well, it may be.  Well, I don't know.  You
say irrelevant.
It is a public hearing, and I think it is fair game 
for defense counsel to raise its concerns. 
MS. COMEY:  Certainly, your Honor.  But it is
irrelevant to whether or not the motion should be granted.
THE COURT:  Right.  I get that.
MS. COMEY:  I would also note that the question of
Mr. Epstein's death is the subject of an ongoing and active
investigation, as has been publicly noted, by a separate team
of Assistant United States Attorneys from the Southern District
of New York, separate from the team who is handling this
prosecution, as well as a separate team of FBI agents.
There is an ongoing and active grand jury 
investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein's 
death.  It is the function of a grand jury and of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation to investigate crimes in the federal 
court system.  It is not the purview, respectfully, of the 
court to conduct an investigation into uncharged matters. 
So respectfully, we disagree with defense counsel's
suggestion that the court has some authority to conduct an
independent investigation.  To the extent any other defendants
who are detained in the MCC have concerns about the conditions
or believe that the conditions are relevant to a future or
current bail determination, it is for those defendants and
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 25 of 86

J8RsEPS1                           
their counsel to raise those arguments and for the judges
hearing those arguments to evaluate those claims.  It is not
relevant to today's proceedings.
Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  In those other cases, Ms. Comey, judges do
have authority to investigate, but don't here?
MS. COMEY:  Not to investigate, your Honor, but to
hear arguments about the conditions of confinement in the MCC
as they may relate to any bail determination.  I believe that
was the argument that was made.
The bigger picture here, your Honor, is that the focus
of today's proceeding, as we understand it, is to allow the
victims who have gathered here today to be heard and to comment
upon the case and to comment upon the motion that is pending,
and to bring this case to a close.
THE COURT:  Got it.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  May I?
THE COURT:  Sure.
MR. WEINGARTEN:  We obviously saw this as, perhaps,
the last opportunity to be before you, and we wanted to take
advantage of the opportunity to say our peace and thank you for
allowing us.
There is precedent here.  Ted Stevens, the Senator
from Alaska case in Washington, DC, Judge Emmet Sullivan
ordered an independent investigation by a private lawyer when
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 26 of 86

J8RsEPS1                           
he was deeply troubled by the alleged Brady violations.  I
represented the prosecutors in that case, so I'm very, very
familiar with it.
It is analogous.  It is a situation where there was
tremendous controversy over what happened in the case and
whether or not the prosecutors went off the reservation.  Judge
Sullivan -- and there were three or four independent -- not
independent, DOJ inquiries into the very same matter.  But
Judge Sullivan wanted his own opportunity to make a judgment
with his own independent investigation.
THE COURT:  OK.
MR. WEINBERG:  If I could just add one precedent, your
Honor.  
The Chief judge in the District of Massachusetts or 
the Chief Judge at the time, Judge Wolf, in a case called 
U.S. v. Fleming, when the conditions at Walpole, which is a 
state prison where federal prisoners were being held -- we 
don't have a federal MCC in Boston -- went to the prison, 
stayed in the prison to determine whether or not the complaints 
about the conditions were authentic.   
I think your Honor has the inherent authority to go to 
the ninth floor and see how the MCC houses pretrial detainees.   
Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Are you saying that whether or not the
motion is granted that is pending before us?
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 27 of 86

J8RsEPS1                           
MR. WEINBERG:  Yes, your Honor.
I think, like when appeals are taken, bail issues
remain before the district court.  Jurisdiction is not
completely divested.  Your Honor issued a pretrial detention
order and your Honor has the power, the inherent authority,
they are not going to refuse to allow you to go look at the
ninth floor.  They are going to count on you to make decisions
in the future.
I just trust that the executive branch is not going to 
prevent the judicial branch from looking into the death of 
Jeffrey Epstein or the conditions in the SHU unit at the MCC, 
sir. 
THE COURT:  Great.  Thank you.
MS. COMEY:  May I, your Honor?
Just very briefly, your Honor.  I would note that upon
the dismissal of the indictment, which I believe the parties
agree is appropriate in this case, there would be no case.
There would be no jurisdiction for the court to conduct any
sort of inquiry, even if the court had such authority.
THE COURT:  Right.
OK.  I think we've heard enough.
It is at this point in the hearing that I would like
to call upon victims' counsel, plural, for any remarks they may
have and they may wish to make.  Also, to introduce their
clients, those of them who wish to be heard.

It would be helpful if, in doing that, if counsel --
Mr. Edwards and I see and I see Mr. Boise as well -- I know
they are counsel to several, at least several of the victims.
It would be helpful if whoever is speaking, both Mr. Edwards
and Mr. Boise, would indicate to the court whether or not they
have discussed the pending motion with their clients, that is
to say and the rule of abatement, etc., etc. with them prior to
today's hearing.
Are we going to hear from Mr. Edwards first, is that
right?
MR. EDWARDS:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  You bet.
It would be helpful, Mr. Edwards, if you would state
and spell your name for the court reporter.
If you are going to introduce someone else, which I 
trust that you are, if you could state and spell their name as 
well. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Yes, your Honor.
May it please the court.  Brad Edwards, B-r-a-d 
E-d-w-a-r-d-s, with the law firm of Edwards Pottinger. 
I have in the courtroom today 15 victims that I
represent and have represented over the years.  There are at
least 20 more who didn't make this hearing today for a
multitude of reasons, some out of fear of public exposure,
others because the way in which this case ended will never

bring full justice, and they decided it was best for them not
to talk today.
Some of my clients are going to address the court that
are here today.  Others are not.  Some are going to use their
names, and have in the past, and others wish to remain
anonymous.  And I have instructed each of them to inform the
court reporter that they will be proceeding as Jane Doe so that
the court reporter can take them down.
THE COURT:  For those who wish to remain anonymous?
MR. EDWARDS:  Exactly, your Honor.
THE COURT:  And that is satisfactory, as far as I am
concerned.
MR. EDWARDS:  Before we do that, I would like to
address a couple of the things that have occurred this morning.
First of all, whether relevant or not, I personally, 
and on behalf of my clients, do appreciate the presentation 
that Mr. Weingarten made and Mr. Marty Weinberg made.   
I have tremendous respect for Mr. Weinberg.  I've 
worked with him through this and related cases for years, and I 
understand the reason why they made the presentation that they 
made. 
There is two things of interest to our clients in that
respect.  One is, because of the tragic ending, that none of my
clients wanted, nor did I, nor did anyone else, if there is
some civil rights violation and there is some civil remedy for
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 30 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
Mr. Epstein that goes to the estate, certainly the victims are
interested in that as they might help to repair the damage
done.
Second, Mr. Epstein's untimely death, the timing is
curious to us.  But more so, it makes it absolutely impossible
for the victims to ever get the day in court that they wanted
in court and to get full justice.  That now can never happen.
I know that Mr. Epstein's attorneys say he wanted it, and they
know, we did too.  And there are a lot of people here today
that are very sad by the way that this ended for both
Mr. Epstein and the fact that full justice was robbed from
them, once again.
The second issue I wanted to address was the Law
Review or the Law Journal article that your Honor referenced,
which is troubling because the opinion seems to say that
transparency is not appropriate in the criminal system and is
not appropriate at this point in time.
That's tough to swallow, especially in this case, 
given the long history of this case.  Personally, it is tough 
to swallow, and on behalf of my clients, I can say that is very 
concerning.  Transparency is the only way that the justice 
system works.  We know this because there was a similar 
investigation of Mr. Epstein many years ago, from 2005 to 2008.   
My personal involvement in this case was because a 
young female came into my office named Courtney Wild, and she 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 31 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
came to me not asking to file a lawsuit against Jeffrey 
Epstein, but simply asking for the government to talk to her.  
She was cooperating in an FBI investigation and wanted the 
government to speak with her, and I thought that was going to 
be an easy task.   
It was only a few months later that we learned that 
this investigation that was represented to my client in written 
form, that it would be a long investigation, and to be patient.  
Basically, to hang tight.  It was resolved by way of a secret 
deal that never allowed any of the more than 30 victims who had 
been identified of Mr. Epstein's abuse in Florida to ever 
participate in a single hearing.  There was a hearing.  They 
were never notified. 
I then went on to represent many of them in civil
cases and also in extensive pro bono work.  And I can tell your
Honor that while Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of them hurt them and
harmed them for many years, the feelings they had was
aggravated exponentially by the facts that they had no rights
in the criminal justice system, by the fact that they were
treated as if they didn't matter.  They were not allowed their
rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act to meaningfully
confer with prosecutors, to be treated with fairness, to be
treated with dignity.  That is what this is supposed to be
about, and to have notice of hearings.
So I do want to thank your Honor, and especially the 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 32 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RsEPS1                           
prosecutors who have worked this investigation and this case, 
which is very different in experience for all of my clients and 
the other Epstein victims in this case, because they were 
allowed to be a part of the process.  While some of them 
elected not to be here today, that opportunity should always be 
allowed for them. 
In 2008, we filed that case under the Crime Victims'
Rights Act because our clients' rights were violated, and as
your Honor knows, a federal judge has ruled in our clients'
favor that their rights were violated.  So this hearing today
means a lot to them.  The fact that they may never get their
chance to speak in court, they may never get complete closure,
and all of us have to wonder, if their rights had been afforded
them the first time, would any of us be here right now.  Or
wouldn't it more likely be the case that everyone, including
Jeffrey Epstein, would have turned out better for it?
Today, I have not only represented, but met and become
very close with many of these victims.  Many of these
survivors.  They are very strong people.  They are people who
have persevered through a lot of adversity.  It's been a roller
coaster of emotions that has led us to where we are today.  And
while they have all been cast over the years because of the
secrecy of the first investigation, in the shadow as victims,
you can't put them all in one bucket and say one size fits all.
They are each individual people who were harmed differently and

J8RsEPS1                           
distinctly through not only the abuse, but the system.
And on behalf of all of them, I would like to thank 
your Honor for the fairness with which they've been treated, 
and the United States Attorney's office for the way in which 
you have handled this investigation, and especially how you 
have treated the victims in this case. 
Like I said, I have many who want to speak.  Some that
can't.  This is a very difficult day for them.  But we
appreciate the opportunity and the invitation.
The first client that I have that is going to address
your Honor is the one who walked into my office in 2008 asking
just to be heard, Courtney Wild.
THE COURT:  Hold on one second.  Did you all want to
be seated?
You don't need to be standing.  Whatever is more 
comfortable until you're ready to give some comments.  It's up 
to you.

reporters, please.

MS. WILD:  My name is Courtney Wild, and I'm a victim
of Jeffrey Epstein.  Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for
years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health.  Jeffrey
Epstein has done nothing but manipulate our justice system,
where he has never been held accountable for his actions, even
to this day.
Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and all the other 
victims of our day in court to confront him one by one, and for 
that he is a coward.   
I want to thank the U.S. Attorney's for seeking 
justice that has been long over due, and most importantly, 
given us, the victims, our day in court to speak our peace and 
find some sort of closure.  I feel very angry and sad that 
justice has never been served in this case.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thanks very much.
MR. EDWARDS:  I believe my next client who is going to
speak is probably going to speak as Jane Doe.
JANE DOE NO. 1:  Yes, Jane Doe.
THE COURT:  We'll say Jane Doe No. 1, just for the
record.
JANE DOE NO. 1:  Okay.  Thank you for allowing us to
speak today.  I've shifted what I want to say in hearing
what's already been said, and just about the question of
Jeffrey's death.  I don't know what the relevance is to this
hearing, but I do know that it is profoundly relevant to my
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 35 of 86

life, as a victim.  I don't like that word, but I still feel
like I am learning the ways that he's impacted me as a complex
situation, but he was also a major part of my life.  As
destructive as that relationship was and as much of a villain
as we have created him to be -- based on facts we've created
him to be a villain -- he's a complex villain and actually all
of that is irrelevant.  Anybody deserves -- an investigation is
the right thing to do.  Like, we do need to know how he died.
It felt like a whole new trauma all over again, and I 
don't know why, you know, because I -- I'm trying to defend 
myself against him at this point in my life, but it still does 
not feel good.  It didn't feel good to wake up that morning and 
find out that he had allegedly committed suicide.  Okay.  But I 
also wanted to say to the press, I'm reading -- I read my story 
in the paper.  I read so many other girls' stories that are so 
similar to my own, and everything that's been focused on is not 
the most important part of it.   
There was -- the problem with focusing on these, the 
facts of the situation, that were out of the ordinary and like 
because he was such a grand person, and it was just a unique 
situation.  I know that that's the more interesting side of the 
story, but I don't want to be used as entertainment.  And the 
problem, the fundamental problem of the whole situation is the 
element of exploitation and coercion, and these are things that 
so many girls can relate to.

J8RPEPS2                 
And even though this Jeffrey Epstein brought it to a 
grand scale, on some level, a lot of girls could relate to the 
trauma that we are talking about, and even though this whole 
situation sucks, I would like to think that it may be possibly 
a catalyst for change because, obviously, as we're seeing with 
the "Me Too" movement, change needs to happen and it's -- what 
I'm seeing in the papers is not a common story, but it's so 
much more common than you realize.  That's all.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.
MR. EDWARDS:  I believe that the next client is going
to also be a Jane Doe; so I think for the purposes of the
record it will be Jane Doe 2.
THE COURT:  Yes.
JANE DOE NO. 2:  Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.  How are you?
JANE DOE NO. 2:  Doing okay.  I hadn't prepared any
words to speak today, but there is something that was on my
mind this morning when I got here.  It's been on my mind in
reading through the press and through the people that I've
spoken to about it, friends, family.  It's something that's
bothered me because I think it has a lot of blame in it, as
well, a little bit of what my friend, who was up here, was
speaking about.
I think that a lot of people asked why we spent so 
much time, why we stayed.  It's an experience that's really

J8RPEPS2                 
hard to explain to people who haven't gone through it.  I think 
there's a writer, Thomas Nagel, who wrote an essay called "What 
is it like to be a bat?"  And I think that he touches on it 
pretty strongly and if you haven't experienced something, it's 
very hard to fully understand why someone makes the decisions 
they do and what the circumstances were.   
I don't want to speak for all of the victims.  I think 
each of us has a different story and different circumstances 
for why we stayed in it, but for me, I think he was really 
strategic in how he approached each of us.  Things happened 
slowly over time.  We didn't -- it almost was like, putting it 
like that analogy of a frog being in a pan of water and slowly 
turning the flame up.  You didn't realize it was happening, and 
it just -- I don't think anyone can fully understand the 
experience, but I just -- the blame feels very strong.   
There's a lot of support as well, but I just want 
people to try and understand that we aren't bad people.  We 
weren't trying to -- it wasn't a situation where we were trying 
to extort money from someone.  A lot of us were in very 
vulnerable situations and in extreme poverty, circumstances 
where we didn't have anyone on our side, to speak on our 
behalf, and that's really scary.   
You start to blame yourself because, at first, you 
don't tell anyone what's happening, and it becomes your deep, 
dark secret that you tried to keep from everyone.  And I didn't

even know I was a victim until I spoke with my lawyers.  I had 
no idea.  I had so much self-hatred and doubt and just guilt 
for everything.  I still do.  I still don't feel like I deserve 
to say I'm a victim, and I think that's a big problem with our 
society right now, that people are still blaming victims, and I 
think that does need to change.   
I hope that today people understand that each of us 
has a story, has a past, has a family and just give us a chance 
to -- you know, that's basically all I just wanted to say.

an amazing man who genuinely cared for people and that he was
going to be able to help me in a modeling career.
I was excited to meet him, after hearing her talk

sexually assaulted.  I left his home, after he threw me, 
basically put money on the table, and I was ashamed.  I was 
embarrassed.  This was not the way I was brought up, and I 
couldn't believe this had happened to me.   
I left and my world kind of spiraled after that.  I 
stopped going on modeling castings.  I gained weight.  I became 
depressed.  I stopped going out with my friends, and only five 
months after I had been in New York City to pursue my dream, I 
left.  I left the modeling industry, and I left New York City, 
and I totally switched my career paths.   
I buried this deep within me, and all of the new 
occurrences that have come up in the media is what brought it 
back up for me.  And I feel sickened and saddened that it took 
so many years, and God knows how many victims, for this to 
finally come out, but I'm thankful it did.  And I'm just angry 
that he's not alive anymore to have to pay the price for his 
actions.  So I thank you for your time. 
THE COURT:  You're very welcome.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, Jane Doe No. 4, I believe,
is going to speak now.
JANE DOE NO. 4:  Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.
JANE DOE NO. 4:  I just have something very short to
say.  I met Jeffrey Epstein at a very vulnerable place in my
life, and whatever the outcome is with everything, I just

wanted to express that we, the victims, we will always carry
irreparable damage and pain throughout our lives after this.
It's something that's never going to go away.
You know, whoever we marry in our life, whatever 
future we have in our life, it's always going to be something 
that's always there for us.  And I'm very nervous right now.  
And Jeffrey Epstein, he took away the chance I had at having 
the future I had envisioned for myself as a young girl, and I 
think many of us here today will never fully heal from that 
pain and the heartache that we'll continue carrying with us.   
So I just wanted to say that.  It's something that 
it's irreparable.  I can't even really use a better word to 
describe that.  So thank you for hearing us today. 
THE COURT:  You're very welcome.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, Jane Doe No. 5 would like to
speak.
JANE DOE NO. 5:  This is a letter that I wrote; so
it's going to be:  Dear Jeffrey, I think you are a mentally
disturbed human being.  You used your power to make me believe
at a young age that I could have my dreams of being a model.
You paid for your freedom.  You violated my rights.  You should
have to pay for them, just as anyone else.  You got a plea deal
that no one else would have been able to get.  You used your
money to get out of paying the price for your actions.
Also, as a victim, I never got to see what the 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 41 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
agreement was or why the special treatment got approved.  I 
think you should have been in jail for several years in 
population and live like everyone else that is mentally 
disturbed like you.  You paid for yourself to get special 
treatment while you were in jail.  I don't even think you spent 
a day in a jail as a normal human being.   
You had investigators come to my house and also went 
to my friend's house to question them.  I will never be able to 
over -- I will never be able to get over the overwhelming 
emotions and embarrassment I experienced from that trauma.  I 
needed therapy several times a week and had high stress and 
anxiety levels.   
You paid your way to make the public think that the 
girls had nothing in life going on for them.  You wanted to try 
and blame that we were lower class and that was the problem 
with the girls.  I was from a middle class family and did well 
in school.  I lived the American girl dream -- or the American 
girl life.  I went on family vacations around the world, grew 
up in a good city, and my parents are still married to this 
day.  Basically, everything you said that we didn't have in our 
life, I did.   
It all came down to I was told I was making $200 in an 
hour.  Being young, that was a lot of money, and I didn't know 
any better.  Sadly, you were the one with an illness that you 
should have to go and see a doctor and also have a mentor group

for the sickness you have.  I will continue with writing my 
book about that secret life, with all the newspaper articles of 
the case, my high school agenda book of official dates.  I'm 
basing that proof that I deposited cash after leaving 
Jeffrey's.  I still have all of the information, articles that 
I collected over the years.   
You mentally and physically traumatized me.  I went to 
therapy, and it was the best thing I did for myself.  If anyone 
only learns one thing from this case, I hope is that money 
should not let you buy your way free.  A crime is a crime and a 
victim is a victim.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, my next client is Chauntae
Davies, C-h-a-u-n-t-a-e, Davies, D-a-v-i-e-s.
MS. DAVIES:  I met Jeffrey Epstein through my first
massage teacher, a man who took me in as his apprentice to
teach me a practice I wanted to learn while in desperate search
to find a cure for a debilitating neurological disorder that I
have, which manifests into violent vomiting attacks, largely
triggered by stress.  It's called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome.  
I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell.  Upon my first 
meeting of her, I wouldn't know I had been recruited until many 
years later, when I would read it in a headline.  Ghislaine and 
Jeffrey took me in.  They sent me to school.  They gave me a 
job.  They flew me around the world, introduced me to a world I

            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
had only dreamt of and made me feel as though I had become a 
part of their family, another thing I was desperately searching 
for.   
But on my third or fourth time meeting them, they 
brought me to Jeffrey's island for the first time, and on the 
first night there, Sarah Kellen came tapping on my door late at 
night to inform me Jeffrey was ready for another massage.  My 
instincts told me this didn't feel right, but I got up and 
followed her to a villa I hadn't yet seen.  Jeffrey and 
Ghislaine's villa.   
I began my massage, trying not to let him smell my 
fear and obvious discomfort, but before I knew what was 
happening, he grabbed onto my wrist and tugged me towards the 
bed.  I tried to pull away, but he was unbuttoning my shorts 
and pulling my body onto his already naked body faster than I 
could think.  I was searching for words but all I could say was 
meek, "No, please stop," but that just seemed to excite him 
more.   
He continued to rape me, and when he was finished, he 
hopped off and went to the shower.  I pulled my shorts up, and 
I ran as fast as I could back to my own villa, my feet bloodied 
from the rocks.  I cried myself to sleep that night.   
I spent two weeks vomiting, almost to death, in a 
Los Angeles hospital after that first encounter.  Jeffrey's 
abuse would continue for the next three years, and I allowed it

            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
to continue because I had been taken advantage of my entire 
life and had been conditioned to just accept it.   
It took me a long time to come forward, too long 
maybe, and all it took to bring -- and all that it took to 
bring this man to justice has been robbed by his death.  Every 
day, every week I've spent in the hospital since, I've suffered 
and he has won.  Every job offer that's been offered to me and 
then retracted because of my connection to this case, I have 
suffered and he has won.  Every public humiliation I have 
endured, I have suffered and he has won.  Every relationship 
that I've had to end because of the abuse that I have endured 
by the hands of this man, I have suffered and he has won.   
Every woman sitting in this room today, and all of the 
women who have yet come forward and who have not yet to come 
forward and whose lives have been affected by Jeffrey Epstein's 
sick abuse of young girls, we have all suffered, and he is 
still winning in death.   
I refuse to let this man win in death.  I couldn't 
fight back when Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me because I 
hadn't yet found my voice.  Well, I have found my voice now, 
and while Jeffrey may no longer be here to hear it, I will not 
stop fighting, and I will not be silenced anymore.  I needed 
him to hear the pain he's caused, what I've gone through 
because of him.  I wrote a 350-page book of all the pain that I 
have endured at the hands of this man that I really needed him

to hear.  His death has robbed me of that justice.   
Please don't rob us of justice again.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, I think I have one more
client that is going to speak today, Anouska De Georgiou.
THE COURT:  Would you spell that?
MS. DE GEORGIOU:  Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.
MS. DE GEORGIOU:  My name is spelled A-n-o-u-s-k-a,
D-e, space, G-e-o-r-g-i-o-u.
Thank you, your Honor, for giving us the opportunity 
to be heard this morning. 
THE COURT:  Sure.
MS. DE GEORGIOU:  When I was introduced to Jeffrey
Epstein, I was young and full of hope and the foolishness of a
teenager.  I was idealistic, and I saw the good in people.
Jeffrey Epstein manipulated me, coerced me and sexually abused
me.
Something I think is very important to communicate is 
that loss of innocence, trust and joy is not recoverable.  The 
abuse, spanning several years, was devaluing beyond measure and 
affected my ability to form and maintain healthy relationships, 
both in my work and my personal life.  He could not begin to 
fathom what he took from us, and I say "us" because I am every 
girl he did this to, and they're all me.  And today we stand

J8RPEPS2                 
together, those that are present and those that aren't.   
I was a victim, and it has taken me many, many years 
to stand here and say, yes, it was me.  I was a victim, but I 
will not remain a victim and be silent for one more day.  
Although I think it's tragic when anybody dies before their 
time, I'm extremely relieved that Jeffrey Epstein will not be 
in a position to hurt anymore children or anymore women, and 
I'm glad to be part of a group of women who are now bonded 
forever in the trauma that we endured at the hands of this man.  
Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, we had one client who was
not able to be here but sent a message through a letter.  Her
name is Michelle Licata, M-i-c-h-e-l-l-e; last name,
L-i-c-a-t-a.  And Brittany Henderson, of my office, is going to
read her letter as instructed.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MS. HENDERSON:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Yup.
MS. HENDERSON:  What happened to me occurred many
years ago when I was in high school, but it still effects my
life.  I was told then that Jeffrey Epstein was going to be
held accountable, but he was not.  In fact, the government
worked out a secret deal and didn't tell me about it.  The case
ended without me knowing what was going on, without him being
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 47 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
held responsible, without any explanation and without a chance
for my voice to be heard.  I was treated like I did not matter.
Many years later, he was arrested again.  These 
investigators and attorneys representing the United States have 
been completely different.  I am still mad, concerned and 
confused about how he committed suicide and escaped 
responsibility again, but I know it is not the fault of the 
judge or the government attorneys.   
I was allowed to be a part of the process this time.  
My attorney was able to tell me what was going on at every 
stage because they kept him informed.  Thank you for inviting 
me.  It means more to me than you can ever know.  I was not 
able to be here this time, but I know that I was allowed to be 
and I had the chance to attend this hearing, which is helping 
me in my healing process.  The fact that I mattered this time 
and the other victims mattered is what counts.  For that, I am 
grateful. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. EDWARDS:  Your Honor, finally, in 2008 when I
filed the case under the Crime Victims Rights Act, it wasn't me
alone.  I did it with Paul Cassell and Jay Howell.  
Paul Cassell is here today, and I think your Honor 
even cited to a piece of -- an opinion of his from when he was 
on the bench, and he has some remarks to make.   
Once again, your Honor, I really do believe that this 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 48 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
is a model for how victims should be treated in a criminal 
process, and we really do appreciate it.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. CASSELL:  I'll be very brief because I know there
are others that want to speak here.  I'm Paul Cassell,
C-a-s-s-e-l-l, previously served as a federal judge at the
District of Utah, currently a law professor, where I teach
crime victims rights at the University of Utah, College of Law.  
I just wanted to take one minute to address some 
suggestion that there would be no need for a hearing this 
morning.  I think, having heard already from these powerful 
victims and recognizing how important giving those statements 
will be in the trajectory of their lives, makes clear that your 
Honor has followed exactly the right path.  Legally, there is 
one precedent, which is U.S. v. Heaton, a case that you cited 
that I wrote about a decade ago, and as explained in that 
opinion, victims have important interests in the criminal 
justice system that can only be recognized if they're given 
their day in court.   
With all due respect to other law professors that have 
recently written an article, I think transparency is one of the 
overriding objectives in our criminal justice system, and the 
one substantive action that I would urge your Honor to take 
today is to publish your remarks as a published opinion.  The 
Heaton case is, to my knowledge, the only reported decision on 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 49 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
this particular issue, even though it's more than a decade old 
and, yet, we can see today that these problems recur in many 
other cases.  Your remarks today, I think, should be published 
so that they can serve as a guide for other judges around the 
country.   
I would encourage you to add into your remarks a 
reference to the Crime Victims Rights Act.  The Crime Victims 
Right Act promises victims the right to be treated with 
fairness, dignity and respect, and the process that we see 
unfolding this morning is a clear example of how victims can be 
treated with fairness, dignity and respect.   
So I know that your Honor is wondering what is the 
appropriate action here.  Unfortunately, it seems like there 
are no other legal options, but there was a legal option for 
you to decide to exercise, which was to allow these victims to 
come forward.  And if there's been one positive thing that has 
come out of the tragedies, the abuse, the other events of this 
case, it's been your decision to allow these victims to be 
heard this morning, and I encourage you to publish your 
decision and to encourage other judges to follow what is 
clearly a model for crime victims rights and is clearly an 
example that should be followed in other cases down the road. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.  I appreciate your
being here.  I had no idea that you would be here when I wrote
the remarks, but it was clear from the literature that you are

J8RPEPS2                 
the leading expert formerly of the District Court of Utah, I
believe, and it's a pleasure to have you here today.
MR. CASSELL:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thanks.
Mr. Boies? 
MR. BOIES:  Thank you, your Honor.  David Boies of
Boies Schiller Flexner.  We have with us today five of the
victims that we represent.  There are a number of additional
victims who either were unable to attend or are still unwilling
to come forward publicly.  This has been an enormously
traumatic aspect of their lives, something that, as you've
already heard and will hear more today, is something that they
can never entirely escape from.
I want to, as prior counsel have, commend both the 
Court and counsel for the Department of Justice for the 
consideration and respect and attention that they have paid to 
the victims.  We believe that that is not only right, as a 
matter of human dignity, but we think that is exactly what the 
law requires and intends.   
I will be more blunt than the Court has been, or 
Professor Cassell has been about Professor Green's article.  
That is an article that cites no authority, and I believe there 
is no authority for his proposition.  I entirely respect his 
right to advocate on behalf of his client Alan Dershowitz, who 
has retained him in connection with litigation that we've 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 51 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
brought against Mr. Dershowitz, but I would have expected that 
the Law Journal or Professor Green himself would have disclosed 
that connection, which I think is a conflict.   
But regardless of the appropriateness of his 
disclosure, or lack of disclosure, I think that his article 
opposing allowing the victims to have a voice in this 
proceeding is inconsistent not only with the policy that 
underlies the Crime Victim Rights Act and the very statute that 
Mr. Epstein is being prosecuted under, but it ignores the 
actual language of those statutes, and many other statutes, in 
which Congress has made clear that the purpose of the criminal 
law is no longer simply to punish the individual defendant, but 
it is to find some way of trying to mitigate the damage that 
has been done to the victims through restitution and economic 
mitigation, but also through the ability to confront and to 
have the court system and the justice system and the 
prosecutors treat these victims as they are victims, as they 
are human beings, and they are entitled to the respect that our 
society needs to give every human being.  So I think that this 
is not only commendable, but I think it is what the law 
requires. 
In response to the question the Court asked, I have
discussed this hearing with my clients.  I have told them that,
under the applicable law, the government has no alternative but
to move to dismiss this case, and I believe under the
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 52 of 86

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
applicable law in this circuit, the Court has no alternative
but to grant that motion.
I think the current law is outdated, as the Court 
suggested in some of its remarks.  I think there will come a 
time when either an Appellate court or the Congress will make 
clear that, just as it's possible to continue civil cases 
against someone after they have deceased, it is possible, at 
least for purposes of things like restitution, to continue 
criminal cases, but we are not there now.  And, fortunately, in 
this case, there are other ways and perhaps even more efficient 
ways to vindicate the interests of the victims here.   
We greatly appreciate the remarks of the 
representative of the Department of Justice today, and we, too, 
on behalf of the victims, are not going to stop when we walk 
out of this courtroom.  We are going to continue to seek 
vindication against Mr. Epstein's estate and, in some senses, 
perhaps even more important, against the people who worked with 
him and enabled him.   
As you have already heard, and will hear more, 
Mr. Epstein did not act alone.  He could not have done what he 
did, on the scope and the scale of what he did, for as many 
years as he did it without the activities and support and the 
co-conspirator activity of a number of other key individuals, 
and those individuals also need to bear their share of 
responsibility, and those people need to have a reckoning as

well.   
My partner Sig McCawley, who's been working with me 
for more than five years on this case, is going to, with the 
Court's permission, introduce five of our clients who will 
speak briefly to your Court.  Thank you very much. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Boies.  Pleasure
to have you here.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor, the first victim
that would like to speak today is Theresa J. Helm.
THE COURT:  Can we have the spelling of your name?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.  Sigrid, S-i-g-r-i-d, and the
last name is M-c-C-a-w-l-e-y, and I'm a partner at Boies
Schiller Flexner.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MS. HELM:  Good morning.
THE COURT:  Good morning.
MS. HELM:  Thank you, prosecutors and Judge, and the
Court.  My name is Theresa Helm.  I note today I do feel
respected and listened to; so I appreciate that, and I have to
say that I commend the boldness of the New York prosecutors for
pursuing a man that has, you know -- and others, that have
clearly taken a lot from a lot of people.
years ago I knew him only as "Jeffrey."  I was 
recruited and brought from California to New York, and that

            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
experience for the last 17 years has been a dark corner in my 
story, in my life, in my life story and that has been 
definitely made worse by my own self-shame and that -- and 
anger for normalizing all of the red flags.  I feel like we are 
conditioned to do that, and that's something that needs to 
change.   
So I'm here today, you know, I'm coming forward 
because it is time to bring light to that darkness, and it's 
time to replace that darkness with light.  And I am a survivor 
of this, and I do aim to progress further from being a 
survivor, you know.  I feel I've worked hard, quite hard, to 
get to where I'm at now, and I'm definitely at a place in my 
life where I will no longer cover up.  I'll no longer cover up 
what needs to be brought to light.   
Jeffrey is no longer here, and the women that helped 
him are, Ghislaine Maxwell.  My experience is with Ghislaine 
Maxwell and Sarah Kellen, and they definitely need to be held 
accountable for helping him, helping themselves, helping one 
another carry on this huge, almost like a system.  So they need 
to be held accountable, all of them, and I would like to see

I am a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell 
in the dark and cruel and criminal acts they committed against 
me and hundreds of other girls and young women for years and 
years and years, unstopped.   
Thank you for allowing me to address the Court and 
speak the truth.  I commend the prosecutors from the Southern 
District of New York for the ongoing investigation and its 
pursuit of justice for us victims.  It has given me hope, and I 
will not let go of that hope. 
When I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at
Mar-a-Lago, just before I was 17, I thought I was given a big
break, and I'd be able to reset my life and become an actual
real massage therapist.  My hopes were quickly dashed, and my
dreams were stolen.  Jeffrey Epstein is no longer alive, but
this is not about how he died.  This is about how he lived.
He will not have his day in court, but the reckoning 
of accountability has begun, supported by the voices of these 
brave and beautiful women in this courtroom today.  The 
reckoning must not end.  It must continue.  He did not act 
alone and we, the victims, know that.  We trust the government

MS. RANSOME:  Thank you, your Honor.  My name is Sarah
Ransome, R-a-n-s-o-m-e.  I'm a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and
Ghislaine Maxwell's international sex trafficking ring.
I would like to thank the Court for the dignity and 
the respect you are showing me here today, as well as the other 
victims.  I would also like to acknowledge and extend my 
gratitude to the prosecutors from the Southern District of 
New York for pursuing justice on behalf of the victims.  
Please, please finish what you have started.  I struggled to 
find the words to adequately say how important your work is to 
us.   
For a very long time Jeffrey Epstein gamed the system 
at every level, and when he realized he couldn't do that any 
longer, he showed the world what a depraved and cowardly human 
being he is by taking his own life.  But we, the victims, are 
still here, prepared to tell the truth, and we all know he did 
not act alone.  We are survivors, and the pursuit of justice 
should not abate.  Thank you, your Honor.

MS. FARMER:  Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good morning.
MS. FARMER:  Annie, A-n-n-i-e, Farmer, F-a-r-m-e-r.
I had the opportunity to speak at Jeffrey Epstein's
bail hearing, and I really appreciate that you heard me and
listened to me that day.  I am so sorry that others will not
have the opportunity to stand before him the way that I did.
But I'm here today to speak on behalf of my sister, Maria
Farmer, who could not be here.
Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell not only assaulted 
her, but as we're hearing from so many of these brave women 
here today, they stole her dreams and her livelihood.  She 
risked her safety in 1996, so many years ago, to report them, 
to no avail, and it is heartbreaking to her and to me that all 
this destruction has been wrought since that time.   
We were deeply disappointed and disturbed by Epstein's 
death and the fact that that was allowed to happen while he was 
in the government's custody, and I'm encouraged to hear that 
there will be a full investigation as to how that was allowed 
to happen.   
But it is extremely important, as others are saying, 
that he did not act alone and that the other people that were a 
part of what he did are held accountable and that that 
investigation continues.

J8RPEPS2                 
I believe that we have a real problem in this country 
with perpetrators of sexual abuse and sexual assault being held 
accountable.  There are so many roadblocks to victims being 
heard, to cases being investigated thoroughly, and then to 
those cases being prosecuted.  And so I think this is a really 
important signal to send a message to victims out there that 
people will take you seriously, people will follow through, and 
that even those in power, as we have unfortunately seen, that 
has not been often are able to escape that, that even those in 
power will be held accountable.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thanks so much.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Our next client, who's going to address
the Court is Marijke Chartouni.  She says it much more
beautifully than I do; so I'll let her say it.
MS. CHARTOUNI:  My first name is spelled,
M-a-r-i-j-k-e; last name is C-h-a-r-t-o-u-n-i.
My name is Marijke Chartouni, and I am a victim of
Jeffrey Epstein and the sophisticated sex trafficking operation
he ran, where he allegedly was to be a financier.
I was 20 and previously modeled and was living in the 
West Village.  I met a young woman named Rena through a mutual 
friend.  We were friends for a few months.  She was an amazing 
artist and liked to party.  One day she called me and asked if 
I was interested in meeting a friend of hers.  She told me he 
wanted to meet me and really liked blonds, and I thought he was

our age and liked to do the same things we did at that age; so 
I agreed.   
On a sunny, crisp day, we took the train together to 
the Upper East Side.  She then began to talk a little bit about 
him on our way to his house.  I was at his house.  I was 
sexually assaulted by both Rena and Jeffrey Epstein in his 
mansion.  It left me feeling both disgusted and betrayed.   
As we walked home to the subway afterwards, she 
continued to tell me about the man who had just abused me with 
her participation.  She seemed exhilarated from the horrific 
experience.  I was shocked and in a daze.  This is a few things 
that she had told me.  She told me he went to Cooper Union.  He 
was a mathematical genius.  That he had favorite girls that he 
would take to Chanel for 15-minute, all-you-can-buy shopping 
trips.  She told me his right-hand person had connection to the 
arts and the fashion world, and she could help me.   
This is not my complete story.  I'll stop here.  I'm 
in a good, stable place in my life, and I had decided to come 
forward to be a voice to the victims who may not be able to 
tell their story, or at least not yet.  I feel like I am a 
survivor.   
Thank you, Judge Berman, for inviting victims to speak 
today before you.  We hope the government is listening very 
closely to the words we are saying. 
THE COURT:  Thank you very much.

MS. LERNER:  Would that be okay?
THE COURT:  Absolutely.
MS. LERNER:  Your Honor, I would like to begin by
saying that I am in awe of all of these beautiful women.  I
just want to let you know, on behalf of Jennifer and myself, we
admire you, we respect you, and we applaud you, and you are
brave survivors.  And Jennifer's heart is with all of you, and
we thank you so much for coming forward.
Jennifer, when she went public, she thought she was 
one of the only ones, and to see all of these faces is, I know, 
amazing for her. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a predator, a pedophile and a sick

individual.  However, he was also a thief.  He stole Jennifer's
childhood dreams, her innocence and her self-confidence.  She
was 14 years old.  What he could not buy, he forcibly took.
Why?  Because he surrounded himself with a network of powerful
people who not only looked the other way, but also actively
facilitated and participated in his sexual abuse of children.
Jeffrey Epstein thought he was above the law, and 
essentially he was until now.  The system let Jennifer and the 
other victims down, but it does not have to end here.  We ask 
the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI to bring all of 
Epstein's enablers and co-conspirators to justice.   
It has taken Jennifer 18 years to find her voice, and 
again, Jeffrey Epstein has tried to silence her.  While she 
will never have her chance to face him in court, he no longer 
has any power over her.  Today, this brave survivor will be 
heard.   
MS. AROZ:  Thank you for allowing me to be able to
have my chance in court today, to be able to tell you what this
horrific man did to my life.  You can't even imagine how much
it affected my childhood, all the way through my adult life.
He robbed me of my dreams.  He robbed me of my chance to pursue
a career I always adored.  He stole my chance at really feeling
love because I was so scared to trust anyone for so many years
that I had such severe anxiety.  I didn't want to leave my
house let alone my bed.

            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
The fact that he felt entitled to take away my 
innocence, the fact that he felt that he could do whatever he 
wanted, regardless of the laws, hurts me so very much.  It took 
me years to tell anyone what Epstein did to me because I was so 
ashamed and embarrassed at what people would say or think of me 
until I found out there were other victims, girls just like me.  
I knew I could no longer keep my silence no matter how ruthless 
and powerful Epstein was, and still is even after his death.   
The fact I will never have a chance to face my 
predator in court eats away at my soul.  Even in death, Epstein 
is trying to hurt me.  I had hoped to at last get an apology, 
but this evil man had no remorse or caring for what he did to 
anyone.  I felt let down by the people who were supposed to 
watch him in prison.  They let this man kill himself and kill 
the chance of justice for so many others in the process, taking 
away our ability to speak.   
Out of all the damages and side effects that Epstein 
caused by his heartless and selfish acts, it's very hard to put 
my feelings and emotions into words, trying to let his 
horrendous actions go and attempting to forgive him, has been 
so difficult for me.  Yet, as hard as it's been to come so 
publicly forward, I refuse to let Epstein take me as a victim 
anymore.   
I am a survivor.  The many that stand before me here 
today that have shared the horrific experiences with this

deplorable human being, because even though this weak, evil 
coward tried to steal all of our childhoods, tried to steal all 
of our innocence and tried to steal all of our means of 
justice, he will never steal our inner strength, and he will 
never, ever, ever steal our voice.  Thank you so much.

MS. GIBBS:  Good morning, your Honor.  Teri Gibbs,
T-e-r-i, G-i-b-b-s.  For the record, I am a California
attorney.  I'm not admitted to the New York State bar.  I am
here to make a statement on behalf of New York attorney, Lisa
Bloom.  I work for her firm, The Bloom Firm.
Lisa Bloom represents four of Jeffrey Epstein's 
victims, Jane Doe 6, for the record, Jane Doe 7 and Jane Doe 8.  
I am so proud of all of you victims who are here today and are 
able to voice yourselves today.  I will not and cannot comment 
on the criminal case, or Ms. Bloom's communications with her 
clients.   
Ms. Bloom would like to share three of her client's 
statements for the record.  Here are the statements.  Statement 
of Jane Doe 6.   
To the Honorable Richard M. Berman.  Jeffrey Epstein 
stole my innocence.  He gave me a life sentence of guilt and 
shame.  I do not consider myself a victim.  I see myself a 
survivor.  The abuse that I endured cannot continue.  Let's 
stop this before it happens to other young women.  Jane Doe.

            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
Statement of Jane Doe 7.  To the Honorable Richard M.
Berman.  I used to be relatively carefree, inquisitive, hopeful
and excited about life, but my life changed because of Jeffrey
Epstein.  My perspective on life became very dark when I was
unknowingly recruited by one of his agents.  Jeffrey Epstein
ruined me.  His recruiter ruined me.  The far-reaching
consequences of that day ruined my family's lives.
I've chosen to remain anonymous in order to protect my 
family from unwanted media attention.   
I was just trying to figure out my path in life when I 
encountered Jeffrey Epstein in his New York City mansion.  I 
cannot even begin to summarize the many detriments this 
experience of sexual assault has had on my life.  Immediately 
following the incident, I was unable to function and be around 
other people.  My parents had to rescue me and bring me home, 
where I became a recluse for years.   
I was changed forever and buried my assault deep down, 
where the darkness couldn't hurt me anymore, but of course, it 
has always been here, lingering and affecting me unconsciously.  
At the time, I was mired in shame, guilt and humiliation.  I 
had somehow tricked myself into thinking that I had allowed the 
assault to happen, that I did it to myself, that I don't 
deserve to be alive or to be loved.  I believed that I was a 
disgusting, shameful person who does not deserve to ever be 
happy.  These are the thoughts I've lived with on a daily 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 65 of 86

            (212) 805-0300
J8RPEPS2                 
basis.   
Furthermore, because I couldn't tell anyone, out of 
fear of judgment, blame or retaliation, keeping this secret 
completely hindered my ability to uncover why these issues 
existed for me, which could have led to a path of healing over 
the years.   
It is time for those of power to do the right thing.  
It is time for compassion toward our fellow human beings to 
reign over money, power and greed.  We need to protect our most 
vulnerable to allow them a chance at a normal life, and nothing 
should come in the way of that.  I believe that for future 
generations, including my own children, this case will set a 
precedent that victims must no longer suffer in silence on our 
own or be shamed for coming forward to seek protection.   
This case should demonstrate to those who want to harm 
others that there will be a reckoning, and they will pay dearly 
for the harm they inflict on innocent people.  Judge Berman, I 
thank you for from the bottom of my heart for this forum and 
opportunity.   
To all of those survivors who came before me, I 
commend your bravery.  There is no way I could have done this 
without you.   
Thank you to the public following this story, for your 
outrage and desire for answers, which will hopefully move this 
case forward so that victims can stop having to relive their

experiences every day and move on to begin to heal.

investigators and public servants working so diligently to find 
those answers and to right all these wrongs.  Jane Doe 7.

THE COURT:  Thanks very much.
MS. GIBBS:  One more.  Statement of Jane Doe 8.
In the past few weeks, I have had to reflect on my 
interaction with Jeffrey Epstein and realized that, though I 
have yet to put it all behind me, I am still a victim.  I say 
this because I have to come to terms with it in an effort to 
truly get past the abuse I suffered at the hands of Epstein. 
Pursuing criminal penalties against him and having an
opportunity to address the egregious crimes he committed
against me and other young woman would have helped my recovery
process.  This all came to an abrupt halt when he took his own
life.  This point of disclosure is lost.
I cannot say that I am pleased he committed suicide,
but I am at peace knowing he will not be able to hurt anyone
else.  However, a sad truth remains.  I, along with other
people, will never have an answer as to why.  I will never have
an apology for the wrongdoing.  And most importantly, Epstein
will not be justly sentenced for his crimes.  Now I sit in my
home questioning the well-being of those girls like myself.  In
choosing death, Epstein denied everyone justice.
Any efforts made to protect Epstein's name and legacy
send a message to the victims that he wins and that he is
untouchable.  I understand his case may be dismissed or closed,
but this makes me feel as though I, and anyone else who fell
pry to his hands, simply do not matter.

J8RsEPS3                       
I ask that you very seriously consider the final
decision, because it will undoubtedly affect all other facets
of this case, including any future charges brought against the
recruiters or third parties to his crimes.  I do not want the
narrative to be, Those poor girls.  I want to send a message to
anyone who would consider engaging in similar acts to think
twice beforehand.  I want some sort of closure for those of us
who relive those horrible moments where we were assaulted,
abused, and taken advantage of by Epstein.
You have the opportunity to help us seek that closure.
I appreciate your time and consideration and ask for your
continued support in dealing with this case to illustrate that
we, Epstein's victims, do matter.
Sincerely, Jane Doe 8.

afford the victims their voice, because many of them have never
spoken before.  They never spoke in Florida.  They never spoke
anywhere.  They never told their mother.  They never told their
father.  They never told their family members.  This is an
opportunity for them to be heard.  We thank you for that.
Your Honor, for 43 years my firm has been the leading
women's rights private law firm in the United States.  We have
helped thousands of victims.  And I, as an officer of the
court, and as a believer in the system, have tried to encourage
the victims to have confidence in the system that should
provide them access to justice that should help them to assert
and vindicate their rights in a court of law.  It has been
increasingly difficult in this case for me to say to my clients
that they should have confidence in the system of justice given
what has occurred in this case, People v. Jeffrey Epstein.  
Having said that, I am encouraged by the fact that 
this court, essentially, in an unprecedented situation where 
the defendant is deceased, is still affording these victims an 
opportunity to be heard.  So we thank you for that.  It is some 
encouragement. 
Your Honor, you also asked do our clients wish to be
heard in reference to some of the issues that have been raised
this morning, including what should happen into this case.
Your Honor, there has been a suggestion that the court should
investigate the circumstances of the death of Mr. Epstein.  I'm

not going to repeat the arguments made by counsel, but I would
say that if there is jurisdiction, and I know that is a legal
issue which has been previously argued, that certainly it would
increase the confidence of my clients.  Not just my clients,
but victims all over, and some are, by the way, located in
other parts of the world, to have the court oversee the
investigation.
We are encouraged by the sensitivity of the attorneys 
for the United States Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York and the investigation that is going on 
with the separate team.  However, and, of course, the defense 
is also conducting its own investigation.  But I do think the 
greatest confidence would be if the court in some way would be 
able to oversee an investigation because the court is a neutral 
party.  And although the court certainly has a stake in finding 
out what happened to defendants who are in the custody of the 
federal system and who should be there to face the prosecutors 
and the charges against them, but now are not because clearly 
the system has failed. 
And the United States Attorney has admitted that, and
even before he admitted that, everybody knows the system
failed.  Failed the victims, failed the court, failed everyone.
In any event, your Honor, having seen so many
thousands of victims of gender violence, sex harassment, sexual
assault, I've dealt with child sex trafficking, child

molesters, I mean, this is a unique case because there are so
many victims and so many failures of the system.  At this
point, what we would really ask for is not just words, but
words have been helpful, but deeds, and that is very important.
In addition, I would like to say, throughout this case
is the running theme of the betrayal of trust.  Betrayal of
trust by Jeffrey Epstein.  Betrayal of trust by the system.
And betrayal of trust to the victims who had a right to
justice.  And the Crime Victims' Act should not just be words,
it should have meaning and it should be enforced.
In essence, we are asking, although you may need to,
of course, grant this motion to dismiss, I think because the
court has shown sensitivity to victims and victims' needs, if
there is a way to at least keep the record open so that victims
who have not been able to be physically present in the
courtroom today and who have not been able to submit to the
court any letters, victim impact, and who have not been able to
secure attorneys or speak to attorneys yet -- so, for example,
I'll still hearing from victims who I have not been able to
meet with yet because they just recently are now contacting
me -- so if they could submit, at least for the record, their
victim impact statements, that, I think, would be a very
important assistance to them.  So that would be, at least they
would know that what they are sharing is on the record.
So, in summary, I would say that they are looking

forward to the very serious investigation by the United States
Attorney of who may have conspired in this case, and that is
very hopeful, and we're hoping that everyone who may have a
role to this criminal prosecution will submit that evidence.
This is about power.  This is about many victims 
having lived in fear -- fear of the rich, the powerful, the 
famous, fear that the system will not afford them justice.  So 
fear of not coming forward.  And fear, of course, is a weapon 
that the rich, powerful, famous, and sexual predators used to 
silence the victims.  But that is gone for a lot of victims 
because they refuse to suffer in silence. 
Finally, it does take courage to speak truth to power.
We thank this honorable court for giving these victims a voice.
We thank them, even after the death of the defendant, for
showing respect for the victims, allowing them dignity,
allowing them a voice.  We do want truth, we do want justice,
we do want accountability, and we do want those conspirators to
face the justice system.
Your Honor, right now we have two of our clients who
would like to address the court.
THE COURT:  Sure.
MS. ALLRED:  Then I have a couple of statements on
victims who do not wish to address the court.
As they come up, we'll give them the opportunity to
say either their name or Jane Doe.

MS. ALLRED:  Thank you.
MS. DAVIES:  Hello.  My name is Teala Davies.  That is
T-e-a-l-a D-a-v-i-e-s.
I was going to start this statement by saying that I
was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein.  But that's not the case.  I'm
still a victim of Jeffrey Epstein.  I'm still a victim because
the fear of not being heard stopped me from telling my story
for so many years.  This lingering fear almost stopped me from
attending this monumental movement of strength and power.
I'm still a victim because I am fearful for my 
daughters and everyone's daughters.  I'm fearful for their 
future in this world, where there are predators in power, a 
world where people can avoid justice if their pockets run deep 
enough. 
I'm still a victim because the 17-year-old Teala was
manipulated into thinking she had found someone who cared,
someone who wanted to help.  Jeffrey knew I had nowhere to go.
He knew I was vulnerable, and he took advantage of that poor
girl, who will never be the same.
I cannot eat at the thought that Jeffrey Epstein -- I

cannot eat at the thought of Jeffrey Epstein not serving the
time he needed to realize the pain and suffering he caused so
many vulnerable young girls.  He thought he was untouchable,
and honestly, so did I.  I thought he was the most powerful
person I would ever meet.
But the end is here and here I stand becoming more 
powerful than he will ever be.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Thank you.
JANE DOE:  Jane Doe.
Um, in 2004, when I was 15 years old, I flew on
Jeffrey Epstein's plane to Zorro Ranch, where I was sexual
molested by him for many hours.  What I remember most vividly
was him explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for
me and how much he was helping me to grow.  Yikes.
I remember feeling so small and powerless, especially 
after he positioned me by laying me on his floor so that I was 
confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him 
smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians.   
After he finished with me, he told me to describe in 
detail how good my first sexual experience felt.  That was the 
first of many lies I was forced to carry for him, the weight of 
which proliferated my trauma.  I felt powerless not merely 
because one man wanted to strip me of my innocence, but because 
I was the victim of a system that just enfranchises human 
beings, making them vulnerable to pedophilic exploitation.

J8RsEPS3                       
As unjust as what happened to me was, I believe that
experience to be a symptom of insidious and pathological
violence that extreme wealth yields, a violence which
ultimately stays hidden through channels of extreme power that
serve it.
I first identified with this feeling the night after I 
was molested by Epstein, when another girl and I took out two 
of his ATVs and raised them across the mesa.  I crashed mine 
and expressed my concern to the other girl of getting in 
trouble, which she replied to me, Don't worry, no one gets in 
trouble for anything here. 
Even as a child, I understood, in a sad and precocious
way, what I hoped we have the ability of changing now.  Even
though Epstein is dead, there is still justice to be brought
for the crimes we felt powerless against concealing for him and
the system that supported him for all these years.
Thank you.
THE COURT:  You're very welcome.
MS. ALLRED:  Thank you.
Your Honor, may it please the court.  I would like to
read a statement for Jane Doe, my client, who is present in
court, but requested that I read it.
We only have one opportunity at childhood.  One
opportunity to develop.  One opportunity to find direction for
our lives.  Jeffrey Epstein robbed and denied me at each

opportunity he had.
I came from a small Texas town, not far from the New 
Mexico border.  My mother died when I was 11, after suffering 
from cancer for many years.  My father was devastated, as were 
my siblings and I.  My father was saddled with debt.  My only 
hope for college was to get a scholarship.   
When I was 15, I was a blossoming freshman in high 
school and was trying to carry on my mother's dream.  She 
wanted me to master the violin.  After school, I would often go 
to a mall in a nearby city.  A lady approached me and saw I had 
a violin case with me and asked if I was any good.  We talked 
about the violin, my family, and why I had clothes that looked 
like hand-me-downs.   
The lady told me she works for a very rich man who had 
a home close by and that he would pay to hear me play.  I was 
told that if I could get away, she could arrange for 
transportation to and from his place and have me back before 
anyone knew I was gone.  After some hesitation, I agreed.  This 
decision was the beginning of the end of my childhood. 
The man who only identified himself as J or Jeff had
asked if I would give him a massage, and over four visits,
eventually progressed to forced oral copulation.  The money he
gave me further placed my young soul into a perverse sense of
hell.
I was so utterly disgusted with myself and what he did 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 53     Filed 09/03/19     Page 77 of 86

to me that I stopped going to see him.  I had documented the 
events with a Texas rape crisis center about the man I know now 
as Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein targeted and took advantage of me, a young
girl, whose mother had recently died a horrific death and whose
family structure had deteriorated.  His actions placed me, a
young girl, into a downward spiral to the point where I
purchased a gun and drove myself to an isolated place to end my
suffering.
A voice that could only have been from my mother told
me, quote, I am not the victim, I am the victor, and I dare not
pull the trigger." I returned the gun days later.
Epstein is a coward.  He lived his life leaching off
the souls of inspiring, young girls due to the fact that he
could never know how it feels inspired to live.  Like a leach,
once Epstein had his fill, he would unlatch and seek out
another victim.
The only sense of justice I had hoped to see was 
Epstein being sentenced.  However, Epstein died as he lived, 
taking the easy way out without any responsibility. 
Your Honor, the next statement is also a statement of
a Jane Doe.  May it please the court.
I was a 16-year-old virgin when Jeffrey Epstein first
raped me.  I was naive and gullable.  He was a pillar of
finance and a giant in the world that I was an insignificant

part of.  I was so impressed that this great man would even
talk to me and impart any of his wisdom on me.  I gladly jumped
at the chance to meet him again, when he told me how impressed
he was with my personal story and maturity for my age.
When I was in his presence, he made an effort to call 
celebrities and influential people on speakerphone, like 
Academy Award-winning actresses and super models, who always 
answered his calls.  Sadly, I was impressed.   
He was friends with former and future heads of states 
and every other fixture in the New York social scene and 
beyond.  He knew important people in my own world that I looked 
up to and revered, but he spoke about them like they were sweet 
distractions far beneath his stature.  He could easily reach 
down from his position and influence the people directly 
involved with my daily life and future prosperity.  I was the 
perfect victim. 
My whole life was extremely turbulent.  But one of my
mother's greatest wishes was that all her children would
graduate from respectable universities.  He promised me that he
would write me a letter of recommendation for Harvard if I got
the grades and scores needed for admission.  His word was worth
a lot, he assured me, as he was in the midst of funding and
leading Harvard's studies on the human brain, and the president
was his friend.
The fact that all of you already know these next

details, which I'll share, should ignite fire instead of induce
the complacency they did in the past, when heard repeatedly
over the years, but yes, an innocent massage turned sexual
almost immediately.
"Here, come.  Come help me with a kink in my shoulder
while we finish our discussion."  A large vibrator and a couple
of hundred dollars, disgust and dirty secret, more praise and
imparted wisdom from a godlike figure, a deliberate diabolical
depression of grooming and submission for his pleasure and
release.  Even if I resisted, I was no match for him.  I felt
powerless, ashamed, and embarrassed.  I wanted to vomit
remembering these moments.
What I learned in those depraved sessions, staring up
at the dome ceiling in his private massage room, tore a violent
hole through any normal sexual awakening.  I'm haunted forever,
having learned everything there is to know about sex through a
vile criminal.  Every time a new molestation would bring a new
lesson, the progressive and constant unwinding.  I was nothing
more than a teenage prostitute.  I was his slave.
I had never even kissed a boy before I met him, and
never throughout the horrific abuse did Jeffrey Epstein kiss me
even once.  When he stole my virginity, he washed my entire
body compulsively in the shower and then told me, "If you're
not a virgin, I will kill you."  And then I wasn't a virgin
anymore.

He forcefully penetrated me.  I was numb.  There was
pain, but his use of the vibrator and his fingers in previous
sessions with me had left a black hole-like void between my
legs.  I protested, but he forced my face into the bed to
stifle my cries.  That was my first time.
I got a few hundred dollars, as usual, as he led me
out of his mansion with assurances that I was on the right path
guided by him.  I lied to myself and tried to believe him.  I
became a hollow shell.  If I missed an appointment, he
threatened me and let me know who was in charge. "Do you know
how important my time is?  I'll bury you.  I owe this -- I
won't say the word -- F'ing town."  He would hang up.
I would stand there frozen in the street, terrified 
that his assistant would call to reschedule.  I made sure to 
stay in line and not disobey him.  I was in complete denial.  
Being paid after every scheduled meeting felt routine and 
disgusting.  He was the master of the universe and the world 
bent to his will.   
He would eventually brag to his assistants about my 
ability to please him sexually right in front of me, leaving me 
feeling grotesque and worthless.  Everything in my outside life 
was falling apart.  I distanced myself from friends and grew 
further away from my family.  I felt less human after each 
ordeal.  My psyche broke down completely and wouldn't let me 
continue.

One day I walked out of his residence and passed a 
girl similar to myself.  When I turned around, she was entering 
Jeffrey's residence.  He no longer even tried to schedule his 
appointments with other girls in secrecy from me.  Maybe he 
never did.  I was too stupid to see. 
My world shattered.  I had been so naive.  I had an
epiphany in a calvary of desperation.  I realized I was just
one of many young girls he had in rotation come to perform for
him for money.  I went into a deep depression and never lifted
completely.  I wanted to inflict pain on myself.  I was
humiliated, angry, and suicidal.  I locked myself away from
everything.  I cut myself off forever from the world I had
known.
I endured the daily agony of knowing my life would
never be the same.  I could never go back to New York City and
the wonderful life I had taken for granted before I met this
demon named Jeffrey Epstein.
This creature had manipulated and outwitted the whole
system, including some of the most intelligent scientists,
political people, prosecutors, and power players.  How easy was
it to manipulate a 16-year-old virgin who never had a boyfriend
and came from a background of hardship with no parental
guidance or support.
I went to therapy and was given antidepressants for 
severe anxiety and depression.  My only solace, years later,

was my desire to succeed on my own terms.  I emersed myself 
into my studies and was accepted to every college I applied to, 
graduating from a top university.  To this day, there is still 
an ache in my being that I did not apply to Harvard in fear of 
his influence there.   
They say you never forget your first.  I'm in a 
never-ending nightmare trying to do just that.  I'm forever 
suffering because everything reminds me of that horror.  This 
new wave of worldwide publicity only worsens my despair.   
It was only many years later that I was finally 
intimate with a man again, and those moments were marred by my 
actions as a child with Jeffrey Epstein.  Even now is 
impossible to separate his treachery from any care of a good 
man.   
For one brief moment there was elation when he was 
recently arrested.  I would finally get my chance to see him 
again face to face and show him what I had become, that I had 
succeeded on my own, that I was worth something in spite of his 
abuse, and that I had surmounted the monumental obstacles he 
laid before me throughout my entire life since falling prey to 
him.   
I had hoped humanity would prevail, but it seems to me 
that he outsmarted everyone so far, and his ghost is still 
laughing at us.  I appeal to all of those just and true that 
his evil legacy and his death not stand in the way of

And then just one last one, and this is much shorter.
Statement of Jane Doe, also my client.
I was a model in another country when I came to the
United States.  I was told by a booker that I needed to meet
with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was the owner of
Victoria's Secret.  The booker told me that Mr. Epstein could
help me get into Victoria Secret's world.
It was my childhood dream to be a Victoria's Secret 
model.  So I went one day in the afternoon and I met 
Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York.  A woman 
introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be 
extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would 
probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away.   
The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey 
Epstein's office.  Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we 
chatted very briefly.  I had my portfolio of photos, but he 
didn't even look at it.  Suddenly, he took his robe off and got 
close to me.  I got up to leave, but the door was locked.   
I didn't know what was going on.  It was my first 
official meeting to be cast in the United States.  I was a 
young girl and confused.  He got very close to me, and I had a 
skirt on.  He started to touch my genitals.  I refused him.  
Then he went to the massage table and showed me the vibrator.

J8RsEPS3                       
I took it and threw it at him.   
At that point, I ran to the door again and figured out 
how to get out of there.  A girl outside asked me where I was 
going and she said to be careful.  She said that Mr. Epstein 
knew a lot of powerful people, including Bill Clinton, and that 
if I didn't do what Mr. Epstein wanted, I would not be able to 
have any job in the industry. 
I was so scared.  I couldn't wait to get out of there,
and I left.  I took the train home.  I had spent all of my
savings getting Victoria's Secret lingerie to prepare for what
I thought would be my audition.  But instead, it seemed like a
casting call for prostitution.  I felt like I was in hell.
Thank you, your Honor.
Thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Allred.
Was there anybody else, any victim's counsel or any of 
the other victims who have not been heard and wish to be heard? 
Well, OK then.  All I have to say, really, is thank
you, all of you, for your participation in today's remarkable
hearing.  I think everybody has benefited greatly from your
input, and especially from the testimony of victims here today
and who have had the courage to come forward.
We have also benefited throughout these proceedings,
however brief altogether, from the attorneys' legal advocacy
and their written and oral submissions.  I'm grateful to them

CHAMBERS OF 
RICHARD M. BERMAN 
U.S.D.J. 
Yesterday, I was provided a paiiial transcript of the August 27, 2019 hearing in the above-
captioned case, and I am writing to clarify the record. 
As you know, I co-authored a New Yark Law Journal article before the hearing. The transcript 
quotes the court, in pertinent part, as follows with reference to me and the article: "On a somewhat more 
serious note, don't quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is 
himself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I'm 
certain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal." Later in the 
hearing, attorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court. 
Just to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate 
or to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert declaration, in 
support of Professor Dershowitz's motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. 
Dershowitz, 1: l 9-cv-03377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as "Epstein-
related." My work as an expert witness, which concluded in June, did not involve my representation of, 
or advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershowitz. I did not serve as counsel or as an advocate on 
anyone's behalf in co-authoring the law journal article. 
Very truly yours, 
~ 
Bruce A. Green

Dear Professor Green, 
September 4, 2019 
Thank you for your letter of August 30, 2019. I appreciate your taking the time to clarify 
the record. 
I learned that you had been "retained to provide opinions as an expert on legal ethics" in 
Giuffre v. Dershowitz following the August 27, 2019 public hearing in US v. Epstein. I learned 
of your role in the Giuffre case by reading your affidavit, dated June 7, 2019, which includes 
your legal ethics opinion that David Boies should be disqualified from representing Ms. Giuffre 
in that matter. As you are aware, both Mr. Boies and Ms. Giuffre were invited to testify at the 
August 27, 2019 hearing. 
I remain surprised that your advocacy of Mr. Boies' disqualification from representing 
Ms. Guiffre (in a case obviously related to US v. Epstein) was not disclosed simultaneously with 
your August 26, 2019 Law Journal opinion piece entitled "The Judge in Epstein's Case Should 
Not Tum the Dismissal Into a Drama for the Victims." I am also surprised that you would find 
the August 27, 2019 public hearing to be an inappropriate occasion for transparency in light of 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57 and the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771. 
You wrote: "This is an odd moment for transparency in a criminal case." 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 56     Filed 09/04/19     Page 2 of 2
Finally, it is unfortunate that your opinion piece may have been construed as an effort to 
chill Ms. Giuffre's and Mr. Boies' right to be heard under 18 U.S.C. § 3771 at the August 27, 
2019 public hearing. You wrote: "[W]hatever informational interests the victims may have 
would be served by affording them a chance to attend the hearing, not by giving them a speaking 
role."

Richard M. Berman

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK  
United States of America  
v.  
Jeffrey Epstein,   
Defendant.  
1:19-cr-490 (RMB)  
UNITED STATES’ MOTION TO UNSEAL GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS  
At the direction of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice hereby moves the Court 
to release grand jury transcripts associated with the above-referenced indictment.  
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a 
memorandum describing an exhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to 
Jeffrey Epstein (the “Memorandum”).1 The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the 
Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether evidence existed 
that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, 
no such evidence was uncovered during the review.   
Since July 6, 2025, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the 
Memorandum’s conclusions.  While the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
continue to adhere to the conclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American 
public is of the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the 
investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
into Epstein, the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury 
https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1407001/dl?inline. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 61     Filed 07/18/25     Page 1 of 4

transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other 
personal identifying information.2 The Department will work with the United States Attorney’s 
Office for Southern District of New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related 
information and other personal identifying information prior to releasing the transcripts.  
Transparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation under the law to protect 
victims.   
1. 
On July 2, 2019, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York returned 
an indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See Dkt. No. 2. On August 10, 2019, 
while awaiting trial, Epstein committed suicide in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in New York City. Soon after, the Court dismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52. 
2. 
On June 29, 2020, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York charged 
Epstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking 
and coercion of minors. See United States v. Maxwell, 1:20-cr-330, Dkt. No. 1 (S.D.N.Y.  June 29, 
2020). In December 2021, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts. Maxwell was sentenced 
to 240 months’ imprisonment, and the Second Circuit later affirmed her convictions and sentence. 
See United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2024).  
3. 
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
announced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein’s crimes and death. Since 
then, the public’s interest in the Epstein matter has remained. Given this longstanding and 
legitimate interest, the government now moves to unseal grand jury transcripts associated with 
Epstein.  
The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States v. Maxwell, 1:20-cr-330 (S.D.N.Y.), and in the 
Southern District of Florida.  
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 61     Filed 07/18/25     Page 2 of 4

4. 
“It is a tradition of law that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain 
secret.” In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. 1973). “[T]he tradition of secrecy,” however, “is not 
absolute.” In re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive, 104 F. Supp. 3d 625, 628 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Although 
Rule 6(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure generally lists the exceptions to grand 
jury secrecy, the Second Circuit has recognized that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in 
which release of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” In re 
Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 767 (7th 
Cir. 2016) (“Rule 6(e)(3)(E) does not displace that inherent power. It merely identifies a permissive 
list of situations where that power can be used.”). One such “special circumstance” is historical 
interest by the public. In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 105. Under In re Craig, this Court retains discretion 
to determine “whether such an interest outweighs the countervailing interests in privacy and 
secrecy[.]” Id.  
5. 
Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested 
and concerned about the Epstein matter. Indeed, other jurists have released grand jury transcripts 
after concluding that Epstein’s case qualifies as a matter of public concern. See Order Granting 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Court’s February 29, 2024 Order, CA Florida 
Holdings, LLC v. Dave Aronberg and Joseph Abruzzo, 50-2019 CA-014681 (15th Cir. July 1, 
2024).3 After all, Jeffrey Epstein is “the most infamous pedophile in American history.” Id. The 
facts surrounding Epstein’s case “tell a tale of national disgrace.” In re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244, 1247 
(11th Cir. 2021) (discussing the plea agreement secured by Epstein in Florida). The grand jury 
records are thus “critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history.” In re Petition of 
Nat. Sec. Archive, 104 F. Supp. 3d at 629. “The time for the public to guess what they contain 
https://www.mypalmbeachclerk.com/home/showpublisheddocument/4194/638554423710170000. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 61     Filed 07/18/25     Page 3 of 4

should end.” Id. Notably, the privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance are 
substantially diminished due to Epstein’s death. Of course, as noted above, the Department of 
Justice will work with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York 
to redact all victim-identifying information prior to any release. 
6. 
For these reasons, this Court should conclude that the Epstein and Maxwell cases 
qualify as a matter of public interest, release the associated grand jury transcripts, and lift any 
preexisting protective orders. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 105 (“It is … entirely conceivable that 
in some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury 
information.”).

EJLECTR:ClPHCALLY 
CR. 490 (RMB) 
ORDER 
The Court has received a four page "United States' Motion to Unseal Grand Jury 
Transcripts" filed with the S.D.N.Y. Clerk's Office on Friday evening, July 18, 2025. See ECF 
No. 61 (Gov't Motion). The Gov't Motion requests that the Court "unseal the underlying grand 
jury transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and 
other personal identifying information." Id. at 1-2. 
The Court intends to resolve this motion expeditiously. However, the Court cannot rule 
on the motion without additional submissions from the Government. Specifically: 
Memorandum of law: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) codified the practice, 
"'older than our Nation itself,' that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain 
secret." In re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 
489, 491 (2d Cir. 1973) (Friendly, C.J.)); see also Douglas Oil Co. of'Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 
441 U.S. 211,218 (1979). Rule 6(e)(3) lists exceptions to the rule of secrecy but these are not 
invoked by the Government's Motion. The Second Circuit - but not many other circuits - has 
recognized that there are ce1tain "special circumstances" in which release of grand jury records 
may be appropriate, based upon a court's supervisory authority over grand juries it empanels .. 1 See 
The Seventh Circuit agrees that a district cou1t may order the release of grand jury materials upon 
a showing of special circumstances. See Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 766-67 (7th Cir. 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 63     Filed 07/22/25     Page 2 of 4
In re Craig, 131 F .3d at l 02; see also id. at 104 ("The discretion of a trial court in deciding whether 
to make public the ordinarily secret proceedings of a grand jury investigation is one of the broadest 
and most sensitive exercises of careful judgment that a trial judge can make."). The Second Circuit 
has identified the following factors for district comis to weigh where considering applications for 
disclosure: 
• 
the identity of the party seeking disclosure; 
• 
whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the Government opposes the 
disclosure; 
• 
why disclosure is being sought in the particular case; 
• 
what specific information is being sought for disclosure; 
• 
how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; 
• 
the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that of their 
families; 
• 
the extent to which the desired material has been previously made public; 
• 
whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might be affected by 
disclosure are still alive; and 
• 
[whether there is an] additional need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case 
in question. 
Id. at 106 (capitalization altered); see also Laws.' Comm.for 9/11 Inquiry, Inc. v. Garland, 43 
F.4th 276,285 (2d Cir. 2022) (affirming district comi's application of those factors). 
2016). Other circuits have taken a much narrower view ofa district court's authority. See, e.g., 
McKeever v. Barr, 920 F.3d 842, 843, 850 (D.C. Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S, Ct. 597 (2020); 
Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1241 (11th Cir. 2020) (en bane); United States v. McDougal, 
559 F.3d 837, 841 (8th Cir. 2009); In re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d 481, 488 (6th Cir. 1991 ), 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 63     Filed 07/22/25     Page 3 of 4
The Government's motion does not adequately address these factors. The Court 
accordingly directs the Government to file a memorandum of law, no later than Tuesday, July 29, 
2025, addressing with specificity these factors. The memorandum of law is to be no more than 25 
pages, double spaced. In light of grand jury secrecy and victim-related issues and other personal 
identifying information concerns, the Government is directed to file, on the public record, a 
redacted version, and to file under seal the memorandum in unredacted form. 
The Coutt also directs the Government to state in the memorandum whether, before filing 
the instant motion, counsel for the Government reviewed the Epstein grand jury transcripts and 
whether the Government provided notice to the victims of the motion to unseal. Following the 
Court's ruling on the Government's motion, the Coutt will invite the Government's input as to 
whether, and to what extent, these redactions are warranted. 
Grand jmy transcripts: The Court has not received the grand jury transcripts that the 
Government seeks to unseal. The Court directs the Government to submit to the Court under seal 
the following materials no later than Tuesday, July 29, 2025: (I) an index of Epstein grand jury 
transcript materials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set 
of Epstein grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of Epstein grand jury 
transcripts (i.e., the transcripts in the form that the Government proposes to release them); and (4) 
a description of any other Epstein grand jury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits. 
Submission from Epstein's Representative: The Coutt has not received any letter on 
behalf of deceased defendant Epstein setting out any position vis-a-vis the proposed disclosure. 
Any such letter is due on or before Tuesday, August 5, 2025. 
Submission(s) from Victims: The Government may not have notified the victims. And, 
the Coutt has not received any letters on behalf of the victims setting out their positions on grand

jury disclosure. Any such letters are due on or before Tuesday, August 5, 2025. See Gov't Motion 
at I n.1 (This is a 2 page, undated, unsigned, U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of 
Investigation memo. According to the Government, "Epstein harmed over one thousand victims. 
Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is intertwined 
throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and likenesses, 
physical descriptions, places ofbiith, associates, and employment history.").

Re: 
United States v. Epstein, Case No. l 9-Cr-490 
Dear Judge Berman: 
On behalf of MSW Media, Inc, ("MSW Media"), I respectfully submit this letter motion 
to intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially 
opposing the Government's motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case, 
filed as Docket No. 61. 
MSW Media (https://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and biogs about 
federal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It 
clearly qualifies as a representative of the news media. 
MSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the following reason. On 17 July 
2025, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the 
Court's permission to release "any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of 
Information Act ("FOIA") request with the Department of Justice ("DOJ") for transcripts of all 
grand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-330 (S.D.N.Y.). We 
are concerned with the modifier "pertinent" in President Trump's instruction, and that concern 
seemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to "make 
appropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information 
prior to releasing the transcripts." (Dkt. #61 at 2 ( emphasis added).) 
To be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not 
pertain to that information, However, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be 
implicitly seeking this Court's permission to withhold other personally identifiable information, 
such as information about the former defendant's partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while 
we join the Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make 
this narrow independent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of 
withholding personally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this 
FOIA request if necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly 

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 64     Filed 07/25/25     Page 4 of 4
withheld is a question best left to the court adjudicating that future case. We are concerned that, 
if this Court explicitly or implicitly blesses the Government's proposed redactions ofnon-victim-
related personally identifiable information ( even in passing), that opinion will be treated as a 
proverbial thumb on the scale in our FO IA case without materially affecting the Court's decision 
in this case. 
In other words, if this Court mentions in its decision that it was swayed at all by the 
Government's promise to redact personally identifiable information, we are concerned that the 
Government will then argue in its FOIA case that "Judge Berman agreed that this information 
should not be publicly disclosed." Therefore, we respectfully request that this Court not take the 
Government's statements regarding non-victim-related personally identifiable information into 
account when reaching its decision regarding the Government's motion, and we further request 
that the Court specify that it is not opining on that question, should it grant the Government's 
motion. 
The Government takes no position on the intervention of MSW Media. I did not consult 
with a representative for the former defendant.

GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM IN RESPONSE TO THE 
COURT’S ORDERS OF JULY 22, 2025 
PAMELA J. BONDI

United States Department of Justice 
JAY CLAYTON

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 1 of 10

I. 
Preliminary Statement 
The Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders 
concerning the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 61; Maxwell 
Dkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 1–3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 1–3). 
This memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted 
in the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63 
at 1–3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 1–3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process … not be 
at the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 61 
at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental 
submission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or 
others referenced in the transcripts.   
II. 
The Court’s Orders 
As the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 1–2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 1–2), the Second 
Circuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury 
records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d 
Cir. 1997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. 1973) (supplemental opinion) 
(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of 
grand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).1 The Second Circuit 
enumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions: 
There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1233 & n.6 (11th Cir. 
2020) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); In re Petition for Order Directing Release of 
Records, 27 F.4th 84, 90–91 (1st Cir. 2022) (same). In light of this split, when the Government 
sought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida 
from 2005 and 2007 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the 
Eleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Pitch—denied that motion. In re 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 2 of 10

(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure; (ii) whether the 
defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes 
the disclosure; (iii) why disclosure is being sought in the particular 
case; (iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure; 
(v) how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; (vi) the 
current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that 
of their families; (vii) the extent to which the desired material—
either permissibly or impermissibly—has been previously made 
public; (viii) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who 
might be affected by disclosure are still alive; and (ix) the additional 
need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question. 
In re Craig, 133 F.3d at 106. 
On July 22, 2025, the Court directed the Government to file a memorandum of law 
“addressing with specificity these and any other factors that the Government views as germane to 
its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). The Court also directed the 
Government to state whether, “before filing the instant motion, counsel for the Government 
reviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the Government provided notice to the 
victims of the motion to unseal,” and to submit: (1) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand jury 
materials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of the 
Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein 
and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand 
jury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 
3).

III. 
Discussion 
A. 
The In re Craig Factors 
The Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [In re Craig] factors 
and any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 
at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follows is a discussion of each of the In re Craig factors, which 
are designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in 
public disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest 
and the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. In re Craig, 
131 F.3d at 104. 
1. 
The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure 
The first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the 
identity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106.   Here, 
the Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with 
increasing calls for additional disclosures in this matter.2 The Government’s position “serve[s] as 
a preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not 
dispositive.” Id.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can 
government opposition preclude it.”). While the Government acknowledges the extraordinary 
See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at 
Federal Prison - United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and 
circumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense 
public interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the 119th Congress, on February 11, 2025, the 
Committee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a letter to the U.S. 
Department of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession 
regarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.’ On May 8, the Task Force 
sent another letter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein 
files’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).  
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 4 of 10

nature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the 
underlying proceedings. 
2. 
Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the 
Government Opposes the Disclosure 
The second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure 
of grand jury materials. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106; see also Lawyers’ Committee for 9/11 
Inquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285–86 (2d Cir. 2022) (affirming denial of motion to disclose 
grand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public 
disclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 800 F.2d 1293, 
1305 (4th Cir. 1986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and 
exhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).  
Defendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position.3 Defendant Maxwell 
has indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell 
Dkt. 793). 
3. 
Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case 
The third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” In re 
Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. The Second Circuit in In re Craig held: “It is . . . entirely conceivable that 
in some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury 
information.” Id. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly 
expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes.  Beyond 
that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of 
Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See In re Am. Hist. Ass’n, 49 F. 
As noted below, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family 
concerning the instant motion. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 5 of 10

Supp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (applying In re Craig) (“Many historians … have spent 
countless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the 
public’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 1; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 1). Attention given to the 
Epstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2025 Memorandum 
announcing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.  
The instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in 
that memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information 
to the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims. 
4. 
What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure 
The fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See In re 
Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury 
transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 1; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 1). As 
stated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to 
appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein 
Dkt. 61 at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2). 
5. 
How Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place 
The fifth factor asks how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. In re Craig, 131 
F.3d at 106.  The grand jury met in June and July of 2019 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met 
in June and July of 2020 and March of 2021 in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has 
not dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107 (“if historical interest 
in a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that 
the public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”). 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 6 of 10

6. 
The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings 
and that of their Families 
The sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings 
and that of their families.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death 
of the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.” 
Id. at 106. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.” 
Id. 
In this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges 
proposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached 
the Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members 
previously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the 
Government responded to that request, and no litigation ensued.  Maxwell currently is 
incarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the 
motions. 
7. 
The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or 
Impermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public 
The Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly 
leaked to the public. 
Certain aspects and subject matters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial. 
To the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the 
Government’s disclosure obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order.  
Many of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject 
of grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent 
and the detective from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and 
some have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation.  The 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 7 of 10

Government is providing under seal a list of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand 
jury proceedings and a corresponding list noting which witnesses testified at trial. 
8. 
Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be 
Affected by Disclosure Are Still Alive 
The eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might 
be affected by disclosure are still alive.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106.  
Here, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings. 
There were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a 
detective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and 
Human Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.  
Both witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the 
Detective continues to be a Detective with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.  
Consistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the 
grand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning 
victims, many of whom are still alive.  In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the 
Government will note which victims are still alive. 
9. 
Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the 
Particular Case in Question 
Finally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the 
particular case in question.” In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. In addition to the typical reasons for 
grand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying 
information related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the 
crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and 
which is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them. (See 
Epstein Dkt. 61 at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2). 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 8 of 10

B. 
Additional Information 
The Court directed the Government to state whether, “before filing the instant motion, 
counsel for the Government reviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the 
Government provided notice to the victims of the motion to unseal.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; 
Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3).  
Before filing the motions to unseal, relevant counsel for the Government reviewed the 
Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts. In addition, the Government has now provided notice 
to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at issue in this 
motion.  The Government has attempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have 
been unsuccessful.  In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other 
individuals identified in the transcripts. 
C. 
Provision of Materials to the Court 
The Court directed the Government to submit: (1) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand 
jury materials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of 
the Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein 
and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand 
jury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 
3).  As to the final category, the Government provides a description of all of the underlying 
materials presented to the grand jury as well as copies of, and proposed redactions to, certain 
materials presented to the grand jury. 
The Government is submitting these materials ex parte and under seal, as they relate to 
grand jury proceedings and include information related to victims, including but not limited to 
victim-identifying information of individuals who neither testified at trial or who were the subject 
of testimony at trial. The Government underscores that it takes very seriously its obligation to 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 66     Filed 07/29/25     Page 9 of 10

protect victim-related information and therefore believes the proposed redactions not only are 
appropriate but are necessary to protect those rights.

Re:
USA vs. Epstein, 1:19-cr-00490-RMB
Dear Hon. Judge Berman:
As a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some 
things that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ written by an anonymous 
member of the DOJ.  
One, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or 
combatting child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims 
we would see some kind of accountability for the years they allowed this horrible human being, 
if you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-setting around the world 
with high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his 
notorious private island. And to make matters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault 
victims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a 
decade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the 
wealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “know who 
they are”. To learn that our own president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity 
and these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blowing. That is their focus? Wow! 
Two, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers, 
without resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what 
happened? Did he really “Kill himself”? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get 
to see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged. 
Three, the latest attention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL 
and the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS. 
Why the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?
I appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and 
frustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones 
asking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they 
have concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them, 
but them. I am beside myself.
I think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved 
third-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed 
through this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are 
completely and entirely protected.

Thank you so much for your time.
I have attached the portion of the DOJ’s memo and link to their statement.
[Consistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one 
thousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these 
victims is intertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim 
names and likenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment 
history.
One of our highest priorities is combatting child exploitation and bringing justice to victims. 
Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.
To that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding 
Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is the 
determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no 
further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.]

Re:	
United States of America vs. Jeffrey Epstein, 1:19-cr-00490-RMB
Dear Hon. Judge Berman:
I come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of how the United States of 
America’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the 
court, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time 
for me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I 
use quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?” 
I regrettably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s 
motion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to 
say, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under 
whose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and 
utter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our own government, the agencies 
that were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they utterly and completely 
failed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this 
letter to the court. 
Because, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice. 
Therefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this matter I have a voice to 
speak to the court and to the United States. 
Dear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein 
Files” with more respect towards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political 
warfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to 
perpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Show us all the files with 
only the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allow me/us to heal. You protect yourself and 
your powerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims know the 
truth, we know who are in the files and now so do you. Do you really think the public is that 
ignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you 
say you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay 
silent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy 
powerful “friends”. In the end we are the biggest voices of the truth and the truth always comes 
out in time.

Page 2
Dear Judge Berman, in making your decision to allow the Unites States of America’s 
current sitting attorneys for the DOJ’s request to release these files, I ask you to have our 
attorneys review the “suggested” redactions as they are the ones who also know the victims, their 
names, their truths and their stories unlike the Unites States Government who did not and does 
not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/
abuser for information. 
In conclusion, I beg the court to make sure it is the upmost priority that in any sort of 
release ALL and EVERY detail that could possibly reveal our identities be redacted. I also 
request that you take your time in making your decision and consider allowing for the victims 
attorney’s to review these files before a release is permitted. 
Side Note: If other victims do not mind having their personal information redacted, my voice is not for them.
Sincerely and thank you for your time,

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 
Cr. 490 (RMB) 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Cr. 330 (PAE) 
Dear Judges Berman and Engelmayer: 
The Government writes respectfully to respond to the Court’s orders, dated July 31, 2025, 
directing the Government to provide additional information regarding grand jury materials the 
Government has asked the Court to unseal in these cases. (Epstein Dkt. 67; Maxwell Dkt. 797). 
In particular, on July 18, 2025, the Government moved the Court to unseal grand jury 
transcripts from these cases, subject to appropriate redactions. (Epstein Dkt. 61; Maxwell 
Dkt. 785). The Court directed the Government to provide supplemental briefing (Epstein Dkt. 63; 
Maxwell Dkt. 789), which the Government submitted on July 29, 2025 (Epstein Dkt. 66; Maxwell 
Dkt. 796). In addition, the Court set a schedule whereby the defendants and victims could set out 
their positions on or before August 5, 2025. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3–4; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 4). 
On July 31, 2025, the Court directed the Government to provide additional information by 
August 4, 2025, in particular, in the Epstein case, a letter: 
1. 
Verifying the date(s) of all grand jury presentation(s) in this 
case; 
2. 
Providing all exhibits shown to grand jurors; 
3. 
Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand 
jury exhibits as well as the transcripts; 
4. 
Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits that are 
not already part of the public record (They may be redacted 
for any public release);

Analyzing how the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52) 
filed in this case impacts proposed disclosure, with legal 
authorities. 
(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional 
information by August 4, 2025, in particular, a letter: 
1. 
Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand 
jury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts. 
2. 
Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as 
redacted for public release, that are not already part of the 
public record. In making this assessment, the Government 
should take into account whether the unredacted portions of 
these exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this 
case, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or 
disclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v. 
Maxwell, 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP). 
3. 
Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the 
grand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that 
is not already part of the public record, taking into account 
the sources above. 
(Maxwell Dkt. 797). 
Because the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects, 
the Government respectfully submits this consolidated letter response.  
First, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in 
these cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large 
number of exhibits were admitted at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to 
judicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United 
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995) (“the public has an especially strong right of 
access to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); United 
States v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d 181, 186 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (“trial exhibits are judicial 
documents to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting 
Amodeo, 71 F.3d at 1049)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any 
judicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during 
the Maxwell trial.  
The Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8, 
2025, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit 
the Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 70     Filed 08/05/25     Page 2 of 4

necessary redactions) any submissions to the Court by the victims identified in the grand jury 
transcripts, which are due to the Court on August 5, 2025. 
Second, the Epstein grand jury met on June 18, 2019, and July 2, 2019. The Maxwell grand 
jury met on June 29, 2020, July 8, 2020, and March 29, 2021. 
Third, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand 
jury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession. 
The Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury 
exhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its letter to the Court but did not have readily 
available at that time. 
Fourth, in connection with this letter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge 
Engelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that 
specifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware, 
publicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2025, many of the 
victims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by 
investigating law enforcement witnesses.  The enclosed, annotated transcripts show that much of 
the information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the 
identities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise 
been publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses.1 
Fifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The 
Government, however, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand 
jury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to 
compare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell 
trial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the 
extent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the 
Court to supplement this letter no later than August 8, 2025, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge 
Berman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order. 
Sixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure. 
While the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]” 
when “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, 140 U.S. 575, 583 (1891), it did so in the 
context of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has 
explicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether 
to disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.), 
Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar 
analysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in 
the Court’s analysis of the In re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.

affirmed 147 F.2d 336 (5th Cir. 1945) (“The same jurisdiction that was sought in the beginning 
continues to exist insofar as the integrity and preservation of the minutia and minutes and 
proceedings of those steps are concerned. What was done here is evidence and may be advantaged 
by either party, having in mind, of course, the question of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings. 
And the only jurisdiction over such matters is in this court.”); see also, e.g., Dale v. Bartels, 532 
F. Supp. 973, 978–79 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony 
after entry of a nolle prosequi). However, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis 
for the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 106 
(2d Cir. 1997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and 
that of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with 
these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”). 
Seventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant 
proceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the 
unsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at 
issue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With 
respect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously 
received victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein matters, the Government will over the 
coming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions. 
Finally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of 
victims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of 
these and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to 
modify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so 
as promptly as practicable. 
As always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.

Re: 
United States of America v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 19-cr-490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
On behalf of the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein, we write at the Court’s 
invitation by Order in this action dated July 22, 2025 (ECF No. 63) to set out the Epstein Estate’s 
position regarding the Government’s recent motion to unseal all grand jury transcripts in this 
action, “subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying 
information” (ECF No. 61 at 1-2). 
In view of the Government’s commitment to protect the identities of those claiming to 
have been victimized by Mr. Epstein, the Epstein Estate takes no position regarding the 
Government’s motion to unseal. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Daniel H. Weiner and Daniel Ruzumna

Re: Unsealing of Grand Jury Transcripts in U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490 (RMB) and U.S. v. 
Maxwell, 20-cr-330 (PAE) 
Dear Judges Berman and Engelmayer, 
We write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from 
the Department of Justice on July 25, 2025, advising that the Court is seeking letters on behalf of 
victims setting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine 
Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts.1  
By the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from Epstein’s and 
Maxwell’s actions.  To date, however, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement 
agencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes committed 
against countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further 
criminal investigations are forthcoming is a cowardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.2  
Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial. 
While the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein 
and Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the 
specific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure. 
Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is now, to the 
victims’ horror, herself attempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon 
Docket and file.

MEMO ENDORSED
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 72     Filed 08/05/25     Page 1 of 5

It is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise 
involving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these 
unspeakable atrocities.   
The recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information 
concerning Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective.  Ms. 
Farmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the 
unsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with 
redactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.  
Transparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full 
scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to 
others.  While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone 
(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 300 gigabytes 
of data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well), 
the instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and 
Maxwell’s crimes.  
In this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the 
conscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the 
failures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.  
Unsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse, 
provide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to how these crimes 
were investigated and prosecuted.  While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not 
absolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure. 
1. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the 
Unsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.  
The Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release 
of grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries 
they empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion … in evaluating whether disclosure is 
appropriate.”  In re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102, 104 (2d Cir. 1997).  In Craig, the Second 
Circuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding 
whether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts.  Id. at 106.  We join 
the Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3–7.  
Two factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.  
or commutation of her sentence.  The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential 
leniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 72     Filed 08/05/25     Page 2 of 5

A. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case  
Grand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary 
case.  In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4–5, 
disclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s 
victims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes.  This transparency and 
accountability is a form of justice.  Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his 
crimes span decades, with thousands of victims.  Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on 
minors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation.  Maxwell, his righthand woman, 
played a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes 
participating in the abuse.  Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others, 
enabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.  
Given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand 
jury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and 
those who enabled it.  For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced, 
fearful of the repercussions of exposing the many powerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many 
of whom have not yet been named or investigated.  Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would 
allow additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose 
themselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones 
to expose such information.  The Government itself acknowledged that there are “over one 
thousand victims,” 3  yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received 
compensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and 
their co-conspirators.  The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.  
See Matter of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2012) (ordering disclosure of 
banking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the 
victims). 
B. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by 
Disclosure Are Still Alive  
This factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand 
jury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing.  This case presents a rare and compelling 
circumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy.  In In re National Security Archive, 
for example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses 
did not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony 
was appropriate.  2008 WL 8985358, at *1–2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2008).  The victims represented 
by the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but 
See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2025), 
https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1407001/dl?inline.  
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 72     Filed 08/05/25     Page 3 of 5

affirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.  
Their consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor.  Further, because 
the Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no 
risk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized.  In re Kutler, 800 F. Supp. 2d 42, 50 (D.D.C. 
2011) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any 
remaining privacy concerns”).  
2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.  
The grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrowly tailored redactions of the 
names, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims.  The Court should not, however, 
rubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who 
neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell 
were charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7.  Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover 
up.  The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party” 
names or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way.  To the extent the Government 
for some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that 
these individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court 
should exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve 
compelling interests.  See generally Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 50 (2d Cir. 2019) (even if 
materials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies, 
“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).  
A. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is 
Appropriate. 
The privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human 
trafficking) are strong.  In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of 
the privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.”  Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2020 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221599, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020).  The Court explained that “[t]hose 
interests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors 
of alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.”  Giuffre v. Dershowitz, 
2020 WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2020).  And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily” 
where “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private 
litigant.”  Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221599, at *16.  In Doe 1 v. JP Morgan 
Chase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein 
justified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of 
their assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling 
reason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.”  742 F. Supp. 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y. 
Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB     Document 72     Filed 08/05/25     Page 4 of 5

2024).  Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell 
weigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. 
B. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-
Conspirators Are Improper.  
The Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2025 Memorandum that concluded 
that no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with 
Epstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme.  Epstein Dkt. No. 61 at 1–2. The Government purports 
to seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the 
conclusions reached by the Memorandum.  Id.  To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient 
evidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes 
and participated in them.  Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases 
have been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s 
sex trafficking.  
As the Court acknowledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and 
Maxwell’s crimes.  Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4.  Less than one-fifth of these victims have been 
compensated for the crimes committed against them, either through the now-closed Epstein 
Victims Compensation Fund or otherwise.  To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases 
filed that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking 
crimes.  See Doe 1 v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-10019 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe 1 v. 
Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-10018 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No. 
24-cv-01204 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-
conspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts, 
their identities should not be shielded from the public.  Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent 
third parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79 
(2d Cir. 1990), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.   
*** 
Ms. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts, 
subject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.  Unsealing the 
grand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.

RE: Crime Victims’ Rights Act Implications Regarding Unsealing of Grand Jury 
Materials in Epstein Proceedings 
Case:  United States of America v. Jeffrey Epstein 
Case No.:  19 CR 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
We represent numerous survivors of Jeffrey Epstein, including several individuals whose names and 
identifying information appear in the subject materials. In that vein, we write to address the 
Department of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials and to respectfully urge the Court to 
administer any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the victims’ rights under the Crime Victims’ 
Rights Act (“CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, the enduring interests protected by Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent. 
I.
Victims’ CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context—
Not in a Vacuum
The CVRA guarantees victims:

 
The right to be reasonably protected from the accused (§ 3771(a)(1)); 
 
The right to be heard at any public proceeding involving release, parole, or sentencing (§ 
3771(a)(3)); 
 
The right to confer with the attorney for the Government (§ 3771(a)(5)); and, 
 
The right to be treated with fairness and respect for dignity and privacy (§ 3771(a)(8)). 
See also Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1016–17 (9th Cir. 2006) (fairness and dignity are 
substantive, enforceable rights); In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391, 394–95 (5th Cir. 2008) (government must 
confer with victims before making consequential case decisions); In re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244 (11th 
Cir. 2021) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully attached post-conviction).  
Given our history fighting for the enforcement of the CVRA on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein’s many 
victims, we were quite surprised to learn that the government sought the unsealing of grand jury 
materials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a step required 
by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, 08-80736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro 
bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government 
previously violated the rights of many of these very same victims.  It is especially troubling that, 
despite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that 
disregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken 
hold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the 
current administration. 
Of significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before 
moving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is now the government representing to this Court 
that it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper 
review and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing 
deep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested 
yesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The 
government responded promptly and provided clarification. However, we have strong reason to 
believe that additional individuals—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those 
materials but were not identified to us by the government.  
It remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was 
a government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether 
these individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this 
ambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.  
Against this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose 
or help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and 
protection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined 
in the relief requested below is adopted by this Court.

II. 
Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrow 
Tailoring. 
Grand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol 
Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 219–23 (1979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant 
must establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any 
disclosure should be no broader than necessary. Id. at 222–23. The Eleventh Circuit has further 
held that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions 
in Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1237–38 (11th Cir. 2020) (en banc); see also 
McKeever v. Barr, 920 F.3d 842, 845–46 (D.C. Cir. 2019). 
Here, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and 
the traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care: 
rigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and 
meaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce 
this approach. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’ 
identities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.1 (privacy redactions). 
Many Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those now adults, § 3771(a)(8) 
and the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 3509(d) 
principles. 
III. 
Requested Relief 
In light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court: 
1) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA §§ 3771(a)(5), (c)(1)): Direct the Government to 
confer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard 
before any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials. 
2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury 
materials to determine whether the proponent has shown a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any 
disclosure and, if so, the narrowest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil. 
3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’ 
counsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a 
strict protective order, to allow victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers, 
(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment 
of victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary. 
4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with 
additional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the 
opportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.

5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards 
cannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Pitch, and the CVRA, deny disclosure 
without prejudice. 
IV. 
Conclusion 
The survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy, 
or dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system 
is sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma.  Several 
victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to 
the trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured 
profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the 
years following. To now compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—
especially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the letter and the spirit of 
the CVRA.  
The CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point toward narrow tailoring, maximal 
privacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight. 
We respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above. 
Respectfully submitted,
