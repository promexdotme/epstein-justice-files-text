UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 1000, 
Plaintiff, 
CASE NO: 
v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
in their capacities as the executors of the  
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN,  
Defendants. 
_____________________________________ 
COMPLAINT 
BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 1 of 14

Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000, by her attorneys Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, for her Complaint 
against Defendants, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn in their capacities as the executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein (“Epstein”), avers upon personal knowledge as to her own 
acts and status and upon information and belief and to all other matters as follows: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1.
This suit arises out of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of Plaintiff.
2.
Jane Doe 1000 was sexually trafficked by Epstein as part of his organized ring of
procuring young and underage girls for sex.  One of Epstein’s co-conspirators contacted Jane 
Doe after a modeling appearance and arranged to have Jane Doe meet Epstein under the false 
pretense that he was involved in the modeling industry and wanted to interview her about 
opportunities.  Rather than help her with her modeling career, Epstein manipulated and 
intimidated Jane Doe and subjected her to years of sexual abuse in his New York mansion. 
3.
Epstein’s trafficking scheme involved recruiting young females by making false promises
and using his wealth, power and threats to intimidate the females into submission to his 
demands.  This same pattern was repeated numerous times with numerous young women. 
4.
As United States District Judge Kenneth Marra found, “From between about 1999 and
2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor girls . . . at his mansion in Palm Beach 
Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas. . . . In addition to his own sexual abuse 
of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually.  Epstein used paid 
employees to find and bring minor girls to him.  Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain 
minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.”  
Doe 1 v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1204 (S.D. Fla. 2019) (internal citations omitted).   
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 2 of 14

5. 
Epstein organized this sex trafficking network to obtain hundreds of young females for 
himself for sex, and also lent these females out to other powerful and wealthy individuals to be 
sexually abused.  
6. 
Epstein conspired with others and hired staff to maintain and keep secret this network of 
sexual abuse for years, which sprawled throughout Epstein’s residences in New York, Florida, 
New Mexico, the United States Virgin Islands, and Paris.  Epstein’s preference was to have three 
different young females a day for his sexual pleasure. 
7. 
  Despite his significant criminal activity, in 2008 Epstein received a shockingly minimal 
charge pleading guilty to a single Florida state law charge of procuring a minor for prostitution 
and a non-prosecution agreement (a “NPA”) with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida.  Unknown to the public and the victims at the time, Epstein’s lawyers were pressuring 
the Government to commit to the NPA without informing the victims.  Epstein’s multiple 
victims were kept in the dark and told to be “patient” while Epstein’s lawyers worked to protect 
him and other potential co-conspirators from prosecution.  Epstein served one year in jail, but 
was afforded the privilege of being able to leave the jail to go to work for twelve hours per day, 
six days per week. 
8. 
The NPA allowed Epstein to escape proportionate punishment for his actions and to 
continue operating his sex trafficking enterprise with liberty.   
9. 
A few years later, Epstein flippantly referred to his sexual abuse of multiple minors, and 
the slap on the wrist he had received for it, in a 2011 interview with the New York Post: 
“Billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City – and making wisecracks about his 
just-ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl. ‘I am not a sexual predator, I’m an 
offender,’ the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a 
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 3 of 14

person who steals a bagel,’ said Epstein.”  Amber Sutherland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein:  I’m a 
Sex Offender Not a Predator, N.Y. Post (Feb. 25, 2011), 
https://nypost.com/2011/02/25/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-im-a-sex-offender-not-a-predator/. 
10. 
In August 2018, just one year before his death, Epstein told a New York Times reporter 
“that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it 
was perfectly acceptable.”  James B. Stewart, The Day Jeffrey Epstein Told Me He Had Dirt on 
Powerful People, N.Y. Times (Aug. 12, 2019), 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html. 
11. 
When Plaintiff was a young woman, Epstein added her to his long list of victims by 
committing sexual assault and battery against her.  As such, Epstein is responsible for battery 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to New York common law.  The damage 
to Plaintiff has been severe and lasting. 
12. 
This action has been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of a criminal action against the 
same defendant to commence an action with respect to the event or occurrence from which the 
criminal action arose.  A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking 
enterprise from which Plaintiff’s claims arise was terminated on August 29, 2019. 
13. 
This action has also been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-C, which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have 20 years to file civil claims “for physical, psychological or other injury 
or condition suffered by such person as a result of conduct which would constitute” certain sex 
crimes under New York Penal Law Article 130.  Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sexually 
assaulted Plaintiff by forcible compulsion within 20 years of filing this Complaint, and that 
sexual assault constitutes one or more sex crimes described in N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-C. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 4 of 14

14. 
Any statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiff’s claims, if any, is tolled due to the 
continuous and active deception, duress, threats of retaliation, and other forms of misconduct that 
Epstein and his co-conspirators used to silence his many victims, including Plaintiff.  Epstein’s 
actions deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity to commence this lawsuit before his death.  Until his 
death, Plaintiff feared that Epstein and his co-conspirators would harm her or her family, or ruin 
her life, if she came forward. 
15. 
Defendants are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense.  
Allowing Defendants to do so would be unjust.  Epstein and his co-conspirators intimidated each 
of his victims into silence by threatening their lives and their livelihoods.  They therefore 
prevented Plaintiff from commencing this lawsuit before his death.  By using threats, along with 
his wealth and power, Epstein was able to escape punishment for his intolerable and brutal 
crimes against countless young women and underage girls for the duration of his life. 
PARTIES 
16. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 is a citizen and resident of New Jersey. 
17. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
18. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
19. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin Islands at 
the time of his death.  Jeffrey Epstein maintained a residence in the Southern District of New 
York.  As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Darren K. Indyke and 
Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 5 of 14

20. 
The amount in controversy in this action exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.00 
excluding interests and costs and is between citizens of different states. Accordingly, jurisdiction 
is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  
21. 
Venue is proper in this Court as Epstein’s sexual abuse of Plaintiff began and occurred in 
New York, New York, where he recruited her, physically molested her, and began grooming her 
for sex in his organized sex trafficking ring. 
22. 
Many of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the Southern District 
of New York, where a substantial amount of Epstein’s property is located. Thus, venue in this 
district is proper. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. 
Epstein’s Sex Trafficking Enterprise 
23. 
 Jeffrey Epstein was widely renowned as a billionaire who used his vast connections to 
powerful individuals, and seemingly unlimited wealth and resources, to create a web of 
transcontinental sex trafficking that served himself, his coconspirators, and some of the most 
powerful people in the world. 
24. 
Epstein owned multiple residences and frequently travelled between them, including at 9 
East 71st Street, New York, New York 10021, where the illegal sexual crimes against Plaintiff 
occurred.  Epstein conservatively valued his New York townhome at $55,931,000.00.  Epstein 
conservatively valued his ranch at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New Mexico 87056, at 
$17,246,208.00.  In addition, Epstein owned residences in the Virgin Islands, Florida, France, 
and even on his own island, Great St. James Island, where his transcontinental sex trafficking of 
hundreds of young girls servicing him, his co-conspirators, and wealthy and powerful individuals 
around the world occurred. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 6 of 14

25. 
The allegations herein concern Epstein’s tortious acts against Plaintiff while in New 
York, where Epstein was staying at his mansion. 
26. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein utilized his seemingly 
unlimited power, wealth, and resources, as well as his deep connections to powerful and 
politically connected individuals to intimidate and manipulate his victims of sexual abuse.  
27. 
Epstein and his co-conspirators had perfected a scheme for manipulation and abuse of 
young females.  As part of the scheme, a female “recruiter” would approach a young female and 
strike up a conversation in an effort to quickly learn about the young female’s background and 
any vulnerabilities they could expose.  The recruiter would then manipulate the young female 
into coming back to one of Epstein’s residences by offering the young female something she 
needed.  At times the recruiter’s lure would be a modeling opportunity, money for education, 
help for the young female’s family, and a whole host of other related offers depending on their 
target’s situation.  Once in the residence, the recruiter and Epstein would work in concert to 
impress and intimidate the young female with displays of vast wealth, including having 
employees that were butlers and maids formally dressed around the house.  They would also 
strategically place photographs of very powerful political and social figures amongst 
photographs and art displaying nude females in an effort to normalize the sexual abuse.  They 
would also normalize the sexual abuse by placing a massage table and spa related products 
around the massage area in an effort to legitimize the area where the abuse was set to occur.  
Once abused, Epstein and his co-conspirators continued to manipulate the victims, using their 
financial power, promises, and threats to ensure that the victim returned as directed and remained 
compliant with their demands.

B. 
The Arrest, Prosecution, and Death of Epstein 
28. 
The sexual trafficking ring described herein started at least as early as 1995 and 
continued up until at least July 2, 2019, when the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of New York (“SDNY”) charged Epstein with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. He was arrested on July 8, 2019, pursuant to the SDNY’s Sealed 
Two Count Indictment, which is attached as Exhibit A. 
29. 
The Indictment described Epstein’s conduct and his abuse and trafficking of females in 
the same trafficking operation he used to abuse and traffic Plaintiff. 
30. 
Epstein’s last will and testament (the “Will”) was executed on August 8, 2019, at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. The witnesses were Mariel Colón Miró and Gulnora Tali.  The 
Will included affidavits from Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in which they swear an 
“Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and Appointment of Local Counsel.” 
31. 
Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 
2019.  
32. 
Epstein’s last will and testament was filed on August 15, 2019, in the Probate Division of 
the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
33. 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court 
of the Virgin Islands for Epstein’s 1953 Trust on August 26, 2019.  See Certificate of Trust, In 
the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Aug. 26, 
2019). 
34. 
Epstein’s will was entered into probate on September 6, 2019, and the Superior Court of 
the Virgin Islands accordingly authorized Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn to administer 
Epstein’s estate.  See Order for Probate, In the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate 
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 8 of 14

No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019); Letters Testamentary, In the Matter of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019). 
35. 
The Will’s first article directs Epstein’s executors “to pay from my estate all expenses of 
my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my estate and all 
of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate.”  The Will further directs that “after the 
payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST,” Epstein “give[s] all of my property, real 
and personal, wherever situated…to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust.” 
36. 
Following Epstein’s death, SDNY submitted a proposed nolle prosequi order in the 
criminal matter against him because it was required by law to do so after Epstein was deceased.  
On August 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman formally dismissed SDNY’s 
indictment against Epstein, terminating the criminal action against him.  Plaintiff’s claims are 
therefore timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
C. 
Jane Doe 1000 
37. 
Jane Doe 1000 grew up in extreme poverty.  At various times throughout her childhood, 
her mother had been homeless.  Jane Doe was unable to enroll in high school because she did not 
have a residence and often lived without running water or electricity. 
38. 
In late 1999, Jane Doe made a modeling appearance.  A man called her and told her that 
Jeffrey Epstein had connections to various modeling jobs and asked her if she would like to meet 
with Epstein to discuss opportunities.  The opportunity sounded enticing to Jane Doe, so she 
agreed and met Epstein at his New York City mansion on 71st Street.   
39. 
Upon meeting Jane Doe, Epstein offered her a position modeling with Victoria’s Secret, a 
lingerie retailer.  He explained that he was friends with Les Wexner, the chief executive of 
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 9 of 14

Victoria’s Secret’s parent company.  Epstein reiterated his connection to Victoria’s Secret each 
time he saw and spoke with Jane Doe. 
40. 
Eventually, Epstein moved Jane Doe into his apartment building on 66th Street, where he 
housed other models and young women that he sexually abused, so that he could have complete 
control over her life.  Her relationship with Epstein quickly turned into one of sexual abuse.  
Ghislaine Maxwell, one of Epstein’s main “recruiters,” along with additional unidentified 
co-conspirators, would call Jane Doe and direct her to go to Epstein’s mansion to give him a 
massage.  The massages quickly escalated into Epstein forcing himself on Jane Doe against her 
will and engaging in one or more sex act with her for his own sexual gratification.  Jane Doe was 
terrified of Epstein, who repeatedly threatened her and made representations about his wealth, 
power, and connections. 
41. 
During Jane Doe’s time with Epstein, he forced her to give him sexual massages and 
made her use sex toys.  
42. 
Epstein also flew Jane Doe to his residence in Palm Beach, Florida, where she was also 
forced to give Epstein sexual massages.   
43. 
On one occasion, Epstein forced Jane Doe to meet with a lawyer, even though she did not 
express any need for a lawyer to Epstein.  The lawyer she met with was a prominent attorney and 
a law professor who was described to Jane Doe as Epstein’s close friend and lawyer.   The 
lawyer appeared to be interviewing her, asking personal questions about her family’s financial 
situation.  The meeting had no legal purpose, and Epstein later used the information that the 
lawyer had obtained through his meeting with Jane Doe to intimidate her and to keep her 
compliant in his sex-trafficking scheme. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 10 of 14

44. 
Epstein made very clear to Jane Doe that he was incredibly wealthy, powerful and 
regularly in contact with world leaders.  In fact, in his New York mansion he had photographs 
displayed of significant political figures to ensure that any young female entering the home 
would know that he had extensive government connections.  Epstein was not to be disobeyed and 
he made clear by his words and actions that there would be consequences if Jane Doe did not 
comply with his demands.   
45. 
Epstein constantly promised Jane Doe modeling opportunities with Victoria’s Secret each 
time she saw him.  He continued to make that promise for years, up until the last time Jane Doe 
saw Epstein. 
46. 
One day, Epstein had someone call Jane Doe to his mansion.  When Jane Doe arrived, 
Maxwell was waiting for her and led her upstairs to Epstein’s master bedroom.  When they got to 
the bedroom, sex toys were laid out on the bed.  Epstein and Maxwell proceeded to sexually 
assault Jane Doe simultaneously and by forcible compulsion.  Maxwell forcibly penetrated Jane 
Doe with a sex toy.  She was horrified and terrified by the experience and knew she had to try to 
get away from Epstein even though she risked harm to herself by disobeying Epstein.  She 
proceeded to move out of the 66th Street apartment building and, having nowhere else to go, 
found shelter at the Salvation Army housing facility. 
47. 
Jane Doe was deeply affected by her harrowing experiences at the hands of Epstein.  She 
suffers extreme emotional distress from an experience that has affected her for her entire life.   
48. 
Epstein’s sexual assault and battery of Jane Doe continues to cause her significant 
distress and harm. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 11 of 14

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Battery) 
49. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1–48 as if fully 
set forth herein.  
50. 
Epstein intentionally committed battery by sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was a 
young woman.  As described above, on multiple occasions, Epstein intentionally sexually 
assaulted and touched Plaintiff in an offensive and sexual manner without her consent. 
51. 
Epstein’s actions constitute sexual offenses as defined in New York Penal Law Article 
130, including but not limited to Article 130.35, inasmuch as Epstein and Maxwell sexually 
assaulted Plaintiff by forcible compulsion within 20 years of filing this Complaint.  See N.Y. 
C.P.L.R. § 213-C. 
52. 
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from 
which Plaintiff’s first cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
53. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in 
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, 
loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION  
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress)  
54. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1–48 as if fully 
set forth herein.  
55. 
As a direct result of these allegations as stated, Epstein committed intentional infliction of 
emotional distress against Plaintiff.  
Case 1:19-cv-10577   Document 1   Filed 11/14/19   Page 12 of 14

56.
Epstein’s actions, described above, constitute extreme and outrageous conduct that
shocks the conscience.  Epstein’s plan to recruit, entice, and assault Plaintiff on multiple 
occasions goes beyond all possible bounds of decency and is intolerable in a civilized 
community. 
57.
Epstein knew or disregarded the substantial likelihood that these actions would cause
Plaintiff severe emotional distress. 
58.
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from
which Plaintiff’s second cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
59.
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, 
loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests judgment against Defendants, awarding 
compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at 
trial; costs of suit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just 
and proper. 
JURY DEMAND 
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted within this 
pleading.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
- v. -
X 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
X 
COUNT ONE 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and · 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
.in cash. 
Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. 
In 

Case 1:19-cv-10577 Document 1-1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 3 of 15 
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. 
EP~TEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Pa.lm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 

Case 1:19-cv-10577 Document 1-1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 4 of 15 
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude , would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. 
EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. 
In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. 
Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005 , EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 

Case 1:19-cv-10577 Document 1-1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 5 of 15 
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." 
During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims ' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. 
Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, mariy were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasioni at the New York Residence. 
EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. 
In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 

Case 1:19-cv-10577 Document 1-1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 6 of 15 
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. 
Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. 
When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. 
Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of addi tional minor girls. 
13. 
In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to t he New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. 
EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additionil 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. 
When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. 
In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 

Case 1:19-cv-10577 Document 1-1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 7 of 15 
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruite~s to bring a specific minor girl fo~ EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. 
In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. 
EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were ·available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida . 
15. 
At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN , the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and ' 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. 
Once 
inside , the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals . 
EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 

Case 1:19-cv-10577 Document 1-1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 8 of 15 
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. 
Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. 
In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN'S travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled ~or when he arrived. 
In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. 
At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. 
Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 

Case 1:19-cv-10577 Document 1-1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 9 of 15 
19. 
Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. 
EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S 
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 7     Filed 11/20/19     Page 1 of 9

Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000, by her undersigned attorneys, respectfully submits this 
memorandum of law in support of her motion for leave to proceed anonymously. 
INTRODUCTION 
This lawsuit arises out of Jeffrey Epstein’s years-long sexual abuse of Plaintiff.  Because 
of Jeffrey Epstein’s death on August 10, 2019, Plaintiff’s civil lawsuit against Defendants for 
battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress is the only avenue for obtaining some form 
of justice.  But releasing her name to the public will expose some of her darkest moments and tie 
those moments to her name in perpetuity.  Using her real name in this litigation, therefore, would 
cause her significant harm and distress, and would inhibit her ability to heal.  For these and similar 
reasons, other courts have allowed Epstein’s victims to proceed anonymously in numerous cases.  
See, e.g., Doe 17 v. Indyke et al., No. 19 Civ. 9610 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, 2019), Dkt. 25; Katlyn Doe 
v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., No. 19 Civ. 7771 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2019), Dkt. 28; Jane Doe 43 
v. Epstein et al., No. 17 Civ. 616 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2017), Dkt. 28; Jane Doe No. 103 v. Epstein, 
No. 10 Civ. 80309 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 9, 2010), Dkt. 5; Doe v.  Epstein, No. 08 Civ. 80119 (S.D. Fla. 
Aug. 7, 2009), Dkt. 253; Doe v. Epstein, No. 08 Civ. 80893 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 6, 2008), Dkt. 15 at 2–
3. 
Epstein’s sex-trafficking enterprise has become highly publicized.  The egregiousness of 
his crimes and his escape from proportionate punishment—Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution 
Agreement with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida in 2008 and died in prison 
after the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York indicted him for federal 
sex-trafficking crimes in July 2019—has made his case one of public fascination.  The names of 
the victims who have come forward against Epstein thus far have been widely publicized and 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 7     Filed 11/20/19     Page 2 of 9

discussed by the media.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 should therefore be permitted to file this lawsuit 
anonymously. 
ARGUMENT 
Although Rule 10(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[t]he title of 
[a] complaint must name all the parties,” the Second Circuit has recognized that the use of a 
pseudonym is appropriate in certain circumstances.  See Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 
F.3d 185, 188–89 (2d Cir. 2008).  In determining whether to grant a motion for leave to proceed 
anonymously, “the plaintiff’s interest in anonymity must be balanced against both the public 
interest in disclosure and any prejudice to the defendant.”  Id. at 189.  The Second Circuit has 
“note[d] with approval” the following list of ten non-exhaustive factors:  
(1) whether the litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive 
and of a personal nature; (2) whether identification poses a risk of 
retaliatory physical or mental harm to the party seeking to proceed 
anonymously or even more critically, to innocent non-parties; 
(3) whether identification presents other harms and the likely 
severity of those harms, including whether the injury litigated 
against would be incurred as a result of the disclosure of the 
plaintiff’s identity; (4) whether the plaintiff is particularly 
vulnerable to the possible harms of disclosure, particularly in light 
of his age; (5) whether the suit is challenging the actions of the 
government or that of private parties; (6) whether the defendant is 
prejudiced by allowing the plaintiff to press his claims 
anonymously, whether the nature of that prejudice (if any) differs at 
any particular stage of the litigation, and whether any prejudice can 
be mitigated by the district court; (7) whether the plaintiff’s identity 
has thus far been kept confidential; (8) whether the public’s interest 
in the litigation is furthered by requiring the plaintiff to disclose his 
identity; (9) whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in 
knowing the litigants’ identities; and (10) whether there are any 
alternative mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of the 
plaintiff. 
Id. at 189–90 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Courts are “not required to list each 
of the factors or use any particular formulation as long as it is clear that the court balanced the 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 7     Filed 11/20/19     Page 3 of 9

interests at stake in reaching its conclusion.”  Id. at 191 n.4.  Taking those factors into account, 
Plaintiff’s interest in anonymity substantially outweighs both the public interest in disclosure and 
potential prejudice to Defendants, if any, and she should be allowed to proceed as Jane Doe 1000 
in this case. 
I. 
Plaintiff’s Interest in Anonymity Favors Allowing Her to Proceed as Jane 
Doe 1000. 
The first three factors of the Second Circuit’s test weigh heavily in favor of Plaintiff 
proceeding as Jane Doe 1000.  The first is “whether the litigation involves matters that are highly 
sensitive and of a personal nature.”  Id. at 190 (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[S]exual assault 
victims are a paradigmatic example of those entitled to a grant of anonymity.”  Doe No. 2 v. Kolko, 
242 F.R.D. 193, 195 (E.D.N.Y. 2006).  The allegations of sexual assault in Plaintiff’s Complaint 
could not be more sensitive.  She alleges that Jeffrey Epstein sexually trafficked, abused, and 
exploited her for years in a humiliating and degrading manner.  Epstein forced Plaintiff to give 
him sexual massages in which he ended up forcing her to engage in various sex acts with him.  
Compl. ¶¶ 40–42, 46.  He also forced her to let him use sex toys on her, and he forced her to engage 
in sex acts with Ghislaine Maxwell.  Compl. ¶¶ 42, 46.  Those were some of the most sensitive, 
degrading, and painful moments of Plaintiff’s life, warranting anonymity in this case. 
The second factor, “whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or mental 
harm to the party seeking to proceed anonymously,” Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190, also weighs 
in favor of Plaintiff proceeding anonymously.  The deceased Epstein is not the only person that 
Plaintiff’s Complaint accuses of wrongdoing.  She also alleges, in graphic detail, that Ghislaine 
Maxwell sexually assaulted her.  Compl. ¶ 46.  Maxwell is still alive and at large, and has been 
known to threaten both the lives and livelihoods of her victims.  See, e.g., Mike Baker, The Sisters 
Who First Tried to Take Down Jeffrey Epstein, N.Y. Times (Aug. 26, 2019), 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 7     Filed 11/20/19     Page 4 of 9

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/us/epstein-farmer-sisters-maxwell.html 
(recounting 
an 
incident in which Maxwell threatened to ruin a victim’s career and suggested that she could have 
the victim killed).  Plaintiff is rightfully afraid of Maxwell and how she might retaliate against 
Plaintiff for the allegations against Maxwell in the Complaint.  The second factor therefore weighs 
in favor of allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously.  
The third factor, “whether identification presents other harms and the likely severity of 
those harms, including whether the injury litigated against would be incurred as a result of the 
disclosure of the plaintiff’s identity,” Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190 (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted), also weighs in favor of anonymity.  Exposing Plaintiff’s identity would cause 
her precisely the injuries for which she is seeking redress in this case:  extreme emotional distress, 
humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her 
privacy.   See Compl. ¶¶ 53, 59.  Further, unlike most sexual assault cases, Epstein’s crimes and 
victims have been the subject of an extraordinary amount of media attention, and many of his 
victims have been heavily scrutinized by the public.  There is no reason to believe that Plaintiff 
would be subject to any less scrutiny than the women who have already spoken out against Epstein 
if she were to proceed under her real name.  Such scrutiny would have both personal and 
professional consequences for Plaintiff.  Her relationships would suffer.  And as for her career, 
Plaintiff has significant concern that the public scrutiny could cause her professional harm.   
II. 
Defendants Will Not Suffer Any Prejudice if Plaintiff Proceeds as Jane Doe 
1000. 
The sixth factor of the Second Circuit’s test for deciding whether to grant a motion for 
leave to appear anonymously is “whether the defendant is prejudiced by allowing the plaintiff to 
press his claims anonymously, whether the nature of that prejudice (if any) differs at any particular 
stage of the litigation, and whether any prejudice can be mitigated by the district court.”  Sealed 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 7     Filed 11/20/19     Page 5 of 9

Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.  “In determining whether a defendant will be prejudiced, courts look at 
the damage to a defendant’s reputation caused by the anonymous proceedings, difficulties in 
conducting discovery, and the fundamental fairness of proceeding in this manner.”  Doe v. Solera 
Capital LLC, No. 18 Civ. 1769, 2019 WL 1437520, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2019). 
This matter will have little to no effect on Epstein’s reputation.  Epstein’s crimes have been 
widely publicized, as has his modus operandi of recruiting and sexually abusing young, vulnerable 
women by offering to pay them for massages turned into unwelcome sexual encounters.  Epstein 
was investigated for molesting more than 30 underage girls in Florida.  And shortly before his 
death, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York charged Epstein with sex 
trafficking and accused him of enticing, recruiting, and molesting girls as young as 14 years old.  
Even during his life, Epstein himself boasted about his predilection for young girls.  See James B. 
Stewart, The Day Jeffrey Epstein Told Me He Had Dirt on Powerful People, N.Y. Times (Aug. 
12, 
2019), 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html 
(describing an interview in which Epstein said that “that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was 
a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable”).  This lawsuit will 
not cause any damage to Epstein’s reputation that has not already been done.  
With respect to difficulties in conducting discovery to investigate Plaintiff’s claims, 
Plaintiff would be willing to cooperate with Defendants to ensure that they could effectively 
conduct discovery and defend against Plaintiff’s claims.  There would therefore be little to no 
prejudice to Defendants if Plaintiff were to remain anonymous. 
Plaintiff has also remained anonymous since Epstein abused her, which favors anonymity 
under the Second Circuit’s seventh factor:  “whether the plaintiff’s identity has thus far been kept 
confidential.”  See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.  Until now, she has never spoken out against 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 7     Filed 11/20/19     Page 6 of 9

Epstein.  Nor are the details in Plaintiff’s Complaint unique enough to make her identity discernible 
to the public or Epstein’s cohorts; unfortunately, countless victims have stories that are extremely 
similar to hers.  This is therefore not a case in which a plaintiff attempts to gain an advantage by 
making accusations to the media, but then shields her name in court.  Compare Solera Capital, 
2019 WL 1437520, at *7 (finding that “the fact that Doe’s anonymity to the public has been 
preserved to date” weighed in favor of proceeding anonymously), with Doe v. Shakur, 164 F.R.D. 
359, 362 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (denying motion for leave to proceed anonymously where the plaintiff 
was accusing a high profile person of sexual assault and “the press [had] known [the plaintiff’s] 
name for some time”). 
III. 
The Public Has Little to No Interest in Disclosure of Plaintiff’s Name. 
The eighth and ninth factors of the Second Circuit’s test for deciding whether to grant a 
motion for leave to appear anonymously ask the court to weigh the public’s interest in disclosure 
of the plaintiff’s identity.  See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.  Those factors weigh in favor of 
allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously here.  Epstein had many victims, and the total number 
is still unknown.  Although the public has an interest in Epstein’s life and crimes generally, the 
identity of Plaintiff is of no particular importance to the public.  Plaintiff is not a public figure, and 
she had never spoken out against Epstein or his co-conspirators before filing this lawsuit.  The 
public’s interest in this case is therefore not in the Plaintiff’s identity, but rather in the crimes 
Epstein committed against Plaintiff and countless other victims. 
In fact, the public interest would be better served by protecting Plaintiff’s identity.  “[T]he 
public generally has a strong interest in protecting the identities of sexual assault victims so that 
other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”  Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195; see also 
N.Y. Civil Rights Law § 50-b (McKinney 2019) (shielding sex-abuse victims from identification 
in, among other things, any “police report, court file, or other document”).  Coming forward with 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 7     Filed 11/20/19     Page 7 of 9

allegations of sexual assault is already extremely difficult for many survivors.  See Cameron 
Kimble, Sexual Assault Remains Dramatically Underreported, Brennan Center for Justice (Oct. 4, 
2018), 
https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/sexual-assault-remains-
dramatically-underreported (“Sexual assault survivors struggle with a wide range of emotions that 
make coming forward difficult: fear of revictimization, distortion of allegations, and generally not 
being believed.”).  Keeping Plaintiff’s name from the public will ensure that media scrutiny of her 
story will not deter other Epstein victims from sharing their own experiences. 
IV. 
There Are No Adequate Alternatives for Protecting Plaintiff’s 
Confidentiality. 
The final factor is whether there are alternative mechanisms for protecting the plaintiff’s 
identity.  Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.  In this case, anything less than full protection of 
Plaintiff’s identity would exacerbate the harms that Plaintiff has already suffered due to the 
conduct described in the Complaint.  There is no adequate alternative mechanism for protecting 
her confidentiality.  Plaintiff should therefore be granted leave to proceed anonymously in this 
case. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her motion to 
proceed anonymously.

WAIVER OF THE SERVICE OF SUMMONS 
To: 
David Boies 
( ame of the plaintiff's attorney or unrepresented plaintifj) 
I have received your request to waive service of a summons in this action along with a copy of the complaint, 
two copies of this waiver form, and a prepaid means of returning one signed copy of the form to you. 
I, or the entity I represent, agree to save the expense of serving a summons and complaint in this case. 
I understand that I, or the entity I represent, will keep all defenses or objections to the lawsuit, the court's 
jurisdiction, and the venue of the action, but that I waive any objections to the absence of a summons or of service. 
I also understand that I, or the entity I represent, must file and serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 within 
days from 
f I / 7-~/ 1 q 
, the date when this request was sent ( or 90 days if it was sent outside the 
United States). If I fail to do so, a defau lt judgment will be entered against me or the entity I represent.

Duty to Avoid Unnecessary Expenses of Serving a Summons 
Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain defendants to cooperate in saving unnecessary expenses of serving a summons 
and complaint. A defendant who is located in the United States and who fails to return a signed waiver of service requested by a plaintiff located in 
the United States will be required to pay the expenses of service, unless the defendant shows good cause for the fa ilure. 
"Good cause" does not include a belief that the lawsuit is groundless, or that it has been brought in an improper venue, or that the cou11 has 
no jurisdiction over th is matter or over the defendant or the defendant's property. 
If the waiver is signed and returned, you can sti ll make these and all other defenses and objections, but you cannot object to the absence of 
a summons or of service. 
If you waive service, then you must, within the time specified on the waiver form, serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 on the plaintiff 
and file a copy with the court. By signing and returning the waiver form, you are allowed more time to respond than if a summons had been served.

Jane Doe 1000 v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn in their capacities as the 
executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Case No. 19-cv-10577-LGS
Dear Judge Schofield: 
We represent Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein (together, “Defendants”) in the referenced action.  Defendants respectfully request that 
the Court refer this action to Magistrate Judge Debra C. Freeman for General Pretrial (including 
scheduling, discovery, non-dispositive pretrial motions, and settlement).  Plaintiff consents to 
this request. 
As a matter of context, several other Judges in this District have collectively referred to 
Magistrate Freeman for General Pretrial numerous actions against Defendants in their 
capacities as Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, including two actions in which 
the parties are represented by the respective counsel of record in this action.1  Magistrate 
Freeman held a status conference on November 21, 2019, which counsel of record for the 
parties to this action attended.  Magistrate Freeman requested the parties in the matters 
referred to Her Honor to submit status reports on January 10, 2020.   
1See Teresa Helm v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Case No. 19-cv-10476-PGG-DCF, Order of Reference (ECF Doc. 6)

The parties are aware that this Court had planned for the parties to submit Joint Letters and

for referral to Magistrate Judge Freeman, the parties request the Court’s guidance on whether 
these documents should be submitted.

Re: 
Jane Doe 1000 v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn in their capacities as the 
executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Case No. 19-cv-10577-LGS
Dear Judge Schofield: 
We represent Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein (together, “Defendants”) in the referenced action.  Defendants respectfully request that 
the Court refer this action to Magistrate Judge Debra C. Freeman for General Pretrial (including 
scheduling, discovery, non-dispositive pretrial motions, and settlement).  Plaintiff consents to 
this request. 
As a matter of context, several other Judges in this District have collectively referred to 
Magistrate Freeman for General Pretrial numerous actions against Defendants in their 
capacities as Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, including two actions in which 
the parties are represented by the respective counsel of record in this action.1  Magistrate 
Freeman held a status conference on November 21, 2019, which counsel of record for the 
parties to this action attended.  Magistrate Freeman requested the parties in the matters 
referred to Her Honor to submit status reports on January 10, 2020.   
1See Teresa Helm v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Case No. 19-cv-10476-PGG-DCF, Order of Reference (ECF Doc. 6) 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2019); Juliette Bryant v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as 
the executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Case No. 19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF, Order of 
Reference (ECF Doc. 8) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 26, 2019).

Application GRANTED.
A referral order will issue separately.  The initial 
pretrial conference, scheduled for January 9, 2020, 
is canceled.

these documents should be submitted.

Dear Judge Freeman:  
Pursuant to the Court’s request at the November 21, 2019, Case Management Conference, 
Plaintiffs and Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein, jointly submit this letter to provide the Court with an update as to the progress 
of discussions regarding both discovery and settlement. 
The parties have thus far engaged in two productive conferences pursuant to Rule 26(f) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  During those conferences, the parties agreed to exchange 
initial disclosures by January 23, 2020, and to exchange discovery plans one week thereafter, on 
January 30, 2020.   
As the Court is aware, Defendants have arranged for a Victims’ Compensation Program 
that will be available to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has conferred with the Program’s designers 
and administrators, the Program’s administrators provided Plaintiffs with a proposed protocol for 
the Program, and Plaintiffs have provided some feedback to the administrators.  The motion for 
the Superior Court of the United States Virgin Islands to approve the establishment of the Program 
will be heard on February 4, 2020.  
The parties request a conference with the Court on February 6 or 7, 2020, to resolve any 
potential disagreements as to how these matters should proceed.  The parties will provide the Court 
with their proposed discovery plan(s) 48 hours before any such conference.

DEBRA FREEMAN, United States Magistrate Judge: 
The above-referenced cases - all brought by plaintiffs claiming that they were sexually 
abused by Jeffrey Epstein and seeking damages from his estate - have been neither consolidated 
for any purpose, nor designated as "related" by the Court. Nonetheless, these cases (together 
with certain other, similar cases, not listed above) have been referred to the undersigned for 
general pretrial supervision, so that discovery - and potentially settlement - may be coordinated 
as reasonable. While, at the parties' request, discovery in the other Jeffrey Epstein cases referred 
to this Court has been stayed pending a further report on the parties' settlement efforts, the 
parties to each of the above-referenced cases have requested, by submissions dated January 10, 
2020, that this Court set a discovery schedule. This Court's having reviewed the parties' 
submissions, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
1. 
In each of the above-referenced cases in which the parties have not yet submitted 
a jointly proposed discovery plan pursuant to Rule 26( t) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
the parties are directed to submit a proposed discovery schedule for this Court's review no later 

Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 21     Filed 01/14/20     Page 2 of 2
than February 6, 2020. This submission should address all of the matters set out in Rule 26(t)(3), 
and should specifically include proposed deadlines for: 
a. 
service of initial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(l); 
b. 
service of initial document requests and interrogatories; 
c. 
any motion for joinder of other parties or amendment of the pleadings; 
d. 
completion of fact discovery; and 
e. 
expert disclosures and the completion of expert discovery, if any. 
. 
. 
2. 
As to each of the above-referenced cases, this Court will hold a pretrial 
conference pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on February 11, 2020, at 
10:00 a.m., in Courtroom 17 A at the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY 
10007. The parties should be aware, however, that the mere fact that this Court will be holding a 
single, joint case-management conference does not necessarily mean that this Court will set an 
identical discovery schedule in each case. At the conference, counsel should be prepared to 
address whether there are reasons why these cases should be treated differently for scheduling 
purposes.

Re: 
Jane Doe 1000 v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the 
executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein, 19-cv-10577-LGS-DCF
Dear Judge Schofield: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the referenced action.  We write pursuant to 
Your Honor’s Individual Rule III(C)(2) to request a conference on and to explain the bases for 
the Co-Executors’ anticipated motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss Plaintiff 
Jane Doe 1000’s (“Plaintiff”) Complaint (ECF No. 1).  We propose this briefing schedule: moving 
brief by February 24, 2020; opposition brief by March 25, 2020; and reply brief by April 8, 2020. 
1. Plaintiff is a New Jersey resident who alleges Decedent committed torts against 
her in or around 1999 in New York and Florida; Plaintiff’s causes of action expired 
nearly two decades ago. 
Plaintiff, a New Jersey citizen and resident, alleges that, in or about 1999, Mr. Epstein 
(“Decedent”), now deceased, committed sexual offenses against her in New York and Florida 
(Compl. ¶¶ 16, 38, 50, 55.)  Plaintiff asserts two causes of action -- battery and intentional 
infliction of emotional distress -- and demands punitive damages. (Id. ¶¶ 49-59, p. 13.) 
Plaintiff does not allege she was a minor when Decedent sexually abused her in or around 
1999.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred.  
New York’s borrowing statute, CPLR § 202, provides that, when a non-N.Y. resident such as 
Plaintiff sues on causes of action accruing outside N.Y., the complaint must be timely under the 
statute of limitations (“SOL”) of both N.Y. and the jurisdiction where the claim accrued.1
Plaintiff’s causes of action expired by in or about: 2003 per FL’s 4-year SOL (Fla. Stat. § 95.11 
(3)(O)); and 2000 or 2002 per N.Y.’s 1- or 3-year SOL (CPLR §§ 214(5), 215(3)).  
“In diversity cases in New York, federal courts apply … C.P.L.R. § 202.” Commerzbank AG v. Deutsche 
Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., 234 F. Supp. 3d 462, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (citation omitted).

Hon. Lorna G. Schofield

2. Plaintiff’s attempts to plead around the statutes of limitations fail. 
Plaintiff erroneously alleges her claims are timely per CPLR § 213-c or § 215(8)(a), her claims 
were equitably tolled, and that the Co-Executors are equitably estopped from asserting an SOL 
defense. (Compl. ¶¶ 12-15.) Each of these arguments fails as a matter of law.   
First, neither CPLR § 213-c nor § 215(8)(a) applies here. The 20 year SOL in CPLR § 213-c 
became effective as of September 18, 2019; the SOL was 5 years as of 2006 and 1 year before 
then. (L. 2006, ch 3, § 5(b).) However, the 20-year SOL does not apply retroactively except 
“where the applicable [SOL] in effect on the date of such act or omission has not yet expired.” L. 
2019, ch. 315, §4. Therefore, CPLR § 213-c cannot revive Plaintiff’s long-expired claims.  
Separately, CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides: “Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the 
same defendant has been commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from which a 
claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff shall have at least one year from the 
termination of the criminal action …  to commence the civil action” (emphasis added). 
Decedent’s criminal indictment (the “Indictment”) attached to Plaintiff’s Complaint does not 
concern Plaintiff’s allegations. Rather, the Indictment charges Decedent sexually abused “minor 
girls” from 2002 to 2005 (Compl., Ex. A at ¶¶ 1, 20), stating throughout that it concerns sex 
trafficking of “minors.” (Id. ¶¶ 2 - 4, 6, 8, 11- 15, 18 - 20, 22.)  
Plaintiff does not allege she was a minor.  Further, she alleges the torts against her occurred in 
the 1990’s. Therefore, this action and the Indictment arise from entirely different occurrences. 
New York courts apply CPLR § 215(8)(a) narrowly. See Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 AD2d 
595, 596 (2d Dept. 1999) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied only to claims based on events of February 
26, 1993 and December 28, 1993, because it was only in connection with events of those two 
days that criminal prosecution was commenced against defendant); Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 
52980/2017, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435 (Sup. Ct. Dutchess Cnty. Oct. 23, 2018) (CPLR § 
215(8)(a) inapplicable where incidents charged in criminal action and those alleged in civil 
action occurred on different dates); McElligott v. City of N.Y., 15-cv-7107 (LGS), 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 201829, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2017) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) inapplicable to claims against 
civil defendants not charged as co-defendants in criminal action, notwithstanding same events 
gave rise to both actions).  Plaintiff alleges a far more tenuous connection to the Indictment than 
the criminal-civil links unsuccessfully asserted in those cases.   
Second, even if CPLR § 213-c and § 215(8)(a) apply, which they do not, Plaintiff’s claims for 
torts committed outside N.Y. are still untimely per FL’s SOL and CPLR § 202.   
Third, Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify 
tolling or equitable estoppel. Equitable tolling is only applied where a plaintiff is “prevented in 
some extraordinary way from exercising h[er] rights.” Viti v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 10-cv-
2908 (ALC) (MHD), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189633, at *30 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2012), adopted by, 
2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174145 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2013) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).   
Under this doctrine, a court may, “under compelling circumstances, make narrow exceptions to 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 24     Filed 01/24/20     Page 2 of 3

the statute of limitations … ‘to prevent inequity.’” Id. (emphasis added) (citations omitted).  “That 
the doctrine is to be employed only sparingly -- in ‘extraordinary’ and ‘compelling’ circumstances 
-- is reflected in the fact that the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to show that tolling is 
justified.” Id. (emphasis added) (citing Boos v. Runyon, 201 F.3d 178, 185 (2d Cir. 2000)).  A 
late-filing party seeking equitable tolling must also demonstrate she acted with “reasonable 
diligence” in pursuing her claims during the period she seeks to toll.  Id. at *32 (citation omitted). 
Equitable estoppel only applies where a plaintiff knows her cause of action exists but the 
defendant’s conduct causes her to delay in bringing her lawsuit. Yesh, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
101744, at *5 (citation omitted). Equitable estoppel requires a plaintiff to show: (i) the defendant 
made a definite misrepresentation of fact and had reason to believe the plaintiff would rely on it; 
and (ii) the plaintiff reasonably relied on the misrepresentation to her detriment. Id. (citation 
omitted).  Tolling is inappropriate where, as here, a plaintiff fails to articulate any acts by a 
defendant that prevented the plaintiff from timely commencing suit. Id. at *6 (citation omitted).   
Plaintiff’s threadbare allegations of “deception,” “threats” and the like (Compl. ¶14) do not 
establish “extraordinary” circumstances justifying tolling.  Nor has Plaintiff alleged (i) that 
Decedent made a misrepresentation to her and had reason to believe she would rely on it, or (ii) 
that Plaintiff reasonably relied on it to her detriment.   
3. Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law.2
Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim must be dismissed as a matter of law because neither Florida 
law nor New York law permits punitive damages against a decedent tortfeasor’s estate. See
Poindexter v. Zacharzewski, 18-14155, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189861, at *6 (Nov. 5, 2018 S.D. 
Fla.) (“Florida law prohibits recovery of punitive damages from the estate of a wrongdoer who is 
deceased.”); NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1) (“an action may be brought or continued against the 
personal representative of the decedent, but punitive damages shall not be awarded nor 
penalties adjudged in any such action brought to recover damages for personal injury.”). That is 
the law in most jurisdictions, as reflected in the Restatement.  See Restat. (Second) Of Torts § 
908 cmt. a (punitive damages not available against representatives of deceased tortfeasor). 
Respectfully submitted, 
s/Bennet J. Moskowitz 
Bennet J. Moskowitz 
Courts in this District regularly dismiss punitive damages claims.  See The Cookware Co. (USA), LLC v. 
Austin, 15-5796, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177691, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2016) (dismissing punitive 
damages claim without leave to replead); SJB v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., 03-6653, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
13227, at *25-26 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 14, 2004) (dismissing punitive damages claims not statutorily available).

New York, NY 10007 
Re:      Jane Doe 1000 v. Indyke et al., Case No. 19-cv-10577 
Dear Judge Schofield, 
Pursuant to Individual Rules III.A.1 and III.C.2, Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 hereby responds 
to Defendants’ request for a pre-motion conference in connection with their anticipated motion to 
dismiss.  Dkt. 24.  Plaintiff’s claims are timely under New York’s statutes of limitation and the 
doctrine of equitable estoppel, and Defendants’ proposed motion “to dismiss” Plaintiff’s request 
for punitive damages is procedurally improper.  For the following reasons, the Court should deny 
Defendants’ anticipated motion in its entirety.1 
I. 
Plaintiff’s Claims Are Timely Under New York Law. 
Plaintiff’s claims are timely under New York’s CPLR § 215(8)(a), which provides: 
“Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same defendant has been commenced 
with respect to the event or occurrence from which a claim governed by this section arises, the 
plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of the criminal action . . . to commence 
the civil action.”  (Emphasis added).  Here, Epstein’s criminal action in this District terminated on 
August 29, 2019.  Compl. ¶ 36.  Because Plaintiff filed the Complaint less than three months later, 
the action is timely under CPLR 215(8)(a).  Defendants’ arguments against CPLR § 215(8)(a)’s 
application to these facts are meritless.  
First, Defendants’ argument that CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not apply because Plaintiff was 
not named as a victim in Epstein’s indictment is incorrect.  New York courts have held that CPLR 
§ 215(8)(a) is “plain, clear and unambiguous” that it does not require that the plaintiff be “the 
victim or the specific person upon whom the crime had been committed.”  Clemens v. Nealon, 202 
A.D.2d 747, 749 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994).     
Second, Defendants’ narrow construction of § 215(8)(a)’s “event or occurrence” language 
is improper, especially in light of the breadth of Epstein’s indictment.  The charges were not limited 
to crimes committed against specific victims.  For example, the overt acts alleged for the sex 
trafficking conspiracy charge were enticing and recruiting multiple victims, “including minor 
To the extent the Court allows Defendants to file a motion to dismiss, Plaintiff requests 30 days from the 
date of Defendants’ motion to file an opposition, with Defendants’ reply brief due 10 days thereafter.

victims identified herein.”  Compl., Ex. A (S.D.N.Y Indictment) ¶ 22(a) (emphasis added).  As 
another example, the Indictment’s sex trafficking count charged Epstein with the sex trafficking 
of “numerous individuals . . . including but not limited to Minor Victim-1.”  Id. ¶ 24.  Nor did the 
Indictment describe the sex trafficking conspiracy as exclusively targeting minor victims—it 
explicitly acknowledged that some victims were not underage at the time of the sexual abuse.  Id. 
¶ 11 (“[Epstein] knew that many of his New York victims were underage.”).  The Indictment was 
targeted at Epstein’s sex-trafficking scheme as a whole, and that scheme is the event or occurrence 
from which Plaintiff’s civil claims arose.  See Kashef v. BNP Paribas S.A., 925 F.3d 53, 56–57, 
(2d Cir. 2019) (guilty plea conceding “knowledge of the atrocities being committed in Sudan” 
allowed victims of the atrocities in Sudan use 215(8)(a) because causes of action arose out of 
defendant’s general conspiracy with Sudan to violate U.S. sanctions put in place to stop atrocities).  
Because Plaintiff’s claims arise out of this common scheme, they fall within CPLR § 215(8)(a).    
The cases Defendants cite are inapposite because the criminal charges in those cases were 
much narrower than Epstein’s, and related to events that occurred on specified dates.  See 
Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 A.D.2d 595, 596 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999) (prosecution commenced 
only in connection with events on two dates); Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. 
Misc. LEXIS 8435, at *3 (Sup. Ct. Oct. 23, 2018) (indictment “charged [the defendant] for 
incidents occurring on three (3) specific dates”).  Epstein’s Indictment was much broader, covering 
sexual abuse that occurred “over the course of many years” “from at least in or about 2002, up to 
and including at least in or about 2005.”  S.D.N.Y. Indictment ¶¶1–2, 8, 20, 24 (emphases added).  
Plaintiff’s claims are therefore timely under CPLR § 215(8)(a) because the scheme the S.D.N.Y. 
Indictment targeted is the event or occurrence from which Plaintiff’s civil claims arise. 
Plaintiff’s claims are also timely under CPLR § 213-c, which provides for a twenty year 
limitations period for “all civil claims or causes of action brought by any person for physical, 
psychological or other injury or condition suffered by such person as a result of conduct which 
would constitute rape” or other enumerated sex crimes.  The Complaint alleges that Epstein 
sexually assaulted Plaintiff by forcible compulsion multiple times within the past twenty years.  
See Compl. ¶ 50, 51.  Plaintiff’s claims fall squarely within CPLR § 213-c’s coverage.  Defendants’ 
assertion that CPLR § 213-c does not apply because “the 20-year SOL does not apply 
retroactively” is meritless.  CPLR § 213-c’s text contains no such limitation, and was revised last 
year (increasing the limitations period from 5 to 20 years) specifically to allow claims such as 
Plaintiff’s to proceed.  See June 17, 2019, New York Committee Report, 2019 NY S.B. 6574 (NS) 
(noting that “victims who have suffered in silence for decades have bravely spoken about their 
abuse, and have also laid bare the state’s limited ability to prosecute their abusers due to the 
passage of time” and that “this bill would increase the time period in which the victim could bring 
a civil suit for these offenses to twenty years”).    
Defendants also assert that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely under New York’s borrowing 
statute, CPLR § 202.  This argument fails for two reasons.  First, CPLR § 202 only applies to non-
residents who are injured outside of New York, and the controlling date for determining a 
plaintiff’s residence is the date on which the cause of action accrued, not the date on which the 
action was commenced.  See, e.g., DeMartino v. Rivera, 148 A.D.2d 568, 570 (N.Y. App. Div. 
1989).  Under the borrowing statute, the phrases “resident” and “domicile” are not synonymous. 
“Rather, the determination of whether a plaintiff is a New York resident, for purposes of CPLR

of living there for some length of time during the course of a year.”  Antone v. Gen. Motors Corp., 
473 N.E.2d 742, 746 (N.Y. 1984).  The fact that Plaintiff currently lives in New Jersey is irrelevant.  
At the time of her repeated sexual assaults, Plaintiff was a resident of New York—she lived in 
Epstein’s apartment building on 66th Street in Manhattan, where he housed other victims.  Compl. 
¶ 40.  When Plaintiff escaped Epstein, she stayed in New York and moved into a Salvation Army 
apartment.  Compl. ¶ 46.  Because Plaintiff had a significant connection with New York at the 
time her cause of action accrued, she was a resident of New York, and CPLR § 202 does not apply.   
Second, even if New York’s borrowing statute did apply and Plaintiff’s claims were 
otherwise untimely, they would still not be barred because CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides for civil 
actions 
to 
commence 
within 
“one 
year 
from 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
criminal 
action . . . notwithstanding that the time in which to commence such action has already expired.”  
II. 
Plaintiff Has Sufficiently Pled Facts Supporting Equitable Estoppel and Tolling. 
Even if Plaintiff’s claims were otherwise time-barred under New York’s statutes of 
limitation (they are not), they would still be timely under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  
Defendants assert that Plaintiff “fails to meet her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances 
sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel.”  Dkt. 24 at 2.  But the Complaint alleges in detail 
the methods of intimidation and control that Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators used to deter 
their victims from seeking justice.  Equitable estoppel applies “where it would be unjust to allow 
a defendant to assert a statute of limitations defense,” Zumpano v. Quinn, 849 N.E.2d 926, 929 
(N.Y. 2006), due to “deception, concealment, threats, or other misconduct,” Zoe G. v. Frederick 
F.G., 208 A.D.2d 675, 675 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994).  The Complaint alleges that Epstein and his 
co-conspirators manipulated victims using “financial power, promises, and threats;” that Plaintiff 
was “terrified of Epstein, who repeatedly threatened her and made representations about his 
wealth, power, and connections;” and that Epstein forced Plaintiff to meet with a prominent lawyer 
who gathered information about Plaintiff’s family’s financial situation that Epstein later used “to 
intimidate her and to keep her compliant in his sex-trafficking scheme.”  Compl. ¶¶ 27, 40, 43.  
The allegations concerning Epstein’s purposeful silencing of his victims (and Plaintiff specifically) 
easily provide the requisite “extraordinary circumstances” for equitable tolling. 
Because equitable estoppel and equitable tolling are fact-specific doctrines, Defendants’ 
attempt to resolve the issue with a motion to dismiss is inappropriate, and any motion challenging 
whether or not those doctrines apply should be reserved until after discovery.  See, e.g., Carelock 
v. United States, 2015 WL 5000816, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2015). 
III. 
The Court Should Address Punitive Damages After Discovery   
Federal Rule 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to file a motion to dismiss for “failure to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Defendants’ request for the Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s 
claim for punitive damages does not relate to either of Plaintiff’s clams (battery and intentional 
infliction of emotion distress) and does not relate to the sufficiency of the allegations in the 
Complaint.  The issue of what type of damages to which Plaintiff is entitled should therefore be 
dealt with at a later stage of this litigation.  See, e.g., Okyere v. Palisades Collection, LLC, 961 F. 
Supp. 2d 522, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying “motion to ‘dismiss’ plaintiff’s request for punitive 
damages as procedurally premature”).

41513378v2
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), submit this memorandum of law in support of their 
motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF 
No. 1) because it is time-barred, and Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages because it is prohibited 
by a New York statute and well-established Florida law. 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This action is time-barred. Plaintiff alleges that, in or about 1999, when she was an adult, 
Jefferey E. Epstein (“Decedent”), now deceased, committed sexual offenses against her in New 
York and Florida. (Compl. ¶¶ 16, 38, 40, 42, 50, 55.) Plaintiff asserts two causes of action—battery 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress—and demands punitive damages. (Id. ¶¶ 49-59, p. 
13.) Plaintiff’s causes of action expired many years ago per New York’s one- and three-year 
statutes of limitations (CPLR §§ 214(5), 215(3)) and Florida’s four-year statute of limitations (Fla. 
Stat. § 95.11 (3)(O)). 
In apparent recognition that her claims are time-barred, Plaintiff erroneously alleges that 
(i) a New York statute of limitations enacted last year revives her claims, notwithstanding the 
enacting law expressly and unequivocally provides it does not apply retroactively to claims that 
are already time-barred, (ii) her claims are timely pursuant to CPLR § 215(8)(a),1 (iii) her claims 
were equitably tolled, and (iv) the Co-Executors are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of 
limitations defense. (Compl. ¶¶ 12-14.) Each of these arguments fails as a matter of law. 
The 2019 New York law enacting a new, longer statute of limitations is very clear: it does 
not apply retroactively except “where the applicable statute of limitations in effect on the date of 
CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides: “Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same defendant has been 
commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from which a claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff 
shall have at least one year from the termination of the criminal action … to commence the civil action.” (Emphasis 
added.) 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 7 of 20

such act or omission has not yet expired.” 2019 N.Y. Ch. 315, 2019 N.Y. SB 6574, §4. Plaintiff’s 
causes of action expired many years before the new law went into effect.  
Moreover, CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not apply here because Decedent’s criminal indictment 
(the “Indictment”), which concerns alleged sexual trafficking of minors, has nothing to do with 
Plaintiff, who alleges sexual assault when she was an adult. Plaintiff also fails to meet her burden 
to allege extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel. 
Plaintiff’s demands for punitive damages must also be dismissed as a matter of law. Both 
New York and Florida law bar recovery of punitive damages from a decedent tortfeasor’s estate—
i.e., exactly what Plaintiff is seeking here. 
STATEMENT OF ALLEGED FACTS 
A.
Plaintiff Alleges Decedent Sexually Assaulted Her In And Around 1999, When 
She Was An Adult 
Plaintiff alleges she met Decedent in “late 1999” at his New York residence. (Compl. ¶ 
38.) Plaintiff does not allege that she was a minor at this time. According to Plaintiff, she went to 
Decedent’s residence to discuss modeling opportunities. (Id. ¶¶ 38-39.) Plaintiff alleges that, at 
some point thereafter, she moved into an apartment owned by Decedent on 66th Street in 
Manhattan. (Id. 40.)  
Plaintiff further alleges that Decedent had “recruiters” who would call her to visit Decedent 
at his residence to give him a massage. (Id.) Decedent allegedly sexually assaulted Plaintiff during 
these massages. (Id.) Plaintiff also alleges, with no further details, that Decedent flew her to 
Florida, where he sexually assaulted her again. (Id. ¶ 42.) Plaintiff also claims Decedent promised 
her modeling opportunities “for years, up until the last time [she] saw Epstein,” but does not 
provide even an approximate date identifying when that was or when the alleged abuse ended. (Id.
¶ 45.)  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 8 of 20

Apparently recognizing that her claims are time-barred under applicable statutes of 
limitations, Plaintiff alleges a few generic legal conclusions that also appear in other time-barred 
complaints against the Co-Executors that Plaintiff’s counsel filed in this District on behalf of other 
individuals. Thus, Plaintiff alleges in conclusory fashion: 

This action has been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of a criminal action 
against the same defendant to commence an action with respect to the event or 
occurrence from which the criminal action arose. A criminal action against [Decedent] 
with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from which Plaintiff’s claims arise 
was terminated on August 29, 2019. (Id. ¶ 12.) 

This action has also been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c, which 
provides that a plaintiff shall have 20 years to file civil claims “for physical, 
psychological or other injury or condition suffered by such person as a result of conduct 
which would constitute” certain sex crimes under New York Penal Law Article 130. 
[Decedent] and Ghislaine Maxwell sexually assaulted Plaintiff by forcible compulsion 
within 20 years of filing this Complaint, and that sexual assault constitutes one or more 
sex crimes described in N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-C. (Id. ¶ 13.) 

Any statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiff’s claims is tolled due to the continuous 
and active deception, duress, threats of retaliation, and other forms of misconduct that 
[Decedent] and his co-conspirators used to silence his many victims, including 
Plaintiff. [Decedent]’s actions deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity to commence this 
lawsuit before his death. Until his death, Plaintiff feared that [Decedent] and his co-
conspirators would harm her or her family, or ruin her life, if she came forward. (Id. ¶ 
14.) 

Defendants are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense. 
Allowing Defendants to do so would be unjust. [Decedent] and his co-conspirators 
intimidated each of his victims into silence by threatening their lives and their 
livelihoods. They therefore prevented Plaintiff from commencing this lawsuit before 
his death. By using threats, along with his wealth and power, Epstein was able to escape 
punishment for his crimes against countless young women and underage girls for the 
duration of his life. (Id. ¶15.) 
These rote, non-specific allegations cannot rescue Plaintiff’s time-barred claims.

ARGUMENT 
A.
Legal Standard: Plaintiff’s Legal Conclusions, Labels, And Formulaic 
Recitations Of The Elements Of Her Causes Of Action Are Insufficient To 
Revive Her Time-Deserved Claims 
“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, 
accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 
662, 678 (2009). While a Court must normally accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations 
in a complaint and draw all inferences in a plaintiff’s favor, those principles are “inapplicable to 
legal conclusions.” Id. at 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 556 
(2007)). Thus, a pleading that offers only “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of 
the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (2007). 
B.
Plaintiff’s Claims Expired Many Years Ago And Must Be Dismissed 
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
arising out of events starting in late 1999 and occurring in New York and Florida, all when Plaintiff 
was an adult. Each cause of action is time-barred and must be dismissed.  
Under New York law, causes of action sounding in battery must be commenced within one 
year of accrual (CPLR § 215(3)); and claims sounding in personal injury, within three years (CPLR 
§ 214(5)). Under Florida law, the statute of limitations for Plaintiff’s claims is four years. See Fla. 
Stat. § 95.11(3)(O).  
Plaintiff does not allege that she endured the alleged sexual assaults for a period of time 
that would permit her to avoid these statutes of limitations. (See Compl. ¶¶ 2, 45.) Plaintiff’s failure 
to allege when Decedent’s alleged sexual assaults ended is either a tacit admission that this action 
is time-barred or a fatal pleading failure. In either event, this action must be dismissed. 
In Plaintiff’s response to the Co-Executors’ pre-motion letter (ECF Doc. 25, § I), Plaintiff 
erroneously claims the current 20-year statute of limitations in CPLR § 213-c applies to her claims. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 10 of 20

However, CPLR § 213-c is not a revival statute. CPLR § 213-c, which became effective as of 
September 18, 2019, does not apply retroactively except “where the applicable statute of 
limitations in effect on the date of such act or omission has not yet expired.” 2019 N.Y. Laws 315, 
2019 N.Y. SB 6574, § 4.  
Plaintiff does not allege—and did not argue in her pre-motion letter—that any of her claims 
were timely as of September 18, 2019. Therefore, CPLR § 213-c does not apply. 
Instead, Plaintiff argued in her pre-motion letter that, because the 2019 law rewriting CPLR 
§ 213-c did not set forth the prohibition on retroactive application in the text of CPLR § 213-c 
itself, Plaintiff should be able to invoke it. (ECF Doc. 25, § I.) That is wrong.  
C.
Plaintiff’s Attempts To Invoke Extraordinary Statute Of Limitations 
Exceptions Fail 
i.
CPLR § 215(8)(a) is inapplicable because the Indictment concerned sex 
trafficking of minors, not adults such as Plaintiff 
Nor does CPLR § 215(8)(a) apply here. CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides: “Whenever it is shown 
that a criminal action against the same defendant has been commenced with respect to the event 
or occurrence from which a claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff shall have at least 
one year from the termination of the criminal action … to commence the civil action.” (emphasis 
added.) 
Decedent’s Indictment, which Plaintiff attaches to her Complaint, was not commenced 
with respect to Plaintiff. Rather, the Indictment charges Decedent sexually abused “minor girls” 
from 2002 to 2005 (Compl., Ex. A at ¶¶ 1, 20), stating throughout that it concerns sex trafficking 
of minors. (Id. ¶¶ 2-4, 6, 8, 11-15, 18-20, 22.) Plaintiff does not allege she was a minor when 
Decedent sexually assaulted her in or around 1999. Therefore, this action and the Indictment arise 
from different occurrences. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 11 of 20

New York courts apply CPLR § 215(8)(a) narrowly. See Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 
A.D.2d 595, 596 (2d Dept. 1999) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied only to claims based on events of 
February 26, 1993 and December 28, 1993, because it was only in connection with events of those 
two days that a criminal prosecution was commenced against defendant); Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 
2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435 (Sup. Ct. Dutchess Cnty. Oct. 23, 2018) (CPLR § 
215(8)(a) inapplicable where incidents charged in criminal action and those alleged in civil action 
occurred on different dates); McElligott v. City of N.Y., No. 15-cv-7107 (LGS), 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 201829, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2017) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) inapplicable to claims against 
civil defendants not charged as co-defendants in criminal action, notwithstanding same events gave 
rise to both actions). 
Gallina is especially instructive. In that case, an individual sued an attorney for battery and 
other claims based on the core allegation that, over the course of two years, the attorney committed 
various sexual misconduct against the plaintiff, including sexual assault. 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 
8435, at *1. Defendant had also been criminally charged with forceable touching for incidents that 
occurred with the plaintiff in 2017. Id. at *3. The court dismissed as time-barred plaintiff’s battery 
counts based on incidents alleged to have occurred in 2016. Id. at *2-3. 
In doing so, the court rejected plaintiff’s argument that CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied to the 
2016 incidents, finding: 
Plaintiff argues that the July and October 2016 incidents are part of the same 
ongoing course of events as the February, March and May 2017 incidents 
and should therefore be deemed timely commenced … the case law does 
not support Plaintiff’s interpretation of … CPLR §215(8)(a). The criminal 
instruments … demonstrate that Defendant was charged for incidents 
occurring on three (3) specific dates … Pursuant to CPLR §215(8)(a), 
tolling would apply only to claims based on these dates, “because it was 
only in connection with the events of these [three] days that a criminal 
prosecution was commenced against the defendant.” Christodoulou v. 
Terdeman, 262 AD2d 595, 596 [2d Dept. 1999]. As criminal charges were 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 12 of 20

not commenced with respect to the July 2016 and October 2016 events, the 
tolling provisions of CPLR §215(8) do not apply. 
Id. at *3-4. 
Here, Plaintiff asserts a more tenuous connection between this action and the Indictment 
than the one unsuccessfully asserted by the plaintiff in Gallina (and the other cited cases). The 
Court should therefore reject Plaintiff’s argument for the application of CPLR § 215(8)(a). 
In Plaintiff’s response to the Co-Executors’ pre-motion letter (ECF No. 25, § I), Plaintiff 
asserts two erroneous arguments for application of CPLR § 215(8)(a). First, Plaintiff argues that 
CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not require the Indictment to expressly identify Plaintiff as one of 
Decedent’s victims. This is a strawman argument: no one argues otherwise. 
However, Plaintiff is required to show—but cannot show under the circumstances here—
that this action and the Indictment arise from the same event. They do not. Not only does the 
Indictment not refer to Plaintiff, it also does not refer to misconduct of the type that Plaintiff alleges 
here. The Indictment could not be clearer: it concerns sex trafficking of minors. Plaintiff does not 
allege she was a minor when Decedent sexually assaulted her. Nor does she allege anything 
establishing she was a sex trafficking victim. 
Second, Plaintiff urges a broad construction of CPLR § 215(8)(a) that effectively rewrites 
it by rendering the limitation therein—“with respect to the event or occurrence from which a 
claim governed by this section arises”—meaningless. Plaintiff effectively argues that, unless the 
Indictment expressly rules out that it arises from the same event as this action, then Plaintiff is 
entitled to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a). That argument is contrary to basic principles of statutory 
interpretation prohibiting a reading of a statute that would render its words meaningless (see 97 
NY Jur Statutes § 185), the case law cited above, a plain reading of the Indictment and common 
sense. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 13 of 20

Plaintiff cites a single case in support of this erroneous argument, Kashef v. BNP Paribas 
S.A., 925 F.3d 53 (2d Cir. 2019). However, Kashef is distinguishable on its face, since the civil 
and criminal actions in that case both arose out of the same conspiracy between BNP and Sudan 
to violate U.S. sanctions. Kashef, 925 F.3d at 63. 
Here, by contrast, Plaintiff’s allegations—that she was an adult whom Decedent sexually 
assaulted—do not comport with the alleged scheme to traffic minors set forth repeatedly in the 
Indictment. Nor does Plaintiff sufficiently set forth allegations establishing she was a trafficking 
victim in any respect. Therefore, while Plaintiff may claim she, too, is a victim of Decedent, she 
is not a victim by reason of the events giving rise to the Indictment. 
Plaintiff also cites a Third Department case, Crucible Materials Corp. v. N.Y. Power Auth., 
A.D.3d 1353 (Third Dept. 2008), to support her separate assertion that the Court must permit 
her to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a) based on statutory interpretation principles. Yet Crucible does not 
concern CPLR § 215(8)(a). Further, in that case, the Third Department reaffirmed the principle 
that, when interpreting a statute, courts “giv[e] clear effect to the plain meaning of the words 
employed.” Crucible Materials Corp., 50 A.D.3d at 1355-56. This is exactly what the Co-
Executors urge here and what Plaintiff argues against—namely, a proper interpretation of CPLR 
§ 215(8)(a) that gives meaning to the words “with respect to the event or occurrence from which 
a claim governed by this section arises.” The Court should reject Plaintiff’s attempt to rewrite the 
statute. 
ii.
Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege “extraordinary” circumstances 
sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel 
Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify 
tolling or equitable estoppel. “Second Circuit cases discussing equitable tolling set a stringent 
standard for its application.” Fairley v. Collins, No. 09-Civ-6894 (PGG), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 14 of 20

26536, at *16 (Mar. 15, 2011 S.D.N.Y.) (Gardephe, J.) (finding equitable tolling did not apply and 
granting defendants’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss complaint on statute of limitations 
grounds). Equitable tolling only applies where a plaintiff is “prevented in some extraordinary way
from exercising h[er] rights.” Viti v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., No. 10-cv-2908 (ALC) (MHD), 
2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189633, at *30 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2012), adopted by, 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 174145 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2013) (emphasis added) (citing Smith v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Corr., 
No. 09-civ-7639, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137152, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Johnson v. Nyack Hosp., 
F.3d 8, 12 (2d Cir. 1996)).  
Under this doctrine, a court may, “under compelling circumstances, make narrow 
exceptions to the statute of limitations … ‘to prevent inequity.’” Id. (emphasis added) (citing Yesh 
Diamonds, Inc. v. Yashaya, No. 09-CV-2016 (DLI) (RER), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101744, at *2 
(E.D.N.Y. 2010); In re U.S. Lines, Inc., 318 F.3d 432, 436 (2d Cir. 2003)). “That the doctrine is to 
be employed only sparingly—in ‘extraordinary’ and ‘compelling’ circumstances—is reflected in 
the fact that the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to show that tolling is justified.” Id. 
(emphasis added) (citing Boos v. Runyon, 201 F.3d 178, 185 (2d Cir. 2000)). A late-filing party 
seeking equitable tolling must also demonstrate she acted with “reasonable diligence” in pursuing 
her claims during the period she seeks to toll. Id. at *32 (citation omitted). 
Equitable estoppel only applies where a plaintiff knows her cause of action exists, but the 
defendant’s conduct causes her to delay bringing suit. See Yesh, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101744, 
at *5 (citing Cerbone v. Int’l Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union, 768 F.2d 45, 50 (2d Cir. 1985)). 
“The rationale behind this equitable doctrine is to protect the person who brings their action after 
it would normally be barred because she was ‘lulled’ into believing that she should delay pursuing 
her cause of action.” Id. (quoting In re Higgins, 270 B.R. 147, 158 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2001)). 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 15 of 20

Equitable estoppel requires a plaintiff to show: “(i) the defendant made a definite misrepresentation 
of fact, and had reason to believe that the plaintiff would rely on it; and (ii) the plaintiff reasonably 
relied on that misrepresentation to h[er] detriment.” Id. (citation omitted). Tolling is inappropriate 
where, as here, a plaintiff fails to articulate any acts by a defendant that prevented the plaintiff 
from timely commencing suit. See id. at *6. 
Plaintiff does not allege any particularized acts by Decedent that prevented her from 
exercising her rights. Nor has Plaintiff alleged that (i) Decedent made a misrepresentation to her 
and had reason to believe she would rely on it, or (ii) Plaintiff reasonably relied on it to her 
detriment. Nor does Plaintiff allege any facts showing she acted with “reasonable diligence” in 
pursuing her claims during the period she seeks to toll. Therefore, there is no “extraordinary” basis 
alleged sufficient to toll the statute of limitations or estop the Co-Executors from asserting a statute 
of limitations defense. 
Plaintiff erroneously asserts in her pre-motion letter that her allegations in paragraphs 27, 
and 43 of her Complaint constitute “extraordinary circumstances” sufficient to invoke these 
doctrines. (ECF No. 13, § II.) However, Paragraph 27 does not even relate to Plaintiff. Rather, it 
concerns general allegations of misconduct by Decedent related to other, unidentified alleged 
victims. There is nothing alleged about why such misconduct prevented Plaintiff from filing this 
action a long time ago.  
Plaintiff’s reliance on paragraphs 40 and 43 is also misplaced. The allegations in those 
paragraphs are that, during the period of the alleged assaults of Plaintiff, Decedent threatened her 
and on a single occasion forced her to meet with an attorney who asked her “personal questions.” 
However, Plaintiff does not allege that Decedent did anything after the alleged assaults ended to 
prevent her from commencing this lawsuit. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 16 of 20

There are numerous court decisions in which stronger, clearer allegations are deemed 
insufficient to justify equitable estoppel or tolling. See, e.g., Conklin v. Maidenbaum, No. 12-cv- 
3606, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113975, at *27 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2013) (Ramos, J.) (finding 
equitable tolling inapplicable and dismissing complaint notwithstanding that plaintiffs alleged they 
reasonably relied on defendants’ representations over a period spanning more than ten months and 
dozens of telephone calls). 
Plaintiff alternatively argues in her pre-motion letter that her entitlement to equitable 
estoppel and tolling are fact issues not subject to rulings by the Court on a motion to dismiss. (ECF 
No. 25, § II.) Plaintiff misses the point. Where, as here, a plaintiff fails to allege facts that support 
invocation of an exception to the statute of limitations, there is no issue of fact sufficient to defeat 
a motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds: 
If properly pled, allegations of equitable estoppel normally create questions 
of fact which cannot be determined at a motion to dismiss…. However, 
without adequate pleading, the issue is not properly raised and therefore 
cannot defeat a motion to dismiss based on statute of limitations grounds. 
See Dep’t of Econ. Dev. v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 747 F. Supp. 922, 943 
(S.D.N.Y. 1990) (dismissing cause of action because plaintiff made no 
allegation in complaint that “its failure to timely institute its third-party 
action was due to its justified reliance upon a misrepresentation” by 
opposing party); Moll v. U.S. Life Title Ins. Co. of N.Y., 700 F. Supp. 1284, 
1293 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (“Plaintiffs have not alleged that defendant caused 
them to delay in bringing suit on a known cause of action. On the contrary, 
plaintiffs repeatedly emphasize that they did not discover the alleged … 
violations until long after the limitations period had expired. Equitable 
estoppel is therefore not appropriate in this case.”). 
Abercrombie v. College, 438 F. Supp. 2d 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). 
Here, as in Abercrombie, “Plaintiff has failed to allege any facts that would support 
invocation of the equitable estoppel doctrine. First, Plaintiff does not identify the 
misrepresentations or other facts demonstrating fraudulent concealment that could serve as the 
basis for the claimed equitable estoppel. More particularly, Plaintiff has utterly failed to identify 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 17 of 20

in the Complaint which statements led her to believe that she could delay bringing her lawsuit.” 
Id. at 266. Nor does Plaintiff allege facts that would support invocation of equitable tolling. 
D.
Plaintiff’s Claim For Punitive Damages Must Be Dismissed Because They Are 
Precluded By New York Law 
Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law because it is barred by statute 
and well-established law. Courts in this District regularly grant motions to dismiss legally deficient 
claims for punitive damages. See, e.g., The Cookware Co. (USA), LLC v. Austin, No. 15 Civ. 5796, 
2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177691, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2016) (Batts, J.) (granting motion to 
dismiss claim for punitive damages without leave to replead because allegations regarding 
defendant’s bad-faith conduct were conclusory and did not rise to the required level of malice); 
SJB v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 03 Civ. 6653, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13227, at *25-26 (S.D.N.Y. 
July 14, 2004) (Buchwald, J.) (granting motion to dismiss punitive damages claims because 
punitive damages were not statutorily available); Kunica v. St. Jean Fin., No. 97 Civ. 3804, 1998 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11867, at *26 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 1998) (Sweet, J.) (granting motion to dismiss 
claim for punitive damages because, even if conduct alleged in complaint was true, it did not rise 
to the level necessary to award punitive damages); Purdy v. Consumers Distrib. Co., 648 F. Supp. 
980, 981, 984 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (Cedarbaum, J.) (granting motion to dismiss claim for punitive 
damages). 
When determining what law applies, the court looks to the choice of law rules of the forum 
state. Simons v. Marriott Corp., No. 92 Civ. 3762 (SWK), 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14365, at *15 
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 1993). Under New York law, the law of the state where a tort occurs generally 
applies to punitive damages. See Starr Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Am. Claims Mgmt., No. 14-cv-0463-
JMF, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60272, *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2015) (“Because punitive damages are 
conduct-regulating, ‘the law of the jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply.’”) 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 18 of 20

(quoting Deutsch v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 723 F. Supp. 2d 521, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 2010); Guidi v. 
Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., No. 95-CV-9006 (LAP), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6390, at *1 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2003)). 
Here, Plaintiff has alleged tortious conduct occurring in New York and Florida. (Compl. 
¶¶ 40, 42.) New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law provides: “No cause of action for injury to 
person or property is lost because of the death of the person liable for the injury. For any injury, 
an action may be brought or continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but 
punitive damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought to 
recover damages for personal injury.” NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1) (emphasis added). “Also, ‘there 
is a strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an estate on account of 
wrongful conduct of the decedent.’” Graham v. Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) 
(quoting Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996)). 
New York General Construction Law § 37-a defines “personal injury” as including “an 
assault, battery, false imprisonment, or other actionable injury to the person either of the plaintiff, 
or of another.”  Here, Plaintiff seeks to recover damages for personal injuries, i.e., “battery” and 
“intentional infliction of emotional distress,” which are actionable injuries to Plaintiff’s person. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff may not recover against the Co-Executors for punitive damages based on 
alleged torts that occurred in New York. 
Nor are punitive damages available to Plaintiff under Florida law. Poindexter v. 
Zacharzewski, No. 18-14155, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189861, at *6 (Nov. 5, 2018 S.D. Fla.) (citing 
Lohr v. Byrd, 522 So. 2d 845 (Fla. 1988)). “Florida law prohibits recovery of punitive damages 
from the estate of a wrongdoer who is deceased.” Id. That is the law in most jurisdictions, as 
reflected in the Restatement. See Restat. (Second) Of Torts § 908 cmt. a (punitive damages not 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 34     Filed 02/28/20     Page 19 of 20

available against representatives of deceased tortfeasor). Even if Plaintiff’s claims somehow 
survive, her claims for punitive damages must therefore be dismissed. 
In her pre-motion letter, Plaintiff does not dispute that this prohibition on punitive damages 
in personal injury actions against a decedent tortfeasor’s estate is black-letter New York and 
Florida law. Rather, Plaintiff asks the Court to simply delay ruling on the issue of punitive damages 
until after discovery. (ECF No. 25, § II.) However, as there are no facts alleged that would render 
Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim proper, there is no reason to allow it to stand. 
Plaintiff seeks to delay the inevitable so she may use the prospect of punitive damages—
expressly prohibited as they may be—as (misplaced) leverage over the Co-Executors. This would 
serve no legitimate purpose. It would also impede productive settlement discussions. Plaintiff’s 
punitive damages claim, like the punitive damages claims in the cases cited above, should be 
dismissed. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated above, Defendants respectfully request that the Court dismiss 
Plaintiff’s Complaint, together with such other and further relief as the Court deems just and 
proper.

Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000, by and through her undersigned attorneys, respectfully submits 
this Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s 
Complaint.1   
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
For decades, Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators recruited countless young women to 
his homes in New York, Florida, and elsewhere, and forced them to give him massages that 
escalated into sexual assault.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 was just one of many victims that Epstein 
and his co-conspirators recruited to be a part of their sex-trafficking operation when she was a 
young woman.  Epstein continuously offered to help Jane Doe with her career, but instead sexually 
abused her for years. 
Defendants contend that Jane Doe’s claims are untimely, but wholly ignore the burden that 
they bear and which they have failed to meet.  First, Jane Doe’s claims are timely under N.Y. 
C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provides that when a criminal action is commenced with respect to 
the same event or occurrence that gives rise to a plaintiff’s civil claims, the plaintiff has at least 
one year from the termination of the criminal action to file a civil action.  Second, Jane Doe’s 
claims are timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c, which provides victims of rape or other delineated 
criminal sexual acts with 20 years to bring a civil action against the perpetrator.  Third, Defendants 
have failed to meet their burden of showing that Jane Doe will be unable to invoke equitable 
estoppel and equitable tolling.  Finally, Defendants’ motion to “dismiss” Jane Doe’s demand for 
punitive damages is not only procedurally improper, but incorrect—punitive damages are available 
under U.S. Virgin Islands law.  The Court should deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss in full. 
Plaintiff respectfully requests oral argument pursuant to Individual Rule 2.K.   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 7 of 32

STATEMENT OF FACTS 
Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000’s story echoes the stories of many other victims of Jeffrey Epstein.  
Jane Doe grew up in extreme poverty and her mother had been homeless at various times 
throughout her childhood.  Compl. ¶ 37.  Jane Doe did modeling work as a young woman, and 
after seeing her picture, a man contacted her to ask if she would like to meet someone with 
connections to various modeling opportunities—Jeffrey Epstein.  Id. ¶ 38.  Because Jane Doe was 
struggling financially and aspired to be a successful model, Jane Doe agreed to meet Epstein at his 
New York mansion.  Id.  When they met, Epstein bragged about his friendship with Leslie Wexner, 
the chief executive of Victoria’s Secret, and offered Jane Doe a modeling job with the lingerie 
retailer.  Id. ¶ 39.  After identifying Jane Doe’s vulnerabilities, Epstein moved her into his 
apartment building on 66th Street, where he provided housing to other victims.  Id. ¶ 40.   
Epstein soon began sexually abusing Jane Doe.  Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s head 
recruiter, and other recruiters would call Jane Doe several times a week and direct her to give 
Epstein massages at his New York mansion.  Id. ¶ 40.  Consistent with Epstein’s pattern of abuse 
of countless other victims, Epstein forced Jane Doe to engage in sex acts during the massages, 
including by making her use sex toys.  Id. ¶¶ 40–41.  Epstein also flew Jane Doe to his mansion in 
Palm Beach, Florida, for additional sexual massages.  Id. ¶ 42. 
Jane Doe’s final encounter with Epstein was particularly harrowing.  On that day, Epstein 
called Jane Doe to his New York mansion, and when she arrived, Maxwell led her upstairs to 
Epstein’s master bedroom.  Id. ¶ 46.  Sex toys had been laid out on the bed prior to Jane Doe’s 
arrival.  Id.  Epstein and Maxwell then simultaneously sexually assaulted Jane Doe by force, and 
Maxwell penetrated Jane Doe with a sex toy.  Id.  The encounter left Jane Doe distraught and 
terrified.  She moved out of the 66th Street apartment building and, having nowhere else to go, 
moved into a Salvation Army housing facility.  Id. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 8 of 32

Epstein and his co-conspirators used displays of wealth and power to manipulate, scare, 
and control their victims.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 27, 44.  For example, after recruiting victims, Epstein and his 
co-conspirators made sure that victims saw photographs of Epstein with powerful political and 
social figures and noticed the opulence of his homes.  Id. ¶ 27.  These tactics were meant to ensure 
that victims knew that there would be consequences if they did not comply with Epstein’s demands 
or if they reported their abuse to the authorities or the media.  Id.  
Unsurprisingly, Epstein and his co-conspirators used these tactics on Jane Doe.  Knowing 
that Jane Doe had struggled financially, Epstein provided her with housing to ensure that she 
remained loyal to and dependent on him.  Id. ¶ 40.  He also constantly touted his relationship with 
Wexner and Victoria’s Secret because he knew about her aspirations, and he promised her 
modeling opportunities every time he abused her.  Id. ¶¶ 39, 45.  Epstein made it so that without 
him, Jane Doe was homeless, jobless, and without any career prospects.  On one occasion, Epstein 
forced Jane Doe to meet with a prominent lawyer and law professor, who gathered personal 
information about her that Epstein later used against her to intimidate her and to keep her quiet.  
Id. ¶ 43. 
After decades of escaping appropriate punishment for his extraordinarily far-reaching and 
disturbing crimes, Epstein was indicted in July 2019 on one count of sex-trafficking conspiracy 
and one count of sex trafficking.  Compl., Ex. A (the “Indictment”).  The Indictment focused on 
Epstein’s recruitment of victims to his New York and Palm Beach homes to provide him with 
massages that became sexual in nature.  Indictment ¶ 7.  The Indictment specifically described 
how Epstein recruited victims who “were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to 
exploitation” to come to his New York and Florida mansions to give him massages.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 9, 
15.  During the massage, Epstein “would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 9 of 32

victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact 
with the victim’s genitals” with his hands or sex toys.  Id.  ¶¶ 9, 15.  Afterwards, Epstein and his 
associates would continue to contact victims to schedule appointments for additional sexual 
encounters so that he could continue to abuse them.  Id. ¶ 11, 17.  This pattern described in the 
Indictment matches Jane Doe’s experience and the experiences of countless other victims. 
On August 8, 2019, shortly after Epstein’s Indictment, Epstein executed his last will and 
testament, naming Defendants the executors of his Estate.  Compl. ¶ 30.  Two days later, Epstein 
was found dead in his jail cell.  Id. ¶ 31.  His last will and testament was filed in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands on August 15, 2019.  Id. ¶ 32.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office submitted a proposed nolle 
prosequi order and Judge Richard M. Berman dismissed the indictment on August 29, 2019.  
Id. ¶ 36.  Plaintiff filed her Complaint shortly thereafter, on November 14, 2019. 
ARGUMENT 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims and Plaintiff’s request for punitive 
damages should be denied.  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient 
factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. . . . A claim 
has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the 
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court must “accept[] all factual 
allegations in the complaint as true and draw[] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.”  
Kashef v. BNP Paribas S.A., 925 F.3d 53, 58 (2d Cir. 2019). 
Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor, Defendants have failed to meet their 
burden of proving that Plaintiff’s claims for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
are untimely.  Further, Defendants’ argument that the Court should dismiss punitive damages from 
the Complaint is both procedurally improper and substantively incorrect. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 10 of 32

I. 
Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden of Proving that Plaintiff’s Claims 
Are Untimely. 
Because the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, Defendants bear the burden of 
proving that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely.  Childers v. New York & Presbyterian Hosp., 36 
F. Supp. 3d 292, 301 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).  A motion to dismiss based on timeliness “should not be 
granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his 
claim which would entitle him to relief.”  Ortiz v. Cornetta, 867 F.2d 146, 148 (2d Cir. 1989) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Accordingly, “dismissal is appropriate only if a 
complaint clearly shows the claim is out of time.”  Harris v. City of New York, 186 F.3d 243, 250 
(2d Cir. 1999).  In this case, Plaintiff’s factual allegations demonstrate that (A) her claims are 
timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), (B) her claims are timely under C.P.L.R. § 213-c, 
(C) Defendants are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense, and (D) the 
limitations period for bringing her claims was equitably tolled. 
A. 
Plaintiff’s Claims Are Timely Under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
Plaintiff’s claims fall squarely within N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which allowed Plaintiff 
to file her complaint within a year of the Indictment’s dismissal.  That provision provides that:  
Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same defendant has been 
commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from which a claim . . . arises, 
the plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of the criminal 
action . . . in which to commence the civil action . . . . 
Id.  Section 215(8)(a)’s one-year limitations period has three requirements: “(1) a criminal action 
has been commenced, (2) against the same defendants, and (3) concerning the same event or 
transaction from which the civil action arose.”  Clemens v. Nealon, 202 A.D.2d 747, 749 (3d Dep’t 
1994).  Because Plaintiff filed the Complaint within one year of the termination of the Indictment, 
her claims are timely.   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 11 of 32

Defendants’ only argument to the contrary is that the Indictment did not concern the same 
event or transaction from which Plaintiff’s civil action arose because the Indictment targeted, 
according to Defendants, some separate sex trafficking operation that only involved underage girls.  
Defs.’ Mem. at 5 (“Plaintiff does not allege she was a minor when Decedent sexually assaulted 
her in or around 1999.  Therefore, this action and the Indictment arise from different 
occurrences.”).  But Defendants mischaracterize § 215(8)(a), the applicable case law, Plaintiff’s 
Complaint, and, most egregiously, the vast sex-trafficking operation that the Indictment targeted.   
1. 
The Indictment Was Not Restricted to Minors. 
As an initial matter, the Indictment covered the crimes Defendants committed against 
Plaintiff, notwithstanding the fact that she did not allege that she was a child when they occurred.  
Defendants seek to minimize the scope of the abuse alleged in the Indictment by focusing on its 
reference to “minors.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 5.  But clinging to the use of the word “minors” does not 
change the nature of the vast and sophisticated operation alleged in the Indictment.  Epstein’s 
pattern and practice was to recruit and traffic young females with vulnerabilities that he knew he 
could exploit, and the Indictment spells out that pattern in detail.  Age is not the deciding factor as 
to whether a female was a victim of the sex-trafficking operation or experienced the precise 
patterns of recruitment and abuse described in the Indictment.  And the fact that many of the 
victims were minors does not mean that non-minors were not victimized by Epstein’s sophisticated 
sex-trafficking operation.  Indeed, the Indictment states that “many” but not “all” of Epstein’s 
victims were minors, demonstrating that prosecutors were investigating Epstein’s crimes against 
young women over the age of 18 as well.  Indictment ¶ 11 (“[Epstein] knew that many of his New 
York victims were underage.”); id. ¶ 17 (“JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage . . . .”).  The FBI confirmed this understanding of the Indictment’s 
scope in a press release issued two days after Epstein’s arrest, stating to Epstein’s victims: “We 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 12 of 32

want to hear from you, regardless of the age you are now, or whatever age you were then, no matter 
where the incident took place.”  https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-
manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors (last visited March 30, 2020) (emphasis added). 
The mere fact that Plaintiff did not allege that she was a minor at the time that she was 
recruited into Epstein’s sex-trafficking scheme does not negate the fact that Plaintiff’s civil claims 
arise from the acts described in the Indictment.  Plaintiff therefore had one year from August 29, 
2019, the date on which Judge Berman formally dismissed the Indictment, to file the Complaint.  
Having filed suit on November 14, 2019, her claims fall well within that limitations period.2 
2. 
Plaintiff’s Claims Concern the Same Sex-Trafficking Operation that the 
Indictment Concerned. 
Even if the Indictment for some reason was limited to Epstein’s trafficking of minors (to 
the exclusion of other victims), Plaintiff’s claims would nonetheless arise from the same “event or 
occurrence” for the purposes of § 215(8)(a).  See, e.g., Kashef, 925 F.3d at 62 (noting that “a New 
York appellate court explicitly rejected the theory that the tolling provisions of CPLR 215(8) are 
exclusively for the benefit of the victims of the crime charged in the criminal proceeding” (internal 
quotation marks omitted)).  Contrary to Defendants’ suggestion, the Court should not construe the 
Indictment “narrowly,” Defs.’ Mem. at 6, where the Indictment itself describes a pattern of abuse 
against numerous victims spanning a number of years.  Epstein repeated the same patterns of 
recruitment and abuse time and time again on countless young females, including Plaintiff.  See, 
e.g., Indictment ¶ 7 (explaining that Epstein “perpetuated [the] abuse in similar ways” against 
To the extent Defendants suggest that Epstein’s crimes against Jane Doe are not part of the 
same “event or occurrence” as those described in the Indictment because they began in 1999 (as 
opposed to 2002), this argument similarly fails.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 5.  The Indictment itself notes 
that Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy lasted “from at least in or about 2002,” and it is now 
apparent that the conspiracy began years earlier.  Indictment ¶ 2 (emphasis added).    
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 13 of 32

victims).  The Indictment was therefore not limited to neatly categorized events that happened on 
specified dates—it covered a sprawling sex-trafficking operation that occurred “over the course of 
many years” and affected an unspecified number of victims.  Id. ¶ 1. 
Defendants’ contention that the Indictment “does not refer to misconduct of the type that 
Plaintiff alleges here” is incorrect.  Defs.’ Mem. at 7.  The sex-trafficking operation that the 
Indictment described is precisely the same sex-trafficking operation that Plaintiff was lured 
into— the Complaint’s allegations as to the perpetrator, the locations, and the repeated sexual 
assaults all match the pattern described in the Indictment.  Just as the Indictment alleged that 
Epstein enticed and recruited “particularly vulnerable” females to engage in sex acts with him in 
New York and Palm Beach, Indictment ¶¶ 3, 6, Epstein enticed and recruited Plaintiff, a 
particularly vulnerable young woman, to engage in sex acts with him in New York and Palm 
Beach.  Compl. ¶¶ 37, 40–42.  Just as the Indictment alleges that the abuse would start out with 
the victim performing a massage on Epstein, Indictment ¶¶ 9, 15, recruiters initially called Plaintiff 
to Epstein’s home to give him a massage.  Compl. ¶ 40.  The Indictment alleges that Epstein would 
escalate the nature and scope of physical contact during the massages to include sex acts, 
Indictment ¶¶ 9, 15, and Epstein escalated the nature and scope of Plaintiff’s massages to include 
sex acts.  Compl. ¶¶ 40, 41.  The Indictment alleges that Epstein used sex toys on victims during 
massages, Indictment ¶¶ 9, 15, and Epstein repeatedly used sex toys on Plaintiff during massages.  
Compl. ¶ 41.  And, finally, just as Epstein’s associates would call victims by phone to arrange for 
them to return for additional sexual encounters, Indictment ¶ 11, Epstein’s associates called 
Plaintiff frequently to schedule more sexual massages.  Compl. ¶¶ 40, 46.  The conduct alleged in 
the Indictment is precisely the conduct alleged in the Complaint. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 14 of 32

Defendants have the audacity to make a stunning contention that Plaintiff does not 
sufficiently allege that she was a sex-trafficking victim.  Defs.’ Mem. at 7.  Defendants may be 
unfamiliar with the definition of sex trafficking: “the recruitment, harboring, transportation, 
provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex 
act.”  22 U.S.C. § 7102.  Epstein and his co-conspirators recruited Plaintiff and housed her in his 
apartment building for the sole purpose of sexually abusing her, without ever helping her find a 
modeling job as he had promised.  Compl. ¶¶ 40, 45, 46.  She is therefore unquestionably a victim 
of sex trafficking.  Defendants’ desperate attempt at severing Plaintiff’s experience from the vast, 
sophisticated sex-trafficking operation alleged in the Indictment fails. 
3. 
Defendants’ Attempts to Narrow the Scope of C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a) Fail. 
Defendants seek to advance a strained interpretation of § 215(8)(a)’s “event or occurrence” 
requirement, asserting that this Court must “apply C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a) narrowly” to limit its 
availability to the specific crimes committed against the specific victims identified in the 
Indictment.  Defs.’ Mem. at 6.  But the cases that Defendants cite for that proposition are 
inapposite.  In Christodoulou v. Terdeman, the Second Department held that § 215(8)(a) “applies 
only to those claims which are based on events of February 26, 1993 and December 28, 1993, 
because it was only in connection with events of these two days that criminal prosecution was 
commenced against defendant.”  262 A.D.2d 595, 595 (2d Dep’t 1999).  Similarly, in Gallina v. 
Thatcher, the court held that the plaintiff could not rely on § 215(8)(a) to file a civil suit for assault 
and battery that occurred over the course of two years because the indictment “charged [the 
defendant] for incidents occurring on three (3) specific dates.”  No. 2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. 
LEXIS 8435, at *3–4 (Sup. Ct. Oct. 23, 2018). 
Christodoulou and Gallina are both readily distinguishable from Plaintiff’s case.  The 
criminal actions in Christodoulou and Gallina focused on events that occurred on specified dates 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 15 of 32

(two dates in Christodoulou and three dates in Gallina), and both Christodoulou and Gallina 
explicitly recognized that the relevant criminal prosecutions were commenced “only in connection 
with the events of these [specific] days.”  See Christodoulou, 262 A.D.2d at 596; Gallina, 2018 
N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435, at *3–4.  By contrast, the Indictment in this case was not limited to a 
specific day or discrete event.  Rather, the Indictment covered sexual abuse that occurred “over 
the course of many years.”  Indictment ¶¶ 1–2, 8, 20, 24.  Further, the Indictment charged Epstein 
with conspiracy and a broad sex-trafficking scheme, while the criminal actions in Christodoulou 
and Gallina charged the defendants with crimes stemming from isolated incidents.3 
In contrast, the Second Circuit’s opinion in Kashef controls and demonstrates why 
Plaintiff’s claims fall within § 215(8)(a) here.  In Kashef, BNP Paribas (“BNPP”) entered a guilty 
plea conceding “knowledge of the atrocities being committed in Sudan and of the consequences 
of providing Sudan access to U.S. financial markets.”  Kashef, 925 F.3d at 56.  The plaintiffs, 
Sudanese victims of mass rape, torture, deliberate infection with HIV, and other atrocities, filed a 
complaint against BNPP within a year of the judgment of conviction, contending that their claims 
were timely under C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a).  Id. at 57, 62–63.  BNPP attempted to argue—similar to 
Defendants’ argument here—that § 215(8)(a) did not apply because the plaintiffs “played no role 
in the proceedings surrounding BNP Paribas’s plea agreement,” the criminal action “required no 
investigation of or briefing on any injuries sustained by Plaintiffs,” and the facts in the criminal 
case and the civil case were not “identical.”  Brief of Defendants-Appellees at 51–52, Kashef 
v. BNP Paribas S.A., No. 18-1304 (2d Cir. Aug. 9, 2018), Dkt. 92. 
Defendants also cite McElligott v. City of New York, No. 15 CIV. 7107 (LGS), 2017 WL 
6210840, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2017), but that case is inapplicable because it hinged on whether 
the defendant in the civil action was the same defendant charged in the criminal action.   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 16 of 32

The Second Circuit rejected BNPP’s argument, and instead found that the “event or 
occurrence” for § 215(8) purposes was more generally “BNPP’s conspiracy with Sudan to violate 
U.S. sanctions” for humanitarian violations.  925 F.3d at 62–63.  The Court therefore held that the 
victims of those humanitarian violations could bring timely claims under § 215(8)(a).  Id.  That 
conspiracy, like the one here, was a broad scheme spanning many years, rather than a single event 
(such as an assault on a specified date).  Just as BNPP’s conspiracy to violate sanctions was the 
relevant event or occurrence in Kashef, Epstein’s widespread sex-trafficking scheme is the event 
or occurrence at issue in Plaintiff’s case for the purposes of applying § 215(8)(a).  Defendants 
attempt to distinguish Kashef by pointing out that “the civil and criminal actions in that case both 
arose out of the same conspiracy between BNP and Sudan to violate U.S. sanctions,” Defs.’ Mem. 
at 8, but that fact only highlights Kashef’s applicability to this case, which also involves a civil and 
criminal action arising from the same conspiracy.  Defendants have failed to meet their burden of 
proving that Plaintiff’s claims do not arise from the same event or occurrence as the Indictment, 
and therefore that § 215(8)(a) does not apply to her claims.4 
B. 
Plaintiff’s Claims are Timely Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c  
Plaintiff’s claims are also timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c.  That provision provides 
victims of rape or criminal sexual acts (and other delineated sexual offenses) 20 years to bring a 
civil action for resulting injuries: 
Defendants argue that a narrow reading of § 215(8)(a) “gives meaning to the statute’s 
language ‘with respect to the event or occurrence from which a claim governed by this section 
arises.’”  Defs.’ Mem. at 8.  But Plaintiff is not asking, for example, for the Court to hold that any 
person with a tangential connection to Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation may avail of § 215(8)(a).  
Rather, the Court should hold that Plaintiff’s claims in this matter arise from the same “event or 
occurrence” as the Indictment because the perpetrator is the same, the location is the same, and, 
most importantly, the pattern of misconduct is the same.   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 17 of 32

Notwithstanding any other limitation set forth in this article, . . . all civil claims or 
causes of action brought by any person for physical, psychological or other injury 
or condition suffered by such person as a result of conduct which would constitute 
rape in the first degree as defined in section 130.35 of the penal law, . . . or criminal 
sexual act in the first degree as defined in section 130.50 of the penal law, . . . may 
be brought . . . within twenty years.  
N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c.5  Plaintiff alleges that Epstein sexually assaulted her by forcible 
compulsion at some point after late 1999, within 20 years of the filing of this lawsuit, and that the 
assault constituted one or more sex crimes listed in § 213-c.  Compl. ¶¶ 13, 38, 46, 51.  Her claims 
are therefore timely under § 213-c. 
Without citing any case supporting their argument, Defendants contend that the 20-year 
statute of limitations of § 213-c does not apply to Plaintiff’s claims because it became effective 
through an amendment on September 18, 2019, and the amendment does not apply retroactively.  
Defs.’ Mem. at 5.  But New York courts have not adopted any such rigid rule prohibiting the 
retroactivity of statutory amendments to limitations periods.  Instead, “[c]ourts have employed 
customary tools of construction to find the requisite intent to give retroactive effect to new laws 
affecting periods of limitation.”  McGuirk v. City Sch. Dist. of Albany, 116 A.D.2d 363, 365 (3d 
Dep’t 1986).  Using those tools, New York courts have held that certain amendments to limitations 
periods apply retroactively.  See, e.g., Meegan S. v. Donald T., 475 N.E.2d 449, 450 (N.Y. 1984) 
(“[T]he enlargement of the Statute of Limitations for paternity suits is to be applied 
retroactively.”). 
“A person is guilty of rape in the first degree when he or she engages in sexual intercourse 
with another person . . . [b]y forcible compulsion” and “is guilty of criminal sexual act in the first 
degree when he or she engages in oral sexual conduct or anal sexual conduct with another 
person . . . [b]y forcible compulsion.”  N.Y. Penal Law §§ 130.35, 130.50.   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 18 of 32

The text and legislative history of § 213-c demonstrate the New York Legislature’s intent 
for the 20-year limitations period to apply retroactively.  First, the text of the provision itself says 
that it applies “notwithstanding any other limitation set forth in this article.”  N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c 
(emphasis added).  “[T]his article” refers to Article 2 of Chapter 8 of the C.P.L.R., which contains 
New York’s statutes of limitation for civil actions, see N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 201, suggesting that the 
Legislature intended for no other statute of limitations to apply. 
Further, the bill’s legislative history highlights the “ticking clock” that the former statute 
of limitations imposed on victims of sexual abuse:  “For crimes of sexual violence in particular, 
the clock ticks against the trauma and culture of silence that prevents victims from speaking out.  
Over the last year, victims who have suffered in silence for decades have bravely spoken about 
their abuse . . . .”  N.Y. Comm. Rep., 2019 N.Y. S.B. No. 6574, 242nd Legis. Sess. (June 17, 2019).  
The Legislature’s explicit reference to “victims who have suffered in silence for decades,” like 
Plaintiff, and victims that have been prevented “from speaking out,” also like Plaintiff, evince an 
intent for the provision to apply retroactively to victims like Plaintiff.  Governor Cuomo echoed 
the sentiment behind the provision while signing the bill, explaining that “[f]ive years is an insult 
to these survivors and today we’re providing them more time to come to terms with the trauma 
they experienced and to seek justice.”  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-
joined-leaders-times-movement-signs-legislation-extending-rape-statute (last visited March 30, 
2020) (emphasis added).  In light of the legislative goals behind the amendment to § 213-c, the 
Court should hold that it applies retroactively to Plaintiff’s claims. 
Moreover, “remedial legislation should be given retroactive effect in order to effectuate its 
beneficial purpose.”  In re Gleason (Michael Vee, Ltd.), 749 N.E.2d 724, 726 (N.Y. 2001).  
Legislative history establishes that the amendment to § 213-c was remedial in nature—it extended 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 19 of 32

the statute of limitations for certain sexual offenses in order to correct the injustice that the shorter 
limitations period imposed on victims.  See Coffman v. Coffman, 60 A.D.2d 181, 188 (2d Dep’t 
1977) (“Remedial statutes are those designed to correct imperfections in prior law, by generally 
giving relief to the aggrieved party.”  (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Meegan S., 475 
N.E.2d at 450 (finding that amendment extending statute of limitations in paternity suits was 
remedial legislation); https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-joined-leaders-times-
movement-signs-legislation-extending-rape-statute (last visited March 30, 2020) (“This new law 
recognizes the injustice that has gone on for far too long . . . .”).  “[I]nsofar as remedial statutes 
are concerned, the court should consider the mischief sought to be remedied and should favor the 
construction which will suppress the evil and advance the remedy.”  Burrows v. Bd. of Assessors 
for Town of Chatham, 98 A.D.2d 250, 253 (3d Dep’t 1983) (internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted), aff’d, 473 N.E.2d 748 (N.Y. 1984).  The remedial purpose of the amendment to § 213-c, 
to correct the injustice of providing victims of rape and other criminal sexual acts who were 
prevented from speaking out by their abusers (like Plaintiff) with only five years to bring actions, 
would be undermined if the amendment were only applied prospectively.  Plaintiff’s claims are 
therefore timely under § 213-c’s 20-year limitations period. 
C. 
Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden of Proving that Plaintiff 
Cannot Invoke Equitable Estoppel. 
Even if the Court were to hold that C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a) and § 213-c do not apply to 
Plaintiff’s claims, it should hold that they are still timely under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  
The Complaint alleges in detail the methods of intimidation and control that Jeffrey Epstein and 
his co-conspirators used to deter their victims from seeking justice.  Epstein went to great lengths 
to threaten and manipulate not only countless victims, but journalists, officials at the highest levels 
of our government, and others charged with preventing and punishing sex trafficking.  Plaintiff 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 20 of 32

had every reason to believe that filing this suit during Epstein’s lifetime would have had severely 
negative (even life-threatening) consequences for her.  She therefore did not take action until after 
she knew that Epstein was dead, and timely filed her claim approximately three months later.   
Defendants’ contend that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies only to situations in 
which the defendant makes a misrepresentation of fact.  Defs.’ Mem. at 10–11.  But “courts have 
long had the power, both at law and equity, to bar the assertion of the affirmative defense of the 
Statute of Limitations where it is the defendant’s affirmative wrongdoing—a carefully concealed 
crime here—which produced the long delay between the accrual of the cause of action and the 
institution of the legal proceeding.”  Gen. Stencils, Inc. v. Chiappa, 219 N.E.2d 169, 171 (N.Y. 
1966).  A defendant is therefore equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense 
if the defendant “wrongfully induced the plaintiff to refrain from timely commencing an action by 
deception, concealment, threats or other misconduct.”  Funk v. Belneftekhim, No. 14-CV-0376 
(BMC), 2019 WL 3035124, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 11, 2019) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). 
Assuming the truth of the allegations in Plaintiff’s Complaint and drawing all inferences 
in her favor, Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded misconduct that should equitably estop Defendants 
from asserting a statute of limitations defense.  Plaintiff was terrified of Epstein and his 
co-conspirators.6  For example, Epstein constantly bragged to Plaintiff about his connections to 
powerful people like Leslie Wexner and made countless representations about his wealth, power, 
and connections.  Compl. ¶¶ 39, 40, 44.  Epstein also forced Plaintiff to meet with a powerful 
lawyer so that the lawyer could gather personal information about Plaintiff.  Id. ¶ 43.  Defendants 
In fact, Plaintiff is still terrified of Epstein’s powerful co-conspirators, which caused her to 
file this lawsuit under pseudonym.  See Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for 
Leave to Proceed Anonymously at 4–5, Dkt. 7 (Nov. 20, 2019).   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 21 of 32

discount this allegation because it happened during the time period when Epstein was abusing 
Plaintiff.  Defs.’ Mem. at 10.  But Defendants conveniently leave out Plaintiff’s allegation that 
“Epstein later used the information that the lawyer had obtained through his meeting with Jane 
Doe to intimidate her and to keep her compliant in his sex-trafficking scheme.”  Compl. ¶ 43.  That 
allegation therefore directly supports Plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel argument.  Epstein also ensured 
that Plaintiff, who struggled financially for her entire life, became dependent on him so that she 
would remain compliant and keep quiet about the abuse.  He provided her with things she 
desperately needed, like housing and the prospect of future employment opportunities.  Compl. 
¶¶ 37, 39, 40, 45.  This manipulation contributed to Plaintiff’s silence until Epstein’s death. 
Plaintiff’s allegations are more than sufficient to allow her claims to proceed under an 
equitable estoppel theory at this early stage of the litigation.  “[A] complaint does not need to 
anticipate potential affirmative defenses, such as the statute of limitations, and to affirmatively 
plead facts in avoidance of such defenses.”  Childers, 36 F. Supp. 3d at 315 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted).  Further, “[w]hether equitable estoppel applies in a given case is 
ultimately a question of fact.”  Kosakow v. New Rochelle Radiology Assocs., P.C., 274 F.3d 706, 
725 (2d Cir. 2001).  Courts applying New York law have therefore reserved the highly factual 
issue of equitable estoppel for summary judgment after discovery or for a jury.  See, e.g., Gotlin 
v. Lederman, No. 05-CV-1899 (ILG), 2006 WL 1154817, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2006) (“A 
vast majority of the cases on equitable estoppel permit plaintiffs to defeat a motion to dismiss on 
the pleadings, deferring the question until some discovery can be had.”).7  Defendants have failed 
In another victim’s action against the Estate, the court recognized that the doctrines of 
equitable estoppel and equitable tolling are “very fact specific” and accordingly asked Defendants 
to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss prior to discovery.  Transcript of Pre-Motion Conference 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 22 of 32

to meet their burden of proving that Plaintiff can prove no set of facts demonstrating her 
entitlement to equitably estopping Defendants from asserting a statute of limitations defense. 
D. 
Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden of Proving that Plaintiff 
Cannot Invoke Equitable Tolling. 
Plaintiff’s claims are also timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling.  While equitable 
estoppel focuses on a defendant’s affirmative misconduct, equitable tolling focuses on the plaintiff 
and applies as a matter of fairness where the plaintiff has been “prevented in some extraordinary 
way from exercising [her] rights.”  Flight Sci., Inc. v. Cathay Pac. Airways Ltd., 647 F. Supp. 2d 
285, 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  In this case, Plaintiff’s 
fear of retaliation prevented her from filing her claims prior to Epstein’s death.  
Defendants’ contention that Plaintiff has not alleged any facts supporting equitable tolling 
is incorrect.  Defs.’ Mem. at 9.  A “reasonable fear of retaliation may be sufficient to constitute 
extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling, particularly if the person threatening 
retaliation is a defendant.”  Davis v. Jackson, No. 15-cv-5359, 2016 WL 5720811, at *11 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016).  The Davis court’s reasoning also applies in this context.  The court 
reasoned that fear of retaliation could support equitable tolling in the prison context because 
“sustained control tends to result in adverse psychological effects that invariably have behavioral 
consequences” such as, among other things, “interpersonal distrust and suspicion of threat or 
personal risk; . . . diminished sense of self-worth and personal value; and posttraumatic stress 
at 3:4-8, Farmer v. Indyke, et al., No. 19-cv-10475 (LGS) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2020), Dkt. 39 (“[T]he 
doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling could, nevertheless, save the claims and make 
them timely and that is very fact specific, or early in the case I presumed there will be factual 
issues around those questions . . . .”). 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 23 of 32

reactions to the pains of imprisonment.  Retaliation and fear of retaliation are natural consequences 
of this unique psychological environment.”  Id. at *10 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Epstein’s pattern of controlling, manipulating, and intimidating his victims caused similar 
psychological effects in his countless victims, which in turn caused severe fear of retaliation.  And 
Plaintiff alleges that Epstein’s abuse and psychological manipulation had such effects on her.  
Compl. ¶¶ 40, 44, 46–48.  The court should therefore extend equitable tolling to reach fear of 
retaliation in the context of Epstein’s abuse of and control over his victims, including Plaintiff. 
In any event, as with equitable estoppel, “when plaintiffs raise an equitable tolling 
argument, a court must deny a motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations unless all 
assertions of the complaint, as read with required liberality, would not permit the plaintiffs to prove 
that this statute was tolled.”  In re S. African Apartheid Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d 228, 287 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009).  Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss and to proceed to 
discovery on the issue of equitable tolling.  See, e.g., Brown v. Parkchester S. Condos., 287 F.3d 
58, 60–61 (2d Cir. 2002) (evidentiary hearing appropriate to determine whether limitations period 
was equitably tolled); Guobadia v. Irowa, 103 F. Supp. 3d 325, 341 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (equitable 
tolling “is a question appropriately reserved for a jury” due to “genuine issues of material fact”); 
Childers, 36 F. Supp. 3d at 315 (holding that plaintiff did not need to plead facts establishing right 
to equitable tolling).  Defendants have failed to meet their burden of proving that Plaintiff can 
prove no set of facts demonstrating entitlement to equitable tolling in this case. 
II. 
The Court Should Deny the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Punitive 
Damages. 
Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law 
is incorrect.  Not only are such damages available, they are warranted in this case.  Beyond the 
procedural impropriety of Defendants’ purported motion to dismiss punitive damages—that on its 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 24 of 32

own warrants its denial—under New York choice-of-law principles the law of the Virgin Islands 
applies to the issue of punitive damages.  Under Virgin Islands law, a court may allow for punitive 
damages against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor, especially when that tortfeasor went to great 
lengths during his life to avoid punishment for causing immeasurable harm to countless victims.  
A. 
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Punitive Damages is Procedurally 
Improper. 
As an initial matter, the Court should not decide whether punitive damages are available at 
this early stage.  A motion to dismiss is not the proper vehicle for determining the availability of 
punitive damages.  Rule 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to file a motion to dismiss for “failure to state 
a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Accordingly, “[a] motion to 
dismiss is addressed to a ‘claim’—not to a form of damages.”  Amusement Indus., Inc. v. Stern, 
693 F. Supp. 2d 301, 318 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).  Defendants’ request for the Court to dismiss 
Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages does not relate to either of Plaintiff’s claims (for battery 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress) and does not relate to the sufficiency of the 
allegations in the Complaint.  The issue of what types of damages Plaintiff is entitled to should 
therefore be dealt with at a later stage.  See, e.g., Hunter v. Palisades Acquisition XVI, No. 16 Civ. 
8779 (ER), 2017 WL 5513636, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2017) (“Because punitive damages are a 
form of damages, not an independent cause of action, a motion to dismiss a prayer for relief in the 
form of punitive damages is procedurally premature.” (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted));  Okyere v. Palisades Collection, LLC, 961 F. Supp. 2d 522, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (same). 
B. 
Plaintiff May Recover Punitive Damages in this Case.  
Even if a motion to dismiss punitive damages was an adequate way to address this issue, 
Defendants’ motion still fails.  Plaintiff may recover punitive damages because the Virgin Islands 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 25 of 32

has the strongest interest in whether punitive damages are available in this case.8  And, under 
Virgin Islands law, Plaintiff can recover punitive damages.    
1. 
The Law of the Virgin Islands for Punitive Damages Governs Under New 
York’s Choice-of-Law Principles. 
Federal courts look to the choice-of-law rules of the forum state in deciding choice-of-law 
disputes.  See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941).  “In the context of 
tort law, New York utilizes interest analysis to determine which of two competing jurisdictions 
has the greater interest in having its law applied in the litigation.  The greater interest is determined 
by an evaluation of the facts or contacts which relate to the purpose of the particular law in 
conflict.”  Padula v. Lilarn Prop. Corp., 644 N.E.2d 1001, 1002 (N.Y. 1994) (internal quotation 
marks and alterations omitted).  New York courts seek “[j]ustice, fairness and the best practical 
result.”  Babcock v. Jackson, 191 N.E.2d 279, 283 (N.Y. 1963). 
“Punitive damages are conduct regulating,” and “[u]nder the doctrine of depecage, then, 
the choice-of law analysis for punitive damages is distinct from the analysis for compensatory 
damages.”  Nat’l Jewish Democratic Council v. Adelson, No. 18 Civ. 8787 (JPO), 2019 WL 
4805719, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2019).  While the law of the place of the tort generally applies 
to conduct regulating law, “under New York law—for punitive damages in particular—a court 
must consider the object or purpose of the wrongdoing to be punished and give controlling weight 
to the law of the jurisdiction with the strongest interest in the resolution of the particular issue 
presented.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  “Punitive damages are designed 
As explained below, under the doctrine of depecage New York law still governs as to the 
underlying claims and as to compensatory damages. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 26 of 32

to punish the defendant, not to compensate the plaintiff, and so the choice-of-law inquiry for 
punitive damages provisions is necessarily ‘defendant-focused.’”  Id. 
Although Defendants correctly note that the law of the jurisdiction of where the tort 
occurred generally applies, Defs.’ Mem. at 12, in this case the Virgin Islands has a stronger interest 
in the resolution of whether punitive damages can be awarded in this case than New York or 
Florida.  This being a “defendant-focused” analysis, Adelson, 2019 WL 4805719, at *6, the Virgin 
Islands’ interest in applying its law on punitive damages is greater than New York’s.  Epstein was 
domiciled in the Virgin Islands, not New York or Florida.  Compl. ¶ 19; see also Schultz v. Boy 
Scouts of Am., Inc., 65 N.Y.2d 189, 201 (1985) (holding that, although New York was the place 
of the wrong, New Jersey law applied because it “would further [New Jersey’s] interest in 
enforcing the decision of its domiciliaries to accept the burdens as well as the benefits of” New 
Jersey law).  Epstein also had a private island in the Virgins Islands, where he abused countless 
young females.  Compl. ¶ 24.  Defendants then chose to probate his Estate in and under the laws 
of the Virgin Islands.  Id. ¶ 32.  Having availed themselves of all the benefits and protections that 
Virgin Islands probate and estate law have to offer, Defendants cannot also seek to escape its 
drawbacks.  Whereas the Virgin Islands has a strong interest in applying its law on punitive 
damages, New York and Florida have no conceivable interest in denying the Virgin Islands from 
advancing that interest.  As such, New York’s choice-of-law rules dictate the application of Virgin 
Islands law to the issue of punitive damages.9 
As an indication of the Virgin Islands’ interest in matters concerning Epstein’s Estate, the 
Attorney General of the United States Virgin Islands filed suit against the Estate on January 15, 
2020, seeking, among other things, punitive damages.  Complaint, GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein, No. ST-20-CV-014 (V.I. Sup. Ct. Jan. 15, 2020), Dkt. No. 1.

2. 
Virgin Islands Law Would Allow for Punitive Damages against 
Defendants in this Case. 
Virgin Islands law would allow for an award of punitive damages in this case.  When 
determining how best to apply common law, courts in the Virgin Islands apply what is known as 
the Banks analysis.  See Gov’t of the V.I. v. Connor, 60 V.I. 597, 600, 602 (2016); Banks v. Int’l 
Rental & Leasing Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 979 (2011).  As part of the Banks analysis, the Virgin Islands 
Supreme Court has “instructed that, instead of mechanistically following the Restatements, courts 
should consider three non-dispositive factors to determine Virgin Islands common law: 
(1) whether any Virgin Islands courts have previously adopted a particular rule; (2) the position 
taken by a majority of courts from other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, which approach 
represents the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands.”  Connor, 60 V.I. at 600 (internal quotation 
marks omitted).  Under the Banks analysis, given the extraordinary nature of this case, Plaintiff 
can pursue punitive damages against Defendants.  
a. 
Banks Factor One: Whether Any Virgin Islands Courts Have 
Adopted a Rule 
Virgin Islands courts have not adopted a rule as to whether a plaintiff can pursue punitive 
damages against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor who went to great lengths to avoid punishment 
for his crimes, including by taking his own life.  Although Defendants cite to the Second 
Restatement of Torts’ position that punitive damages are not awarded against the representatives 
of a deceased tortfeasor, Defs.’ Mem. at 13–14, that position is included only in commentary and 
is not binding on Virgin Islands courts.  See Connor, 60 V.I. at 600 (instructing not to 
“mechanistically” follow the Restatements).  And although some Virgin Islands trial courts have 
cited to the Restatement, those courts were not faced with the question at issue in this case:  
whether punitive damages are available against an estate.  See, e.g., Pappas v. Hotel on the Cay 
Time-Sharing Ass’n, Inc., 69 V.I. 3, 6 & n.8 (V.I. Super. 2015) (citing the Restatement in a case 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 28 of 32

that did not involve an estate); Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 (Super. Ct. 
2009) (“[P]unitive damages are not available in wrongful death actions in the Virgin Islands.”).  
Defendants have not cited a single Virgin Islands case adopting the Restatement’s commentary’s 
position on that specific issue.  Given the lack of any established rule in the Virgins Islands 
governing this case, this Banks factor is neutral.  
b. 
Banks Factor Two: The Position Taken by a Majority of Courts 
from Other Jurisdictions  
As to the second Banks factor, numerous courts have held that plaintiffs may recover 
punitive damages against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor.  See, e.g., Haralson v. Fisher 
Surveying, Inc., 31 P.3d 114, 117 (Ariz. 2001) (concluding that “there are situations in which it 
would be appropriate, and perhaps even necessary, to express society’s disapproval of outrageous 
conduct by rendering such an award against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor” (internal quotation 
marks omitted)); Tillett v. Lippert, 909 P.2d 1158, 1162 (Mont. 1996) (rejecting “the reasoning of 
those courts which have disallowed punitive damages against the estates of deceased tortfeasors”); 
Perry v. Melton, 299 S.E.2d 8, 12 (W. Va. 1982) (“Punitive damages in this state serve other 
equally important functions and are supported by public policy interests going beyond simple 
punishment of the wrongdoer.”).  Those courts have reasoned that punitive damages do not only 
serve to punish wrongdoers, but also to “motivate others not to engage in similar action in the 
future.”  Kaopuiki v. Kealoha, 87 P.3d 910, 928 (Haw. Ct. App. 2003).10  In this case, general 
See also, e.g., Ellis v. Zuck, 546 F.2d 643, 644–45 (5th Cir. 1977) (punitive damages 
allowed against estate because they provide “deterrents to others similarly situated from taking 
steps of the character condemned”); Estate of Farrell ex rel. Bennett v. Gordon, 770 A.2d 517, 
521–22 (Del. 2001) (punitive damages available against estate because they “serve a dual 
purpose—to punish wrongdoers and deter others from similar conduct” (internal quotation marks 
omitted)); Hofer v. Lavender, 679 S.W.2d 470, 474 (Tex. 1984) (exemplary damages available 
against estate because they “serve as an example to others”).   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 29 of 32

deterrence is of the utmost importance—Epstein spent decades abusing countless young women 
and girls, intimidating them into silence, and gaming the justice system with his wealth and power 
to avoid punishment.  No person should be able to commit such acts while at the same time 
considering themselves to be above the law. 
Even courts that generally do not allow for punitive damages against a deceased 
tortfeasor’s estate have expressly acknowledged that punitive damages might be available where, 
as here, the deceased tortfeasor takes his own life “as an escape from punitive damages.”  Crabtree 
ex. Rel. Kemp v. Estate of Crabtree, 837 N.E.2d 135, 139 (Ind. 2005) (“If we ever encounter a case 
where a tortfeasor seems to have considered his own death as an escape from punitive damages 
incident to some intentional tort, we can address that issue at that time.”).  Here, it is undisputed 
that punitive damages would have been available against Epstein if he were still alive.  But Epstein 
spent his life using his power, wealth, and intimidation to avoid proportionate punishment for his 
countless crimes.  See Compl. ¶¶ 8, 14.  And once he was finally imprisoned pending trial for his 
sex-trafficking operation, he signed his will and then almost immediately caused his own demise.  
See id.  ¶¶ 30, 31.  Given the unique facts surrounding Epstein’s crimes and death, and the need to 
deter others from committing such heinous crimes against vulnerable victims and then using power 
to avoid the consequences, the second Banks factor weighs heavily in favor of allowing for punitive 
damages under these facts. 
c. 
Banks Factor Three: The Soundest Rule for the Virgin Islands  
Although none of the three Banks factors is dispositive, the third factor—“which approach 
represents the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands”—is the most important.  See Connor, 60 V.I. 
at 600.  The soundest rule for the Virgin Islands is to allow for punitive damages against an estate 
in circumstances as extraordinary as those in this case.  Here, the deceased tortfeasor spent his life 
avoiding punishment, used wealth, power, intimidation, and threats to prevent his victims from 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 39     Filed 03/30/20     Page 30 of 32

seeking justice, and then caused his own demise once he was about to face real punishment for his 
countless crimes.  Allowing for punitive damages in this case would be in line with the general 
deterrence principle behind punitive damages because it would deter others from manipulating the 
justice system and silencing victims of sexual abuse to avoid punishment.  See, e.g., Guardian Ins. 
Co. v. Gumbs, No. ST-15-CV-195, 2016 WL 9525609, at *10 (V.I. Super. Aug. 22, 2016) (“[A] 
primary purpose behind punitive damages [is] . . . to further deter [the tortfeasor] and others like 
him from similar conduct in the future.”).  The rule would also be consistent with the cases 
suggesting that punitive damages against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor may be available if the 
tortfeasor committed suicide to avoid punishment.  The absence of any Virgin Islands case 
adopting the Restatement’s commentary about punitive damages against estates, coupled with the 
extraordinary nature of Epstein’s transcontinental sex-trafficking enterprise, counsel in favor of 
such a rule.11  The Court should therefore deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss punitive damages.    
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s 
Complaint.  Because Defendants seek to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint in full, Plaintiff requests 
oral argument on Defendants’ motion. 
To the extent necessary, United States courts may certify questions to the Supreme Court 
of the Virgin Islands if there is “a question of law which may be determinative” and if “it appears 
there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Supreme Court.”  Banks, 55 V.I. at 972 
(internal citations omitted).  Because the issue would be a matter of first impression in the Virgin 
Islands, and given the split in common law authorities concerning the availability of punitive 
damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate, the Court should certify the question to the 
Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands if it deems it necessary to resolve the issue at this stage of the 
case.  See CIT Bank N.A. v. Schiffman, 948 F.3d 529, 537 (2d Cir. 2020), certified question 
accepted, No. 36, 2020 WL 729773 (N.Y. Feb. 13, 2020) (certifying questions where no precedent 
from state’s highest court is available, and the state court was better situated to make “value 
judgments and important public policy choices”).

The Co-Executors1 submit this reply memorandum of law in support of their motion to 
dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF No. 1). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
In her opposition brief, Plaintiff effectively asks the Court to depart from well-established 
law to resuscitate her claims that expired fifteen years ago.  First, Plaintiff asks the Court to 
disregard basic principles of statutory interpretation and numerous cases applying CPLR 
§ 215(8)(a) by holding that, unless a criminal indictment expressly rules out that it arises from the 
same event as a civil action, a plaintiff in the civil action may invoke that rule to revive a time-
barred claim.  Second, Plaintiff asks the Court to disregard Second Circuit authority holding that 
it is Plaintiff’s burden to allege “extraordinary circumstances” to toll the statutes of limitations.  
Third, while conceding that courts generally apply the law of the place of a tort to the issue of 
punitive damages, Plaintiff nonetheless urges this Court to create a new rule whereby, if an alleged 
tortfeasor’s will is being probated in a jurisdiction that has nothing to do with the tort, the law of 
the probate jurisdiction should apply.  Plaintiff’s requests are baseless.   
ARGUMENT 
A.
Plaintiff has the procedural burden backwards: she fails to meet her burden to allege 
facts sufficient to invoke an extraordinary exception to the statute of limitations. 
1.
Plaintiff is unable to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a) because she fails to present a 
criminal indictment that arises from Decedent’s alleged conduct towards her.  
Plaintiff’s central premise in arguing for application of CPLR § 215(8)(a) to this action, 
notwithstanding the Indictment charges sex-trafficking of minors while Plaintiff alleges she was 
abused by Decedent as an adult, is that the “pattern described in the Indictment matches 
[Plaintiff’s] experience.”  (Op. Br. p. 4.)  Even assuming that is correct, it does not render CPLR                  
Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Co-Executors’ moving brief (ECF 
No. 34). 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 6 of 15

§ 215(8)(a) applicable.  Rather, to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a), Plaintiff is required to establish the 
Indictment and this action arise from the same “event or occurrence”—i.e., what Decedent 
allegedly did to her.  Plaintiff fails to do this. 
The Indictment has nothing to do with Plaintiff, even if it concerns her alleged abuser and 
describes a “pattern” similar to what she described.  There is no legal authority that permits a civil 
Plaintiff to interpret CPLR § 215(8)(a) in such an open-ended manner.  Plaintiff’s assertion that 
the Indictment “was not restricted to minors” (Op. Br. p. 6) defies a plain reading of it.  Plaintiff’s 
reliance on an FBI press release (id. at 6-7) is unconvincing in light of the language in the 
Indictment itself: it alleges that Decedent sexually trafficked “minor girls” (Compl., Ex. A at ¶ 1), 
stating throughout that it concerns sex trafficking of “minors” (id., Ex. A at ¶¶ 2-4, 6, 8, 11-15, 18-
20, 22). 
The cases cited in the Co-Executors’ moving brief confirm that, even where it is undisputed 
that the subject criminal indictment concerns the civil plaintiff and the same kind of conduct 
alleged in the plaintiff’s civil complaint, CPLR § 215(8)(a) still does not apply where the 
indictment and civil action arise from different events or occurrences—i.e., the express limitation 
set forth in the text of CPLR § 215(8)(a).  (See Op. Br. pp. 5-6.)  Plaintiff’s attempt to distinguish 
these cases on the ground that they “focused on events that occurred on specific dates” (id., p. 9) 
is based on Plaintiff’s dubious assertion that, because the Indictment at issue here “was not limited 
to a specific day or discrete event” (id., p. 10), anyone alleging she suffered the same type of 
misconduct described in the Indictment is free to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a).  Such a reading renders 
the limitation in CPLR § 215(8)(a) meaningless and does not comport with the rationale set forth 
in the cited decisions.  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 7 of 15

Plaintiff once again relies on Kashef v. BNP Paribas S.A., 925 F.3d 53 (2d Cir. 2019), 
notwithstanding that the Co-Executors already demonstrated that Kashef, which concerned a 
conspiracy between BNP and Sudan to violate U.S. sanctions, is factually distinguishable from 
this action.  (Mov. Br. p. 8.)  Plaintiff’s decision to cite Kashef again shows that she has not located 
any relevant authority to rebut the cases cited by the Co-Executors.     
2.
Plaintiff bears the burden to allege “extraordinary” circumstances; she fails to 
meet this burden.
Plaintiff misstates the burden with respect to equitable estoppel by asserting “Defendants 
have failed to meet their burden of showing that [she] will be unable to invoke equitable estoppel 
and … tolling.”  (Op. Br. p. 1.)  As explained in the Co-Executors’ moving brief, the burden is on 
Plaintiff to sufficiently allege “extraordinary circumstances” to invoke these doctrines.  (Mov. Br. 
pp. 8-11.) 
In her opposition brief, Plaintiff does not even attempt to address many of the cases that 
the Co-Executors cite on this point, including Abercrombie v. College, 438 F. Supp. 2d 243 
(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“without adequate pleading, the issue is not properly raised and therefore cannot 
defeat a motion to dismiss based on statute of limitations grounds”), and this Court’s decision in 
Fairley v. Collins, No. 09-CV-6894 (PGG), 2011 WL 1002422, at *4-6 (Mar. 15, 2011 S.D.N.Y.) 
(Gardephe, J.) (finding equitable tolling did not apply and granting defendants’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6) motion to dismiss complaint on statute of limitations grounds). 
Plaintiff fails to meet her burden.  In her opposition brief, Plaintiff attempts to paint a more 
detailed picture of why she waited 15 years to bring this action than she did in her Complaint.  
However, the Complaint is controlling.  In her Complaint, Plaintiff does not allege: any 
particularized acts by Decedent that prevented her from exercising her rights; that Decedent made 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 8 of 15

a misrepresentation to her and had reason to believe she would rely on it; or that she reasonably 
relied on any misrepresentation by Decedent to her detriment.    
Rather, excluding vague allegations concerning Decedent’s alleged misconduct directed at 
some unidentified set of alleged victims that does not include Plaintiff (see, e.g., Compl. ¶ 26 
(“[Decedent] … manipulate[d] his victims”), Plaintiff merely asserts the following allegations 
concerning events allegedly occurring in 1999: “Upon meeting [Plaintiff], [Decedent] offered her 
a position modeling with Victoria’s Secret . . . [Decedent] reiterated his connection to Victoria’s 
Secret each time he saw and spoke with [Plaintiff]” (id. ¶ 39); Plaintiff was “terrified of [Decedent], 
who repeatedly threatened her and made representations about his wealth, power, and connections” 
(id. ¶ 40); “On one occasion, [Decedent] forced [Plaintiff] to meet with a lawyer … and [Decedent] 
later used the information that the lawyer had obtained through his meeting with [Plaintiff] to 
intimidate her and to keep her compliant in his sex-trafficking scheme” (id. ¶ 43); “[Decedent] 
made very clear to [Plaintiff] that he was incredibly wealthy, powerful, and regularly in contact 
with world leaders … he had photographs displayed of significant political figures to ensure that 
any young female entering the home would know that he had extensive government connections 
… [Decedent] was not to be disobeyed and he made clear by his words and actions that there would 
be consequences if [Plaintiff] did not comply with his demands”  (id. ¶ 44); and “[Decedent] 
constantly promised [Plaintiff] modeling opportunities … up until the last time [Plaintiff] saw 
[Decedent]” (id. ¶ 45). 
These nebulous allegations do not constitute “exceptional” circumstances that justify 
permitting Plaintiff to pursue this action that expired 15 years ago.  Not a single case Plaintiff cites 
supports a finding that her allegations are “extraordinary.”  To the contrary, Funk v. Belneftekhim, 
No. 14-CV-0376 (BMC), 2019 WL 3035124 (E.D.N.Y. July 11, 2019), which Plaintiff cites, 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 9 of 15

confirms that her allegations fall short.  In that matter, the court found the plaintiffs “alleged 
extraordinary circumstances that could warrant the application of equitable tolling: they were 
drugged, kidnapped, flown to Belarus, held captive, and tortured for 383 and 483 days, 
respectively.”  Id. at *2.  There are no such allegations here.   
Other cases Plaintiff cites likewise support the conclusion she has not met her burden.  See
Gotlin v. Lederman, No. 05-CV-1899 (ILG), 2006 WL 1154817, at *30 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2006) 
(plaintiffs in medical malpractice action alleged defendants failed to provide them with, and 
intentionally and fraudulently attempted to discourage and prevent them from obtaining, their 
medical records); Gen. Stencils, Inc. v. Chiappa, 219 N.E.2d 169, 171 (N.Y. 1966) (plaintiff was 
allowed to invoke equitable estoppel against a bookkeeper who had used his position to carefully 
conceal his theft of the plaintiff’s money); Brown v. Parkchester S. Condos., 287 F.3d 58, 59 (2d 
Cir. 2002) (employee argued his medical condition prevented him from timely filing his 
complaint); Guobadia v. Irowa, 103 F. Supp. 3d 325, 341 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (plaintiff filed her 
lawsuit less than a year after leaving a home where she was allegedly forced to work without pay 
as a servant).  Other cases Plaintiff cites do not even address the issues on this motion.2
Plaintiff’s reliance on Davis v. Jackson, No. 15-CV-5359 (KMK), 2016 WL 5720811, at 
*11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016)—to support her assertion that reasonable fear of retaliation “may 
be sufficient” to warrant equitable tolling (Op. Br. p. 17)—is misleading.  In that action, the court 
granted a pro se prisoner leave to allege facts sufficient to show he pursued his claims with 
reasonable diligence.  Id. at *39.  However, the court was very clear that its findings were based 
on plaintiff’s incarceration and pro se status.  See id. at *35, 39 (“in the prison context, reasonable 
See Ortiz v. Cornetta, 867 F.2d 146 (2d Cir. 1989) (fact issue was date on which pro se office received plaintiff’s 
complaint).
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 10 of 15

fear of retaliation may be sufficient”; “given Plaintiff’s pro se status … the Court is hesitant to 
dismiss [his] claims”).  Plaintiff is neither a prisoner nor pro se, so Davis is inapplicable.  
B.
CPLR § 213-c does not apply retroactively and is not a revival statute. 
Plaintiff’s invocation of CPLR § 213-c is erroneous.  The 20-year statute of limitations in 
CPLR § 213-c became effective as of September 18, 2019; the statute of limitations was 5 years 
as of 2006 and 1 year before then.  (L. 2006, ch. 3, § 5(b).)  The 20-year statute of limitations does 
not apply retroactively except “where the applicable statute of limitations in effect on the date of 
such act or omission has not yet expired.”  L. 2019, ch. 315, § 4.  Therefore, CPLR § 213-c neither 
applies retroactively nor revives Plaintiff’s claims, all of which expired nearly two decades ago. 
C.
This motion is proper and timely regardless of its title. 
Plaintiff’s argument that the Co-Executors may only move to strike her punitive damages 
claim (Op. Br. pp. 1, 19) is both wrong and irrelevant.  “[T]he technical name given to a motion 
challenging a pleading is of little importance … as prejudice to the nonmoving party hardly can 
result.”  See C. Wright & A. Miller, 5C Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1380 (3d ed.). 
Courts in this District regularly grant motions to dismiss punitive damages.  See, e.g., The 
Cookware Co. (USA), LLC v. Austin, No. 15-CV-5796, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177691, at *17 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2016) (Batts, J.) (granting motion to dismiss claim for punitive damages without 
leave to replead because allegations regarding defendant’s bad-faith conduct were conclusory and 
did not rise to the required level of malice); SJB v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 03-CV-6653 (NRB), 
2004 WL 1586500, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2004) (Buchwald, J.) (granting motion to dismiss 
punitive damages claims which were not statutorily available); Kunica v. St. Jean Fin., No. 97-
CV-3804 (RWS), 1998 WL 437153, at *8-9 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 1998) (Sweet, J.) (granting motion 
to dismiss claim for punitive damages because, even if conduct alleged in complaint was true, it 
did not rise to the level necessary to award punitive damages). 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 11 of 15

Courts in the Second Circuit, including in this District, also routinely grant motions to 
strike punitive damages including at the pleadings stage.  See, e.g., In re Merrill Lynch Auction 
Rate Sec. Litig., 851 F. Supp. 2d 512, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting defendant’s motion to strike 
sections of first amended complaint asserting punitive damages); Nash v. Coram Healthcare 
Corp., No. 96-CV-0298 (LMM), 1996 WL 363166, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 1996) (“The motion 
to strike the punitive damages prayer from the Complaint is Granted.”); Cerveceria Modelo, S.A. 
de C.V. v. USPA Accessories LLC, No. 07-CV-7998 (HB), 2008 WL 1710910, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. 
Apr. 10, 2008) (“Because Defendant has failed to allege that Plaintiff’s conduct was egregious and 
directed at the public generally, its claim for punitive damages cannot proceed.”).  Therefore, 
whether the Co-Executors’ motion is deemed one to dismiss or strike, the Court should dispose of 
Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim.3
D.
There is no basis to disregard black-letter New York law applying the law of the 
place of alleged torts to the issue of punitive damages. 
Plaintiff’s argument that “New York choice-of-law-rules” dictate the application of USVI 
law to the issue of punitive damages (Op. Br. p. 20) is wrong for two independent reasons.  First, 
Plaintiff alleges the acts and omissions giving rise to her causes of action occurred in New York 
and Florida.  (Compl. ¶¶ 40-42, 46.)  Therefore, New York and Florida law applies to the issue of 
punitive damages.  See Starr Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Am. Claims Mgmt., No. 14-CV-0463 (JMF), 
2015 WL 2152816, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2015) (“Because punitive damages are conduct-
3Plaintiff cites Amusement Indus. v. Stern, 693 F. Supp. 2d 301 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). However, that court acknowledged 
a plaintiff’s demand for punitive damages may be stricken where, as here, it is prohibited by law. Id. at 318 n.5 (citation 
omitted).  Further, neither that case nor the others Plaintiff cites in support of her argument that striking her punitive 
damages claim would be premature involve a prohibition on such claims such as EPTL §11-3.2(a)(1).  See Hunter v. 
Palisades Acquistion XVI, LLC, No. 16-civ-8779 (ER), 2017 WL 5513636, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2017) (defendant 
moved to dismiss plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages under her cause of action for conversion); Okyere v. Palisades 
Collection, LLC, 961 F. Supp. 2d 522, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (defendants alleged punitive damages were not available 
in the absence of malice and intent).  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 12 of 15

regulating, ‘the law of the jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply.’” (quoting 
Deutsch v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 723 F. Supp. 2d 521, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 2010)); Guidi v. Inter-
Continental Hotels Corp., No. 95-CV-9006 (LAP), 2003 WL 1846864, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 
2003)).  
Second, Plaintiff may not have the Court apply the first sentence of § 11-3.2(a)(1), 
permitting her to bring this case, but disregard the very next sentence precluding punitive damages.  
At least one New York federal court expressly rejected such an “anomalous situation.”  See Blissett 
v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996) (“[I]t would be an anomalous situation 
indeed if plaintiff were allowed to proceed with this … action … because of [§] 11-3.2(a)(1), while 
at the same time he was allowed to recover … punitive damages.”). 
Plaintiff’s premise used to gin up a purported connection to the USVI in this action—that 
Decedent “chose to probate his Estate” there and had allegedly abused other victims (but not 
Plaintiff) there (Op. Br. p. 21)—is specious.  Plaintiff sues for damages based on torts that occurred 
in New York and Florida.  Further, she chose to sue in New York.  Therefore, the Court should 
reject Plaintiff’s assertion that “[w]hereas the [USVI] has a strong interest in applying its law on 
punitive damages, New York and Florida have no conceivable interest in denying the [USVI] from 
advancing that interest.”  (Id. p. 21).  The USVI has no interest in applying its punitive damages 
laws in a case brought by a non-USVI resident who alleges torts that took place in New York and 
Florida.   
The sole connection to the USVI is that the Decedent’s Estate is being probated there, 20 
years after the alleged tortious conduct took place—a connection much weaker than the one 
deemed “tenuous” in Nat’l Jewish Democratic Council v. Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d 416 (S.D.N.Y. 
2019), on which Plaintiff relies.  Even under the framework of Adelson, New York, not the USVI, 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 13 of 15

has the greater interest in applying its laws and policies concerning Plaintiff’s improper claim for 
punitive damages.   
Plaintiff also misinterprets Adelson.  In Adelson, the National Jewish Democratic Council 
and its chair sued Sheldon G. Adelson for damages based on Adelson’s prior filing of a defamation 
suit against them in the same court pursuant to Nevada law.  Id. at 421.  The court had dismissed 
Adelson’s prior action under Nevada’s anti-SLAPP statute, which has its own punitive damages 
provision.  Id. at 421, 426.  In the action against Adelson, the court held that Nevada had a much
stronger interest in applying its punitive damages law because Adelson had tried to use Nevada’s 
defamation law to chill First Amendment rights.  Id. at 426.  By contrast, “New York’s interest 
[was] relatively attenuated” in the second action because “[i]ts sole connection to this suit [was] 
that the suit was filed here.”  Id.  Here, the situation is effectively the opposite, given the strong 
New York connection. 
E.
Even if USVI law applies, which it does not, it follows the majority rule prohibiting 
recovery of punitive damages against a tortfeasor’s estate.  
Plaintiff does not dispute that New York law bars her punitive damages claim.  Should the 
Court find New York law applies (it does), then Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim should be 
dismissed.  Even if the Court finds USVI law applies to Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim (it does 
not), the result is the same.  USVI courts apply a “Banks analysis” to determine U.S.V.I. common 
law, including consideration of: (1) whether USVI courts previously adopted a particular rule; (2) 
the position taken by a majority of other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, which approach 
is the soundest rule for the USVI.  Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Connor, No. S. CT. CIV. 2013-0095, 
2014 WL 702639, at *1 (V.I. Feb. 24, 2014).  The Banks factors show that USVI courts would 
adopt the majority rule that punitive damages are not available against a deceased tortfeasor’s 
estate: (1) previously, USVI courts favorably cited the Restatement section barring punitive 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 40     Filed 04/13/20     Page 14 of 15

damages against estates, see, e.g., Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 (D.V.I. 
2009); Booth v. Bowen, No. CIV. 2006-217, 2008 WL 220067, at *5 (D.V.I. Jan. 10, 2008) 
(considering the inverse issue); (2) a majority of U.S. jurisdictions preclude awards of punitive 
damages based on wrongful acts of decedents, see 2 Linda L. Schlueter, Punitive Damages § 20.4 
(7th ed. 2015) (“[A] majority of jurisdictions will not award punitive damages against a deceased 
tortfeasor’s estate.” (citation omitted)); and (3) post-Banks, USVI have found the Restatement 
§ 908 is “the soundest rule,” Pappas v. Hotel on the Cay Time-Sharing Ass’n, 69 V.I. 3, 15 n.8 
(U.S.V.I. Super. Ct. 2015) (citing Davis v. Christian, 46 V.I. 557 (D.V.I. App. Div. 2005).  See 
also Isaac v. Crichlow, 63 V.I. 38, 2015 WL 10568556 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2015); St. Thomas House, 
Inc. v. Barrows, 15 V.I. 435 (V.I. Terr. Ct. 1979); Brandy v. Flamboyant Inv. Co., Ltd., 24 V.I. 
249 (V.I. Terr. Ct. 1989); Thomas v. Rijos, 780 F. Supp. 2d 376, 380 (D.V.I. 2011).4
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth above and in the Co-Executors’ moving brief, the Co-Executors 
respectfully request that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint, together with such other and 
further relief the Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff argues that the USVI A.G.’s request for punitive damages in a USVI Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act lawsuit against Decedent’s Estate shows the third Banks factor weighs in Plaintiff’s favor.  
However, that the USVI A.G. asks for something in a lawsuit is not legal authority.  See Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 
914, 940 (2000).

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
MARY DOE, 
Plaintiff,  
-v-  
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
and SARAH VICKERS, 
Defendants. 
Civ. 10758 (PAE) 
OPINION & ORDER 
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:  
In this diversity action, plaintiff Mary Doe1 brings tort claims under New York law 
against, inter alia, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, the executors of the estate of Jeffrey 
Epstein (“Indyke and Kahn” or “the executor defendants”).  The executor defendants now move 
to dismiss Doe’s claim against them for punitive damages, on the grounds that, as a matter of 
New York law, such damages are categorically unavailable in a personal injury action against the 
personal representative of an estate.2  For the reasons that follow, the Court grants that motion.  
I. 
Background 
A. 
Doe’s Complaint 
Doe’s Complaint, filed on November 20, 2019, alleges a horrific course of sexual and 
psychological abuse at Epstein’s hands during 2004 and 2005.  Cmplt. ¶¶ 1–15 (summary 
account); id. ¶¶ 38–106 (detailed account).  It alleges that Doe came to the United States with her 
Doe has been granted leave to proceed pseudonymously.  Dkt. 21. 
Doe also sues Sarah Vickers, who is alleged to have served as Epstein’s scheduler and assistant.  
See Dkt. 1 (Complaint, or “Cmplt.”) ¶ 19.  Doe’s bid for punitive damages against Vickers is not 
implicated by this motion.  
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 1 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 44-1   Filed 04/28/20   Page 1 of 17

parents as a young refugee from a war-torn country, and was working in pursuit of a promising 
career as a model when, in 2004, at age 16, she met Epstein through another model.  Id. ¶ 2.  
Epstein made clear to Doe how important and powerful he was and promised to help her with her 
modeling career and college admissions.  Id. ¶ 3.  Doe, in turn, “believed she could trust him” 
and “that he could change her life.”  Id. ¶ 4.  Epstein, however, “used his power over Mary to 
sexually abuse her, viciously and repeatedly.”  Id. ¶ 5.  Aided by defendant Sarah Vickers, 
Epstein’s scheduler and assistant, Epstein “would summon Mary to his Manhattan townhouse, 
order her to give him massages, and then subject her to sexual acts, the severity of which 
increased over time.”  Id.; see also id. ¶ 19.  The Complaint graphically chronicles Epstein’s acts 
of sexual abuse in the townhouse, which included forcing Doe to perform oral sex on him and 
later raping her.  Id. ¶¶ 7–9; 56–105.  
In late 2005, the Complaint alleges, Doe—as a result of an incident at the townhouse—
“suddenly saw the truth: she was not even a human being to Epstein, she was an object,” and 
Epstein was treating her as a prostitute, “one of many girls he treated as sexual objects.”  Id. 
¶ 11.  Doe had a breakdown, almost immediately thereafter left New York City, returned to her 
parents’ home across the country, and never saw Epstein again.  Id. ¶ 12.  Epstein’s abuse caused 
Doe to abandon her modeling career and left her humiliated, angry, and suicidal, with debilitating 
panic attacks and “dramatic psychological scars.”  Id. ¶¶ 13–14.  Epstein’s arrest in July 2019 
gave Doe “brief[] hope that he might finally face consequences,” but his death in August 2019 at 
a federal jail in Manhattan “left Mary with the desolate sense that he has evaded justice yet 
again.”  Id. ¶ 15. 
In this action, Doe brings claims, under New York law, of battery, id. ¶¶ 108–13, assault, 
id. ¶¶ 114–19, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress, id. ¶¶ 120–27, against Indyke 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 2 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 44-1   Filed 04/28/20   Page 2 of 17

and Kahn, solely in their capacities as executors of Epstein’s estate, id. ¶ 18, and against Vickers, 
for her “integral role in operating Epstein’s operation of sex trafficking Mary and other girls,” id. 
¶ 19.  As its basis for personal jurisdiction over the executors, it alleges that “Epstein was subject 
to personal jurisdiction at the time of his death,” id. ¶ 22, “because the tortious acts giving rise to 
Plaintiff’s claims took place in New York State,” id. ¶ 23.  The Complaint seeks, in addition to 
compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees and costs, “punitive damages in an amount to be 
determined at trial.”  Id. p. 19. 
B. 
The Executors’ Partial Motion to Dismiss 
 On January 21, 2020, the executor defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss, Dkt. 17, 
and a supporting memorandum of law, Dkt. 18 (“Def. Mem.”).  It sought dismissal of the prayer 
for punitive damages on the ground that such damages cannot, as a matter of New York law, be 
sought against the personal representatives of an estate.  On March 3, 2020, Doe filed a 
memorandum of law in opposition, Dkt. 28 (“Doe Opp’n”), and a supporting declaration by 
Daniel Mullkoff, Esq., Dkt. 29 (“Mullkoff Decl.”), which attached Epstein’s will.  On March 20, 
2020, the executor defendants filed a reply.  Dkt. 33 (“Def. Reply”). 
II. 
Applicable Legal Standards Under Rule 12(b)(6)  
To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must plead “enough 
facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 
550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim will only have “facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads 
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable 
for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  A complaint is 
properly dismissed where, as a matter of law, “the allegations in a complaint, however true, 
could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558.  When resolving a 
motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 3 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 44-1   Filed 04/28/20   Page 3 of 17

and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  Steginsky v. Xcelera Inc., 
741 F.3d 365, 368 (2d Cir. 2014).  That tenet, however, “is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”  
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  Pleadings that offer only “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic 
recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. 
III. 
Discussion 
 In moving to dismiss Doe’s prayer for punitive damages against them, the executor 
defendants argue that New York law applies to this personal injury action and categorically 
prohibits an award of punitive damages against the personal representatives of an estate.  
Specifically, they note, § 11-3.2(a)(1) of New York’s Estates, Powers and Trusts Law (“EPTL”) 
provides: 
No cause of action for injury to person or property is lost because of the death of 
the person liable for the injury.  For any injury, an action may be brought or 
continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but punitive 
damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought 
to recover damages for personal injury. 
EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1) (emphasis added).  
Applying this statute, courts have held punitive damages unavailable in personal injury 
actions against executors or administrators of estates.  These include federal courts determining 
the damages available for constitutional-tort claims under New York law, see, e.g., Graham v. 
Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (precluding, based on EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), 
punitive damages claims in § 1983 action against estate administrators, and noting that New 
York law is “very clear” on this point); Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996) 
(overturning, based on EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), jury’s punitive damages award in § 1983 case 
against estate, and noting “strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an 
estate on account of wrongful conduct of the decedent”), and state courts in personal injury 
actions governed by New York law, see, e.g., Gordon v. Nathan, 352 N.Y.S.2d 464, 464 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 4 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 44-1   Filed 04/28/20   Page 4 of 17

(1st Dep’t. 1974) (affirming dismissal of punitive damages claim because, under EPTL 
§ 11-3.2(a)(1), defendant’s death precluded recovery of punitive damages from personal 
representatives of estate); cf. Flaum v. Birnbaum, 582 N.Y.S.2d 853, 857 (4th Dep’t. 1992) 
(affirming denial of punitive damages in case against deceased executor; citing EPTL 
§ 11-3.2(a)(1) and the “strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an 
estate on account of the wrongful conduct of the decedent”).   
The law of a majority of states is in accord with EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), as reflected in the 
Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (1979) (“Punitive 
damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor[.]”); see also Doe 
Opp’n at 12 (acknowledging that “a majority of states do not permit punitive damages against 
estates”).  This majority rule aligns with “[t]he general rule under federal common law,” that “an 
action survives the death of a party insofar as it is remedial[,] and not penal[,] in nature.”  See, e.g., 
Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Exeter Holdings, Ltd. v. Haltman, No. 13 Civ. 5475 
(JS) (AKT), 2017 WL 9485707, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2017) (collecting cases), report and 
recommendation adopted, 2017 WL 3981299 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2017).   
The justification commonly given for precluding punitive damage awards against estates 
is that punishment and deterrence—the recognized bases for imposing punitive damages on a 
tortfeasor—are not advanced by imposing punitive damages on his or her estate.  As the New 
Mexico Supreme Court explained in adopting the majority rule:  “[P]unishment and deterrence 
are not accomplished by enabling recovery of punitive damages from the estate of deceased 
tortfeasors”; “[w]hen the tortfeasor cannot be punished for his culpable behavior, punitive 
damages no longer have the desired effect and, therefore, the victim loses the legal entitlement to

recover those damages.”  Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 871 P.2d 1343, 1351 
(N.M. 1994) (canvassing laws of other states). 
 Doe does not dispute that EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1) precludes punitive damages in a personal 
injury action under New York law.  Instead, Doe makes three arguments: (1) that defendants’ 
motion is premature, Doe Mem. at 4; (2) that defendants’ motion is improperly styled as a 
motion to dismiss, id. at 3; and (3) that the law of the United States Virgin Islands (“USVI”), not 
New York law, applies, and permits punitive damages against an estate, id. at 4–13. 
Doe’s first argument is quickly dispatched.  Doe cites cases where courts have declined 
to resolve motions to dismiss aimed at prayers for relief, finding such motions premature.  See id. 
at 4 (citations omitted).  But a review of these cases reflects that the motions in those cases were 
not based on categorical preclusions of punitive damages.  In contrast, where punitive damages 
have been unavailable as a matter of law, courts have not hesitated to dismiss prayers for such 
damages at the threshold.  See, e.g., Murtha v. N.Y. State Gaming Comm’n, No. 17 Civ. 10040 
(NSR), 2019 WL 4450687, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2019) (dismissing demand for punitive 
damages under the New York State Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”) because it “does not 
provide for punitive damages”); Rosen v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 18 Civ. 6670 (AT), 
2019 WL 4039958, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2019) (granting motion to dismiss demand for 
punitive damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the New York City 
Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”) where neither statute permitted a plaintiff to recover punitive

“precluded as a matter of law”); Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Ctr. v. Gen. Reins. Corp., 
No. 16 Civ. 2063 (CM), 2016 WL 5793996, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2016) (“In this case, the 
circumstances surrounding the denial of the insurance indemnification claim do not warrant the 
rare exception provided for punitive damages under a breach of contract claim.  For this reason,

14, 2004) (dismissing punitive damages claim because such damages are unavailable in § 1983 
actions against municipalities).  Provided that New York law applies to this action, this case, too, 
involves a categorical preclusion of such damages, under EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), that can be 
adjudicated at the threshold. 
Doe’s second argument is that the defendant-executors’ challenge is improperly brought 
as a motion to dismiss.  Doe Mem. at 3 & n.3.  There is divided case authority on this point.  
Courts, including in the cases cited above, have granted motions to dismiss prayers for such 
relief.  But others have declined to entertain such motions, stating that, “[b]ecause punitive 
damages are a form of damages, not an independent cause of action, a motion to dismiss a prayer 
for relief in the form of punitive damages is ‘procedurally premature.’”  Farina v. Metro. Transp.

961 F. Supp. 2d 522, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).   
The Court has no occasion to resolve this conceptual debate, because the executors’ 
motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) alternatively can be treated as a motion to strike under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f).  See C. Wright & A. Miller, 5C Federal Practice and 
Procedure § 1380 (3d ed.) (“[T]he technical name given to a motion challenging a pleading is of 
little importance inasmuch as prejudice to the nonmoving party hardly can result from treating a 
motion that has been inaccurately denominated a motion to strike as a motion to dismiss the 
complaint.”).  And under Rule 12(f), on a motion or sua sponte, a court may strike from a 
pleading an “insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous 
matter.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  Although motions to strike under Rule 12(f) are generally 
“disfavored and granted only if there is a strong reason to do so,” Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. 
Media, Inc., No. 09 Civ. 2227 (PAC), 2013 WL 1746062, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2013) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Roe v. City of New York, 151 F. Supp. 2d 495, 510 
(S.D.N.Y. 2001)); see also Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., 551 F.2d 887, 893 (2d 
Cir. 1976)), ample authority permits striking prayers for punitive damages where such relief is 
unavailable as a matter of law.  See, e.g., In re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Sec. Litig., 
851 F. Supp. 2d 512, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting motion to strike sections of complaint

necessary to sustain punitive damages award in case involving fraud and deceit); Ladenburg 
Thalmann & Co. v. Imaging Diagnostic Sys., Inc., 176 F. Supp. 2d 199, 207 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) 
(granting motion to strike punitive damages because complaint did not allege, inter alia, egregious 
conduct sufficient to sustain such an award); Brady v. Port. Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., No. 93 Civ. 1679 
(NG) (CLP), 1998 WL 724061, at *2–3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 1998) (granting motion to strike 
punitive damages claims on grounds that Port Authority was immune from such damages); Nash v. 
Coram Healthcare Corp., No. 96 Civ. 0298 (LMM), 1996 WL 363166, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 1996) 
(granting motion to strike prayer for punitive damages because complaint did not allege facts 
sufficient to support such damages in breach of contract case).   
Here, there is practical wisdom in treating defendant’s motion as one to strike, if doing so 
is necessary to enable the Court to resolve at the jump the viability of Doe’s prayer for punitive 
damages.  With numerous personal injury actions pending against the Epstein estate as a result of 
the recent enactment of the New York Child Victims Act, there is value in clarifying—for the 
parties and settlors—the damages available in actions where the law permits a sure answer on 
this point. 
Doe’s final argument is that USVI, not New York, law governs whether punitive 
damages are available.  Because this Court sits in New York, it applies a New York choice of 
law analysis to that question.  See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 
(1941); Md. Cas. Co. v. Cont’l Cas. Co., 332 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir. 2003) (“A federal court 
sitting in diversity applies the choice-of-law rules of the forum state.”).  “Where, as here, the 
claims sound in tort, New York courts apply an ‘interest analysis’ to determine choice-of-law 
issues.”  Golden v. Wyeth, Inc., No. 04 Civ. 2841 (JS), 2013 WL 4500879, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 20, 2013).  Under that analysis, punitive damages are considered to be conduct-regulating, 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 9 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 44-1   Filed 04/28/20   Page 9 of 17

and “the law of the jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply.” See, e.g., Starr 
Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Am. Claims Mgmt., Inc., No. 14 Civ. 0463 (JMF), 2015 WL 2152816, *3 
(S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2015) (quoting Guidi v. Inter-Cont’l Hotels Corp., No. 95 Civ. 9006 (LAP), 
2003 WL 1907901, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2003)); Bauta v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., No. 14 Civ. 3725 
(RER), 2019 WL 8060183, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2019).  Here, the torts alleged occurred 
entirely in New York.  The personal injury claims which Doe’s Complaint brings arise from 
sexual assaults and related conduct that, as alleged, occurred exclusively within New York 
City—in and around Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse.  
Doe counters by noting that, while this rule applies as a general matter, it may be overcome 
if there is good reason not to apply it.  Doe Mem. at 5 (citing Nat’l Jewish Democratic Council v. 
Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d 416, 424–25 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)).  In arguing that there is reason not to 
apply New York law to the punitive damages question here, Doe relies on the doctrine of dépeçage, 
under which courts may treat the choice of law analysis for one (or more) issues in a case––in 
this instance, the availability of punitive damages––as distinct from the rest of its analysis, here 
the applicability of New York law to Doe’s tort claims for compensatory damages.  Id.; see also 
2002 Lawrence R. Buchalter Alaska Tr. v. Phila. Fin. Life Assurance Co., 96 F. Supp. 3d 182, 
200 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Ally Fin. Inc., No. 11 Civ. 7010 (DLC), 
2012 WL 6616061, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2012).   
Doe argues that, although New York may have the greater interest in resolving issues 
relating to compensatory damages, the USVI, where the executors are domiciled and where 
Epstein’s will is to be probated, has the greater interest as to punitive damages, which, unlike 
compensatory damages, are defendant-focused.  Doe Mem. at 7–8.  Doe does not argue that the 
executor-defendants themselves merit punishment or are in need of deterrence.  Instead, Doe 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 10 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 44-1   Filed 04/28/20   Page 10 of 17

argues that Epstein’s decision to alter his will shortly before his suicide to provide that it would 
be probated in the USVI was strategically motivated.  She argues that his executors “should not 
be permitted to selectively avail themselves of certain benefits of USVI law but avoid those 
aspects of USVI law that they do not like.”  Id. at 7. 
The Court is unpersuaded.  Whatever benefits Epstein envisioned for his estate by virtue 
of probating his will in the USVI, Doe does not articulate any relevant to this litigation.  Other 
than conclusorily, Doe does not argue that the decision to probate Epstein’s will in the USVI will 
have any adverse bearing on a personal injury action brought against the estate in New York that 
involves tortious conduct in New York.  Doe does not argue, for example, that the probating of 
Epstein’s will in the USVI stands to insulate his assets from recovery from such a plaintiff, or 
otherwise impede her or others victimized in New York from recovering on meritorious claims.  
Doe’s point that the estate may prosper from being probated in the USVI is disconnected from 
her claims.3   
More fundamentally, Doe does not articulate any concrete interest that the USVI has in 
either vindicating the rights of a victim sexually abused in a Manhattan townhouse in 2004 and 
2005 or, specially relevant to punitive damages, in assuring that the perpetrator of that abuse is 
adequately punished and deterred.  In contrast, the Second Circuit has noted the strong interest 
that New York has with respect to “conduct-regulating” rules, including regarding damages, with 
respect to unlawful behavior within its borders: 
“If conflicting conduct-regulating laws are at issue, the law of the jurisdiction 
where the tort occurred will generally apply because that jurisdiction has the 
greatest interest in regulating behavior within its borders.”  Cooney v. Osgood 
If anything, the probating of the estate in the USVI may stand to benefit the estate’s creditors, 
and thereby potentially Doe, to the extent that an estate probated in the USVI may avoid the high 
estate-tax rates imposed by New York State.

Mach., Inc., 81 N.Y.2d 66, 72 (1993).  In Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian 
Bank, SAL[,] . . . we observed that, under New York law, when the jurisdictions of 
the conduct and injury are distinct, “it is the place of the allegedly wrongful 
conduct that generally has superior ‘interests in protecting the reasonable 
expectations of the parties who relied on the laws of that place to govern their 
primary conduct and in the admonitory effect that applying its law will have on 
similar conduct in the future.’”  [739 F.3d 45, 50–51 (2d Cir. 2013)] (quoting 
Schultz [v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc., 65 N.Y.2d 189, 198 (1985)]) (alterations 
omitted).  Here, the allegedly wrongful conduct . . .  took place in New York . . . .  
We therefore conclude that New York’s rules on fraud damages and negligent 
misrepresentation apply. 
AHW Inv. P’ship, MFS v. Citigroup, Inc., 661 F. App’x 2, 5 (2d Cir. 2016).  New York’s interest 
is also reinforced by the fact that Doe’s suit is timely only by virtue of the state’s recent 
enactment of the New York Child Victims Act, which temporarily revived time-barred suits.  See 
Cmplt. ¶ 107. 
That New York law governs the availability of punitive damages is further reinforced by 
Doe’s having sued the executor defendants under EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1).  It is problematic for her 
to cherrypick within that provision, invoking the part that authorizes a personal injury suit 
against an executor while disclaiming the balance, which delimits the recovery available in such 
a suit.4  See Blissett, 940 F. Supp. at 457 (“[I]t would be an anomalous situation indeed if 
plaintiff were allowed to proceed with this [§] 1983 action against the estate of Casey because of 
[§] 11-3.2(a)(1), while at the same time he was allowed to recover relief in the form of punitive 
damages, which clearly is beyond the scope of relief which that statute authorizes.”).  Such a 
result is also inconsistent with the doctrine of dépeçage, where one forum’s law is “applied to 
regulate certain issues arising from a given transaction or occurrence, while those of another 
system regulate the other issues.”  Schwartz v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., 492 F. Supp. 2d 308, 328 
Doe’s claims undisputedly all qualify as personal injury claims.  See N.Y. Gen. Constr. Law 
§ 37-a. (defining “personal injury” as including “an assault, battery, false imprisonment, or other 
actionable injury to the person either of the plaintiff, or of another”).  Doe does not argue 
otherwise.

539 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2008).  Here, Doe, in selectively drawing upon EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), seeks 
to invoke dépeçage to apply two different sets of laws to a single issue.  The doctrine does not 
invite such a result. 
Finally, Adelson, on which Doe relies in claiming that USVI law governs punitive 
damages, is inapposite.  Adelson had brought an earlier action in this District for defamation, in 
breach of Nevada law, against the National Jewish Democratic Council and its chair (together, 
“NJDC”).   Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d at 420–21.  That action had been dismissed pursuant to 
Nevada’s anti-SLAPP statute.  NJDC then sued Adelson, seeking punitive damages under that 
same Nevada statute.  Id.  On Adelson’s motion to dismiss the punitive damages prayer, Judge 
Oetken held that Nevada’s interest was stronger than New York’s as to punitive damages, 
because Adelson had brought the initial suit under Nevada law and because it had been 
dismissed under the Nevada SLAPP statute on which the NJDC now pursued punitive damages.  
He reasoned that “because the litigant has attempted to use Nevada’s defamation law to chill 
First Amendment rights, Nevada has a corresponding interest in punishing the litigant for 
maliciously invoking Nevada law and in deterring future litigants from doing the same.”  
Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d at 426 (citing Schultz, 65 N.Y.2d at 198).  Noting that “[p]unitive 
damages are designed to punish the defendant, not to compensate the plaintiff,” Judge Oetken 
explained that “the choice-of-law inquiry for punitive damages provisions is necessarily 
defendant-focused” in this way.  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Golden, 
2013 WL 4500879, at *3).  By contrast, Judge Oetken concluded that New York’s interest in the 
dispute was “relatively attenuated” and effectively limited to the fact that the suit was filed in 
federal district court in Manhattan where, notably, the claims were brought under Nevada 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 13 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 44-1   Filed 04/28/20   Page 13 of 17

defamation law.  “After all, New York lacks a particularized interest either in protecting 
defendants from liability under Nevada defamation law or in controlling the behavior of litigants 
who file in the federal courts.  And where the locus jurisdiction has a merely fortuitous 
relationship with the case, that jurisdiction’s interest in the case is minimal.”  Id. at 426–27 
(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Doe’s case in this District, in contrast to 
Adelson, does not build on a prior litigation in, or based on the law of, the USVI. 
In any event, the choice of law debate here appears academic.  That is because, while the 
USVI does not have a statute on point and USVI courts have not squarely resolved the issue, it is 
likely that USVI common law would not permit an award of punitive damages against an estate.  
In 2011, the USVI Supreme Court instructed courts to apply what it terms a “Banks analysis” to 
determine USVI common law.  This entails consideration of “three non-dispositive factors”: 
(1) whether any USVI court has previously adopted a particular rule; (2) the position taken by a 
majority of courts of other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, which rule represents the 
soundest rule for the USVI.  See Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Connor, 60 V.I. 597, 600 (2014); 
Matthew v. Herman, 56 V.I. 674, 680 (2012); Banks v. Int’l Rental & Leasing Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 
979 (2011).  The parties differ as to how these factors apply, but the executors’ assessment is the 
more persuasive. 
As to the first Banks factor, USVI courts have repeatedly cited the Restatement (Second) 
of Torts § 908 favorably.  Twice, albeit in dicta, they have expressly quoted the language in 
comment (a) to § 908 that bars an award of punitive damages against the estate of a decedent 
tortfeasor.  See Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 (D.V.I. 2009) (“Punitive 
damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor nor, ordinarily, in 
an action under a death statute.” (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (1979))

majority of jurisdictions, the Court finds that the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(2) 
represents the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands, and is in accord with local public policy.”).  
Doe has not cited any contrary authority. 
As to the second Banks factor, the parties agree that, consistent with the Restatement, 
most U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an award of punitive damages against a tortfeasor’s estate.  
See, e.g., Crabtree ex rel. Kemp v. Estate of Crabtree, 837 N.E.2d 135, 138 (Ind. 2005) (“[t]he

Claim for punitive damages in tort action as surviving death of tortfeasor or person wronged, 30

view appears to be that punitive damages may not be recovered against the estate of a deceased 
wrongdoer.”).  Doe notes that some jurisdictions (like New York) have adopted this result by 
The decisions in Hamilton and Booth were dicta on this point, because the executor in each 
case was the plaintiff, not the defendant.

statute while others have done so by court decision.  Doe Mem. at 12.  This distinction, however, 
does not appear germane to the Banks inquiry. 
As to the third Banks factor, the parties have not cited any evidence—beyond USVI 
courts having repeatedly cited Restatement § 908 with favor, including in the course of a Banks 
analysis—as to which rule would most soundly fit the USVI’s interests.  Beyond recognizing 
that USVI courts appear comfortable with the majority rule, the Court therefore cannot assign 
significant independent weight to this factor.  Doe notes that the USVI’s attorney general, in a 
separate lawsuit, is pursuing punitive damages against the Epstein estate based on alleged 
predations by Epstein in the USVI.  See Mullkoff Decl. Ex. B ¶¶ 307–10.  Doe further argues 
that because the only heir listed in Epstein’s will—his brother Mark Epstein—allegedly knew or 
had constructive knowledge of Epstein’s pattern of sexual abuse, it is just to deny him recovery 
from the estate by exposing the estate to punitive damages awards in cases such as hers.  Doe 
Mem. at 11.  But the decision by a government lawyer to attempt to obtain such damages in a 
high-profile case involving allegations of extreme conduct, or the alleged guilty knowledge of an 
heir in this case, do not speak to the question that the third Banks factor assays: which rule of law 
best durably serves the USVI’s interests.  The Court therefore has no basis to treats this Banks 
factor as countervailing, let alone outweighing, the first two. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons above, the Court grants the defendant-executors’ motion to dismiss the 
prayer for punitive damages against them.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to 
terminate the motion pending at docket 17.

Dear Judge Liman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action.  We write to 
further supplement the Co-Executors’ pending motion to dismiss (ECF Doc. 33) with the

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 15, 
Plaintiff,  
-v-  
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
Defendants. 
Civ. 10653 (PAE) 
ORDER 
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:  
In this diversity action, plaintiff Jane Doe 15 (“Doe”)1 brings claims of battery, assault, 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in 
their capacities as co-executors of the estate of Jeffrey Epstein.  These claims arise from Doe’s 
allegations of sexual trafficking and abuse perpetrated against her by Epstein in 2004, when she 
was age 15.  Doe alleges that Doe visited Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in New York City, 
where Epstein’s secretary photographed her and groomed her for future sexual exploitation; on 
Epstein’s behalf, the secretary later invited Doe to visit Epstein at his ranch in New Mexico, and 
arranged Doe’s visit.  See Dkt. 1 (“Cmplt.”) ¶¶ 2–4, 25–26, 30–37.  Epstein’s sexual abuse of 
Doe occurred during the visit to the New Mexico ranch that ensued.  Id. ¶¶ 5–6, 41–69. 
The defendants have filed a partial motion to dismiss, directed solely at Doe’s prayer for 
punitive damages.  They argue that New Mexico law governs Doe’s claims, and that under New 
Mexico law, punitive damages are unavailable in a personal injury action against the personal 
Doe has been granted leave to proceed pseudonymously.  Dkt. 22. 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 1 of 4

representative of an estate.  See Dkt. 18 (motion); Dkt. 19 (memorandum of law in support); 
Dkt. 34 (reply).  Doe opposes that motion.  Dkt. 29 (memorandum of law in opposition). 
The Court grants defendants’ motion.  The Court’s analysis substantially tracks the 
analysis in a memorandum and opinion it issued earlier this week granting a motion seeking the 
same relief in another case in which a plaintiff has brought the same personal injury claims 
against the executors arising from sexual abuse Epstein allegedly perpetrated on her.  See Mary 
Doe v. Indyke and Kahn, 19 Civ. 10758 (PAE) (“Mary Doe”); see id. Dkt. 38 (“Mary Doe Op.”) 
(issued April 28, 2020).  The Court here incorporates that decision by reference. 
In Mary Doe, Epstein’s abuse was alleged to have occurred in his Manhattan townhouse.  
The Court noted that the New York statute that authorizes personal injury actions against the 
personal representative of the decedent precludes punitive damages in such actions, see Mary 
Doe Op. at 4 (citing New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law (“EPTL”) § 11-3.2(a)(1)), and 
required dismissal of Mary Doe’s prayer for such damages, id. at 4–6.  The Court rejected Mary 
Doe’s counter-arguments: that defendants’ motion was premature, id. at 6–7, and improperly 
styled as a motion to dismiss, id. at 7–9, and that the law of the United States Virgin Islands 
(“USVI”), where Epstein’s estate is being probated, applies, and permits punitive damages 
against an estate in such an action, id. at 9–16.  As to the final argument, the Court noted that 
under New York choice-of-law rules, the substantive law of the location of the tortious conduct 
occurred generally applies as to punitive damages, and that there was no reason to depart from 
that rule here, id. at 9–14.  In any event, the Court held, it is likely that, as a matter of common 
law, the USVI—like New York, the majority of states, and Restatement (Second) of Torts 
§ 908—would not allow imposition of punitive damages on a tortfeasor’s estate, id. at 14-16. 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 2 of 4
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 45-1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 2 of 4

The parties in this case are represented by the same counsel as in Mary Doe, and make 
substantially the same arguments for and against dismissal.  The one variation is that, because 
Epstein’s abuse is alleged to have occurred at the New Mexico ranch, defendants argue that New 
Mexico law applies.  See Dkt. 19 at 2–6; Dkt. 34 at 5–8.  But that, defendants argue, does not 
change the result, because New Mexico common law as announced by the state supreme court, 
like EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), bars punitive damages in a personal injury action against a tortfeasor’s 
estate.  See Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 871 P.2d 1343, 1351–52 (N.M. 1994) 
(canvassing laws; noting that “punishment and deterrence are not accomplished by enabling 
recovery of punitive damages from the estate of deceased tortfeasors”; and adopting majority 
rule that “[w]hen the tortfeasor cannot be punished for his culpable behavior, punitive damages 
no longer have the desired effect and, therefore, the victim loses the legal entitlement to recover 
those damages”); see also Barbara R. as next friend of S.R. v. Couch, No. 03 Civ. 1225 (MCA) 
(WDS), 2006 WL 8443923, at *28 (D.N.M. Sept. 30, 2006) (citing Jaramillo and noting that 
“[t]he rationale behind this rule is that ‘to punish the estate ignores the central purpose of 
punitive damages, which is to punish the tortfeasor and to deter him from repeating the wrongful 
act”).  Doe, for her part, does not dispute that New Mexico law mirrors New York law.  Instead, 
in opposing dismissal, she makes the same three arguments as in Mary Doe.   
The Court again finds punitive damages unavailable as a matter of law and plaintiffs’ 
counter-arguments unavailing.  As to the third argument, relating to choice of law, unlike in 
Mary Doe, there is indeed room for debate about which jurisdiction’s law applies.  But the 
debate is between New York (where the grooming process began) and New Mexico (where the 
sexual abuse occurred).  And under either state’s law, imposition of punitive damages on the 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 4
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 45-1   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 4

Epstein estate is squarely prohibited.  Doe does not have any stronger argument than did Mary 
Doe that USVI law applies in her case, or, if it did, that it would permit such damages. 
The Court, accordingly, grants defendants’ motion to dismiss the prayer for punitive 
damages.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at Dkt. 18. 
SO ORDERED.

Re: 
Jane Doe 1000 v. Darren K. Indyke & Richard D. Kahn, 19-10577-LJL-DCF 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
We write on behalf of Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 in the above-captioned litigation. Pursuant 
to Individual Rule II.A and Local Civil Rule 37.2, Plaintiff respectfully requests a pre-motion 
conference on Plaintiff’s anticipated motion to compel Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard 
D. Kahn (1) to produce responsive documents from the Relevant Period as defined in Plaintiff’s 
discovery requests; (2) to produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s requests, not simply 
documents that directly mention Plaintiff’s name; and (3) to respond to Plaintiff’s interrogatories.1  
The Court has made clear that discovery in this case would not be stayed pending the approval of 
the claims administration program or a motion to dismiss absent a contrary order from the Court. 
See Tr. of Nov. 21, 2019 Conf. at 26:10–12.  Yet by failing to comply with their clear and 
unequivocal discovery obligations, including not producing a single document to date, Defendants 
are attempting to grant themselves a de facto stay of discovery.  Defendants have provided no basis 
for their delay. 
I. 
Background 
Plaintiff alleges that Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators operated a decades-long 
sex-trafficking scheme by which they recruited young women for sexual abuse.  Compl. ¶¶ 23–
26.  Plaintiff was one of those women.  Epstein and his associates trafficked her after seeing her 
modeling work in 1999, housed her in Epstein’s apartment building, and sexually abused her for 
several years.  Id. ¶¶ 38–46.  After years of suffering in silence due to fear, Plaintiff filed a 
complaint against Defendants on November 14, 2019. 
On January 28, 2020, Plaintiff sent Defendants a document preservation notice and 
identified various email accounts used by Jeffrey Epstein.  Exhibit A, Jan. 28, 2020 Document 
Preservation Notice.  Defendants responded on February 3, 2020, by stating that they were abiding 
by all of their discovery obligations, including their preservation obligations.  Exhibit B, Feb. 3, 
Pursuant to Individual Rule I.C., Plaintiff states that she conferred in good faith 
with Defendants about the issues raised in this letter by telephone on April 27, 2020.

2020 Letter from B. Moskowitz to S. McCawley.  Yet on the very same day, Defendants sent 
Plaintiff completely vacuous Rule 26 Disclosures. Defendants provided the name of one witness—
Plaintiff—and stated that they were not aware of any documents, ESI, or tangible things in their 
possession, custody, or control that they would use to support their defenses.  Exhibit C, Feb. 3, 
2020 Initial Disclosures of Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn.   
On March 10, 2020, Plaintiff served 79 Requests for Production (“RFPs”) and 18 
Interrogatories on Defendants (collectively, Plaintiff’s “discovery requests”).  In Plaintiff’s 
interrogatories, she again asked Defendants to identify potential witnesses, in addition to email 
accounts used by Epstein, telephone numbers used by Epstein, and other information to aid 
Plaintiff in identifying witnesses and the location of evidence necessary to prove her case.  On 
April 16, 2020, after Plaintiff provided Defendants a week-long extension, Defendants served 
responses and objections in which they failed to respond to a single Interrogatory (aside from 
identifying Plaintiff as a witness to her own abuse) and failed to produce a single document.  
Exhibit D, Defendants’ Apr. 16, 2020 Objections and Responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of 
Interrogatories; Exhibit E, Defendants’ Apr. 16, 2020 Objections and Responses to Plaintiff’s First 
Request for Production of Documents. 
On April 27, 2020, after sending Defendants a letter regarding the clear deficiencies in their 
responses and objections, Plaintiff met and conferred with Defendants for an hour and a 
half.  See Ex. F, Apr. 20, 2020 Letter from S. McCawley to B. Moskowitz. Defendants stated that 
they had not yet fully processed the ESI in their possession, had not run any searches on the ESI, 
and were not in a position to provide information about the ESI, despite having received Plaintiff’s 
document retention notice in January and Plaintiff’s discovery requests in March.  During the meet 
and confer, Plaintiff also explained her position on the relevance and necessity of each of her 
discovery requests, and offered to answer any questions that Defendants had about the relevance 
of any of her requests.  Defendants refused to accept the Relevant Period that Plaintiff defined in 
her discovery requests, and stated that they would only produce documents that reference Plaintiff.  
They also stated, without providing any legal basis for their position, that they would not produce 
anything relating to Epstein’s sex trafficking or abuse of other victims. 
As of today, May 7, 2020, Plaintiff has yet to receive a single document or piece of 
information responsive to any of her discovery requests, including the documents that specifically 
reference Plaintiff that Defendants agreed to produce.  The only information Defendants have 
provided to Plaintiff in the course of discovery is their statement that Plaintiff is a witness in this 
case.  Plaintiff has produced more than 10,000 pages of documents responsive to Defendants’ 
discovery requests to date, and has responded to all of Defendants’ interrogatories to the best of 
her ability. 
II. 
Defendants’ Objection to the Relevant Period is Improper. 
Defendants have improperly objected to the Relevant Period that Plaintiff defined in her 
discovery requests as January 1, 1999 to the present.  Without providing any legal basis for their 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 46   Filed 05/07/20   Page 2 of 5

position, Defendants contend that the relevant time period should be limited to the dates of 
Plaintiff’s abuse as alleged in the Complaint.2 
Under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, parties may obtain discovery 
“regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense.”  Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 26(b)(1).  “[R]elevance for the purposes of discovery is an extremely broad concept.”  Melendez 
v. Greiner, No. 01 CIV.07888 SAS DF, 2003 WL 22434101, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2003) 
(Freeman, J.). 
This case turns on (1) whether Jeffrey Epstein sexually trafficked and sexually assaulted 
Plaintiff and (2) whether Plaintiff’s claims are timely, an affirmative defense that Defendants have 
already raised in a motion to dismiss.  ECF No. 34.  Discovery from the Relevant Period as defined 
by Plaintiff is relevant to both Plaintiff’s claims and Defendants’ statute of limitations defense, 
and is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
Epstein’s sexual trafficking and assault of Plaintiff began in 1999 and lasted for several 
years.  But Plaintiff has reason to believe, based on publicly available documents, that Epstein and 
his co-conspirators began trafficking and sexually abusing young girls and women in the same 
manner that he trafficked and abused Plaintiff in the mid-1990s, and continued to do so up until 
the date of Epstein’s arrest on July 8, 2019.  Documents relating to the sexual trafficking and/or 
sexual assault of others at any point during that period would make the fact that Epstein trafficked 
and sexually assaulted Plaintiff, the key fact that Plaintiff bears the burden of proving in this case, 
more probable than it would be without such evidence.  See Fed. R. Evid. 401.  Plaintiff also bears 
the burden of proving Epstein’s intent to sexually assault her.  See Cerilli v. Kezis, 16 A.D.3d 363, 
364 (2d Dep’t 2005) (“The elements of battery are bodily contact, made with intent, and offensive 
in nature.”).  Evidence that he sexually trafficked and assaulted others would be directly relevant 
to proving such intent.  Such evidence would also likely be admissible at trial.  See Fed. R. Evid. 
415.   
Further, Defendants have raised a statute of limitations defense in this matter, ECF No. 34, 
and Plaintiff contends that they should be equitably estopped from doing so based on Epstein’s 
misconduct.  Compl. ¶ 15.  Although Plaintiff disagrees with Defendants’ interpretation of the case 
law, Defendants contend that to invoke equitable estoppel, Plaintiff bears the burden of proving 
that Epstein’s “conduct cause[d] her to delay bringing suit,” that Epstein “made a definite 
misrepresentation of fact, and had reason to believe that the plaintiff would rely on it,” and that 
“plaintiff reasonably relied on that misrepresentation.”  ECF No. 34 at 9–10.  Documents relating 
to Epstein’s misconduct after his abuse of Plaintiff ended could very well be relevant to equitable 
estoppel, including to whether Plaintiff reasonably relied on that misconduct in staying silent about 
her abuse until after Epstein’s death. 
The fact that Epstein and his co-conspirators carried out a global sex-trafficking operation, 
which directly injured Plaintiff, for 20 years does not mean that Plaintiff is not entitled to discovery 
about that operation.  Yet Defendants have taken that position and have not indicated any 
willingness to change it.  The Court should direct Defendants to search documents within their 
This is despite the fact that Defendants themselves served discovery requests on Plaintiff 
in which they defined the relevant time period as “the date on which you first learned of Decedent 
through the date of your responses to these requests.” 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 46   Filed 05/07/20   Page 3 of 5

possession, custody, or control from the Relevant Period as described in Plaintiff’s discovery 
requests—1999 to the present. 
III. 
Defendants Must Produce More than Documents That Explicitly Reference Plaintiff.   
In addition to their blanket objection to the production of documents from any year aside 
from the years during which Plaintiff was herself sexually assaulted, Defendants contend that they 
will only produce one category of documents: those that specifically mention Jane Doe 1000.  
Defendants have refused, without providing any legal basis for doing so, to produce any document 
that does not directly reference Plaintiff, regardless of the year.   
Defendant cannot broadly object to producing any documents that do not directly reference 
Plaintiff.  Documents relevant to Plaintiff’s claims and Defendants’ defenses go well beyond 
documents that reference Plaintiff.  The following is a small sampling of examples of relevant 
documents that would not necessarily mention Plaintiff: 
 As explained above, documents evidencing Epstein’s trafficking and sexual 
assaults of others, although not about Plaintiff herself, are directly relevant to 
whether he trafficked and sexually assaulted Plaintiff.   
 Epstein’s communications with his co-conspirators are likely to evidence the 
scheme by which Epstein recruited and abused Plaintiff, even if they do not 
specifically mention Plaintiff.  For example, documents in which Epstein and his 
co-conspirators discuss recruiting young models or arranging for their housing in 
Epstein’s apartment complex would corroborate Plaintiff’s allegations. 
 Documents relating to payments from Epstein to his employees are relevant to 
whether Epstein paid his employees to keep them quiet, and would be relevant in 
impeaching witnesses in this case. 
 Documents relating to Epstein’s silencing, intimidation, and manipulation of 
victims other than Plaintiff is relevant to establishing whether Plaintiff reasonably 
feared Epstein, which is relevant to Defendants’ statute of limitations defense and 
Plaintiff’s equitable estoppel theory. 
Plaintiff explained these theories of relevance during a meet and confer call with 
Defendants.  Without any legal basis, and while purporting to understand Plaintiff’s position, 
Defendants consistently maintained that they would not produce any document that does not 
directly mention Jane Doe 1000.  This position unwarranted, legally baseless, and unacceptable, 
and Defendants have not indicated that they are willing to change it.  The Court should direct 
Defendants to search for documents within their possession, custody, or control and not allow 
Defendants to unilaterally and arbitrarily limit their search to documents that reference Plaintiff’s 
name. 
IV. 
Defendants Must Respond to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories. 
Plaintiff served 18 interrogatories on Defendants, and Defendants failed to answer a single 
one, aside from listing Plaintiff as an “individual who may have knowledge concerning the issues 
in this lawsuit.”  Ex. D at 3.  Plaintiff asked Defendants to identify email accounts used by Epstein 
or his employees or agents on his behalf—Defendants provided no answer.  Id.  Plaintiff asked 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 46   Filed 05/07/20   Page 4 of 5

Defendants to identify telephone numbers used by Epstein or his employees or agents on his 
behalf—Defendants provided no answer.  Id. at 4.  Plaintiff asked Defendants to provide a list of 
Epstein’s employees in an effort to identify potential witnesses to Epstein’s abuse of Plaintiff and 
other victims—Defendants provided no answer.  Id.  This is despite the fact that Defendant Kahn 
was Epstein’s longtime accountant and likely knows who was on Epstein’s payroll.  This total 
failure to answer even basic questions about the location of documents and potential witnesses is 
egregious. 
When asked about their failure to respond to any interrogatories, in addition to raising their 
meritless objections to the Relevant Period and to producing information that does not relate 
directly to Plaintiff, Defendants stated that they do not have responsive information because 
Epstein is dead and Defendants do not know where to look for responsive information.  Defendants 
also drew a distinction between their capacities as Epstein’s lawyer and accountant, as opposed to 
their capacities as executors of his Estate, but could not give Plaintiff a clear answer as to their 
position on how that distinction affects their discovery obligations.  For example, Defendants’ 
counsel could not tell Plaintiff whether Darren Indyke—Epstein’s longtime lawyer who has ties to 
Epstein’s co-conspirators3—or Richard Kahn—Epstein’s longtime accountant who assisted him 
for years with both personal and professional accounting work—had ever been directly asked 
whether they know of any individuals who might have information about Plaintiff’s claims. 
Plaintiff still has no understanding of how Defendants have attempted to fulfill their 
discovery obligations, or of what documents or information are within their possession, custody, 
or control.  At this stage in the litigation, such opaqueness is unacceptable and a clear attempt by 
Defendants to avoid their discovery obligations in the hopes that the claims administration process 
comes to fruition.  But Defendants cannot unilaterally decide to stay this case.  The Court should 
direct Defendants to respond to Plaintiff’s interrogatories.

attorney over one of Leslie Wexner’s properties, and employed Lesley Groff as an executive 
assistant for his law practice.  See Julia La Roche et al., Jeffrey Epstein’s Lawyers Deeply Involved

Dear Mr. Moskowitz:  
This is a document preservation notice issued in connection with the above-captioned civil 
actions.  Please read this notice carefully and take all steps necessary to preserve all documents 
that might be relevant to this dispute.  You should take affirmative steps to suspend any automated 
deletion.  The documents covered by this notice are potentially subject to discovery and production 
in the above-captioned litigation and will be needed as evidence and/or to enable us to prepare 
fully to take your clients’ sworn testimony in a deposition and/or at a trial 
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26, you were required to identify “all 
documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in 
its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses.”  In your Initial 
Disclosures for Annie Farmer, Teresa Helm, and Juliette Bryant, however, you stated that “[a]t 
present, the Co-Executors are not aware of any such documents, electronically stored information, 
and tangible things.”  I assume that you mean that you are not aware that any “documents, 
electronically stored information, [or] tangible things” that would be supportive of your clients’ 
defenses.  If instead you are taking the position that your clients do not have possession, custody, 
or control over Mr. Epstein’s documents (including his electronically stored information), please 
state so in your reply so that we may bring that to the Court’s attention immediately.   
At the November 21, 2019, conference Judge Freeman stated:  “Counsel should know what 
their obligations are and those obligations are pretty clear under the law and counsel should take 
them seriously.  If you do not preserve evidence that should be preserved that you had a reason to 
believe was relevant to claims or defense in the case and that you didn’t take steps to preserve, 
there can be negative consequences down the road.”  Nov. 21, 2019, Hearing Tr. at 33:4-10.  The 
Court instructed that your preservation efforts should be “broad enough” to documents located at 
Mr. Epstein’s “multiple residences in multiple countries across the world.”

Dear Ms. McCawley:
As you know, we represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced actions
(the “Actions”).  We are writing in response to your letter dated January 28, 2020.
You state: “If … you are taking the position that your clients do not have possession, custody, or 
control over Mr. Epstein’s documents (including his electronically stored information), please 
state so in your reply so that we may bring that to the Court’s attention immediately.”  We have 
never taken that position.  Accordingly, there is nothing to raise with the Court.
Separately, we confirm that our clients are abiding by all of their discovery obligations including 
preservation obligations.  However, your list of subject matters is inappropriate because it is
argumentative, assumes many unproven facts not in evidence and is overly broad.1 Your 
interpretation of Local Rule 26.3 is likewise inappropriate; we defer to the rule itself.   
Very truly yours,
Bennet J. Moskowitz
Bennet J. Moskowitz
1It bears mentioning that counsel in another action against the Co-Executors previously attempted to 
extract positions from us concerning a similar list and, failing that, to obtain relief from Magistrate 
Freeman.  Such counsel obtained no such relief.  Nor was any relief necessary given our identical 
representation in that action that our clients are abiding by their preservation obligations.

FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES TO DEFENDANTS 
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as co-executors of the estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), by their attorneys, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
and 33, provide the following responses to Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000’s (“Plaintiff”) First Set of 
Interrogatories to Defendants (the “Interrogatories”).  
RESERVATION OF RIGHTS 
These responses are made solely for the purpose of and in relation to discovery in the 
above-captioned action. The Co-Executors submit these responses subject to, and without 
intending to waive, and expressly preserving: (i) any objections as to relevancy, materiality, 
competency, privilege and admissibility of any documents and information produced in discovery, 
including without limitation herein; and (ii) the right to object to any other discovery requests. The 
Co-Executors reserve their right to amend these responses if and when appropriate.  Further, these

Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 46-4   Filed 05/07/20   Page 2 of 16

SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS  
The Co-Executors object to Plaintiff’s definition of the term “Jeffrey Epstein” or “Epstein” 
on the grounds that, insofar as it includes “any entities owned or controlled by Jeffrey Epstein, any 
employee, agent, attorney, consultant, or representative of Jeffrey Epstein,” it is overbroad, unduly 
burdensome, vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors will interpret “Jeffrey Epstein” or 
“Epstein” as Jeffrey E. Epstein.  
The Co-Executors also object to Plaintiff’s definition of the term “Ghislaine Maxwell” or 
“Maxwell” on the grounds that, insofar as it includes “any entities owned or controlled by 
Ghislaine Maxwell, any employee, agent, attorney, consultant, or representative of Ghislaine 
Maxwell,” it is overbroad, unduly burdensome, vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors will 
interpret “Ghislaine Maxwell” or “Maxwell” as Ghislaine Maxwell.  
The Co-Executors also object to Plaintiff’s definition of the term “Massage” on the grounds 
that it is more expansive than the common use of the term and is inconsistent with the term’s usage 
in the Complaint. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES 
INTERROGATORY NO. 1 
List the names and addresses of all persons who are believed or known by You, Your 
agents, or Your attorneys to have any knowledge concerning any of the issues in this lawsuit, and 
specify the subject matter about which the witness has knowledge. 
RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds and to the extent that it 
calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work 
product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.  The Co-
Executors also object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither 
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also overly broad and 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 46-4   Filed 05/07/20   Page 3 of 16

unduly burdensome.  Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objection, the Co-Executors

is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 2

RESPONSE:  
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 2 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds it seeks “discovery about discovery,” which would result in unnecessary expense.  
Such matters are more appropriately and cost-effectively addressed in the context of the parties’ 
discussions regarding document discovery.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it calls for the production of information protected by the 
attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or 
protection from disclosure.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds 
and to the extent that it calls for the production of information outside their possession, custody,

Re: 
Jane Doe 1000 v. Indyke et al., Case No. 19-cv-10577 
Dear Bennet: 
I write on behalf of Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 in response to Defendants Darren K. Indyke 
and Richard D. Kahn, as co-executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate”), responses 
and objections to the Plaintiff’s discovery requests provided on April 16, 2020.  As you likely have 
anticipated, I specifically write in response to your total failure to respond to your discovery 
obligations.  I ask that we meet and confer about your lack of responses as soon as practicable.  
First, as you are aware, Plaintiff served eighteen interrogatories on Defendants.  You 
answered none of them; rather, each interrogatory is met with an assortment of boilerplate 
objections, ranging from objections to relevancy or “discovery about discovery” or assuming 
“facts not in evidence” (which is especially puzzling, given that the very purpose of discovery is 
to find such facts).  At best, these objections are deficient; at worst, they are meritless and 
borderline frivolous.   
Similarly, you have failed to adequately respond to most of Plaintiff’s document requests.  
Again, your objections are premised on conclusory objections, ranging from objections to 
relevancy and claims that certain documents are outside Defendants’ possession, custody, and 
control.  As part of your discovery obligations, “generalized objections that discovery requests are 
vague, overly broad, or unduly burdensome are not acceptable.”  Shanchun Yu v. Diguojiaoyu, 
Inc., 18-CV-7303, 2019 WL 6174204, *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 2019) (granting plaintiffs’ motion 
to compel discovery after defendants “raised repeated and rote objections to Plaintiffs’ document 
requests, [] refused to provide Plaintiffs any documents whatsoever, and []answered the 
interrogatories in [a] substantially similar fashion”); see also Harris v. Bronx Parent Housing 
Network, Inc., 18-CV-11681, 2020 WL 763740, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2020) (“Boilerplate 
objections that include unsubstantiated claims of undue burden, overbreadth and lack of relevancy, 
accompanied by a lack of document production or interrogatory response, are a paradigm of 
discovery abuse.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “A party resisting discovery

has the burden of showing specifically how, despite the broad and liberal construction afforded 
the federal discovery rules, each interrogatory is not relevant or how each question is overly broad, 
burdensome or oppressive . . . by submitting affidavits or offering evidence revealing the nature 
of the burden.”  Harris, 2020 WL 763740, at *2 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   
Second, your relevance objections are meritless.  All of Plaintiff’s requests are relevant.  
For example, please explain how documents relating to Jane Doe 1000 are not relevant to her 
claims or are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  See 
Request 1.  Epstein abused Plaintiff several times a week for years and housed her in one of his 
apartment buildings.  She is entitled to any documents that relate to her.  Plaintiff’s other requests 
are also directly relevant to her claims or the Estate’s affirmative defenses.  She is entitled to 
discovery, for example, about Epstein’s relationship with Les Wexner, Victoria’s Secret, or any 
other modeling connections about which Epstein lied (e.g., RFPs 15, 17, 39, 61, 64-69); any 
Epstein-affiliated attorney she was forced to meet with at Epstein’s direction (e.g., RFPs 54-55, 
57-59; Interrogatories 10, 17); Epstein’s communications with associates who were present in his 
homes when Plaintiff was abused (e.g., RFP 70); documents relating to the co-conspirators who 
helped Epstein recruit and abuse Plaintiff (e.g., RFPs 3, 4, 12, 25, 28, 29); and Plaintiff’s and 
Epstein’s travel to the places in which Epstein abused Plaintiff.  (e.g., RFPs 13, 14, 48-51; 
Interrogatory 6). 
Moreover, Plaintiff is entitled to know the breadth and nature the sex-trafficking operation 
that she was victimized by.  See Fed. R. Evid. 415 (“In a civil case involving a claim for relief 
based on a party’s alleged sexual assault or child molestation, the court may admit evidence that 
the party committed any other sexual assault or child molestation.”).  Plaintiff alleges that Epstein 
utilized his sex-trafficking operation to recruit and abuse countless young girls and women in a 
methodical and similar fashion.  Epstein’s recruitment, trafficking, and assault of other girls in the 
same way that he recruited, trafficked, and assaulted Plaintiff would make Plaintiff’s allegations 
more probable.  See Fed. R. Evid. 401.  Plaintiff’s discovery requests are therefore directly relevant 
to the allegations in her Complaint, or, at a minimum, are reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence. 
Third, your objections to certain of the time periods stated in the Requests are meritless for 
several reasons.  As explained above, Epstein’s other sexual assaults would be both relevant and 
admissible in this case, regardless of time period.  Further, you have raised a statute of limitations 
defense in Plaintiff’s case, and Plaintiff has made an equitable estoppel argument in response.  
Plaintiff is entitled to discovery relevant to her equitable estoppel theory, including but not limited 
to any threats or misrepresentations that Epstein made to Plaintiff to prevent her from filing this 
lawsuit, outside of the time period during which Plaintiff was physically abused by Epstein. 
Fourth, your objection to Plaintiff’s definition of Jeffrey Epstein as including “any entities 
owned or controlled by Jeffrey Epstein, any employee, agent, attorney, consultant, or 
representative of Jeffrey Epstein” is an improper attempt to narrow your discovery obligations in 
this matter.  Your objection directly contradicts the Local Rules of this Court, which define the 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 46-6   Filed 05/07/20   Page 3 of 4
BSF 

April 20, 2020 
Page 3
word “parties” as including a defendant’s “employees, partners,  . . . or affiliates.”  Local Rule 
26.3(c)(5).  Plaintiff’s definition is proper. 
Fifth, your responses and objections state many times that certain documents and 
information are outside of the Estate’s possession, custody, and control.  If that is the case, please 
explain what is and is not within the Estate’s possession and control.  For example, please explain 
in detail what computers, hard drives, email accounts, telephone records, or hard copy documents 
you have reviewed and provide a list of search terms that were used and specifically list what items 
you claim to not have access to. We know that Epstein at a minimum used the following email 
accounts: 
x jeffreye@mindspring.com; 
x jeeproject@yahoo.com; 
x jeevacation@gmail.com; 
x jepstein@revonet.com; 
x zorroranch@aol.com; 
x cecilia@ellmax.com; 
x cecilia.steen@gmail.com;  
x jeffrey.epstein@centurytel.net; and 
x epsteinj@wanadoo.fr   
Confirm that you have accessed and searched each of these accounts and provide the 
protocol used for the search.  In the alternative, if the Estate contends that information that is 
responsive to Plaintiff’s discovery requests was destroyed, provide all details relating to the 
destruction.   
Please let us know your availability for a meet and confer on the following dates and times:   
x Wednesday, April 22, 2020 between 2:00 and 3:00 EST; 
x Thursday, April 23, 2020 between 3:00 EST and 6:00 EST; and 
x Friday, April 24, 2020 between 3:00 EST and 5:00 EST.

Juliette Bryant, 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced actions 
commenced by Plaintiffs Jane Doe 1000, Teresa Helm and Juliette Bryant (the “Actions”).  
Plaintiffs filed a letter in each of the Actions yesterday seeking a pre-motion conference on 
Plaintiffs’ anticipated motions to compel, among other things, interrogatory responses (the 
“Letters”).  While we address threshold issues with the Letters below – primarily that they are 
premature and inconsistent with Your Honor’s individual rules and directions regarding the parties’ 
obligation to engage in meaningful efforts to resolve discovery issues before seeking the court’s 
intervention – one of Your Honor’s explicitly stated pet peeves – we respectfully request that the 
Court deny the requests for pre-motion conferences as an unnecessary waste of the Court’s time.  
Alternatively, the Co-Executors request permission to submit a response to the substantive issues 
raised in the Letters by May 13, 2020, by which time Co-Executors expect to have supplemented 
their interrogatory responses, which is something the Co-Executors agreed to do as a 
compromise, before Plaintiffs went ahead and filed the Letters with the Court.
The timing of the Letters is particularly troubling considering that the parties’ meet-and-
confer process was still very much on-going with respect to issues raised by both sides.  In fact, 
we emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel on May 6 seeking confirmation that, in light of the parties’ continued 
communications to resolve certain discovery issues, which only commenced on April 27, 
neither side would seek judicial intervention at this time, consistent with Your Honor’s directives.   
Plaintiffs responded to that email yesterday at 5:41PM – 35 mins before they filed the 
Letters – leaving us no opportunity to respond to Plaintiffs’ suggestion that the Parties were at an 
impasse.  That is perplexing, given that the Co-Executors advised Plaintiffs’ counsel during our 
conversation on April 27 (and again as recently as May 5) that the Co-Executors would be 
supplementing their interrogatory responses and would consider their position on a number of the 
issues Plaintiffs raised and get back to them.  Plaintiffs’ inexplicable rush to demand a pre-motion

conference not only violates Your Honor’s rules and explicit directions, it appears designed to 
obtain a perceived litigation advantage in an effort to detract from Plaintiffs’ refusal to comply with 
their own discovery obligations (including, for example, their refusal to produce all of their medical 
records, and not just those that Plaintiffs unilaterally deem relevant to these actions).  Again, these 
are issues which the Co-Executors had believed the parties were still discussing in good faith. 
Accordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ request for a pre-motion conference on the 
grounds that the Letters are premature, misconstrue the nature of the Parties’ discussions and 
violate Your Honor’s rules concerning the Parties’ obligations to meet and confer in good faith in 
an effort to resolve or narrow discovery disputes.  However, if Your Honor is inclined to consider 
Plaintiffs’ request, then the Co-Executors respectfully request permission to submit a response to 
the substantive issues raised in the Letters by May 13, 2020. 
Respectfully submitted,

Re: 
Jane Doe 1000 v. Darren K. Indyke & Richard D. Kahn, 19- 10577-LJL-DCF 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
We submit on behalf of Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 this reply in further support of her letter 
motion for a conference to address Defendants’ complete failure to participate in discovery to date 
(ECF No. 46), and in response to Defendants’ letter, filed on May 8, 2020 (ECF No. 47).  As set 
forth in Plaintiff’s opening letter, Defendants refuse to produce documents concerning Jeffrey 
Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy.  Instead, they offer to produce only documents that directly 
mention Plaintiff’s name, and documents only from limited time periods surrounding the specific 
dates on which she was abused.  ECF No. 46.  Defendants also failed to respond to any of Plaintiff’s 
Rule 33 interrogatories.  Defendants’ opposition admittedly offers no “response to the substantive 
issues,” yet asks the Court to deny Plaintiff’s request for a conference because it would somehow 
be “an unnecessary waste of the Court’s time.”  ECF No. 47 at 1.  The Court should reject 
Defendants’ transparent delay tactic and order the Defendants to address their discovery 
deficiencies immediately.  
Defendants’ only basis for arguing that a conference would be “premature” is that, on April 
30, they promised to serve amended responses to Plaintiff’s interrogatories by the end of last week.  
But not only did Defendants fail to serve amended interrogatory responses last week (despite 
committing to do so), they have never even offered to amend their responses to Plaintiff’s Rule 34 
requests for production.  Defendants also made clear at a meet and confer held on Tuesday, May 
5, that they would not be changing their positions on the threshold disputes identified in Plaintiff’s 
letter.  These disputes, which the parties have already conferred over for hours, are therefore ripe 
for the Court’s review. 
Contrary to Defendants’ suggestion, Plaintiff has complied with her obligations to meet 
and confer in good faith.  She has also already produced hundreds of documents spanning over 
10,000 pages.  Instead, it is Defendants’ obstructionist conduct that requires immediate Court 
intervention.  Because this case was filed six months ago and the Court’s Rule 16 conference took 
place back in February, Defendants’ failure to produce a single document or meaningfully respond 
to discovery requests can only be viewed as an intentional effort to delay discovery.  As just one 
example, Defendants claim that they “expect” to be able to “supplement” their interrogatory 
responses by May 13.  But their initial responses, which are attached as exhibits to Plaintiff’s

opening letter, speak for themselves, and make clear that Defendants have not undertaken 
reasonable efforts to comply with their discovery obligations or meet Court-ordered deadlines in 
good faith.  Where, as here, Defendants (i) refused to answer interrogatories such as “Identify all 
email accounts used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents on his behalf”; (ii) failed to 
provide signatures, pursuant to Rule 33(b)(5), indicating that counsel even discussed the 
interrogatories with their clients before serving their responses; and (iii) did not send a single 
attorney involved in the drafting of their objections to the parties’ April 27 meet and confer, leaving 
Defendants unable to explain how their responses were crafted or even articulate what they meant; 
it is clear that Defendants are attempting to game the process to maximize delay.  Plaintiff’s 
decision to curtail these dilatory tactics therefore does not fall within what the Court described as 
a “pet peeve” at the February 11, 2020, conference.                              
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her request for a conference to address 
these issues. 
Respectfully submitted,

Re:
Jane Doe 1000, 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman:
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors 
of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced 
action (the “Action”).  We write to address the substantive issues raised in Plaintiff’s letters 
to the Court dated May 7 and May 11, prematurely requesting a pre-motion conference 
on Plaintiff’s anticipated motion to compel.  For the reasons set forth below and in our 
May 8 letter, we respectfully request that the Court deny Plaintiff’s request.  
The picture Plaintiff paints is a false one.  On their face, Plaintiff’s interrogatories 
are clearly overbroad and unduly burdensome.  However, as a compromise and as the 
Co-Executors said they would do before Plaintiff filed her letter, the Co-Executors have 
supplemented their responses to those interrogatories.  Notwithstanding that Plaintiff has 
provided no transparency into her own efforts to produce responsive materials (something 
the Co-Executors hope to resolve before filing letters with the Court), the Co-Executors 
have collected and are, in connection with this and the numerous other cases against 
them before Your Honor, reviewing a database of over 730,000 documents.  We 
address Plaintiff’s specific points below.
First, Plaintiff’s proposed 21-year time frame for discovery is not proportional to 
the needs of this case and would impose an undue burden on the Co-Executors.  
Although Plaintiff asserts that her alleged abuse by Mr. Epstein occurred from 1999 to 
2002, she demands discovery from 1999 through the present.  Plaintiff’s proposed time 
frame is contrary to the goals of the 2015 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, which emphasize the pre-existing but often-unheeded requirement that all civil 
discovery be proportional to the needs of the case.  See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. 
v. Fayda, No. 14CIV9792WHPJCF, 2015 WL 7871037, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2015),

aff'd, No. 14CV9792, 2016 WL 4530890 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2016) (“[T]he amended rule 
is intended to encourage judges to be more aggressive in identifying and discouraging 
discovery overuse; by emphasizing the need to analyze proportionality before ordering 
production of relevant information.”).  Requiring the Co-Executors to conduct a search for 
and produce documents over an 21-year time period is not proportional to the needs of 
this case – which relates to Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct over a four-year period that 
concluded in 2002.  The Co-Executors advised Plaintiff’s counsel that the appropriate 
time period for discovery is the time period during which Plaintiff alleges she was abused 
and during which time her claims would have accrued.  Moreover, the Co-Executors will 
search for and produce all non-privileged communications between Mr. Epstein and 
Plaintiff or otherwise concerning Plaintiff, regardless of the year.
Plaintiff’s position, that all information relating to what Plaintiff describes as a “sex 
trafficking” scheme -- which is based on unproven allegations in the S.D.N.Y.’s 2019 
indictment of Mr. Epstein -- is relevant to Plaintiff’s alleged abuse, is untenable.  Plaintiff 
does not assert sex trafficking claims.  Rather, her claims are limited to battery and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
Moreover, conduct that occurred after Plaintiff’s alleged abuse cannot possibly be 
used to support her claims.  While Plaintiff posits that discovery relating to Mr. Epstein’s 
conduct with other individuals is “relevant” to her claims, that does not mean that such 
discovery is proper.  See Mamakos v. United Airlines, Inc., No. CV147294JFBAKT, 2018 
WL 4861392, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018) (“[A]lthough Rule 26 still permits a wide 
range of discovery based upon relevance and proportionality, the provision authorizing 
the court ... to order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the 
action has been eliminated.”) (internal citations omitted).  Accordingly, the Court should 
reject Plaintiff’s attempt to grossly expand the scope of discovery to obtain documents 
that extend “far beyond the scope of Plaintiff’s claims and would significantly burden” the 
Co-Executors.  See Robertson v. People Magazine, No. 14 CIV. 6759 (PAC), 2015 WL 
9077111, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2015) (denying discovery requests that are 
“burdensome and disproportionate” where Plaintiff sought “nearly unlimited” discovery 
that was not addressed to alleged discriminatory conduct and/or comments).
Contrary to her counsel’s assertion, Plaintiff does not need discovery about Mr. 
Epstein’s interactions with other individuals to meet her burden to prove her claims for 
battery or intentional infliction of emotional distress allegedly committed against her.  The 
mere fact that certain testimony regarding a defendant’s prior conduct could theoretically 
be admissible at trial does not mean that Plaintiff is entitled to wide-ranging discovery.  
Plaintiff cites no authority for that proposition.  
Nor does Plaintiff need discovery about Mr. Epstein’s interactions with other 
individuals to invoke her equitable estoppel defense to the Co-Executor’s assertion that 
her claims are barred by the statute of limitations.  In order to prevail on her equitable 
estoppel defense, Plaintiff is required to show that Mr. Epstein’s conduct towards Plaintiff

prevented her from bringing her suit earlier; his conduct towards others has no bearing 
on such a defense.  “To invoke equitable estoppel, a plaintiff must show that: ‘(i) the 
defendant made a definite misrepresentation of fact and had reason to believe that the 
plaintiff would rely on it; and (ii) the plaintiff reasonably relied on that misrepresentation 
to h[er] detriment.’” See Yesh Diamonds, Inc. v. Yashaya, No. 09-CV-2016 (DLI) (RER), 
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101744, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2010) (quoting Kavowras v. New 
York Times Co., 328 F.3d 50, 56-57 (2d Cir. 2003).
Second, Plaintiff suggests that the Co-Executors agreed to produce only 
documents that expressly reference Plaintiff.  That is an inaccurate representation of the 
parties’ conversations during the meet-and-confer sessions.  As we explained during the 
parties’ April 27 and May 5 meet-and-confers, the Co-Executors have and will continue 
to search for and produce documents that relate to Plaintiff and her claims of battery and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress, regardless of whether they specifically 
reference Plaintiff.  For example, if the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff traveled on Mr. 
Epstein’s plane, then flight logs for the relevant time period will be produced.  Similarly, 
where phone records exist from the relevant time period and Plaintiff provides Co-
Executors with phone numbers that she used during the Relevant Time Period, Co-
Executors will search for calls to/from such phone numbers.  To the extent Plaintiff bases 
her argument on the Co-Executors’ search-term proposal for ESI, her counsel never 
engaged with us.  Rather than continue discussions that include bilateral search-term 
proposals – as is customary in this District and something other counsel in the other 
lawsuits against the Estate have done – Plaintiff burdened the Court in an apparent effort 
to obtain a wide-ranging Court order that would unduly burden the Co-Executors.  If 
Plaintiff had simply made a single proposal or engaged in any effort to compromise on 
her positions, this could have all been avoided. 
Third, Plaintiff’s request that the Co-Executors supplement their interrogatory 
responses is moot.  Again, this is exactly the situation the Court warned against.  The Co-
Executors supplemented their interrogatory responses earlier today, as they agreed to do 
before Plaintiff went ahead and burdened the Court with her initial lengthy letter on this 
issue.  The Co-Executors provided their initial and supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s 
interrogatories in the capacity in which they were sued.  Plaintiff provides no support for 
her position that the Co-Executors’ responses should be made in their personal or other 
professional capacity.  Plaintiff also misrepresents the parties’ communications regarding 
information provided by Co-Executors in connection with their interrogatory responses.  
As we advised Plaintiff on several occasions, the Co-Executors reviewed and approved 
the interrogatory responses before they were served.  
Plaintiff incorrectly states that counsel for Co-Executors represented that the Co-
Executors “do not know where to look for responsive documents.”  To the contrary, we 
stated that, despite the fact that obtaining documents and information from a large, 
complicated estate is more involved and thus takes longer than the collection of 
documents from an individual party such as Plaintiff, the Co-Executors retrieved hundreds

of thousands of documents and were reviewing the voluminous database in preparation 
for production, but that the task had been complicated by the need to track down such 
information and the attendant delays caused by the current pandemic.  The Co-Executors 
have compiled a database with over 730,000 documents that they have been searching 
for documents responsive to this and discovery requests in numerous other lawsuits.  
Subject to the execution of a mutually acceptable ESI protocol and confidentiality order 
(something made abundantly clear in the Co-Executors’ written responses to Plaintiff’s 
requests for production), they expect to begin production within the next week.  The only 
reason a confidentiality order was not already entered in this action (but was in several 
other lawsuits against the Co-Executors) is that, unlike the plaintiffs’ counsel in the other 
actions, Plaintiff’s counsel here insisted until shortly before filing their letter that the Co-
Executors accept unsupportable changes, such as the removal of several categories of 
confidentiality that the Co-Executors require but which Plaintiff does not believe she 
needs—a vexatious tactic.
Finally, contrary to her representations to the Court, Plaintiff has not complied with 
her discovery obligations.  Rather, Plaintiff produced a small set of self-selected, and 
useless materials so she could rush to Court under the guise of having made a meaningful 
production in the face of what she falsely claims was stonewalling from her adversaries.  
Approximately half of the documents Plaintiff produced are irrelevant documents from 
another case that was handled by Plaintiff’s counsel that has nothing to do with Plaintiff’s 
claims in this action.1  There appears to have been no reason for the production of these 
documents other than to inflate the size of Plaintiff’s production.  Those same documents 
were also produced by the other Plaintiffs that Plaintiff’s counsel represents in actions 
against Mr. Epstein’s estate.  They do not appear to be documents that were in Plaintiff’s 
personal possession.  
Accordingly, we request that the Court deny Plaintiff’s request for a pre-motion 
conference and instead direct Plaintiff to engage in a good-faith meet-and-confer session 
to resolve the parties’ discovery disputes.
Respectfully submitted,

Re: 
Jane Doe 1000 v. Darren K. Indyke & Richard D. Kahn, 19-10577-LJL-DCF 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
We submit on behalf of Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 this reply in further support of her letter 
motion for a conference to address Defendants’ failure to comply with their discovery obligations 
(ECF No. 46), and in response to Defendants’ second letter in opposition, filed on May 13, 2020 
(ECF No. 52).  As an initial matter, the Court should disregard Defendants’ latest response as 
untimely.  Pursuant to Individual Rule 1.D., “[u]nless the Court orders otherwise, opposition to 
any letter motion shall be filed within three (3) days of the moving letter.”  Notwithstanding this 
rule, Defendants filed an incomplete and non-substantive opposition on May 8, and requested 
“permission to submit a response to the substantive issues raised in the Letters by May 13, 2020.”  
ECF No. 47.  Defendants’ letter did not comply with Individual Rule 1.B., which governs “requests 
for adjournments or extensions of time.”  In any event, the Court did not issue an order extending 
Defendants’ time to respond, much less grant Defendants leave to file two oppositions as opposed 
to one.  But even if the Court were to consider Defendants’ untimely filing, each of their arguments 
is meritless, and confirms the need for immediate Court intervention to resolve the parties’ disputes.   
First, Defendants refuse to engage in discovery for more than a narrow, four-year period.  
This is improper, as information concerning Epstein’s abuse of other girls and young women 
throughout the span of his sex-trafficking conspiracy is plainly relevant, and therefore discoverable 
under Rule 26.  Defendants deride Plaintiff’s allegations as a “sex trafficking scheme–which,” 
according to Defendants, “is based on unproven allegations in the S.D.N.Y.’s 2019 indictment of 
Mr. Epstein.”  ECF No. 52 at 2 (emphases added).  But given all that has been discovered about 
the scope of Epstein’s operations and the numerous ways in which Plaintiff’s abuse mirrored 
Epstein’s abuse of others, Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff “does not need discovery about Mr. 
Epstein’s interactions with other individuals” is baseless.  As set forth in Plaintiff’s opening letter, 
“[d]ocuments relating to the sexual trafficking and/or sexual assault of others at any point during 
that period would make the fact that Epstein trafficked and sexually assaulted Plaintiff, the key 
fact that Plaintiff bears the burden of proving in this case, more probable than it would be without 
such evidence.”  ECF No. 46 at 2.  Moreover, Rule 415 (which Defendants fail to address) 
unambiguously provides that “[i]n a civil case involving a claim for relief based on a party’s 
alleged sexual assault or child molestation, the court may admit evidence that the party committed

any other sexual assault or child molestation.”  Fed. R. Evid. 415.  Defendants are free to attempt 
to prove Epstein innocent, and can try to prove that the allegations set forth in Plaintiff’s complaint 
and the S.D.N.Y.’s indictment are false.  They cannot, however, prevent Plaintiff from accessing 
the information that would prove otherwise. 
Defendants argue that allowing discovery into a period of time greater than four years is 
somehow “not proportional to the needs of this case and would impose an undue burden on the 
Co-Executors.”  ECF No. 52 at 1.  But “unsubstantiated claims of undue burden, overbreadth and 
lack of relevancy” in situations where a party has “produced no documents and answered no 
interrogatories . . . are a paradigm of discovery abuse.”  Jacoby v. Hartford Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 
254 F.R.D. 477, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).  Defendants do not even attempt to quantify what the burden 
of reviewing documents through the present would be, or how that number would compare to that 
for the four-year time period they propose.  The only information Defendants offer in their letter 
is a representation that they are “reviewing a database of over 730,000 documents.”  ECF No. 52 
at 1 (emphasis in original).  That representation is ambiguous, however, as it sheds no light on (i) 
how many of those documents Defendants will review (as opposed to just being a number of 
documents housed on a “database”); (ii) how those documents were collected; or (iii) whether any 
of those documents are currently being reviewed in response to the discovery requests Plaintiff 
served in this case (as opposed to those served in cases brought by other victims).  And the fact 
that Epstein’s Estate is “large and complicated” does not change Defendants’ discovery obligations 
or the deadlines that this Court imposed.  Absent any particularized showing that compliance with 
Plaintiff’s discovery requests would pose an undue burden, Defendants’ proposal to limit the 
discovery period to four years is unfounded. Again, to date Defendants have not produced a single 
document—not one.                      
Second, Defendants improperly refuse to answer interrogatories or produce documents that 
do not specifically reference Plaintiff or the specific instances in which she was abused.  
Defendants claim that they “have and will continue to search for and produce documents that relate 
to Plaintiff and her claims of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, regardless of 
whether they specifically reference Plaintiff.”  ECF No. 52 at 3.  As set forth above, however, 
Plaintiff is entitled to information concerning Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy as a whole, 
including his abuse of others, his communications with his co-conspirators, and the various ways 
in which he operated his scheme throughout the years.  Because the parties’ disagreement hinges 
on whether or not defined topics are discoverable under Rule 26, Defendants’ suggestion that the 
dispute can be resolved by exchanging “bilateral search-term proposals” is disingenuous at best.1  
Id. at 3.  Court intervention is required now so that Defendants can begin reviewing and producing 
documents concerning the sex-trafficking conspiracy they are trying to keep secret.                     
Third, the Court should compel Defendants to answer Plaintiff’s interrogatories in full.  In 
a desperate attempt to convince the Court that this issue is somehow “moot” or that Plaintiff’s pre-
motion letter was “premature,” Defendants claim that Plaintiff’s request was merely “that Co-
Plaintiff already offered to provide a list of search terms to Defendants, and their counsel 
responded by stating that Defendants would only consider any other names Plaintiff goes by as 
search terms.  If that was not Defendants’ position, they never corrected it or otherwise indicated 
that they would change it.

Executors supplement their interrogatory responses.”  ECF No. 52 at 3.  To be clear, Plaintiff’s 
anticipated motion will be to compel Defendants to respond meaningfully to all of Plaintiff’s 
interrogatories, which has still not happened despite Defendants’ belated “supplementation.”  
Defendants’ “supplemental responses,” attached hereto as Exhibit A, remain deficient, and only 
insert cosmetic changes based on information that should have been obvious to Defendants at the 
time they served their “initial” responses, 2 or parrot back information taken from Plaintiff’s 
complaint and Plaintiff’s own production of documents.  In any event, each of Defendants’ 
“supplemental” responses “is limited to the Relevant Time Period,” which means that Defendants 
still refuse to answer Plaintiff’s interrogatories for more than a four-year period.  Court 
intervention is required to compel Defendants to answer these interrogatories in full.     
Finally, although irrelevant to the pending motion concerning Defendants’ discovery 
efforts, Plaintiff has fully complied with her discovery obligations to date, and will continue to do 
so.  Defendants complain that Plaintiff included within her productions what they claim are 
“irrelevant documents from another case,” ECF No. 52 at 4, but Plaintiff produced these 
documents because Defendants specifically asked for the documents identified in Plaintiff’s initial 
disclosures, and Plaintiff correctly produced those documents.  Plaintiff has and will continue to 
engage with opposing counsel in good faith to answer any questions they may have.3                                
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her request 
for a conference.   
Together with their “supplemental responses,” Defendants’ served verifications for their “initial 
responses” on May 13, 2020.  Ex. B.  Whereas the initial responses were served on April 16, the 
signatures for the verifications for those responses are dated May 12, 2020, which is the same date 
as the verifications for the supplemental responses.     
In a footnote, Defendants mention a ruling in Giuffre v. Dershowitz, which disqualified Boies 
Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) as counsel for another Epstein victim, Virginia Giuffre, in a 
defamation case brought by that victim against Alan Dershowitz.  Giuffre v. Dershowitz, 410 F. 
Supp. 3d 564, 578-79 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  Judge Preska’s disqualification of the law firm was not a 
sanction.  Instead, it was based on the advocate-witness rule because Dershowitz claimed that a 
BSF attorney (while representing the victim) said something to him during a settlement negotiation 
that would implicate the truth or falsity of one of Dershowitz’s allegedly defamatory statements.  
Id. at 579. Indeed, BSF continues to represent Virginia Giuffre before Judge Preska in the Giuffre 
v. Maxwell matter.  Defendants disingenuously state that “[t]he Court should be aware” of that 
ruling, despite the fact that it has nothing to do with whether or not Plaintiff herself was a victim 
of Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy.  If Defendants and their counsel are actually seeking to 
prove Epstein innocent or otherwise insulated from accounting for his misconduct, they should 
drop their baseless objections to discovery, stop ad hominem attacks on counsel, cease their delay 
tactics, and welcome a trial on the merits.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 1000, 
Plaintiff,  
                       v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN 
in their capacities as the executors of the ESTATE  
OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN, 
Defendants.  
    Case No. 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF 
DEFENDANTS’ OBJECTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF 
JANE DOE 1000’S FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES TO DEFENDANTS 
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as co-executors of the estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), by their attorneys, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
and 33, provide the following supplemental responses to Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000’s (“Plaintiff”) 
First Set of Interrogatories to Defendants (the “Interrogatories”).  
RESERVATION OF RIGHTS 
These supplemental responses are made solely for the purpose of and in relation to 
discovery in the above-captioned action. The Co-Executors submit these supplemental responses 
subject to, and without intending to waive, and expressly preserving: (i) any objections as to 
relevancy, materiality, competency, privilege and admissibility of any documents and information 
produced in discovery, including without limitation herein; and (ii) the right to object to any other 
discovery requests.  The Co-Executors have been placed in charge of a large and complex estate 
and are working to determine the existence of responsive information concerning the affairs of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Decedent”) and those efforts are continuing. Much of the requested 
information is outside of their knowledge, possession or control.  To the extent non privileged 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 53-1     Filed 05/14/20     Page 2 of 14

42245275  
responsive information would be available to them at all, access to such information has been 
severely hampered by the current pandemic.  Accordingly, Co-Executors reserve their right to 
amend or further supplement these responses if and when appropriate.  Further, these supplemental 
responses are neither an admission nor acceptance of any alleged facts, including without 
limitation those stated in the Interrogatories. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS  
The Co-Executors incorporate their initial objections to the definitions and instructions as 
if stated fully herein. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO 
INTERROGATORIES 
INTERROGATORY NO. 1 
List the names and addresses of all persons who are believed or known by You, Your 
agents, or Your attorneys to have any knowledge concerning any of the issues in this lawsuit, and 
specify the subject matter about which the witness has knowledge. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds and to the extent that it 
calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work 
product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.  The Co-
Executors also object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither 
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also overly broad and 
unduly burdensome.   
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors identify the 
following individual who has knowledge concerning the battery and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress allegedly committed by Decedent against Plaintiff:  Plaintiff. 
In addition, in her Complaint, Plaintiff identifies the following individuals with whom she 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 53-1     Filed 05/14/20     Page 3 of 14

42245275  
has interacted with or communicated with:  any unidentified individuals housed with Plaintiff in 
the location described in paragraph 40 of the Complaint; Ghislaine Maxwell; the alleged 
“additional unidentified co-conspirators” referenced in paragraph 40 of the Complaint; the 
unidentified individual described in paragraph 43 of the Complaint; and the unidentified individual 
described in paragraph 46 of the Complaint.  Co-Executors do not know whether these individuals 
ever spoke with or interacted with Plaintiff, or have knowledge concerning Plaintiff’s allegations. 
In addition, the Co-Executors identify the following individuals, believed to have worked 
at Decedent’s homes in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, which are the only places where 
Plaintiff alleges she encountered Decedent, during the period from November 1999 to 2002, which 
based upon the allegations of the Complaint, appears to cover the entire time period during which 
Plaintiff’s claims accrued (the “Relevant Time Period”):  Luciano Fontanilla, Rosalyn Fontanilla, 
Richard Barnett, Ghislaine Maxwell, Juan Alessi, Maria Alessi and Adam Perry Lang.  Co-
Executors do not know whether these individuals ever spoke with or interacted with Plaintiff, or 
have knowledge concerning Plaintiff’s allegations. 
To the extent additional individuals are identified in response to other interrogatories, those 
individuals may, but do not necessarily, have such knowledge.  The Co-Executors’ search for 
relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement this response if and when any 
additional responsive information is ascertained.  
INTERROGATORY NO. 2 
Identify all email accounts used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents on his behalf. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:  
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 2 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 53-1     Filed 05/14/20     Page 4 of 14

42245275  
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state that it is 
their understanding that the email addresses listed below were created for or on behalf of Decedent, 
but only jeevacation@gmail.com and jeeproject@yahoo.com were actively used by Decedent 
himself.  Moreover, Co-Executors currently do not believe that jeevacation@gmail.com existed or 
was in use during the Relevant Time Period and do not know whether jeeproject@yahoo.com was 
in use during the Relevant Time Period: 
• columbiadental1@yahoo.com 
• jeevacation@me.com 
• jeevacation1@me.com 
• jeeproject@yahoo.com 
• jeevacation@gmail.com 
• jeffrey@jeffreyepstein.org 
• jeffreyepsteinorg@gmail.com 
• jeffreyepsteinorg@yahoo.com 
• jeffreyepstein@live.com 
• jeeitunes@gmail.com 
• littlestjeff@yahoo.com 
The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained. 
INTERROGATORY NO. 3 
Identify all telephone numbers used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents acting 
on his behalf, including beepers, Blackberry or PDA devices, cellular phones and land lines in any 
of his residences, by stating the users name, complete telephone number(s), type of device and 
name of the service provider. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 3 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 53-1     Filed 05/14/20     Page 5 of 14

overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state that it is 
their understanding that the following phone numbers were used by Decedent or registered to 
properties where Decedent stayed at different times, but are unaware of the specific time period 
that the numbers were in use:

The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 4 
Identify all employees, including each employee’s position and dates and locations of 
employment, who performed work or services in or on any property owned, leased, occupied, or 
used by Epstein, including but not limited Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach, Florida, New York 
City, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, London and Paris, and provide the name and contact 
information of the individual who hired, trained and supervised each employee. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 4 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to those individuals who are believed to have worked during the Relevant Time 
Period at Decedent’s homes in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, which are the only places 
where Plaintiff alleges she encountered Decedent.  Co-Executors do not know whether these 
individuals ever spoke with or interacted with Plaintiff during the Relevant Time Period.

Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors identify the 
following individuals: 
• Luciano Fontanilla 
• Rosalyn Fontanilla 
• Richard Barnett 
• Ghislaine Maxwell 
• Juan Alessi 
• Maria Alessi 
• Adam Perry Lang 
The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 5 
Identify all employees, including each employee’s position and dates and location of 
employment, who performed work as an assistant, scheduler, secretary, masseuse or traveling 
masseuse for Epstein and provide the name and contact information of the individual who hired, 
trained and supervised each employee. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 5 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the terms “scheduler” and “traveling masseuse” are vague and ambiguous.  The Co-
Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is 
unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time 
Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors identify Lesley 
Groff and Sarah Kellen, who were Decedent’s assistants during a portion of the Relevant Time 
Period.  Co-Executors do not know whether Ms. Groff or Ms. Kellen ever spoke with or interacted 
with Plaintiff.  Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors refer

Plaintiff to the documents produced by Plaintiff at Bates Nos. JDOE 3736-3832, which purports 
to list contact information for masseuses.  Co-Executors do not know whether any individuals 
identified therein are masseuses or if those individuals provided massages to Decedent during the 
Relevant Time Period.  The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they 
will supplement this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 6 
Identify all companies and/or persons who provided transportation services to Epstein, 
whether as an employee or independent contractor, including without limitation drivers, 
chauffeurs, boat captains, pilots, and aircraft crew, and provide the contact information for each 
listed person or company. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 6 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case, as Plaintiff 
does not allege that she traveled anywhere with Decedent; it is also overly broad and unduly 
burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the grounds that the phrase 
“transportation services” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors further object to this 
Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-
Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state the 
following were individuals who provided air transportation services to Decedent during the 
Relevant Time Period: 
• David Rodgers 
• Larry Visoski 
• Larry Morrison

INTERROGATORY NO. 7 
Identify all females by name and age for whom Epstein or his employees or agents provided 
accommodations at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York for any period of time. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 7 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the phrase “provided accommodations” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors 
further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  
Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state the 
following individuals stayed at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York for some period of time, 
but it is unknown whether any of them stayed at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York during 
the Relevant Time Period: 
• Roslyn Fontanilla 
• Susan Hamblin 
• Sarah Kellen 
Co-Executors do not know whether the individuals listed have ever spoke with or interacted 
with Plaintiff during the Relevant Time Period.  The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information

remains ongoing; they will supplement this response if and when any additional responsive 
information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 8 
Identify by name and age all persons who gave a massage or were asked to give a massage 
to Epstein, Maxwell or a guest, or to whom Epstein or Maxwell gave a massage, at any of Epstein’s 
residences and provide the location of each massage. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 8 on the grounds and to the extent that it 
calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work 
product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.  The Co-
Executors further object on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither relevant to 
Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also overly broad and unduly 
burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent 
that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant 
Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors refer Plaintiff to 
the documents produced by Plaintiff at Bates Nos. JDOE 3736-3832, which purports to list contact 
information for masseuses.  Co-Executors do not know whether any individuals identified therein 
are masseuses or if those individuals provided massages to Decedent during the Relevant Time 
Period. The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained. 
INTERROGATORY NO. 12 
Identify any telecommunications, information technology, or audio-visual technology 
company that Epstein hired for work in any of his residences or offices and provide the name and

SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 12 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the phrase “hired for work” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors further object 
to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, 
Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors believe that 
Mark Lundberg may have performed information technology work in some or all of Decedent’s 
homes during the Relevant Time Period.   
The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 1000, 
Plaintiff, 
CASE NO: 19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF  
v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN,  
in their capacities as the executors of the  
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN,  
Defendants. 
_____________________________________  
STIPULATED CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER  
WHEREAS, Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 and Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. 
Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, (collectively, the “Parties” and each 
individually, a “Party”) request that this Court issue a protective order pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 26(c) to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic and sensitive information that 
they may need to disclose in connection with discovery in this action;  
WHEREAS, the Parties, through counsel, agree to the following terms; and  
WHEREAS, this Court finds that good cause exists for issuance of an appropriately 
tailored confidentiality order governing the pretrial phase of this action;  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Parties to this action, their respective agents, 
employees, and attorneys, any other person in active concert or participation with any of the 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 1 of 13

foregoing, and all other persons with actual notice of this Order will adhere to the following 
terms, upon pain of contempt:  
1. 
“Producing Party” shall mean the parties to this action and any third parties 
producing Confidential Information. 
2. 
“Receiving Party” shall mean the party to this action and/or any non-party 
receiving Confidential Information. 
3. 
With respect to “Discovery Material” (i.e., documents, information or tangible 
things of any kind produced or disclosed in the course of discovery in this action) that a 
Producing Party has designated as “Confidential” pursuant to this Order, no Receiving Party may 
disclose such Confidential Discovery Material to anyone else except as expressly permitted 
hereunder.  
4. 
The Producing Party may designate as Confidential only the portion of such 
material that it reasonably and in good faith believes consists of:  
(a) medical, mental health and/or other health care records;  
(b) information concerning Plaintiff’s real name or personal details that could 
result in the disclosure of Plaintiff’s identity; 
(c) Social Security numbers, personal telephone numbers, tax returns, and credit 
and banking information of any person;  
(d) names of alleged minor victims of sexual abuse;  
(e) previously non-disclosed financial information; 
(f) non-public information that the producing person in good faith considers to be, 
reflect, or reveal business, marketing, financial, or regulatory information or data, 
or information of commercial value, including, without limitation, trade secrets, 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 2 of 13

contracts with third parties, or other information required by law or agreement to 
be kept confidential;  
(g) any other material the Parties agree in writing is Confidential; and 
(h) any other category of information given confidential status by this Court after 
the date of this Order.  
5. 
With respect to the Confidential portion of any Discovery Material other than 
deposition transcripts and exhibits, the Producing Party or its counsel may designate such portion 
as “Confidential” by: (a) stamping or otherwise clearly marking as “Confidential” the protected 
portion in a manner that will not interfere with legibility or audibility; and (b) producing for 
future public use another copy of said Discovery Material with the confidential information 
redacted.  
6. 
A Producing Party or its counsel may designate deposition exhibits or portions of 
deposition transcripts as Confidential Discovery Material either by: (a) indicating on the record 
during the deposition that a question calls for Confidential information, in which case the 
reporter will bind the transcript of the designated testimony in a separate volume and mark it as 
“Confidential Information Governed by Protective Order;” or (b) notifying the reporter and all 
counsel of record, in writing, within 30 days after a deposition has concluded, of the specific 
pages and lines of the transcript that are to be designated “Confidential,” in which case all 
counsel receiving the transcript will be responsible for marking the copies of the designated 
transcript in their possession or under their control as directed by the Producing Party or that 
person’s counsel. During the 30-day period following a deposition, all Parties will treat the entire 
deposition transcript as if it had been designated Confidential.  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 3 of 13

7. 
If at any time before the termination of this action a Producing Party realizes that 
it should have designated as Confidential some portion(s) of Discovery Material that it 
previously produced without limitation, the Producing Party may so designate such material by 
notifying all Parties in writing. Thereafter, the Receiving Party will treat such designated 
portion(s) of the Discovery Material as Confidential. In addition, the Producing Party shall 
provide each Receiving Party with replacement versions of such Discovery Material that bears 
the “Confidential” designation within two business days of providing such notice.  
8. 
Nothing contained in this Order will be construed as: (a) a waiver by a Party or 
person of its right to object to any discovery request; (b) a waiver of any privilege or protection; 
or (c) a ruling regarding the admissibility at trial of any document, testimony, or other evidence.  
9. 
Where a Producing Party has designated Discovery Material as Confidential, the 
Receiving Party may disclose such information only to the following persons:  
(a) the Parties to this action;  
(b) counsel retained specifically for this action, including any paralegal, clerical, 
or other assistant that such outside counsel employs and assigns to this matter; 
(c) outside vendors or service providers (such as copy-service providers and 
document-management consultants) that counsel hire and assign to this matter, 
provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form 
annexed as Exhibit A hereto;  
(d) any mediator or arbitrator that the Parties engage in this matter or that this 
Court appoints, provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure  
Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto;  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 4 of 13

(e) as to any document, its author, its addressee, and any other person indicated on 
the face of the document as having received a copy;  
(f) any witness who counsel for a Party in good faith believes may be called to 
testify at trial or deposition in this action, provided such person has first executed 
a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto; 
(g) any person a Party retains to serve as an expert witness or otherwise provide 
specialized advice to counsel in connection with this action, provided such person 
has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto;  
(h) stenographers engaged to transcribe depositions the Parties conduct in this 
action; and  
(i) this Court, including any appellate court, its support personnel, and court 
reporters.  
10. 
Before disclosing any Confidential Discovery Material to any person referred to 
in subparagraphs 9(c), 9(d), 9(f), or 9(g) above, counsel must provide a copy of this Order to 
such person, who must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto stating that he or she has read this Order and agrees to be bound by its terms. Said counsel 
must retain each signed Non-Disclosure Agreement, hold it in escrow, and produce it to 
opposing counsel either before such person is permitted to testify (at deposition or trial) or at the 
conclusion of the case including any and all appeals, whichever comes first.  
11. 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Paragraph 9 shall impose any limitation on 
the ability of a Producing Party to disclose its own Confidential Discovery Material. A 
Producing Party shall not be required to obtain an executed Non-Disclosure Agreement from its 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 5 of 13

own current or former employees with respect to disclosure of its own Confidential Discovery 
Material.    
12. 
This Order binds the Parties and certain others to treat as Confidential any 
Discovery Materials so classified. The Court has not, however, made any finding regarding the 
confidentiality of any Discovery Materials, and retains full discretion to determine whether to 
afford confidential treatment to any Discovery Material designated as Confidential hereunder. 
All persons are placed on notice that the Court is unlikely to seal or otherwise afford confidential 
treatment to any Discovery Material introduced into evidence at trial, even if such material has 
previously been sealed or designated as Confidential.  
13. 
In filing Confidential Discovery Material with this Court, or filing portions of any 
pleadings, motions, or other papers that disclose such Confidential Discovery Material 
(“Confidential Court Submission”), the Parties shall publicly file a redacted copy of the 
Confidential Court Submission via the Electronic Case Filing System. The Parties shall file an 
unredacted copy of the Confidential Court Submission under seal with the Clerk of this Court, 
and the Parties shall serve this Court and opposing counsel with unredacted courtesy copies of 
the Confidential Court Submission.  Any Party that seeks to file Confidential Discovery Material 
under seal must file an application and supporting declaration justifying—on a particularized 
basis—the sealing of such documents. The parties should be aware that the Court will unseal 
documents if it is unable to make “specific, on the record findings . . . demonstrating that closure 
is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.”  Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2006).  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this paragraph, if the parties stipulate that specific portions of a document are both 
confidential and immaterial to this lawsuit, a party may publicly file a version of the document 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 6 of 13

with those confidential and immaterial portions redacted, and that party need not submit an 
unredacted version to the Court or file a motion to seal.  
14. 
Any Party who objects to any designation of confidentiality may at any time 
before the trial of this action serve upon counsel for the Producing Party a written notice stating 
with particularity the grounds of the objection. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, 
counsel for all affected Parties will address their dispute to the Court by motion.  The Party 
seeking confidentiality shall bear the burden of establishing that the material at issue was 
properly designated as confidential.  The Parties shall treat the disputed materials as Confidential 
pending the Court’s resolution of such motion.   
15. 
Any Party who requests additional limits on disclosure (such as “attorneys’ eyes 
only” in extraordinary circumstances), may at any time before the trial of this action serve upon 
counsel for the recipient Parties a written notice stating with particularity the grounds of the 
request. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, counsel for all affected Parties will 
address their dispute to the Court.   
16. 
Absent an Order from a court of competent jurisdiction, Recipients of 
Confidential Discovery Material under this Order may use such material solely for the 
prosecution and defense of this action, any appeals thereto, and any alternative dispute resolution 
proceeding intended to resolve this action with prior express permission of the producing party, 
and not for any other purpose or in any other litigation proceeding. Nothing contained in this 
Order, however, will affect or restrict the rights of any Party with respect to its own documents 
or information produced in this action.  Nor shall anything contained in this Order prejudice a 
Party’s ability to seek discovery in this and any other legal proceeding, without prejudice to any 
other Party’s right to object to such discovery.   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 7 of 13

17. 
Nothing in this Order will prevent any Party from producing any Confidential 
Discovery Material in its possession in response to a lawful subpoena or other compulsory 
process, or if required to produce by law or by any government agency having jurisdiction, 
provided that, unless precluded by applicable laws or rules, such Party gives written notice to the 
Producing Party as soon as reasonably possible, and if permitted by the time allowed under the 
request, at least 10 days before any disclosure. Upon receiving such notice, the Producing Party 
will bear the burden to oppose compliance with the subpoena, other compulsory process, or other 
legal notice if the Producing Party deems it appropriate to do so.  
18. 
Each person who has access to Discovery Material designated as Confidential 
pursuant to this Order must take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized or 
inadvertent disclosure of such material.  
19. 
If a Receiving Party receives documents or other materials that it has reason to 
believe are subject to a good faith claim of attorney-client privilege, work product protection, or 
other privilege or immunity from disclosure, the Receiving Party must refrain from examining 
the documents or other materials any more than is essential to ascertain whether the documents 
or other materials are reasonably subject to such a claim.  The Receiving Party shall promptly 
notify the producing person in writing that the Receiving Party possesses documents or other 
material that appears to be privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure.  
20. 
If, in connection with this litigation, a producing person inadvertently discloses 
information that is subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product 
protection, or any other privilege or immunity from disclosure (“Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information”), such disclosure shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of any 
claim of privilege, work product protection, or other privilege or immunity from discovery with 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 8 of 13

respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information or its subject matter.  In addition, a producing 
person may use its own document (e.g., as a deposition exhibit) containing material that is 
subject to a claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for the purpose of establishing the 
basis of such claim without waiver of any applicable privilege or immunity from disclosure, 
unless the producing person affirmatively uses or relies upon the specific material contained in 
the document that is subject to the claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for any 
purpose other than establishing the basis of such claim.  
21. 
If a producing person makes a claim of inadvertent disclosure, the Receiving 
Party shall, within five business days, return or destroy all copies of the Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information, and provide a certification of counsel that all such information has been returned or 
destroyed, unless the Receiving Party seeks to dispute that the information is privileged or 
otherwise protected as set forth below.  Until the dispute is resolved or ruled upon, the Receiving 
Party shall undertake to keep such information restricted solely for use in connection with the 
dispute over the privilege or protection.     
22. 
Within five business days after the notification that such Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information has been returned or destroyed, the producing person shall produce a privilege log 
with respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  
23. 
The Receiving Party may move the Court for an Order compelling production of 
the Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  Pursuant to the parties’ obligations set forth herein, the 
motion shall not quote or paraphrase the substance of the document subject to the motion to 
compel beyond the description of the document contained in the privilege log entry for the 
document.  The motion shall be filed under seal, and shall not assert as a ground for entering 
such an Order the fact or circumstances of the inadvertent production in this action.  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 9 of 13

24. 
The Producing Party retains the burden of establishing the privileged or protected 
nature of any Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  Nothing in this Order shall limit the right of 
any Producing Party or Receiving Party to request an in camera review of the Inadvertently 
Disclosed Information.  
25. 
Unless the parties otherwise agree or a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise 
orders, within 60 days of the final disposition of this action—including all appeals—all 
Receiving Parties must either return Confidential Discovery Material—including all copies 
thereof—to the Producing Party, or destroy such material—including all copies thereof. In either 
event, by the 60-day deadline, the Receiving Party must certify its return or destruction by 
submitting a written certification to the Producing Party that affirms that it has not retained any 
copies, abstracts, compilations, summaries, or other forms of reproducing or capturing any of the 
Confidential Discovery Material.  Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Discovery Materials that 
have been received electronically and that cannot be returned or destroyed must be electronically 
deleted and deleted from “trash” files, and the Receiving Party must take reasonable measures to 
ensure that unauthorized persons do not have access to Confidential information residing on the 
Receiving Party’s computer server and back-up media; and (ii) outside counsel for the parties are 
permitted to retain one archival copy of all pleadings, motion papers, court filings made under 
seal, transcripts, legal memoranda, correspondence, attorney work product, written discovery 
responses, deposition and trial exhibits, and expert reports, even if such materials contain 
Confidential Discovery Material, subject to a continuing obligation to protect information 
designated Confidential pursuant to this Order. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 54     Filed 05/21/20     Page 10 of 13

26. 
Nothing in this Order shall be construed as superseding or limiting the Order 
and/or Stipulation concerning Plaintiff’s Anonymity entered or to be entered in this case. In the 
event of a conflict, the terms of the Stipulation/Order of Plaintiff’s Anonymity shall govern. 
27. 
This Order will survive the termination of the litigation and will continue to be 
binding upon each Receiving Party.  
28. 
This Court will retain jurisdiction over all persons subject to this Order to the 
extent necessary to enforce any obligations arising hereunder or to impose sanctions for any 
contempt thereof.

WHEREAS, this Court finds that good cause exists for issuance of an appropriately 
tailored confidentiality order governing the pretrial phase of this action;  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Parties to this action, their respective agents, 
employees, and attorneys, any other person in active concert or participation with any of the 
Under Paragraph 2(F) of the Court's Individual Practices in Civil Cases, available at https://nysd.uscourts.gov/honlewis-j-liman, "All 
parties wishing to propose a protective order must, after receiving the Court’s permission in accordance with Paragraph 1(B), submit a 
proposed protective order that conforms as closely as possible with the Court’s Model Protective Order, which is available on the Judge’s 
website. Any changes must be reflected in a redline that should be filed as an exhibit to the proposed protective order." The parties are

Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 1 of 13

foregoing, and all other persons with actual notice of this Order will adhere to the following 
terms, upon pain of contempt:  
1. 
“Producing Party” shall mean the parties to this action and any third parties 
producing Confidential Information. 
2. 
“Receiving Party” shall mean the party to this action and/or any non-party 
receiving Confidential Information. 
3. 
With respect to “Discovery Material” (i.e., documents, information or tangible 
things of any kind produced or disclosed in the course of discovery in this action) that a 
Producing Party has designated as “Confidential” pursuant to this Order, no Receiving Party may 
disclose such Confidential Discovery Material to anyone else except as expressly permitted 
hereunder.  
4. 
The Producing Party may designate as Confidential only the portion of such 
material that it reasonably and in good faith believes consists of:  
(a) medical, mental health and/or other health care records;  
(b) information concerning Plaintiff’s real name or personal details that could 
result in the disclosure of Plaintiff’s identity; 
(c) Social Security numbers, personal telephone numbers, tax returns, and credit 
and banking information of any person;  
(d) names of alleged minor victims of sexual abuse;  
(e) previously non-disclosed financial information; 
(f) non-public information that the producing person in good faith considers to be, 
reflect, or reveal business, marketing, financial, or regulatory information or data, 
or information of commercial value, including, without limitation, trade secrets, 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 2 of 13

contracts with third parties, or other information required by law or agreement to 
be kept confidential;  
(g) any other material the Parties agree in writing is Confidential; and 
(h) any other category of information given confidential status by this Court after 
the date of this Order.  
5. 
With respect to the Confidential portion of any Discovery Material other than 
deposition transcripts and exhibits, the Producing Party or its counsel may designate such portion 
as “Confidential” by: (a) stamping or otherwise clearly marking as “Confidential” the protected 
portion in a manner that will not interfere with legibility or audibility; and (b) producing for 
future public use another copy of said Discovery Material with the confidential information 
redacted.  
6. 
A Producing Party or its counsel may designate deposition exhibits or portions of 
deposition transcripts as Confidential Discovery Material either by: (a) indicating on the record 
during the deposition that a question calls for Confidential information, in which case the 
reporter will bind the transcript of the designated testimony in a separate volume and mark it as 
“Confidential Information Governed by Protective Order;” or (b) notifying the reporter and all 
counsel of record, in writing, within 30 days after a deposition has concluded, of the specific 
pages and lines of the transcript that are to be designated “Confidential,” in which case all 
counsel receiving the transcript will be responsible for marking the copies of the designated 
transcript in their possession or under their control as directed by the Producing Party or that 
person’s counsel. During the 30-day period following a deposition, all Parties will treat the entire 
deposition transcript as if it had been designated Confidential.  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 3 of 13

7. 
If at any time before the termination of this action a Producing Party realizes that 
it should have designated as Confidential some portion(s) of Discovery Material that it 
previously produced without limitation, the Producing Party may so designate such material by 
notifying all Parties in writing. Thereafter, the Receiving Party will treat such designated 
portion(s) of the Discovery Material as Confidential. In addition, the Producing Party shall 
provide each Receiving Party with replacement versions of such Discovery Material that bears 
the “Confidential” designation within two business days of providing such notice.  
8. 
Nothing contained in this Order will be construed as: (a) a waiver by a Party or 
person of its right to object to any discovery request; (b) a waiver of any privilege or protection; 
or (c) a ruling regarding the admissibility at trial of any document, testimony, or other evidence.  
9. 
Where a Producing Party has designated Discovery Material as Confidential, the 
Receiving Party may disclose such information only to the following persons:  
(a) the Parties to this action;  
(b) counsel retained specifically for this action, including any paralegal, clerical, 
or other assistant that such outside counsel employs and assigns to this matter; 
(c) outside vendors or service providers (such as copy-service providers and 
document-management consultants) that counsel hire and assign to this matter, 
provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form 
annexed as Exhibit A hereto;  
(d) any mediator or arbitrator that the Parties engage in this matter or that this 
Court appoints, provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure  
Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto;  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 4 of 13

(e) as to any document, its author, its addressee, and any other person indicated on 
the face of the document as having received a copy;  
(f) any witness who counsel for a Party in good faith believes may be called to 
testify at trial or deposition in this action, provided such person has first executed 
a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto; 
(g) any person a Party retains to serve as an expert witness or otherwise provide 
specialized advice to counsel in connection with this action, provided such person 
has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto;  
(h) stenographers engaged to transcribe depositions the Parties conduct in this 
action; and  
(i) this Court, including any appellate court, its support personnel, and court 
reporters.  
10. 
Before disclosing any Confidential Discovery Material to any person referred to 
in subparagraphs 9(c), 9(d), 9(f), or 9(g) above, counsel must provide a copy of this Order to 
such person, who must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto stating that he or she has read this Order and agrees to be bound by its terms. Said counsel 
must retain each signed Non-Disclosure Agreement, hold it in escrow, and produce it to 
opposing counsel either before such person is permitted to testify (at deposition or trial) or at the 
conclusion of the case including any and all appeals, whichever comes first.  
11. 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Paragraph 9 shall impose any limitation on 
the ability of a Producing Party to disclose its own Confidential Discovery Material. A 
Producing Party shall not be required to obtain an executed Non-Disclosure Agreement from its 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 5 of 13

own current or former employees with respect to disclosure of its own Confidential Discovery 
Material.    
12. 
This Order binds the Parties and certain others to treat as Confidential any 
Discovery Materials so classified. The Court has not, however, made any finding regarding the 
confidentiality of any Discovery Materials, and retains full discretion to determine whether to 
afford confidential treatment to any Discovery Material designated as Confidential hereunder. 
All persons are placed on notice that the Court is unlikely to seal or otherwise afford confidential 
treatment to any Discovery Material introduced into evidence at trial, even if such material has 
previously been sealed or designated as Confidential.  
13. 
In filing Confidential Discovery Material with this Court, or filing portions of any 
pleadings, motions, or other papers that disclose such Confidential Discovery Material 
(“Confidential Court Submission”), the Parties shall publicly file a redacted copy of the 
Confidential Court Submission via the Electronic Case Filing System. The Parties shall file an 
unredacted copy of the Confidential Court Submission under seal with the Clerk of this Court, 
and the Parties shall serve this Court and opposing counsel with unredacted courtesy copies of 
the Confidential Court Submission.  Any Party that seeks to file Confidential Discovery Material 
under seal must file an application and supporting declaration justifying—on a particularized 
basis—the sealing of such documents. The parties should be aware that the Court will unseal 
documents if it is unable to make “specific, on the record findings . . . demonstrating that closure 
is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.”  Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2006).  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this paragraph, if the parties stipulate that specific portions of a document are both 
confidential and immaterial to this lawsuit, a party may publicly file a version of the document 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 6 of 13

with those confidential and immaterial portions redacted, and that party need not submit an 
unredacted version to the Court or file a motion to seal.  
14. 
Any Party who objects to any designation of confidentiality may at any time 
before the trial of this action serve upon counsel for the Producing Party a written notice stating 
with particularity the grounds of the objection. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, 
counsel for all affected Parties will address their dispute to the Court by motion.  The Party 
seeking confidentiality shall bear the burden of establishing that the material at issue was 
properly designated as confidential.  The Parties shall treat the disputed materials as Confidential 
pending the Court’s resolution of such motion.   
15. 
Any Party who requests additional limits on disclosure (such as “attorneys’ eyes 
only” in extraordinary circumstances), may at any time before the trial of this action serve upon 
counsel for the recipient Parties a written notice stating with particularity the grounds of the 
request. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, counsel for all affected Parties will 
address their dispute to the Court.   
16. 
Absent an Order from a court of competent jurisdiction, Recipients of 
Confidential Discovery Material under this Order may use such material solely for the 
prosecution and defense of this action, any appeals thereto, and any alternative dispute resolution 
proceeding intended to resolve this action with prior express permission of the producing party, 
and not for any other purpose or in any other litigation proceeding. Nothing contained in this 
Order, however, will affect or restrict the rights of any Party with respect to its own documents 
or information produced in this action.  Nor shall anything contained in this Order prejudice a 
Party’s ability to seek discovery in this and any other legal proceeding, without prejudice to any 
other Party’s right to object to such discovery.   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 7 of 13

17. 
Nothing in this Order will prevent any Party from producing any Confidential 
Discovery Material in its possession in response to a lawful subpoena or other compulsory 
process, or if required to produce by law or by any government agency having jurisdiction, 
provided that, unless precluded by applicable laws or rules, such Party gives written notice to the 
Producing Party as soon as reasonably possible, and if permitted by the time allowed under the 
request, at least 10 days before any disclosure. Upon receiving such notice, the Producing Party 
will bear the burden to oppose compliance with the subpoena, other compulsory process, or other 
legal notice if the Producing Party deems it appropriate to do so.  
18. 
Each person who has access to Discovery Material designated as Confidential 
pursuant to this Order must take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized or 
inadvertent disclosure of such material.  
19. 
If a Receiving Party receives documents or other materials that it has reason to 
believe are subject to a good faith claim of attorney-client privilege, work product protection, or 
other privilege or immunity from disclosure, the Receiving Party must refrain from examining 
the documents or other materials any more than is essential to ascertain whether the documents 
or other materials are reasonably subject to such a claim.  The Receiving Party shall promptly 
notify the producing person in writing that the Receiving Party possesses documents or other 
material that appears to be privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure.  
20. 
If, in connection with this litigation, a producing person inadvertently discloses 
information that is subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product 
protection, or any other privilege or immunity from disclosure (“Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information”), such disclosure shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of any 
claim of privilege, work product protection, or other privilege or immunity from discovery with 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 8 of 13

respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information or its subject matter.  In addition, a producing 
person may use its own document (e.g., as a deposition exhibit) containing material that is 
subject to a claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for the purpose of establishing the 
basis of such claim without waiver of any applicable privilege or immunity from disclosure, 
unless the producing person affirmatively uses or relies upon the specific material contained in 
the document that is subject to the claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for any 
purpose other than establishing the basis of such claim.  
21. 
If a producing person makes a claim of inadvertent disclosure, the Receiving 
Party shall, within five business days, return or destroy all copies of the Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information, and provide a certification of counsel that all such information has been returned or 
destroyed, unless the Receiving Party seeks to dispute that the information is privileged or 
otherwise protected as set forth below.  Until the dispute is resolved or ruled upon, the Receiving 
Party shall undertake to keep such information restricted solely for use in connection with the 
dispute over the privilege or protection.     
22. 
Within five business days after the notification that such Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information has been returned or destroyed, the producing person shall produce a privilege log 
with respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  
23. 
The Receiving Party may move the Court for an Order compelling production of 
the Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  Pursuant to the parties’ obligations set forth herein, the 
motion shall not quote or paraphrase the substance of the document subject to the motion to 
compel beyond the description of the document contained in the privilege log entry for the 
document.  The motion shall be filed under seal, and shall not assert as a ground for entering 
such an Order the fact or circumstances of the inadvertent production in this action.  
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 9 of 13

24. 
The Producing Party retains the burden of establishing the privileged or protected 
nature of any Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  Nothing in this Order shall limit the right of 
any Producing Party or Receiving Party to request an in camera review of the Inadvertently 
Disclosed Information.  
25. 
Unless the parties otherwise agree or a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise 
orders, within 60 days of the final disposition of this action—including all appeals—all 
Receiving Parties must either return Confidential Discovery Material—including all copies 
thereof—to the Producing Party, or destroy such material—including all copies thereof. In either 
event, by the 60-day deadline, the Receiving Party must certify its return or destruction by 
submitting a written certification to the Producing Party that affirms that it has not retained any 
copies, abstracts, compilations, summaries, or other forms of reproducing or capturing any of the 
Confidential Discovery Material.  Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Discovery Materials that 
have been received electronically and that cannot be returned or destroyed must be electronically 
deleted and deleted from “trash” files, and the Receiving Party must take reasonable measures to 
ensure that unauthorized persons do not have access to Confidential information residing on the 
Receiving Party’s computer server and back-up media; and (ii) outside counsel for the parties are 
permitted to retain one archival copy of all pleadings, motion papers, court filings made under 
seal, transcripts, legal memoranda, correspondence, attorney work product, written discovery 
responses, deposition and trial exhibits, and expert reports, even if such materials contain 
Confidential Discovery Material, subject to a continuing obligation to protect information 
designated Confidential pursuant to this Order. 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF     Document 55     Filed 05/22/20     Page 10 of 13

26. 
Nothing in this Order shall be construed as superseding or limiting the Order 
and/or Stipulation concerning Plaintiff’s Anonymity entered or to be entered in this case. In the 
event of a conflict, the terms of the Stipulation/Order of Plaintiff’s Anonymity shall govern. 
27. 
This Order will survive the termination of the litigation and will continue to be 
binding upon each Receiving Party.  
28. 
This Court will retain jurisdiction over all persons subject to this Order to the 
extent necessary to enforce any obligations arising hereunder or to impose sanctions for any 
contempt thereof.  
SO STIPULATED AND AGREED.

THE COURT:  This is Judge Freeman.  We might have a
court reporter, but I'm going to record this call anyway, so
hold on while I set that up.
All right.  So this is Judge Freeman, and this is a 
conference in four of the cases against the Jeffrey Epstein 
estate:  Farmer v. Indyke, 19 Civ. 10475; Helm v. Indyke, 
Civ. 10476; Bryant v. Indyke, 19 Civ. 10479; and Doe 1000 v. 
Indyke, 19 Civ. 10577.   
If you are here for some other case or you think I got 
those numbers wrong, please make sure I know about it.   
But I'm going to ask for your appearances.  We have 
quite a number of people on the line.  Let me have the 
appearance first by plaintiff's counsel in these cases. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  Good morning.  This
is Sigrid McCawley from the law firm of Boies, Schiller &
Flexner, and I'm representing the plaintiffs in the actions
that you listed.  Along with me, I have my colleague Sabina
Mariella and Andrew Villacastin.  We also have a few of our
summer associates who have joined the line as well.
THE COURT:  All right.
Do I have a court reporter on the line? 
THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes.  Good morning, Judge.  This
is Kristen Carannante.
THE COURT:  I'm going to ask anyone who is giving
appearances for the record to please spell your name.  So,

Ms. McCawley, if you could please spell your name and the names
of your colleagues.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course.  Sigrid McCawley, which is
spelled S-I-G-R-I-D, and the last name is McCawley,
M-c-C-A-W-L-E-Y.  I also have with me Sabina Mariella, which is
S-A-B-I-N-A M-A-R-I-E-L-L-A and Andrew Villacastin, and that's
A-N-D-R-E-W and Villacastin is V-I-L-L-A-C-A-S-T-I-N.  
THE COURT:  You are counsel in all of the cases that
are on for today?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Correct.  Correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Can I have defendants' counsel, please?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Hi, your Honor.  Again, this is Bennet
Moskowitz, B-E-N-N-E-T, last name M-O-S-K-O-W-I-T-Z, at
Troutman Sanders, for the co-executors in each of these cases.
My colleagues who handle the day-to-day discovery, 
Matthew Aaronson and Valerie Sirota, are on.  That's Matthew is 
M-A-T-T-H-E-W, last name is Aaronson, A-A-R-O-N-S-O-N; and 
Valerie, V-A-L-E-R-I-E, last name Sirota, S-I-R-O-T-A, and we 
are counsel for the co-executors in each of these cases. 
THE COURT:  All right.
Do I have any other attorneys who are on or 
representing plaintiffs in any of the other cases that are 
pending before the court?  No.  All right. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor --
THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. MENNINGER:  Sorry.  This is a defendant's counsel
for Ms. Maxwell, Laura Menninger.
THE COURT:  Oh, yes.
MS. MENNINGER:  I am in the 10475 case.
THE COURT:  Can you spell your name, please?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes.  It is L-A-U-R-A
M-E-N-N-I-N-G-E-R.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And, again, are there any other
attorneys on the line in any of the cases?
All right.  I'm going to assume, then, that anyone 
else on the phone is public or press and just ask you to please 
keep your lines muted.   
Sometimes on these calls we hear beeps which suggest 
that someone else may have joined in the call.  It can also 
suggest that someone may have dropped off the call.  And 
because of that, I will probably interrupt anyone who is 
speaking just to try to make sure that we didn't lose anybody 
or we didn't gain anyone we should know about.  It is not a 
courtroom where I can see people coming and going, so I just 
like to make sure we didn't accidentally lose one of the 
counsel who is supposed to be present.  And I apologize in 
advance for the interruptions. 
Do I have Hanna Martin on?
MS. MARTIN:  Yes, Judge, I'm here.
THE COURT:  Okay.  That's one of my law clerks, just

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
so you know.
All right.  So I have letters in these cases.  They
have come in clusters of letter and response and reply in the
three cases where Ms. Maxwell is not a party, and then there
are letters relating to her in the case where she is a party.
Let me start with the other cases where she is not the
party and deal with those letters first.  
Can I have, from Ms. McCawley, just a status update 
from you where things stand with your current request, with 
your understanding about potential settlements? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
So with respect to the requests, we have presented to 
the court a main threshold issue which has been unresolved at 
this point by the parties, and that is the issue of the time 
period within which the defendants, the estate, will produce 
documents.  That issue remains unresolved.   
It is the plaintiffs' position that documents for the 
entire relevant time period for each plaintiff, which runs from 
the date of their abuse, that year, to the present, are 
responsive and relevant to discovery in the case.  That goes to 
the evidence with respect to any of the conduct that Epstein 
was engaging in over those years that would prove the abuse, 
not simply, as in a car crash case, you don't just get the 
evidence of the date of the car crash, you get all evidence 
relating to anything that's relevant and could be used 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 6 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
potentially at trial.  Similarly, here, the defendants have 
attempted to limit the production to simply the year of the 
abuse or years of the abuse, if it happened in more than one 
year.  It is our position that all evidence relating to the 
over 20-year span of Epstein's abuse of not only our clients 
but other clients that are similarly situated, other women that 
are similarly situated, is highly relevant to the discovery in 
this matter.   
And of course, as your Honor knows, the plaintiff has 
the burden of proving her case in each of these instances, and 
the estate has taken the position of attempting to prove 
Epstein's innocence, therefore making all of this information 
highly relevant for the entire time period.   
This is similar to other cases that have come before 
in the Southern District of New York.  For example, Judge 
Sweet, in his case with one of the victims, allowed discovery 
for the entire time period from 2000 to the present; and that 
is, again, because, under 415, evidence of other abuse can be 
admissible at trial.  So we believe that the entire time period 
is highly relevant, and those documents need to be produced. 
The status of this, as of the date of filing our
letters, no documents have been produced.  In the last couple
of days, in Ms. Helm's case and in the Jane Doe 1000 case,
there has been one document produced by the defendants.  In the
case of Annie Farmer there have been three documents produced,
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 7 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
one of which was clawed back.  And in the case of Juliette
Bryant, there have been 90 documents produced, and that is on
their side.
So we are still in a position where we have not
received any substantial document production in this case.  The
court will remember that, back on January 28 -- the cases were
filed in November.  Back on January 28 we sent -- after your
hearing that you had in December asking them to preserve
documents, we sent a document preservation letter that outlined
in very specific detail the e-mail accounts for which we were
aware of that Mr. Epstein had utilized.
You are going to hear today, and you saw in the 
filings from the defendant about their claims of burdens, they 
have not justified burden at this point.  They have thrown 
around a number of 700,000 documents.  I will tell you that we 
have already gone through 600,000 documents in just Annie's 
case alone for our production.  They have not produced a hit 
list to show burden or otherwise establish why our request 
would be so burdensome.   
So with respect to -- and that is only -- now, they 
are only still responding to the time period that is the one- 
or two-year window, depending on the particular plaintiff.  So 
at this stage we do not have -- that is still the threshold 
issue that we are asking this court to resolve.  We need that 
issue resolved before we can undertake depositions or get this 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 8 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
case moving, because we at this point have no documents of any 
substance from the other side.  So that is the key issue that 
we have put before the court for resolution.   
They have produced supplemental interrogatory 
responses.  Again, those are still limited to the time period 
that they have set forth.  They have not agreed to produce 
information for the entire time period at this point.   
So that is the key issue that we put before the court 
that we need resolution on it in order to be able to move these 
cases forward at this point.   
THE COURT:  All right.  Before I ask some questions
about that, let me just ask about potential for settlement of
these cases.  What is plaintiffs' understanding?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Potential for settlement in these
cases, as your Honor knows, there was the proposal of a
potential claims administration program that came about in the
fall of this past year.  That program has been through a series
of back-and-forth between the U.S. Virgin Islands' A.G. and the
estate, with input from the various plaintiffs' attorneys, as
well.  The program has not yet been approved.  It has made
headway, but it has not yet been approved to move forward.
There are still issues with respect to a release and other
matters, so that has not gotten off the ground at all.  So
there have been no substantive settlement discussions of any
kind in these cases.
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 9 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
And, again, if --
THE COURT:  If the program --
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.
THE COURT:  If the program gets off the ground, the
program as you understand it to be fashioned, would these
plaintiffs be likely to participate in it?
MS. McCAWLEY:  We would still have to have those final
conversations with the clients pending what the final outcome
of the program is, but they have all been interested in trying
to participate in a program if it does go forward.
Our concern, of course, is that that program has been 
delayed and has not moved forward, so we have had the need to 
press  forward with our case.  Of course, in that program, too, 
any offer that could be made could be very substandard, where 
our clients would want to proceed with the merits of their 
action, which is why we are here before the court trying to 
seek resolution of our clients' claims, because there is no 
guarantee with respect to that program whatsoever.  So we are 
in a position where we need to and want to move forward with 
discovery without further delay to be able to get to the merits 
of our clients' claims.   
Any discovery they would receive in these matters 
would be relevant anyway to those discussions with our 
presenting claims to the claims administrator.  So we see that 
as coinciding and being relevant and responsive to Epstein 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 10 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
being able to establish our claim, again, before the claims 
administrator. 
THE COURT:  All right.  And going back to your request
to compel discovery from defendant, you say that the time frame
is the issue.  I believe the letter was presented, it appeared
to say in general you hadn't gotten discovery responses to
document requests or interrogatories, and then you highlighted
this issue.  Is this really the key issue or the only issue or
are there other issues with respect to just not getting
responses?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, you are correct, your Honor.  At
the time we wrote the initial letter, the responses were --
there were not responses, there were just objections.  They
have since supplemented their responses but, again, limiting it
only to the time frame.  So we still may have issues with those
responses, because at this point we only can see them as to the
time period within which they are saying the abuse victims --
that time period where they were abused, so we don't believe
that they are fulsome at this point.  But if the court could
resolve the threshold issue of whether or not they have to
produce for the entire time period, they would then supplement,
or our assumption is that they would supplement their responses
both to interrogatories and to the requests for production, and
then we could evaluate at that point if it appears there is
anything missing.
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 11 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
THE COURT:  And why would it not be the case that,
document request by document request or interrogatory by
interrogatory, the inquiry might be different as to what time
frame would be appropriate to look at?  There might be some,
depending upon how the request is framed, where it would be
appropriate to look at a longer time frame; and there may be
some, based on the nature of the request, where that would not
make sense to look at a longer time frame.  Why should I be
doing this on a global basis?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, that's a very fair question, your
Honor.  So the requests, for example, seek information
related -- like the request number one is information related
to the plaintiff including diary, diaries, journals, calendars,
any information, travel itineraries that relate to that
plaintiff, and that could be in any time period.  For example,
if Epstein's last year was talking about one of our client's
and had information that he had recorded in an e-mail about one
of our clients, that would be responsive.
So the time period does pertain, in my view, to all of
the requests.  We have not -- they have not come to us and said
a particular request only applies for these reasons to one
particular year.  In my view, the request, for example, for
flight logs, if there are not flight logs in a certain year,
they would only produce what they have, obviously.  But if they
have flight logs for the entire time period, we would want
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 12 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
those.  So it is -- your Honor is correct that there can be
some request-specific issues, but they haven't agreed to
produce anything outside of the year of the abuse at this
point.
THE COURT:  Are there some requests that relate to
people other than your clients?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.
THE COURT:  Other than --
MS. McCAWLEY:  For example -- yes.
So as I said before, it is our position that, with 
respect to our clients' claims in each of the cases, 
information relating to Epstein's abuse of other victims is 
highly relevant under 415, particularly to establish that this 
pattern of luring in young girls in the same way, for example, 
with saying they are interviewing for a modeling job or saying 
they are coming for an assistant's interview, the pattern of 
how he lured girls in, then abused them is relevant to our 
clients presenting their claims to the jury to prove the truth 
of the fact that they have before, as well, abused in a similar 
manner.  So we firmly believe that that information is highly 
relevant to the case.   
Again, the estate has taken the position, and you have 
seen it in our filings, that Epstein is innocent, and we have 
to prove the truth of that, as well as with respect to all of 
these cases.  So we are in a position where we are having to 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 13 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
fight to get discovery from the estate.  I would was certainly 
hoping it would not be this kind of a battle.  I was hoping 
that now that he is no longer taking his Fifth Amendment 
privileges, no longer with us, that we would be able to get 
substantive discovery in a more streamlined manner, but that is 
not the case.   
And any threshold issue is very important because it 
implicates our clients' ability to be able to present their 
case and to be able to substantively be able to depose witness.  
As your Honor knows our discovery deadline is looming in early 
July.  We need to be able to take the depositions of various 
people who either interacted with our clients or who were 
witnesses to the abuses that occurred in Epstein's various 
homes, and we need the information and the documents from his 
files that establish and relate to the abuse, and those are the 
requests that we have put forward. 
THE COURT:  All right.  I have some thoughts on this,
but let me hear from defendants first.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Hi, your Honor.  Bennet Moskowitz.
If I may, I would like to address the program issue
first, which I think is much quicker than the discovery.  My
colleague, Matt Aaronson, will discuss the discovery issues, if
that's okay.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MS. McCAWLEY:  So I am very, very surprised to hear
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 14 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
Ms. McCawley give a presentation that seems like her clients
are lukewarm on the program.  She is on the e-mails from this
week where Brad Edwards, who represents five plaintiffs and we
understand the vast majority of claimants all of whom want to
participate in the program according to him, announced to us on
the estate side that he was able to get the Attorney General to
finally step aside and let the program move forward.  So my
first surprise is hearing that Ms. McCawley thinks that the
program is still in some vast limbo.  It is not for all of the
reasons that I discussed this morning, which Ms. McCawley is
aware of.
THE COURT:  Hold on a second.  We have two separate
conferences.  One was at 10:00 and this one is 11:00.  So when
you say that we discussed this morning, Ms. McCawley, unless
she didn't announce herself, was not on that call and doesn't
know what you said at that conference.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.
MS. McCAWLEY:  (Inaudible).
THE COURT:  I'm sorry?
MS. McCAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  This is Sigrid McCawley.  
I was unaware of the 10:00 conference call.  I'm 
sorry. 
THE COURT:  We had a conference call in certain of the
other cases with different plaintiffs' counsel where there were
somewhat different issues raised.

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.  And I am trying --
THE COURT:  I'm trying to cluster these so we don't
have to have a marathon session with all cases at once.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I am happy to concisely, as best I
can, go through the same points, and I will say now that I know
Ms. McCawley knows all of the following with perhaps one
exception, which I will explain.
Ms. McCawley knows that around 69 individual 
claimants, including her clients, have publicly come forward to 
voice overwhelming support for the program, including to the 
USVI probate court.  We know that is the vast majority of known 
claimants.  We are aware of only one claimant who is a state 
court plaintiff who has publicly said that she is not 
participating, and that was through her counsel, and I don't 
even know if that's that person's current position.   
Ms. McCawley also knows that seven plaintiffs in the 
SDNY action, including one of her clients, Maria Farmer, most 
recently stayed their actions in favor of the program.  It 
bears mentioning that Maria Farmer's -- you know, the 
stipulation in that regard goes contrary to everything 
Ms. McCawley just said.   
Your Honor entered that order, so I don't think I need 
to repeat it verbatim.  But mentioned in there was the notion 
of conserving resources, and in that regard, as a side note, it 
bears mentioning that Boies Schiller has been the biggest 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 16 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
culprit in driving up the estate's litigation cost, money that 
will never be available for their clients or other alleged 
victims in the program.  We don't understand that.  We were 
staffed very leanly until recently, just me and an associate.  
Five attorneys on their side, including three partners.  I have 
lawyers, my colleagues are on now for the team more recently, 
because Boies Schiller takes the most unreasonable positions on 
discovery, grossly overbroad view -- again, Mr. Aaronson will 
get to that -- and they make the most constant threat to motion 
practice notwithstanding their clients participating in the 
program.  
Ms. McCawley also knows that the protocol for the
program, which was done in close consultation between the
administrator and designers and claimants' counsel, including
hers, her firm, and with -- in between co-executors is nearly
finalized.  
And Ms. McCawley also knows the only reason this 
hasn't gone forward until now was because of the USVI Attorney 
General.  But again, Mr. Edwards announced a couple of days ago 
in an email that Ms. McCawley is on that that last, quote, 
lingering issue, as Mr. Edwards put it, is now resolved.  And, 
again, there are a few less contentious matters to iron out, 
but it is our firm expectation that by sometime next week that 
resolution in principle will be formalized.   
The sole thing that Ms. McCawley may not be aware of 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 17 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
is that if something unexpected happens and that resolution in 
principle is not finalized, then by June 15, our current intent 
on the estate side is to move forward with the program absent 
the probate court entering an order directing us not to or 
otherwise impeding that, and I don't think that's going to 
happen because another person who has voiced support for the 
program is the probate judge who, on February 4, at a hearing 
that Ms. McCawley attended, as did David Boies, the probate 
judge said the following:  "I think we agreed that everybody 
believes this program is a great program."   
So I will say that I don't understand why we get one 
display of overwhelming support from Boies Schiller and others 
when we are not before your Honor, and then we come before your 
Honor and I hear a different story.  The program is going to go 
forward very soon.  I am confident of that.  And I'm confident 
that, per Ms. McCawley's own statements, all of her clients, 
not just the one who stayed her action already, are going to 
participate.  So, again, every dollar we are spending in the 
meantime is money that will never be available for that 
program.   
That's all I have to say on the program aspect.  
Unless your Honor has questions, I will refer to my colleague, 
Mr. Aaronson, to address the discovery issues. 
THE COURT:  Let me hear the discovery issues.
MR. AARONSON:  Good morning, your Honor.  Matthew

K5m2FarC                  
Aaronson.
I want to correct a couple of misstatements that 
Ms. McCawley made.   
It is not the estate's position that documents that 
relate to the claims asserted by the plaintiffs will not be 
produced.  In fact, all of our discovery responses have 
identified that to the extent the request seeks information 
about plaintiffs, they will be produced.   
We also identified to your Honor in the letter that we 
sent to you -- 
THE COURT:  Hold on.  Let me interrupt you.  Without
regard to time frame or only within a specific time frame?
MR. AARONSON:  I was about to clarify that.  We said
in our letter to your Honor without regard to time frame with
respect to the plaintiffs.  And in fact, that is something
that, your Honor, the problem we have here is, we were still
under the impression we were meeting and conferring with
plaintiffs' counsel on these issues, and we put that in our
letter.  And before we could even -- you know, we told them we
would consider their positions, and before we could even
conclude that, they filed a letter with the court.  I think you
are aware, our initial letter to the court said that we were
sort of surprised by that and we are saying it is premature.
We still think these issues are premature.  
But the simple fact is, your Honor, our position is we 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 19 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
are producing any documents that reference orally to the 
plaintiffs.  And in fact we have searched documents for that.  
So there is no dispute there, there is no issue there.   
We are not saying that the time period for documents 
relating to plaintiff is limited in that way, shape, or form.  
What we did say was, these are events in some situations, 
Theresa Helm, incidents that happened on one day in 2002, and 
we are saying it is not proportional to ask for our client, the 
estate, to search for documents relating to a 20 -- I guess it 
would be a 19-year period, your Honor, relating to people who 
may have worked at a property that Mr. Epstein owned and in 
fact property that Mr. Epstein -- Ms. Helm doesn't allege she 
ever visited.  You know, it's a scope issue.   
But, again, to the extent there is an allegation that 
Ms. Helm -- I'm sorry, there is a document that references 
Ms. Helm, we have agreed to produce it.  We searched for those 
documents.  And the same applies for all of the plaintiffs.   
So I want to make it very clear that that is a 
misstatement of what our position is. 
You know, again, the scope here is just so overbroad,
beyond plaintiff, that we think it is not proportional to the
case.  We disagree completely with Ms. McCawley's statement
that any of that discovery is necessary for her to prove her
claims.  Her claims in this case are a simple claim of battery.
That's the claim in this case.  That's her burden to prove and

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
that is it.  And we have agreed to provide documents that
relate to her claims.  If she says she was at a property on a
certain date, we have identified to the best of our ability
people who may have been at that property that date.
You know, I'm not sure what more we are obligated to 
do, your Honor.  And this is a part of the problem.  If they 
have complaints about search terms, then meet with us to talk 
about search terms.  Before we could finish the process, they 
ran into court.  We are open to a dialogue.  We have always 
been open to a dialogue to try to resolve these issues.  But, 
as we told you, they prematurely went to court to try to -- you 
know, to try to get in front of your Honor before we could even 
finish that. 
We have a lot of requests, your Honor, that are just
completely unrelated to these cases.  I don't think it's
appropriate now to go through each one right now.  But I just
wanted to clarify that this concept that it is a -- we are not
agreeing to produce documents about the plaintiffs is wholly
untrue, and I just wanted to make that very clear.
THE COURT:  Okay.  So let me go back on plaintiffs'
side.  I'm not going to make any blanket ruling, and I'm not
persuaded that you have conferred fully in good faith before
bringing the motion, in part, because you have already said
that some of it is moot because in fact when you got responses,
you no longer had a complete absence of information, and now
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 21 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
you are really just focused on the time frame issue.  That
tells me that when you wrote the initial letter you hadn't
conferred fully in good faith to see what really had to be put
before the court.
With respect to the time frame issue, it sounds like 
defendant is prepared to and planning to produce documents 
without regard to time frame that refer to your clients or 
relate to your clients, and it also sounds like defendants are 
willing to confer with respect to other requests.   
As far as those other requests go, the test for 
relevance is not whether something is relevant to a general 
subject matter of a case, it's whether it is relevant to a 
claim or defense asserted in the case.  It may be with respect 
to some of the requests where time frame is at issue that the 
documents sought are in fact highly relevant to a defense 
that's been asserted in the case, for example.  It may be that 
they are tangentially relevant.  It may be the burden is great.  
It may be the burden is modest.  It may be that -- let me just 
make sure I didn't lose counsel.   
Do I still have plaintiffs' counsel? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Do I still have defendants' counsel?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  If anyone joined from the public or
press, I will please ask you to mute your phone.

K5m2FarC                  
Did anyone join who is an attorney in one of the cases
in front of me?  No.  All right.
I lost the thread a little bit of what I was saying, 
but the point is that if this is in front of me with 
particularized disputes, I'm going to have to look at each 
document request at issue or each interrogatory at issue, hear 
from the parties about the particular relevance to a claim or a 
defense, hear from the defendant about the particular arguable 
lack of relevance or burden, and make item-by-item 
determinations.  I'm not going to do it in a blanket fashion, 
and you are going to have to confer on that kind of level to 
get it focused for me, if it comes back to me, so that I 
understand just what the documents are that are being sought, 
just what the claim of relevance is, just what the purported 
burden is, just what the proportionality is so that I can make 
that assessment balancing relevant factors. 
Now, the other issue that we have is resources and
settlement and whether the dollars that are spent by 
defendants in litigating the case and responding to discovery
requests might be better spent by being put into a fund if
plaintiffs are planning to participate in that and whether it
is a consideration that I should take into account, whether we
should have any kind of extended period of time for the
responses so that you can see if you are going to participate
in the program if the kinks are worked out.

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
In the earlier conference we had today, what I did was 
allow the parties to have a bit of a hiatus in their cases, to 
conserve resources, asking for a status letter by June 19 with 
the understanding that the estate was planning to move forward 
with the program no later than June 15 absent something they 
thought would be extraordinary to stop it from doing so. 
So on plaintiffs' side, let me hear whether you think
it makes sense to give it a window of time before there is
increased attorney's fees spent to see if in fact that program
is moving forward and you might be participating in it.
And in any event, let me hear what you have to say 
about my view that perhaps you should be conferring further in 
good faith about these time frame issues on a 
request-by-request basis. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course, your Honor.  This is Sigrid
McCawley for the plaintiff.
With respect to the issue of a hiatus, my concern
there would be that we, as you know, back in November, talked
about this program, and while Mr. Moskowitz has made
representations on this call, you will understand that those
were the same representations that he was making back in
December and January and, for a number of reasons, that program
has just not moved forward.  Now I'm hearing for the first time
this June 15 date that I have not heard before.
The problem I see with any kind of hiatus -- and, to 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 24 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
be clear, we don't want to, of course, expend unnecessary 
estate resources.  The issue that I have with that is it is the 
continued delay and the part of the disadvantage to my clients 
in that they don't have information, all of the information 
they need relevant to their claims because they haven't 
received -- even though we have tried diligently, they have not 
received substantial production in the case of any kind.   
So with respect to a hiatus, my concern would be that 
right now our discovery deadline is set for early July.  We 
were hoping to get documents in order to be able to start 
taking some of the necessary depositions to get information for 
our case to be able to move it forward, and I believe that is 
something that we would be entitled to.  I think that my 
concern is that, again, it would be a July 15 date, then it 
would be -- I'm sorry, a June 15 date, then a July 15 date, and 
it would continue without us being able to move the case 
forward.   
Also, as you know, the claims program is voluntary.  
So to the extent that a client does participate in that and 
gets paused, we don't know what that claims administration 
program is going to ultimately prove to be.  So to the extent 
that a client participates and is offered something or not 
offered anything, their case should be moving forward so that 
they are able to go to trial on the merits of their claims, if 
they need to, against the estate.  So that would be my concern 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 25 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
with making any change at this point.   
Again, we are not -- the discovery, in my view, has 
moved very, very slowly.  So just to pull back and not have 
them continue to engage with us on discovery, in my view, would 
be problematic, because it would just further delay the case.   
So those are my concerns generally with respect to 
that.   
And, again, I'm hearing from the other side this June 
date that I have no confidence that that is something that 
will necessarily move forward because we don't have anything in 
writing with respect to that or any statement from the court in 
the USVI that they have approved that or anything of that 
nature.  So that was my concern there. 
With respect to the issue before the court, we are in
a position where the time frame issue is significantly
problematic to us for the reasons that I have outlined.  While
they are representing to the court today that they will produce
documents related to the plaintiff, you will remember that we
have --
THE COURT:  What did they say in their responses that
you got in?  Did they say these documents will be produced or
is it just they are saying this for the first time to the court
today?
MS. McCAWLEY:  With respect to the plaintiff, they
represented they would run the name of the plaintiff in their
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 26 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
discovery searches and produce with respect to the plaintiff,
yes, that they did.  
THE COURT:  Why -- 
MS.McCAWLEY:  But the problem --
THE COURT:  Why did you tell me earlier on in the call
that they were refusing to produce any documents for the later
time frame even with regard to the plaintiff?
MS.McCAWLEY:  That is my understanding of their
position, your Honor.  I am hearing now that they are saying --
well, first of all, they have only produced one document for
Theresa Helm's case, one document for Jane Doe's case.
THE COURT:  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  This is
complete lack of meaningful dialogue between the parties,
because I'm hearing opposite things from the parties about what
defendants' position is.  Defendant, as I understand it from
this call, has said that they will, and have told you that they
will, produce documents regardless of time frame if they refer
or relate to the plaintiff, and that they are doing that in
fact in all cases and have not taken a position that they would
not.  And you are saying that is your understanding of their
position, that they will not.
How can that be if you have had a good conference 
between you? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, as we set forth in our
letter, we did have a two-hour conference where we asked them
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 27 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
about the time frame issues and made sure to get the full
position on that because that was our biggest concern.  And
that is what we discretely presented to the court because that
was the concern we have, that they were not going to be
producing anything beyond the time period of the abuse.
(Indiscernible crosstalk) 
THE COURT:  -- discretely presented to the court.  You
presented to the court in your opening letter that there was a
complete failure to respond to any of the requests, and now you
tell me on the call that since then there has been a response,
and so what is now being discretely presented on this telephone
call is what you say is a remaining issue, which seems like it
is only a remaining issue in part because it seemed like if
there are documents specifically relating or referring to the
plaintiff, defendants have agreed to produce it and according
to defendants have told you they have agreed to produce it in
their responses that you have since gotten.  Now, I haven't
seen those responses.  If they have been put before me, I'm
sorry, I have not reviewed them.  I don't think I have them.
For that matter, I'm not sure I have all of the requests, I'm
not sure I have an item-by-item explanation of relevance, and
I'm not sure that your discussion has been adequate between the
lawyers.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley for
the plaintiff.

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
I appreciate that.  I am hearing your Honor.  We will 
go back and address these issues again with the defendants in 
the hopes of being able to resolve them and not hopefully have 
to come before the court with respect to them.  We are, again, 
hopeful to be able to get discovery in this case.  We do not 
believe that has been the situation that we are in presently, 
and that's why we have presented it to the court.  But I 
understand your point, your Honor, and we will make sure to 
engage further in the hopes of being able to resolve this. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Let me ask, on defendants'
side, by when do you plan to produce -- assuming we have no
stay of discovery here and no hiatus, by when do you plan to
produce the documents referring or relating to plaintiff?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We have already started that, your
Honor.  Bennet Moskowitz, excuse me.  And in fact, I apologize.
Let me let Mr. Aaronson address that question.  And then, if I
can, I would like to just very quickly respond to something
Ms. McCawley said about the program.
THE COURT:  Let me hear first about the documents -- 
MR. AARONSON:  Yes -- 
THE COURT:  -- regarding the production.
MR. AARONSON:  Yes, your Honor.  Matthew Aaronson.  
We have already started the production.  We made a 
production I believe on Wednesday of documents, and I think in 
particular Ms. Bryant it was over 100 documents.   
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 29 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
So with the process underway -- and, again, I think, 
your Honor, you have gotten this correct, is that we have told 
them that we will produce and search for -- search for and 
produce documents that relate to their clients.  To the extent 
that they think we need to add additional search terms, we 
searched the individual plaintiffs' names.  If there are 
additional search terms, we are open to a dialogue to discuss 
that.  If there are additional terms, as in every case, whether 
or not we can reach agreements on those terms.  You know, the 
thing -- 
THE COURT:  I would like to put a deadline on getting
the production complete with respect to any documents that in
any way refer or relate to the plaintiffs after you have had
some further discussion perhaps on search terms, if necessary.
But I would like to have a firm date when you are not just
producing a few documents and a few documents and say it is
underway, that that actually gets produced.  Once -- 
MR. AARONSON:  That's fair, your Honor.  Part of that
goes back to the same issue you raised earlier about the
expenditure of time and money on discovery issues versus
putting it towards the program.  
So to the extent the court is not inclined to issue a 
pause or some sort of temporary issue on that, it's hard to 
say.  The problem we have is that, you know, it is difficult to 
search all of our files, given the pandemic.  Some files have 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 30 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
not been able to be collected yet.  So I can tell you that, of 
the electronic documents that we have collected, I think we can 
keep that probably within 30 days of what we have collected 
already.   
But I will tell you, we have done the initial pass of 
that, and we have made those productions.  As I said, Juliette 
Bryant there was a significant number of documents.  Presumably 
other plaintiffs there were not.  So, again, we do believe that 
it would be appropriate (unintelligible) some of this, but to 
the extent the court is not inclined to do that, you know, I 
think 30 days for what we have.  But to be clear, your Honor, I 
don't know that we have collected every, you know, source at 
this point in time, given our inability to collect documents 
dues to the pandemic. 
THE COURT:  How has the pandemic affected your ability
to collect documents specifically?
MR. AARONSON:  I will let Mr. Moskowitz speak to that,
but my understanding is, you know, that we have not been able
to access and people are not traveling to different locations.
So we have collected electronic documents.  I'm not -- again,
I'm deferring to Mr. Moskowitz on that, whether or not the
additional documents are still out there.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  Bennet Moskowitz.  Happy to
clarify that point, your Honor.
There are two -- let me take a step back.  Yes.  It is 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 31 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
true that we have collected over 700 and I think 40,000 
documents, and we did search them for the plaintiffs' names.  
And we did produce what we found that wasn't privileged, and we 
will go back and make sure that that is complete.  But the fact 
that we located many documents for Juliette Bryant, which were 
dated to as late as I believe last year and have already been 
produced, so I don't understand Ms. McCawley's confusion about 
the time frame issue.  But in any event, the fact that we found 
those but didn't find such documents for the other cases just 
evidences a lack of documents, not something wrong with the 
search process.   
In terms of the pandemic difficulties, my problem with 
making a 30-day blanket representation is that there are at 
least some hard copy files that I would like certain people to 
look through, and while I have no reason one way or the other 
to expect their responsive materials are there, I would like 
that to happen before such deadline, and I'm not 100 percent 
certain that it can, because at least some of the documents are 
in places that are still under lockdown or there are still 
health concerns.   
In addition to that, this is somewhat subject to the 
disputes about the scope of the discovery.  If Ms. McCawley is, 
let's say, correct and these cases -- everything related to any 
allegedly bad thing Mr. Epstein ever did is relevant in each 
action, well, then, it could take me, you know, six months or a 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 32 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
year to finish looking for every piece of paper and every 
property Mr. Epstein owned.  So, again, it's with the context 
of just searching for names.  Mr. Aaronson is correct, that can 
be done in the next 30 days, with the exception of anything 
that we can't actually access to look through.   
And again I have -- 
THE COURT:  You have already --
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.
THE COURT:  You already have the documents
electronically, at least certain of the documents, most of the
documents.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.
THE COURT:  And you have already gone through them and
you have already made some production.  Why would you need
another 30 days before you can get to the end of that
particular road?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We may not.  It really depends on the
rest of the meet-and-confer process which never completed.  It
depends on the search terms that are proposed, whether there
are any additional search terms proposed.  For example, what we
wanted to happen during a full meet-and-confer process, which
is what we strive to do in every case, and what we are actually
doing in other actions against the estate, that Boies Schiller
is not involved with, is suggest search terms to us that you
think would satisfy your view of what a particular request
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 33 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
entails, let us run the report.  If the report comes back and
says 500 documents or even a thousand, we may deem that
reasonable for that request.  If it comes back at 10,000, we
may not deem that reasonable.
So this is part of what an ongoing discussion, I hope, 
would have entailed, which gives me pause to, again, say a 
blanket yes, we will get it all done in 30 days.  As to 
searching for things, I mentioned the plaintiffs in what we 
have already collected, to the extent we didn't complete that, 
you know, we don't need 30 days.  But I don't know that that 
will satisfy Ms. McCawley. 
THE COURT:  Okay.
If this case goes all the way forward in litigation
and goes to trial, you are going to try this case.  You are not
going to try ever case that is before this court or any other
court at the same trial.  That doesn't mean that evidence
regarding others who are claiming to have been victims of
Mr. Epstein might not have relevance to some claim or defenses
being raised, and I understand that it may, in some documents,
may have relevance.  
But you are going to have to get, on plaintiffs' side, 
a lot more focused with what you want and why you want it.  And 
if you are going to come back and make a renewed application to 
me, that application is going to have to be more focused on 
what kind of documents you are talking about, what claim or 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 34 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
defense they are relevant to, why they are relevant to that 
claim or defense, giving me an example of some case law that 
shows how it could be relevant, and I will make a decision on a 
request-by-request basis about what appropriate time frames 
should be used.  And with respect to search terms, in the first 
instance you need to talk to each other about that because you 
don't want the court coming up with search terms or trying to 
make judgment calls on that if it's not necessary.  You know, 
you are much better off trying to figure it out between you, 
getting an agreed protocol, an agreed list of custodians, an 
agreed list of search terms, and then go from there, as 
generally happens in cases where there might be a lot of 
documents that are kept electronically.  So I expect you to go 
through that process as you would in any other case.   
I am open to kicking out your deadlines a bit to give 
you time to talk this through and to see if we can get some 
progress.  I'm going to ask defendants, to the extent you 
already have a known universe of documents, if there are any 
you have not yet produced, get them produced within two weeks.  
If there are additional search terms, you will talk with each 
other in good faith about time frame for running any additional 
searches and getting any additional documents produced.  And if 
plaintiff wanted to come back to me on a renewed motion that's 
more specifically laid out on particular categories of 
documents or responses to interrogatories, you will do that

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
after you have tried to work these things through with an eye 
toward what is what is reasonable.  Plaintiff may reasonably 
need more than defendants want to give.  Defendants may have a 
reasonable point about conserving resources for the sake of a 
settlement program which should be taken seriously because it 
seems that very serious efforts are underway to try to get that 
program off the ground. 
I'm going to ask for a status letter by June 19, which
is the date that I gave in other cases.  It is geared to
Mr. Moskowitz's representation that this program should launch,
he thinks, by June 15.  So it seems to me by June 19 you will
have a better idea and you will also have a better idea of
where you are with respect to these discovery issues.
I'm going to caution plaintiffs' counsel in the
future, please do not send me something without being sure you
are at the end of the road in talking to your adversary.  I
don't want to get a response that says it is premature, we
haven't really talked.  Make sure you are clear on a
point-by-point basis that you have talked about specific
relevance, that you have talked about specific burden issues,
that you have talked about specific search terms, at least you
have try to engage in that kind of dialogue.  If you are
stymied, you are stymied, and I will hear from you.  But I
don't think you are at that point.
And I think that's it with respect to those disputes,
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 36 of 57

K5m2FarC                  
and I should probably turn to the dispute regarding
Ms. Maxwell.  What I am going to do is I am going to -- I don't
know if the letters were framed as a motion for a conference or
a motion to compel.  If they were framed as a motion for a
conference, I will say granted.  We had a conference.  As to
the underlying issue about compelling, go talk or in if
actually framed as a motion, I will say denied without
prejudice to renew, and I'm going to ask for a status letter by
June 19.  
Anybody want to say anything else on that before I 
turn to Ms. Maxwell's issue? 
No?  Okay.  I'm hearing no, or I am hearing nothing.  
Hopefully I haven't lost everybody on the entire call.  I'm 
hearing laughs, so hopefully that means not. 
Let me turn to Ms. Menninger's issue.  One thing I
want to understand, because there was a reference to a
potential criminal prosecution which of course could impact
whether there should be a stay as to a defendant who is being
criminally prosecuted.  Currently, if I'm understanding
correctly, Ms. Maxwell may be the target of an investigation,
or you may be concerned she is the target of an investigation
but there are no actual criminal charges pending, is that
right?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, that's correct, your Honor.  We
do not have any criminal charges pending anywhere, but we have

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
a number of public statements by the U.S. Attorney's office in
the Southern District, as well as statements made by
plaintiffs' counsel to the press that suggest that those --
that that investigation is underway and that it would encompass
Ms. Maxwell, and so that is our concern.  But it is correct to
say that there is no active criminal charges that I am aware
of.
THE COURT:  All right.  So if there were active
criminal charges filed or if that should happen, that might
influence the thinking about whether or not there should be a
stay, because of course if a defendant ends up taking the
Fifth, that could have consequences in a civil case and
defendant may feel there is little choice but to do that if the
person is under a criminal indictment or if plaintiffs have
filed.
So I just want to just note that if that circumstance 
change -- if that circumstance changes, let me know.  If it 
affects any ruling I make, let me know, because I may need to 
revisit a ruling. 
Let me hear what -- given the last conference, the
last subject, where there seem to be some changed landscapes
since the application was initially made, let me make sure that
I am aware of the current circumstance.
Let me just hear from Ms. Maxwell's counsel first on 
this.

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
MS. MENNINGER:  Thank you, your Honor, Ms. Menninger
here on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.
The landscape has not changed since our letters.  We 
have filed a motion to dismiss the claims which we believe are 
distinct and different from any sort of example that the estate 
may have, and we believe that they are strong grounds for 
dismissal.  The case -- the allegations against Ms. Maxwell in 
this case involve an allegation of battery that occurred one 
time in 1996 in New Mexico, and the statute of limitations and 
venue issues, you know, in New York versus New Mexico are very 
different for Maxwell than perhaps for the estate and we think 
provide the grounds for dismissal. 
The other two bases that we raise for a stay are the
claims program that your Honor has already spent some time
discussing on this call and the earlier call today.  We
believe -- we don't have any independent information.  We were
not party to the calls in the Virgin Islands, as were counsel
for plaintiffs and for the estate.  But I have heard on the
call today the representations made by the estate that they
believe that the program will be getting off the ground in a
matter of a few weeks, June 15, or three weeks or so from
today.  
Given that plaintiff has indicated an intent to 
participate in that program, at least in filings in the Virgin 
Islands, and the fact that that program would -- if she

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
participates and it is successful, would render this entire 
lawsuit moot, we think we believe balancing that fact against 
the extremely broad discovery demands that your Honor has heard 
something about, although not with respect to Ms. Maxwell yet, 
would counsel in favor of at least a short stay similar to the 
ones that other plaintiffs' counsel have agreed to, promoted, 
or even stipulated to in other cases pending before your Honor.   
We have received extensive discovery demands.  We have 
been advised that plaintiffs' counsel intends to take a number 
of depositions, including around the country, including for 
people that plaintiff in our case never met and had no dealings 
with.  And, your Honor, I can speak from personal experience 
with that same type of discovery happening with the same 
plaintiffs' counsel in the Giuffre v. Maxwell action that I was 
counsel for in front of Judge Sweet.  We had a number of 
significant discovery disputes in that case and we had 
depositions that occurred not only across the country, from 
California to New York and Florida and many places in between, 
but also abroad in that case, and the litigation costs were in 
the hundreds of thousands easily in that case.  And so looking 
at the pattern of discovery that I believe plaintiff intends to 
pursue here, balancing the costs of those to someone like my 
client, who is not a multimillionaire, and then viewing the 
claims program as something that could be successful in 
resolving this case in a short period of time, we would ask 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 40 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
your Honor to consider putting a stay on discovery in the 
Farmer case that I am party to, or I am counsel for a party to.   
I think I can second or third some of the things that 
have already been said earlier, so I don't want to waste the 
court's time with those.  But we have concerns that any money 
spent on this litigation is going to reduce the amount of money 
that would be available to any of the accusers in the Virgin 
Islands, and we don't think it makes sense to spend the money 
on these broad discovery requests if we can get the case 
resolved shortly.   
I think the only objection that I heard from 
plaintiffs' counsel to something like a hiatus was that there's 
a pending discovery cutoff of early July, and it seems to me 
reasonable that of course if the claims program gets off the 
ground in a few weeks, that discovery cutoff could be set out 
to see if it is successful or not.  And so it is sort of a 
false premise to say that the discovery cutoff in July is the 
reason we should be forging ahead full steam with this 
expensive discovery, rather than just taking the more logical 
approach, to me, which would be to at least put it on hold to 
see if the claims program is successful in the first instance; 
and, if not, then the cases can proceed with the court's 
blessing, pick back up where we left off.   
In this particular case, I think it also bears noting 
that the claim allegedly occurred in 1996, so it has been some

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
years since the allegations supposedly happened, and so I 
don't see that waiting one or two or three months balanced 
against 24 years is -- it's not as though we think documents 
will go missing in those three months that weren't already 
somehow lost to the winds of time over the last 24 years, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT:  So you are -- I will just note, by the
way, that in your initial letter you ask for an opportunity to
do full briefing, but it is all laid out in the letters.  So
let me just get some clarification on that.  What more briefing
would you be looking to do beyond what's in these letters?  You
have case citations in these letters and you lay out the bases
for a stay.  What would you be looking to do when you are
trying to conserve resources?  Do you really need full
briefing.
MS. MENNINGER:  I think it could be abbreviated
briefing; but, yes, there are more cases in support of the
request that we are making.  There are more cases in terms of
the criminal investigation versus active prosecution, and then
there is certainly a fair amount of exhibits that I could
tender to your Honor to display the breadth of discovery that
is part of the traditional balancing test when looking at a
motion to stay -- or good cause -- of grounds for good cause as
balanced against the breadth of discovery.
THE COURT:  I don't remember if at the beginning of
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 42 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
this call I asked if my law clerk Hanna Martin was on.  Hanna,
are you there?
MS. MARTIN:  Yes, I'm here, Judge.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, for the court reporter, it is
Hanna Martin, H-A-N-N-A.
And Hanna and I were conferring before this conference
about some case law about some criminal prosecution as opposed
to criminal investigation, and we weren't finding, at least on
an initial look, cases where the courts tended to stay civil
proceedings when there was an investigation proceeding.  You
have cases that say the opposite?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I have some.  They are not
in the Southern District, so there are -- 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
MS. MENNINGER:  -- cases that have occurred in various
federal and state cases across the country.
THE COURT:  And you are looking for a stay of the
entire case, not just as to proceedings against your client?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, it seems to me best to
stay the case, but I would be amenable just in regards to my
client or, as I said towards the end of my letter, there are
other alternatives that, you know, I think I would view as
intermediate steps, for example, bifurcation of discovery on
the statute of limitations issue, for example, if that were
something the court thought were appropriate or a stay on party
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 43 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
depositions until later in the discovery process to see where
the claims program and the criminal investigation end up, and
certainly with regard to the motion to dismiss, that should be,
I would think, decided at some point.
THE COURT:  I might consider, because there is a lot
to do in this case, I might consider putting a hold on
Ms. Maxwell having to make statements, so either responding to
substantive interrogatories or being deposed because of Fifth
Amendment issues, because it may be that she ends up the
subject of prosecution even if she is not yet and because there
are other things that can meanwhile be going forward.  If we
put her deposition further down the pike, maybe we will have
greater clarity on that before that issue actually comes to the
fore.
I'm also thinking that there are other interests 
besides hers in this case.  There are plaintiffs' interests and 
I'm sure that although your point is well taken that it's not 
that likely that documents will now not be preserved within 
these few months as opposed to not being preserved over the 
years, I'm sure plaintiff does not want to hear that after all 
of these years she must wait more time in order to have what 
she considers to be serious wrongs redressed.  So the factors 
can cut in more than one direction. 
So right now I'm not inclined to stay the whole case,
but I am inclined to keep one eye on settlement, to keep one

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
eye -- I'm not sure how many eyes I have -- to keep an eye on
the -- any criminal investigation and ask to have updates if
there are charges filed, and maybe put some things more at the
front end of the discovery period, some things more at the back
end of the discovery period.  And I am willing to move the
dates out some to accommodate the parties if the parties are
engaged in good-faith discussions, if there is a desire to
conserve resources because it looks like the claims program is
in fact going forward.  I am willing to do that.  I have done
that another cases.  I have stayed other cases.  I have
extended deadlines in other cases.  I don't really want to see
resources going to litigation if it's not necessary.  But right
now I'm not inclined to have a complete stay of everything.
Ms. Menninger, what would be your reaction to saying
hold off on anything that could be in the category of
affirmative statements made by Ms. Maxwell for now and having
other discovery going forward?
MS. MENNINGER:  It does address -- this is
Ms. Menninger, again, Laura Menninger.  
It does address many of my concerns.  I would say, you 
know, the costs related to the broad discovery demands that 
were propounded, written discovery requests and the like, are 
still of concern to me.  As I mentioned, we have been asked for 
every calendar she has had for the last 24 years and every 
Amazon account she has ever used for the last 24 years.  So 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 45 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
I -- 
THE COURT:  That sounds to me, again, like you need to
have a discussion with plaintiffs' counsel and, plaintiffs'
counsel, it sounds like you need to have a discussion with
Ms. Menninger about what you really need, why you really need
it, how it can be done in a way that's manageable with no
absolute yeses and no absolute nos with respect to those sorts
of requests.
It may be that there is something about Amazon
accounts that's really critical, and you can explain that.  And
maybe there is something else that's not really critical, and
you can, you know, bend a bit on it.  So you need to have that
kind of discussion to keep, you know -- you know, to keep
discovery tailored to the case and proportionate to the needs
of the case.  That has to do with time frame, that has to do
with the scope of what's being claimed in a particular case,
and to some extent it has to do with Mr. Epstein's accused
conduct over time.  So you are going to have to try to have
that conversation and try to balance it.  And if you can't,
then I will.
MS. MENNINGER:  I appreciate that, your Honor.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is --
THE COURT:  Yes.
MS. McCAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  This is Ms. McCawley.  Can
I address --

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
THE COURT:  Absolutely.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Please go ahead.
MS. McCAWLEY:  With respect to the motion to stay that
Ms. Maxwell is proposing, one of the bases that she has filed
motion to dismiss, Judge Schofield held a premotion conference
with respect to that --
THE COURT:  Hold on a moment, please.  Do I still
have -- do I still have -- I know I still have Ms. McCawley.
Do I still have Ms. Menninger?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Do I still have Mr. Moskowitz?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Did anyone join us who is another
attorney?  Okay.  Hopefully we didn't lose anybody.  If anyone
joined from the public or press, welcome.  Please keep your
phone on mute.  
Okay.  Go ahead.  You were saying, Ms. McCawley? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.  So we did hold in front of 
Judge Schofield a premotion conference on Ms. Maxwell's motion
to dismiss.  As Judge Schofield did with the estate, she
discouraged Ms. Maxwell from filing a motion to dismiss, giving
her preliminary views that they -- the arguments that she was
putting forth were not meritorious.  Ms. Maxwell insisted on
filing a motion to dismiss and has done that now, just this
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 47 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
week.  So in my view, that is -- bodes against any sort of stay
based on the motion to dismiss because the district judge has
set forth her views with respect to that at least as an initial
matter.
With respect to the case law, your Honor is correct,
the case law in New York is clear that unless there is an
indictment put forward, which there has not been, it doesn't
allow somebody in a civil case to stay the case on the basis of
a possible investigation.
With respect to your Honor's statements about the
investigation and potentially allowing Ms. Maxwell to not have
to make statements in this civil action, the concern I have
there is that we have no indication of any time frame with
respect to the Southern District of New York, how long that
investigation could go on or will go on or anything of that
nature.  So the concern, for me, is Ms. Maxwell, as we have
alleged, worked in concert with Mr. Epstein to abuse my client.
We brought those claims under the Child Victims Act, as we are
allowed to do, because she was a minor, and to not be able to
get a discovery and ask Ms. Maxwell questions and get responses
and keep the case moving forward puts us in handcuffs with
respect to being able to establish our claims because, as your
Honor has seen from the complaint, the allegations are that
they worked together hand in hand with respect to the abuse of
Annie Farmer.  So I would have concerns about some form of that
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 48 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
kind of a path for defendant Maxwell in the case at this time
until there is a criminal indictment that's put forward.
THE COURT:  All right.  Let me just say a few things
about that.
First of all, if the investigation is going on here in 
New York, or for that matter wherever it may be going on, 
because what we have in New York is not only in New York with 
respect to COVID-19, the grand jury process is understandably 
delayed because it is very difficult to have jurors convene.  
So there may be additional time before any case that is being 
investigated is indicted, and so we just have to recognize that 
we are in somewhat unusual circumstances. 
The second thing is that any stay that I might put in
place with respect to any aspect of the claims against
Ms. Maxwell would be temporary and would be revisited.  I would
not allow it to drag on indefinitely.  But in a case where some
things can be done to move the case forward and the case is not
completely stalled, I don't see any harm in putting some things
a little bit further down the road.
The third thing I will say is this is also an unusual
circumstance because of the potential of this claims process in
which plaintiff may well participate and which may well get off
the ground soon; and, if it does, I'm not sure whether it would
moot claims against Ms. Maxwell or not, but it might.  And as
you balance those factors, you have this situation where we may
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 49 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
know in the relatively near future whether plaintiff is
actively participating in the claims process, whether it looks
like it is going to resolve her claims, and we may never have
to get to the point where we jeopardize, potentially jeopardize
somebody's Fifth Amendment rights.
So I might be inclined to do this, to say, look, you 
can carry on with discovery in the case after a conference on 
all kinds of things, to try to keep costs under control and try 
to focus on what's most important.  I will extend deadlines out 
if you would like if you are feeling pressure from that.  We 
will hold off on -- not on production of documents from 
Ms. Maxwell but on the statements that she makes, whether sworn 
statements or interrogatories or deposition, we will put that a 
little bit further down.  You will give me status report 
regarding the process of settlement, and we will take stock.   
And with respect to holding off on interrogatory 
responses or deposition by Ms. Maxwell, that will not be a 
permanent situation, that will be revisited.  And if time is 
stretching out too far and if there is no indictment, then I 
may take further briefing on the subject and I will make a 
decision as to whether in fact that part of the case should 
also go forward.  But I will not let it drag out indefinitely.  
That is my current thinking. 
What say both of you on that?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, this is Laura Menninger.
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 50 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
That would be -- we would welcome that ruling, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Plaintiff?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, obviously we disagree with
that because we believe that it's important to have
Ms. Maxwell's participation in this case.  We have noticed her
for a deposition already and that got moved because she -- you
know, the issue of just being able to be in person, things of
that nature.  We were trying to accommodate.  So we are
concerned about there being extended delay and are concerned
about not being able to get information from her through her
testimony.
We respect the court's concerns about a Fifth 
Amendment privilege but, again, we would ask that if you are 
going to be inclined to do something like this, you tie it to a 
date like the June 15 date, or something along those lines, so 
that we are not in a position where she is able to take 
depositions of all of our people and we are, you know, 
handcuffed with respect to any discovery with respect to 
Ms. Maxwell. 
THE COURT:  Like I said, I have no desire to have this
drag out.  If all things -- if we didn't have this potential
claim process out there with a fairly soon, seemingly likely,
start date, according to defendants, then I think the balance
would be different.  Because I don't think the case law in this
circuit would generally support the stay when there is no
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 51 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
prosecution pending yet.
But nonetheless, there are a number of factors one 
might look at on that, and whether or not an indictment is 
pending is only one of the factors.  There are several factors 
that could be relevant, including, and I'm going to refer you 
to the Louis Vuitton Malletier case.  For the court reporter, 
L-O-U-I-S V-U-I-T-T-O-N M-A-L-L-E-T-I-E-R v. Ly, L-Y, U.S.A., 
Inc., and the case number is 676 F.3d 83 from 2011.  So the 
Second Circuit noted that courts often take a look at a number 
of factors in deciding whether there should be a stay, 
including the extent to which the issues in the criminal case 
overlap with those presented in the civil case.  Here, there 
would be, I assume, a very strong overlap to the status of the 
case, including whether the defendants have been indicted.  So 
that's a factor.   
Three, the private interests of the plaintiff in 
proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to 
plaintiffs caused by the delay.  Here I'm looking at the 
potential settlement process and that, to me, is an unusual 
factor that suggests that the plaintiffs' interests may be 
divided here in proceeding fast with this case when there is a 
potential settlement within the next few months potentially 
available to plaintiffs and plaintiff may go for that.   
Another factor is the private interest of and burden 
on the defendants.  We do have an individual here.  We are not 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 52 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
talking about the estate, and there is somewhat more burden for 
discovery.   
There are the interests of the courts.  The interest 
of the court is not to have unnecessary litigation if the 
matters can be resolved amicably, and not to have it stretch 
out forever.  That's also an interest of the court.   
We also have this strange overlay of COVID-19 which 
affects the ability for criminal prosecutors to take matters to 
a grand jury.   
The public interest, I think the public interest is -- 
would be well served by a claims process.  If you look at this 
case in terms of there being a number of claim victims, and 
that is something that I definitely am looking at and is 
weighing into my consideration as to how any and all of these 
cases should be litigated.  And in several of the cases, which 
claims that are no more recent than the claims here, a lot of 
plaintiffs' counsel have agreed to stays or partial stays or 
are holding off on certain things to conserve resources and 
allow that process to play out a bit, and I think that those 
are factors that are unusual in this case.  This is a 
case-by-case, specific analysis that has to be made as to 
whether there should be a stay. 
So in this particular case, at this particular time,
with these particular circumstances, it seems to me to make
sense not to stay the case in its entirety, to send counsel

off to have the kind of good-faith conference you should have
had before contacting me in the first place and that you should
always have about anything and everything as you try to work
through discovery issues, but to hold off on the most serious
of the issues with respect to Ms. Maxwell, which are her
constitutional rights, and not forever, but at least long
enough to let us know whether the claims process is likely to
go forward.  And I will revisit it, and I will revisit it at
intervals that are reasonable and that does not put you in
limbo where you will never be able to get discovery from
Ms. Maxwell if this case proceeds.  All right?
So let me ask straight out, are you, under the 
circumstances I have described and the way in which I would 
envision this, which is some discovery going forward, 
good-faith conference, report to me by June 19 about the 
status, are you looking to have me move out the discovery 
schedules at all and, if so, by how long? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley.  
Would it be possible to have some time to consider 
that?  Right now the discovery deadline is set for July 10, I 
believe, and I of course have anticipated taking depositions 
throughout June and into early July.  So if I could have some 
time to consider what that would look like and confer with the 
other side, then if we can't agree, then maybe present 
something to the court with the timing of that?

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
THE COURT:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not usually in the
habit of suggesting extensions, but I think here, rather than
be crunched with depositions and panicking at the end of June
and beginning of July, putting another 30 days on it to give
you time to talk through your issues and for me to have fuller
briefing on the issue of a stay, should it come to that, it
might make sense to at least give you another 30.
MS. McCAWLEY:  That would be fine, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Mr. Moskowitz, do you want to say
anything?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Just very quickly, your Honor.  
That 30-day initial extension for the further 
discussion makes perfect sense to us.  I would say you laid 
out -- your Honor laid out very compelling reasons, one of 
which is unique to this action, but the others equally apply to 
the other actions that we are here now before you on, so I 
would hope that we could also discuss with Ms. McCawley keeping 
the extensions in line for each case with those other 
considerations in mind.  It's something we will discuss.   
The only other thing I wanted to mention is -- which I 
didn't get a chance to mention earlier is that Ms. McCawley 
mentioned various concerns about the program.  That could be 
more convincing from someone but for the fact that they already 
stayed one of their clients' actions in favor of the program.  
So I just don't -- it doesn't square with us that those 
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF   Document 57   Filed 06/03/20   Page 55 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
concerns are such that they can't take the same reasoned 
approach in the other actions when they found it reasonable for 
one of them already.   
But other than that, I have nothing to add, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So I'm going to ask for a status
report by June 19.  In that status report, I not only want to
hear about how discovery is going and how settlement prospects
are looking.  I also want to hear about further discussions
with counsel for Ms. Maxwell and mapping out of how the parties
would anticipate things moving further from that point, and,
you know, Ms. Maxwell permitting not to respond to
interrogatories and not to have her deposition until the
parties have had a chance to confer, until I have had that
status report June 19, until I hear again from counsel as to
the next logical way to proceed with that, and I will kick out
discovery deadlines 30 days, which is modest.  Others, I think,
are going to be kicked out longer.  You can do whatever
planning you do for depositions to be happening a little
further down the road in July, and you will get back to me.  As
need be, we will have another conference and we will take in
the next piece.  Okay?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Anything else -- 
MS. MENNINGER:  Thank you, your Honor.

THE COURT:  -- before we end this call?
All right.  Let me just say one last thing, which is, 
I did record this call into the conferencing system, but you 
also have a court reporter on the call.  You don't need to have 
a transcript made from the telephone recording.  And just be 
aware that if there are two transcripts made -- one from AT&T 
and one from the court reporter -- and there is any 
discrepancy, the court reporter's transcript will be the 
official transcript and will control.  Okay? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you all.  Take care,
everybody.

1At the hearing held on February 4, 2020, while the Court did not allow the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands to intervene, the Court did request the Co-Executors and the Attorney General to resolve their differences 
concerning the proposed compensation program. which has garnered the support of all interested parties, including 
claimants' counsel. The Co-Executors now inform that "(b]ecause the need for the Program has grown increasingly 
urgent, and with the support of claimants' counsel and the USVI Attorney General - and because the remaining 
impediments have been resolved and the interested parties have consented to the Protocol."' they and the Attorney 
General have reached an agreement in which the latter will promptly lift previously imposed liens to pay amounts 
owed for the Program and to begin funding the Program's active operations, including payment of compensation 
determinations to eligible claimants. Co-Executors' Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program and 
Presentation of Program Protocol, at 6, June I. 2020.
