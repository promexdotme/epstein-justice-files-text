UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JULIETTE BRYANT, 
Plaintiff, 
CASE NO: 
v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
in their capacities as the executors of the  
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN,  
Defendants. 
_____________________________________ 
COMPLAINT 
BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 1 of 16

Plaintiff Juliette Bryant, by her attorneys Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, for her Complaint 
against Defendants, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn in their capacities as the executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein (“Epstein”), avers upon personal knowledge as to her own 
acts and status and upon information and belief and to all other matters as follows: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1.
This suit arises out of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of Plaintiff beginning when Plaintiff
was 20 years old that lasted years and included trafficking Plaintiff to each of his homes in the 
United States and Paris. 
2.
Plaintiff was a young girl living in South Africa with hopes of becoming a model when
she was approached by one of Epstein’s recruiters about a prospective modeling opportunity in 
the United States and invited to a restaurant to meet Epstein, who was dining with a former high 
U.S. Government official, a famous actor, and a well-known comedian.  What appeared on the 
outside as a legitimate opportunity to break into the modeling business in the United States 
turned into years of horrific abuse and manipulation at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein.   
3.
Epstein’s trafficking scheme involved recruiting young females by making false promises
and using his wealth, power and threats to intimidate the females into submission to his 
demands.  This same pattern was repeated numerous times with numerous young women. 
4.
As United States District Judge Kenneth Marra found, “From between about 1999 and
2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor girls . . . at his mansion in Palm Beach 
Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas. . . . In addition to his own sexual abuse 
of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually.  Epstein used paid 
employees to find and bring minor girls to him.  Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 2 of 16

minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.”  
Doe 1 v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1204 (S.D. Fla. 2019) (internal citations omitted).   
5. 
Epstein organized this sex trafficking network to obtain hundreds of young females for 
himself for sex, and also lent these females out to other powerful and wealthy individuals to be 
sexually abused.  
6. 
Epstein conspired with others and hired staff to maintain and keep secret this network of 
sexual abuse for years, which sprawled throughout Epstein’s residences in New York, Florida, 
New Mexico, the United States Virgin Islands, and Paris.  Epstein’s preference was to have three 
different young females a day for his sexual pleasure. 
7. 
  Despite his significant criminal activity, in 2008 Epstein received a shockingly minimal 
charge, pleading guilty to a single Florida state law charge of procuring a minor for prostitution 
and a non-prosecution agreement (a “NPA”) with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida.  Unknown to the public and the victims at the time, Epstein’s lawyers were pressuring 
the Government to commit to the NPA without informing the victims.  Epstein’s multiple 
victims were kept in the dark and told to be “patient” while Epstein’s lawyers worked to protect 
him and other potential co-conspirators from prosecution.  Epstein served one year in jail, but 
was afforded the privilege of being able to leave the jail to go to work for twelve hours per day, 
six days per week. 
8. 
The NPA allowed Epstein to escape proportionate punishment for his actions and to 
continue operating his sex trafficking enterprise with liberty.   
9. 
A few years later, Epstein flippantly referred to his sexual abuse of multiple minors, and 
the slap on the wrist he had received for it, in a 2011 interview with the New York Post: 
“Billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City – and making wisecracks about his 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 3 of 16

just-ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl. ‘I am not a sexual predator, I’m an 
offender,’ the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a 
person who steals a bagel,’ said Epstein.”  Amber Sutherland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein:  I’m a 
Sex Offender Not a Predator, N.Y. Post (Feb. 25, 2011), 
https://nypost.com/2011/02/25/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-im-a-sex-offender-not-a-predator/. 
10. 
In August 2018, just one year before his death, Epstein told a New York Times reporter 
“that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it 
was perfectly acceptable.”  James B. Stewart, The Day Jeffrey Epstein Told Me He Had Dirt on 
Powerful People, N.Y. Times (Aug. 12, 2019), 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html. 
11. 
When Plaintiff was 20 years old, Epstein added her to his long list of victims by 
committing sexual assault and battery against her.  As such, Epstein is responsible for battery 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to New York common law.  The damage 
to Plaintiff has been severe and lasting. 
12. 
This action has been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of a criminal action against the 
same defendant to commence an action with respect to the event or occurrence from which the 
criminal action arose.  A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking 
enterprise from which Plaintiff’s claims arise was terminated on August 29, 2019. 
13. 
This action has also been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-C, which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have 20 years to file civil claims “for physical, psychological or other injury 
or condition suffered by such person as a result of conduct which would constitute rape in the 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 4 of 16

first degree as defined in section 130.35 of the penal law.”  Epstein raped Plaintiff within 20 
years of filing this Complaint. 
14. 
Any statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiff’s claims, if any, is tolled due to the 
continuous and active deception, duress, threats of retaliation, and other forms of misconduct that 
Epstein and his co-conspirators used to silence his many victims, including Plaintiff.  Epstein’s 
actions deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity to commence this lawsuit before his death.  Until his 
death, Plaintiff feared that Epstein and his co-conspirators would harm her or her family, or ruin 
her life, if she came forward. 
15. 
Defendants are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense.  
Allowing Defendants to do so would be unjust.  Epstein and his co-conspirators intimidated each 
of his victims into silence by threatening their lives and their livelihoods.  They therefore 
prevented Plaintiff from commencing this lawsuit before his death.  By using threats, along with 
his wealth and power, Epstein was able to escape punishment for his intolerable and brutal 
crimes against countless young women and underage girls for the duration of his life. 
PARTIES 
16. 
Plaintiff Juliette Bryant is a citizen and resident of South Africa. 
17. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
18. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
19. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin Islands at 
the time of his death.  Jeffrey Epstein maintained a residence in the Southern District of New 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 5 of 16

York.  As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Darren K. Indyke and 
Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
20. 
The amount in controversy in this action exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.00 
excluding interests and costs and is between citizens of different states.  Accordingly, 
jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  
21. 
Venue is proper in this Court as Epstein’s sexual abuse of Plaintiff began in New York, 
New York, where he recruited her at the age of 20 and began grooming her for sex in his 
organized sex trafficking ring. 
22. 
Many of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the Southern District 
of New York, where a substantial amount of Epstein’s property is located.  Thus, venue in this 
district is proper.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. 
Epstein’s Sex Trafficking Enterprise 
23. 
 Jeffrey Epstein was widely renowned as a billionaire who used his vast connections to 
powerful individuals, and seemingly unlimited wealth and resources, to create a web of 
transcontinental sex trafficking that served himself, his co-conspirators, and some of the most 
powerful people in the world. 
24. 
Epstein owned multiple residences and frequently travelled between them, including at 9 
East 71st Street, New York, New York 10021, and at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New 
Mexico 87056, where the illegal sexual crimes against Plaintiff occurred.  Epstein conservatively 
valued his New York townhome at $55,931,000.00.  Epstein conservatively valued his New 
Mexico ranch at $17,246,208.00.  In addition, Epstein owned residences in the Virgin Islands, 
Florida, and France, and even on his own island, Great St. James Island, where his 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 6 of 16

transcontinental sex trafficking of hundreds of young females servicing him, his co-conspirators, 
and wealthy and powerful individuals around the world occurred. 
25. 
The allegations herein concern Epstein’s tortious acts against Plaintiff while at Epstein’s 
mansion in New York, his home in Florida, his home in the Virgin Islands, his apartment in 
Paris, and his New Mexico ranch. 
26. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein utilized his seemingly 
unlimited power, wealth, and resources, as well as his deep connections to powerful and 
politically connected individuals to intimidate and manipulate his victims of sexual abuse.  
27. 
Epstein and his co-conspirators had perfected a scheme for manipulation and abuse of 
young females.  As part of the scheme, a female “recruiter” would approach a young female and 
strike up a conversation in an effort to quickly learn about the young female’s background and 
any vulnerabilities they could expose.  The recruiter would then manipulate the young female 
into coming back to one of Epstein’s residences by offering the young female something she 
needed.  At times the recruiter’s lure would be a modeling opportunity, money for education, 
help for the young female’s family, and a whole host of other related offers depending on their 
target’s situation.  Once in the residence, the recruiter and Epstein would work in concert to 
impress and intimidate the young female with displays of vast wealth, including having 
employees that were butlers and maids formally dressed around the house.  They would also 
strategically place photographs of very powerful political and social figures amongst 
photographs and art displaying nude females in an effort to normalize the sexual abuse.  They 
would also normalize the sexual abuse by placing a massage table and spa related products 
around the massage area in an effort to legitimize the area where the abuse was set to occur.  
Once abused, Epstein and his co-conspirators continued to manipulate the victims, using their 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 7 of 16

financial power, promises, and threats to ensure that the victim returned as directed and remained 
compliant with their demands. 
B. 
The Arrest, Prosecution, and Death of Epstein 
28. 
The sexual trafficking ring described herein started at least as early as 1995 and 
continued up until at least July 2, 2019, when the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of New York (“SDNY”) charged Epstein with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. He was arrested on July 8, 2019, pursuant to the SDNY’s Sealed 
Two Count Indictment, which is attached as Exhibit A. 
29. 
The Indictment described Epstein’s conduct and his abuse and trafficking of females in 
the same trafficking operation he used to abuse and traffic Plaintiff. 
30. 
Epstein’s last will and testament (the “Will”) was executed on August 8, 2019, at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. The witnesses were Mariel Colón Miró and Gulnora Tali.  The 
Will included affidavits from Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in which they swear an 
“Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and Appointment of Local Counsel.” 
31. 
Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 
2019.  
32. 
Epstein’s last will and testament was filed on August 15, 2019, in the Probate Division of 
the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
33. 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court 
of the Virgin Islands for Epstein’s 1953 Trust on August 26, 2019.  See Certificate of Trust, In 
the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Aug. 26, 
2019). 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 8 of 16

34. 
Epstein’s will was entered into probate on September 6, 2019, and the Superior Court of 
the Virgin Islands accordingly authorized Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn to administer 
Epstein’s estate.  See Order for Probate, In the Matter of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate 
No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019); Letters Testamentary, In the Matter of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019). 
35. 
The Will’s first article directs Epstein’s executors “to pay from my estate all expenses of 
my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my estate and all 
of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate.”  The Will further directs that “after the 
payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST,” Epstein “give[s] all of my property, real 
and personal, wherever situated . . . to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust.” 
36. 
Following Epstein’s death, SDNY submitted a proposed nolle prosequi order in the 
criminal matter against him because it was required by law to do so after Epstein was deceased.  
On August 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman formally dismissed SDNY’s 
indictment against Epstein, terminating the criminal action against him.  Plaintiff’s claims are 
therefore timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
C. 
Juliette Bryant 
37. 
Plaintiff Juliette Bryant was born on July 23, 1982, in South Africa.  
38. 
In 2002, Juliette was 20 years old and an aspiring model.  In Cape Town, Naja Hill, an 
American model, approached Juliette in an attempt to befriend her.  Hill asked Juliette if she 
would like to meet Epstein, who she called the “King of America.”  Hill described Epstein as a 
well-connected billionaire who could help her with her modeling career and explained that he 
was visiting Africa with a former high U.S. Government official, a famous actor, and a 
well- known comedian.   
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 9 of 16

39. 
Juliette considered meeting Epstein an amazing opportunity because modeling in New 
York City had always been one of her biggest dreams.  Hill brought Juliette to a restaurant to 
meet Epstein, who at the time was dining with the former high U.S. Government official, the 
famous actor, and the well-known comedian.  Juliette had never met a celebrity before.  She was 
invited to attend a speech the former high U.S. Government official was giving in Cape Town 
the next day, and was escorted to the speech by police cars with individuals associated with the 
former official. 
40. 
Later, Epstein asked Juliette to bring her modeling portfolio to his hotel for “casting.”  
Epstein told Juliette that he owned a modeling agency and would get her an agent in New York.  
He also mentioned that his good friend, Les Wexner, owned Victoria’s Secret, a lingerie 
conglomerate. 
41. 
Within a few days, Leslie Groff began calling Juliette.  Groff told Juliette that Epstein 
wanted to bring her to New York City to model.  Groff, who was in New York at the time, 
helped Juliette get a visa, passport, and airline tickets.  It was Juliette’s first time traveling 
overseas, so she was nervous.  Epstein called Juliette’s mother from New York to assure her that 
Juliette would be safe with him in New York. 
42. 
Within two weeks, Juliette arrived in New York.  A car picked her up from the airport 
and brought her to an apartment building on 66th Street, where Epstein housed some of the other 
models who he was abusing.  But Juliette was not there for long.  Shortly after arriving at the 
apartment, Sarah Kellen, another one of Epstein’s co-conspirators, called and told Juliette that 
Juliette was going to the Caribbean.  Juliette did not understand why she was traveling to the 
Caribbean so soon after arriving in New York City, but hoped it was for a modeling job. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 10 of 16

43. 
  Juliette was taken on Epstein’s private plane.  During the flight, Epstein began sexually 
touching Juliette’s leg.  She felt trapped and terrified, and feared that she would be killed.   
44. 
They arrived at Epstein’s home in the Virgin Islands.  Epstein’s abuse of Juliette there 
began when Kellen sent Juliette to Epstein’s room to massage him.  For the rest of the trip, 
Epstein repeatedly raped Juliette by forcible compulsion.  Kellen repeatedly sent Juliette to 
Epstein’s room, where he would touch her, use massage devices on her, force her to perform oral 
sex on him, and sexually force himself on her.  Juliette also witnessed another young girl 
performing oral sex on Epstein in front of Juliette while they were watching a movie.  Juliette 
was terrified of Epstein and his power.  No one knew where she was and she believed that if 
anything happened to her, no one would ever know. 
45. 
Instead of fulfilling her dreams of becoming a model in New York City, Juliette was 
subject to extreme and repeated sexual abuse.  Epstein’s sexual abuse of Juliette was humiliating 
and degrading, and caused Juliette to cry herself to sleep each night.  She felt trapped and alone 
on Epstein’s private island.  Juliette learned very quickly that Epstein was incredibly powerful 
and that she should not disobey his demands.   
46. 
Epstein’s abuse of Juliette lasted for years. Epstein forced her to travel to the United 
States many times to see Epstein and be subjected to repeated sexual abuse for one to two weeks 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 11 of 16

at a time, sometimes staying in his New York apartment.   Epstein never introduced Juliette to a 
modeling agent, and she was never hired for a modeling job. 
47. 
For those years, Juliette felt like a prisoner and was afraid of betraying Epstein because of 
his money and power.  She was afraid he would hurt her or her family.  In fact, the very first time 
Epstein brought Juliette to the United States, in order to scare her, he told her that when another 
woman had accused him of rape, he planted drugs in the woman’s apartment and had her sent to 
prison. 
48. 
Epstein made very clear to Juliette that he was incredibly wealthy, powerful, and 
regularly in contact with world leaders.  In fact, in his New York mansion he had photographs 
displayed of significant political figures to ensure that any young female entering the home 
would know that he had extensive government connections.  Epstein was not to be disobeyed and 
he made clear by his words and actions that there would be consequences if Juliette did not 
comply with his demands.   
49. 
Juliette was also forced to travel to Epstein’s home in Paris where she had to stay with 
Ghislaine Maxwell, one of Epstein’s main recruiters of young females, and where Sarah Kellen 
forced her to be photographed nude for Epstein.  During that trip, Juliette witnessed that young 
females were on call to sexually pleasure Epstein.   
50. 
Juliette’s final trip to the United States was in 2004.  She flew to see Epstein at his New 
Mexico ranch, called “Zorro Ranch.”  Epstein abused Juliette at Zorro Ranch.  During that trip, 
Epstein took Juliette with him to meet another important government official.  Juliette complied 
and went with Epstein.  At the meeting, Juliette believed that Epstein had brought her there so 
that the official could look her over.  Juliette felt very uncomfortable and she and Epstein began 
to fight because he claimed she was not being obedient.  Epstein then informed Juliette that he 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 12 of 16

wanted her to travel with him on his plane to California and serve drinks to some of his scientist 
friends who were going to be flying with him to California.  But before the flight, after an 
argument with Epstein, Juliette flew home to South Africa.  This was the last time Juliette visited 
Epstein. 
51. 
Epstein attempted to keep in contact with Juliette through e-mail over the years.  For 
example, in 2016, Epstein e-mailed Juliette to ask if she knew Sarah Ransome, another woman 
who was a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme.  In June 2019, only two months before his 
death, Epstein sent Juliette an e-mail asking her to send him nude photographs. 
52. 
Juliette was deeply affected by her harrowing experiences at the hands of Epstein.  She 
developed eating disorders that affected her for years afterwards.  She also suffered from 
substance abuse, debilitating panic attacks, and severe anxiety.  
53. 
Epstein’s sexual assault and battery of Juliette continues to cause her significant distress 
and harm. 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Battery) 
54. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1–53 as if fully 
set forth herein.  
55. 
Epstein intentionally committed battery by sexually assaulting Plaintiff on numerous 
occasions at his homes in New York, New Mexico, Florida, France, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  
As described above, on multiple occasions over a years-long period, Epstein raped Plaintiff and 
intentionally touched intimate parts of her body in an offensive and sexual manner without her 
consent. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 13 of 16

56.
Epstein’s actions constitute sexual offenses as defined in New York Penal Law Article
130, including but not limited to rape in the first degree as defined in Article 130.35, inasmuch as 
Epstein engaged in sexual intercourse with Plaintiff by forcible compulsion.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. 
§ 213-C.
57.
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from
which Plaintiff’s first cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
58.
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, anxiety, panic attacks, 
psychological trauma, loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION  
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) 
59.
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1–53 as if fully
set forth herein. 
60.
As a direct result of these allegations as stated, Epstein committed intentional infliction of
emotional distress against Plaintiff. 
61.
Epstein’s actions, described above, constitute extreme and outrageous conduct that
shocks the conscience.  Epstein’s plan to recruit, entice, rape, and assault Plaintiff on multiple 
occasions goes beyond all possible bounds of decency and is intolerable in a civilized 
community. 
62.
Epstein knew or disregarded the substantial likelihood that these actions would cause
Plaintiff severe emotional distress. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/14/19     Page 14 of 16

63.
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from
which Plaintiff’s second cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint.  See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
64.
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, anxiety, panic attacks, 
psychological trauma, loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests judgment against Defendants, awarding 
compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at 
trial; costs of suit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just 
and proper.

WAIVER OF THE SERVICE OF SUMMONS 
To: 
David Boies 
(Name of the plaintiff's attorney or unrepresented plaintijJ) 
I have received your request to waive service of a summons in this action along with a copy of the complaint, 
two copies of this waiver form, and a prepaid means of returning one signed copy of the form to you. 
I, or the entity I represent, agree to save the expense of serving a summons and complaint in this case. 
I understand that I, or the entity I represent, will keep all defenses or objections to the lawsuit, the court's 
jurisdiction, and the venue of the action, but that I wai e any objections to the absence of a summons or of service. 
I also understand that I, or the entity I represent, must file and serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 within 
days from 
JI /?.SI I~ 
, the date when this request was sent (or 90 days if it was sent outside the 
United States). If I fail to do so, a default judgment will be entered against me or the entity I represent.

Duty to Avo id Unnecessary Expenses of Serving a Summons 
Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain defendants to cooperate in saving unnecessary expenses of serving a summons 
and complaint. A defendant who is located in the United States and who fai ls to return a signed waiver of service requested by a plaintiff located in 
the United States will be required to pay the expenses of service, unless the defendant shows good cause for the failure. 
"Good cause" does not include a belief that the lawsuit is groundless, or that it has been brought in an improper venue, or that the court has 
no j urisdiction over this matter or over the defendant or the defendant's property. 
If the waiver is signed and returned, you can still make these and all other defenses and objections, but you cannot object to the absence of 
a summons or of service. 
If you waive service, then you must, within the time specified on the waiver form, serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 on the plaintiff 
and file a copy with the court. By signing and returning the waiver form, you are allowed more time to respond than if a summons had been served.

Dear Judge Freeman:  
Pursuant to the Court’s request at the November 21, 2019, Case Management Conference, 
Plaintiffs and Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein, jointly submit this letter to provide the Court with an update as to the progress 
of discussions regarding both discovery and settlement. 
The parties have thus far engaged in two productive conferences pursuant to Rule 26(f) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  During those conferences, the parties agreed to exchange 
initial disclosures by January 23, 2020, and to exchange discovery plans one week thereafter, on 
January 30, 2020.   
As the Court is aware, Defendants have arranged for a Victims’ Compensation Program 
that will be available to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has conferred with the Program’s designers 
and administrators, the Program’s administrators provided Plaintiffs with a proposed protocol for 
the Program, and Plaintiffs have provided some feedback to the administrators.  The motion for 
the Superior Court of the United States Virgin Islands to approve the establishment of the Program 
will be heard on February 4, 2020.  
The parties request a conference with the Court on February 6 or 7, 2020, to resolve any 
potential disagreements as to how these matters should proceed.  The parties will provide the Court 
with their proposed discovery plan(s) 48 hours before any such conference.

DEBRA FREEMAN, United States Magistrate Judge: 
The above-referenced cases - all brought by plaintiffs claiming that they were sexually 
abused by Jeffrey Epstein and seeking damages from his estate - have been neither consolidated 
for any purpose, nor designated as "related" by the Court. Nonetheless, these cases (together 
with certain other, similar cases, not listed above) have been referred to the undersigned for 
general pretrial supervision, so that discovery - and potentially settlement - may be coordinated 
as reasonable. While, at the parties' request, discovery in the other Jeffrey Epstein cases referred 
to this Court has been stayed pending a further report on the parties' settlement efforts, the 
parties to each of the above-referenced cases have requested, by submissions dated January 10, 
2020, that this Court set a discovery schedule. This Court's having reviewed the parties' 
submissions, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
1. 
In each of the above-referenced cases in which the parties have not yet submitted 
a jointly proposed discovery plan pursuant to Rule 26( t) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
the parties are directed to submit a proposed discovery schedule for this Court's review no later 

Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 11   Filed 01/14/20   Page 2 of 2
than February 6, 2020. This submission should address all of the matters set out in Rule 26(t)(3), 
and should specifically include proposed deadlines for: 
a. 
service of initial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(l); 
b. 
service of initial document requests and interrogatories; 
c. 
any motion for joinder of other parties or amendment of the pleadings; 
d. 
completion of fact discovery; and 
e. 
expert disclosures and the completion of expert discovery, if any. 
. 
. 
2. 
As to each of the above-referenced cases, this Court will hold a pretrial 
conference pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on February 11, 2020, at 
10:00 a.m., in Courtroom 17 A at the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY 
10007. The parties should be aware, however, that the mere fact that this Court will be holding a 
single, joint case-management conference does not necessarily mean that this Court will set an 
identical discovery schedule in each case. At the conference, counsel should be prepared to 
address whether there are reasons why these cases should be treated differently for scheduling 
purposes.

Re: 
Juliette Bryant v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as 
executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF
Dear Judge Carter: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action.  We write 
pursuant to Your Honor’s Individual Practice § 2(A) to set forth the bases for the Co-Executors’ 
anticipated motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss the time-barred claims and 
punitive damages demand in Plaintiff Juliette Bryant’s (“Plaintiff”) Complaint (ECF No. 1). 
1. Plaintiff is a South African resident who alleges Decedent committed torts against 
her from 2002 to 2004 when she was an adult, in various jurisdictions.  
Plaintiff, who claims South African citizenship and residency, alleges that, from 2002 (when she 
was 20) to 2004, Mr. Epstein (“Decedent”), now deceased, committed various sexual offenses 
against her in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”), France, Florida, New Mexico and New York. 
(Compl. ¶¶ 16, 38, 50, 55.)  Plaintiff asserts two causes of action -- battery and intentional 
infliction of emotional distress -- and demands punitive damages. (Id. ¶¶ 54-64, p. 15.) 
2. Plaintiff’s causes of action are time-barred. 
CPLR § 202 provides that, when a non-N.Y. resident such as Plaintiff sues on causes of action 
accruing outside N.Y., the complaint must be timely under the statute of limitations (“SOL”) of 
both N.Y. and the jurisdiction where the claim accrued.1  Plaintiff’s causes of action expired by: 
2006 per the USVI’s 2-year SOL (5 V.I.C. § 31(5)(A)); 2008 per FL’s 4-year SOL (Fla. Stat. § 
95.11 (3)(O)); 2007 per N.M.’s 3-year SOL (N.M. Stat. § 37-1-8); and 2005 or 2007 per N.Y.’s 1- 
or 3-year SOL (CPLR §§ 214(5), 215(3)).  
3. Plaintiff’s attempts to plead around the statutes of limitations fail. 
Plaintiff erroneously alleges her claims are timely per CPLR § 213-c or § 215(8)(a), her claims 
were equitably tolled, and that the Co-Executors are equitably estopped from asserting an SOL 
defense (Compl. ¶¶ 12-15). Each of these arguments fails as a matter of law.   
“In diversity cases in New York, federal courts apply … C.P.L.R. § 202.” Commerzbank AG v. Deutsche 
Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., 234 F. Supp. 3d 462, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (citation omitted).

Hon. Andrew L. Carter Jr. 
January 24, 2020 
Page 2
First, neither CPLR § 213-c nor § 215(8)(a) applies here. The 20 year SOL in CPLR § 213-c 
became effective as of September 18, 2019; the SOL was 5 years as of 2006 and 1 year before 
then. (L. 2006, ch 3, § 5(b).) However, the 20-year SOL does not apply retroactively except 
“where the applicable [SOL] in effect on the date of such act or omission has not yet expired.” L. 
2019, ch. 315, §4. Therefore, CPLR § 213-c cannot revive Plaintiff’s claims arising from torts 
committed in N.Y.  
Separately, CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides: “Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the 
same defendant has been commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from which a 
claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff shall have at least one year from the 
termination of the criminal action …  to commence the civil action” (emphasis added). 
Decedent’s criminal indictment (the “Indictment”) attached to Plaintiff’s Complaint does not 
concern Plaintiff’s allegations.  Rather, the indictment charges Decedent sexually abused “minor 
girls” (Compl., Ex. A at ¶ 1), stating throughout that it concerns sex trafficking of “minors.” (Id., 
Ex. A at ¶¶2 - 4, 6, 8, 11- 15, 18 - 20, 22.) Because Plaintiff alleges she was an adult when 
Decedent abused her, her action and the Indictment arise from different occurrences. 
New York courts apply CPLR § 215(8)(a) narrowly. See Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 AD2d 
595, 596 (2d Dept. 1999) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied only to claims based on events of February 
26, 1993 and December 28, 1993, because it was only in connection with events of those two 
days that a criminal prosecution was commenced against defendant); Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 
2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435 (Sup. Ct. Dutchess Cnty. Oct. 23, 2018) (CPLR § 
215(8)(a) inapplicable where incidents charged in criminal action and those alleged in civil 
action occurred on different dates); McElligott v. City of N.Y., 15-cv-7107 (LGS), 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 201829, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2017) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) inapplicable to claims against 
civil defendants not charged as co-defendants in criminal action, notwithstanding same events 
gave rise to both actions).  Plaintiff alleges a far more tenuous connection to the Indictment than 
the criminal-civil links unsuccessfully asserted in those cases.   
Second, even if CPLR § 213-c and § 215(8)(a) apply, which they do not, Plaintiff’s claims for 
torts committed outside N.Y. are still untimely per the limitations periods of those jurisdictions 
and CPLR § 202.  While Plaintiff alleges Decedent raped her within 20 years of filing her 
Complaint (Compl. ¶13), she does not allege that occurred in N.Y. Plaintiff’s claims for torts 
outside N.Y. are untimely.  
Third, Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify 
tolling or equitable estoppel. Equitable tolling is only applied where a plaintiff is “prevented in 
some extraordinary way from exercising h[er] rights.” Viti v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 10-cv-
2908 (ALC) (MHD), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189633, at *30 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2012), adopted by, 
2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174145 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2013) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).   
Under this doctrine, a court may, “under compelling circumstances, make narrow exceptions to 
the statute of limitations … ‘to prevent inequity.’” Id. (emphasis added) (citations omitted).  “That 
the doctrine is to be employed only sparingly -- in ‘extraordinary’ and ‘compelling’ circumstances 
-- is reflected in the fact that the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to show that tolling is 
justified.” Id. (emphasis added) (citing Boos v. Runyon, 201 F.3d 178, 185 (2d Cir. 2000)).  A 
late-filing party seeking equitable tolling must also demonstrate she acted with “reasonable

diligence” in pursuing her claims during the period she seeks to toll.  Id. at *32 (citation omitted). 
Equitable estoppel only applies where a plaintiff knows her cause of action exists but the 
defendant’s conduct causes her to delay in bringing her lawsuit. Yesh, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
101744, at *5 (citation omitted). Equitable estoppel requires a plaintiff to show: (i) the defendant 
made a definite misrepresentation of fact and had reason to believe the plaintiff would rely on it; 
and (ii) the plaintiff reasonably relied on the misrepresentation to her detriment. Id. (citation 
omitted).  Tolling is inappropriate where, as here, a plaintiff fails to articulate any acts by a 
defendant that prevented her from timely commencing suit. Id. at *6 (citation omitted).   
Plaintiff’s threadbare allegations of “deception,” “threats” and the like (Compl. ¶14) do not 
establish “extraordinary” circumstances justifying tolling.  Nor has Plaintiff alleged (i) that 
Decedent made a misrepresentation to her and had reason to believe she would rely on it, or (ii) 
that Plaintiff reasonably relied on it to her detriment.   
4. Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law.2
Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim must be dismissed as a matter of law because none of the 
jurisdictions where the alleged torts occurred permits punitive damages against a decedent 
tortfeasor’s estate. See Poindexter v. Zacharzewski, 18-14155, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189861, 
at *6 (Nov. 5, 2018 S.D. Fla.) (“Florida law prohibits recovery of punitive damages from the 
estate of a wrongdoer who is deceased.”); Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 117 N.M. 
337, 346 (N.M. 1994) (“punishment and deterrence are not accomplished by enabling recovery 
of punitive damages from the estate”); NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1) (“an action may be brought or 
continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but punitive damages shall not 
be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought to recover damages for personal 
injury.”); Powell v. Chi-Co’s Distrib., ST-13-TOR-14, 2014 V.I. LEXIS 21, at *5 n.13 (U.S.V.I. 
Super. Ct. Apr. 3, 2014) (Restat. §908(2) “reflects the common law of this jurisdiction”).3 That is 
the law in most jurisdictions, as reflected in the Restatement.  See Restat. (Second) Of Torts § 
908 cmt. a (punitive damages not available against representatives of deceased tortfeasor).4
Courts in this District regularly dismiss punitive damages claims.  See The Cookware Co. (USA), LLC v. 
Austin, 15-5796, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177691, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2016) (dismissing punitive 
damages claim without leave to replead); SJB v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., 03-6653, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
13227, at *25-26 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 14, 2004) (dismissing punitive damages claims not statutorily available). 
To determine common law, USVI courts consider: (1) whether USVI courts previously adopted a rule; 
(2) the position taken by a majority of other jurisdictions; and (3) which approach is the soundest for the 
USVI.  Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Connor, No. S. CT. CIV. 2013-0095, 2014 WL 702639, at *1 (V.I. Feb. 
24, 2014).  These factors favor the Co-Executors: (1) pre-Banks, USVI courts expressed approval for 
Restat. § 908 (see Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 (D.V.I. 2009) (considering the 
inverse issue)); (2) a majority of other jurisdictions preclude punitive damages against a tortfeasor’s 
estate (2 Linda L. Schlueter, Punitive Damages § 20.4 (7th ed. 2015)); and (3) post-Banks, USVI courts 
have held § 908 is the soundest rule (Powell, supra.).   
France does not recognize punitive damages. Punitive Damages, supra., at § 22.4 (citation omitted).

New York, NY 10007 
Re:      Bryant v. Indyke et al., Case No. 19-cv-10479 
Dear Judge Carter, 
Pursuant to Individual Rule 2(A), Plaintiff Juliette Bryant hereby responds to Defendants’ 
request for a pre-motion conference in connection with their anticipated motion to dismiss.  Dkt. 
12.  Plaintiff’s claims are timely under New York’s statutes of limitation and the doctrine of 
equitable estoppel, and Defendants’ proposed motion “to dismiss” Plaintiff’s request for punitive 
damages is procedurally improper.  For the following reasons, the Court should deny Defendants’ 
anticipated motion in its entirety. 
I. 
Plaintiff’s Claims Are Timely Under New York Law. 
Plaintiff’s claims are timely under New York’s CPLR § 215(8)(a), which provides: 
“Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same defendant has been commenced 
with respect to the event or occurrence from which a claim governed by this section arises, the 
plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of the criminal action . . . to commence 
the civil action.”  (Emphasis added).  Here, Epstein’s criminal action in this District terminated on 
August 29, 2019.  Compl. ¶ 36.  Because Plaintiff filed the Complaint less than three months later, 
the action is timely under CPLR § 215(8)(a).  Defendants’ arguments against CPLR § 215(8)(a)’s 
application to these facts are meritless.  
First, Defendants’ argument that CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not apply because Plaintiff was 
not named as a victim in Epstein’s indictment is incorrect.  New York courts have held that CPLR 
§ 215(8)(a) is “plain, clear and unambiguous” that it does not require that the plaintiff be “the 
victim or the specific person upon whom the crime had been committed.”  Clemens v. Nealon, 202 
A.D.2d 747, 749 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994).     
Second, Defendants’ narrow construction of § 215(8)(a)’s “event or occurrence” language 
is improper, especially in light of the breadth of Epstein’s indictment.  The charges were not limited 
to crimes committed against specific victims.  For example, the overt acts alleged for the sex 
trafficking conspiracy charge were enticing and recruiting multiple victims, “including minor 
victims identified herein.”  Compl., Ex. A (S.D.N.Y Indictment) ¶ 22(a) (emphasis added).  As 
another example, the Indictment’s sex trafficking count charged Epstein with the sex trafficking 
of “numerous individuals . . . including but not limited to Minor Victim-1.”  Id. ¶ 24.  Nor did the

Indictment describe the sex trafficking conspiracy as exclusively targeting minor victims—it 
explicitly acknowledged that some victims were not underage at the time of the sexual abuse.  Id. 
¶ 11 (“[Epstein] knew that many of his New York victims were underage.”).  The Indictment was 
targeted at Epstein’s sex-trafficking scheme as a whole, and that scheme is the event or occurrence 
from which Plaintiff’s civil claims arose.  See Kashef v. BNP Paribas S.A., 925 F.3d 53, 56–57, 
(2d Cir. 2019) (guilty plea conceding “knowledge of the atrocities being committed in Sudan” 
allowed victims of the atrocities in Sudan use 215(8)(a) because causes of action arose out of 
defendant’s general conspiracy with Sudan to violate U.S. sanctions put in place to stop atrocities).  
Because Plaintiff’s claims arise out of this common scheme, they fall within CPLR § 215(8)(a).    
The cases Defendants cite are inapposite because the criminal charges in those cases were 
much narrower than Epstein’s, and related to events that occurred on specified dates.  See 
Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 A.D.2d 595, 596 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999) (prosecution commenced 
only in connection with events on two dates); Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. 
Misc. LEXIS 8435, at *3 (Sup. Ct. Oct. 23, 2018) (indictment “charged [the defendant] for 
incidents occurring on three (3) specific dates”).  Epstein’s Indictment was much broader, covering 
sexual abuse that occurred “over the course of many years” “from at least in or about 2002, up to 
and including at least in or about 2005.”  S.D.N.Y. Indictment ¶¶1–2, 8, 20, 24 (emphases added).  
Plaintiff’s claims are therefore timely under CPLR § 215(8)(a) because the scheme the S.D.N.Y. 
Indictment targeted is the event or occurrence from which Plaintiff’s civil claims arise. 
Plaintiff’s claims are also timely under CPLR § 213-c, which provides for a twenty year 
limitations period for “all civil claims or causes of action brought by any person for physical, 
psychological or other injury or condition suffered by such person as a result of conduct which 
would constitute rape” or other enumerated sex crimes.  The Complaint alleges that Epstein raped 
Plaintiff numerous times within the past twenty years.  See Compl. ¶ 44 (“Epstein repeatedly raped 
Juliette by forcible compulsion.”).  Plaintiff’s claims fall squarely within CPLR § 213-c’s coverage.  
Defendants’ assertion that CPLR § 213-c does not apply because “the 20-year SOL does not apply 
retroactively” is meritless.  CPLR § 213-c’s text contains no such limitation, and was revised last 
year (increasing the limitations period from 5 to 20 years) specifically to allow claims such as 
Plaintiff’s to proceed.  See June 17, 2019, New York Committee Report, 2019 NY S.B. 6574 (NS) 
(noting that “victims who have suffered in silence for decades have bravely spoken about their 
abuse, and have also laid bare the state’s limited ability to prosecute their abusers due to the 
passage of time” and that “this bill would increase the time period in which the victim could bring 
a civil suit for these offenses to twenty years”).    
Defendants also assert that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely under New York’s borrowing 
statute, CPLR § 202.  This argument fails for two reasons.  First, CPLR § 202 only applies to non-
residents who are injured outside of New York, and the controlling date for determining a 
plaintiff’s residence is the date on which the cause of action accrued, not the date on which the 
action was commenced.  See, e.g., DeMartino v. Rivera, 148 A.D.2d 568, 570 (N.Y. App. Div. 
1989).  Under the borrowing statute, the phrases “resident” and “domicile” are not synonymous. 
“Rather, the determination of whether a plaintiff is a New York resident, for purposes of CPLR § 
202, turns on whether [she] has a significant connection with some locality in the State as the result 
of living there for some length of time during the course of a year.”  Antone v. Gen. Motors Corp., 
473 N.E.2d 742, 746 (N.Y. 1984).  The fact that Plaintiff currently lives in South Africa is therefore 
irrelevant.  At the time of her repeated sexual assaults, Plaintiff was a resident of New York.  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 13   Filed 01/29/20   Page 2 of 4
BSF 

Epstein’s co-conspirators got Plaintiff a visa so that she could travel to New York often, and when 
she visited she stayed at Epstein’s New York home for one to two weeks at a time.  Compl. ¶¶ 41, 
46.  Because Plaintiff had a significant connection with New York at the time her cause of action 
accrued, she was a resident of New York, and CPLR § 202 does not apply.   
Second, even if New York’s borrowing statute did apply and Plaintiff’s claims were 
otherwise untimely, they would still not be barred because CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides for civil 
actions to commence within “one year from the termination of the criminal action . . . 
notwithstanding that the time in which to commence such action has already expired.”  
II. 
Plaintiff Has Sufficiently Pled Facts Supporting Equitable Estoppel and Tolling. 
Even if Plaintiff’s claims were otherwise time-barred under New York’s statutes of 
limitation (they are not), they would still be timely under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  
Defendants assert that Plaintiff “fails to meet her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances 
sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel.”  Dkt. 12 at 2.  But the Complaint alleges in detail 
the methods of intimidation and control that Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators used to deter 
their victims from seeking justice.  Equitable estoppel applies “where it would be unjust to allow 
a defendant to assert a statute of limitations defense,” Zumpano v. Quinn, 849 N.E.2d 926, 929 
(N.Y. 2006), due to “deception, concealment, threats, or other misconduct,” Zoe G. v. Frederick 
F.G., 208 A.D.2d 675, 675 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994).  The Complaint alleges that Epstein and his 
co-conspirators manipulated victims using “financial power, promises, and threats;” that Plaintiff 
was “afraid of betraying Epstein because of his money and power” and was “afraid he would hurt 
her or her family;” that Epstein tried to scare her by telling her that he had one of his accusers sent 
to prison; and that Epstein tried to keep in contact with Plaintiff after the abuse ended.  Compl. ¶¶ 
27, 47, 51.  The allegations concerning Epstein’s purposeful silencing of his victims (and Plaintiff 
specifically) easily provide the requisite “extraordinary circumstances” for equitable tolling. 
Because equitable estoppel and equitable tolling are fact-specific doctrines, Defendants’ 
attempt to resolve the issue at motion to dismiss is inappropriate, and any motion challenging 
whether or not those doctrines apply should be reserved until after the parties have conducted 
discovery.  See, e.g., Carelock v. United States, 2015 WL 5000816, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2015). 
III. 
The Court Should Address Punitive Damages After Discovery   
Federal Rule 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to file a motion to dismiss for “failure to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Defendants’ request for the Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s 
claim for punitive damages does not relate to either of Plaintiff’s clams (battery and intentional 
infliction of emotion distress) and does not relate to the sufficiency of the allegations in the 
Complaint.  The issue of what type of damages to which Plaintiff is entitled should therefore be 
dealt with at a later stage of this litigation.  See, e.g., Okyere v. Palisades Collection, LLC, 961 F. 
Supp. 2d 522, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying “motion to ‘dismiss’ plaintiff’s request for punitive 
damages as procedurally premature”).

II. 
Plaintiff’s Attempts To Invoke Extraordinary Statute Of Limitations 
Exceptions Fail....................................................................................................... 7 
A. 
CPLR § 215(8)(a) is inapplicable because the Indictment arises out 
of the alleged sex trafficking of minors, not adults such as Plaintiff. ........ 7 
B. 
CPLR § 213-c is inapplicable because it is not retroactive ..................... 10 
C. 
Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege “extraordinary” 
circumstances sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel .............. 12 
III. 
Plaintiff’s Claim For Punitive Damages Are Barred As A Matter Of Law ......... 16 
A. 
Banks factor one: previously, USVI courts favorably cited the 
Restatement section that precludes punitive damages against 
estates. ...................................................................................................... 18 
B. 
Banks factor two: a majority of U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an 
award of punitive damages based on the wrongful acts of a 
decedent ................................................................................................... 19 
C. 
Banks factor three: Post-Banks, USVI courts have favorably

Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), submit this memorandum of law in support of their 
motion, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint 
(ECF No. 1) because it is time-barred and Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages because it is 
prohibited by statute. 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
This action is time-barred. Plaintiff, who claims South African citizenship and residency, 
alleges that, from 2002 (when she was 20 years old) to 2004, Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Decedent”), now 
deceased, committed various sexual offenses against her in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”), 
France, Florida,1 New Mexico, and New York. (Compl. ¶¶ 16, 38, 50, 55.) Plaintiff asserts two 
causes of action—battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress—and demands punitive 
damages. (Id. ¶¶ 54-64, p. 15.) 
However, Plaintiff’s causes of action expired by: 2006 per the USVI’s two-year statute of 
limitations (5 V.I.C. § 31(5)(A)); 2005 or 2007 per New York’s one- or three-year statute of 
limitations (CPLR §§ 214(5), 215(3)); 2007 per New Mexico’s three-year statute of limitations 
(N.M. Stat. § 37-1-8); 2008 per Florida’s four-year statute of limitations (Fla. Stat. § 95.11 (3)(O)); 
and 2014 per France’s ten-year statute of limitations (Art. 2226 (1) of the French Civil Code). 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims are untimely and must be dismissed. 
In apparent recognition that her claims are time-barred, Plaintiff erroneously alleges that 
they are timely pursuant to CPLR § 215(8)(a)2 and CPLR § 213-c, they were equitably tolled, and 
In two conclusory allegations, Plaintiff lists Florida as one of the locations where she was assaulted (Compl. ¶¶ 25, 
55), but offers no factual allegations in support.  
CPLR § 215(8)(a) provides: “Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same defendant has been 
commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from which a claim governed by this section arises, the plaintiff 
shall have at least one year from the termination of the criminal action … to commence the civil action” (emphasis 
added). 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 8 of 28

- 2 - 
that the Co-Executors are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense. 
(Compl. ¶¶ 12-15.) Each of these arguments fails as a matter of law. 
CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not apply here because Decedent’s criminal indictment (the 
“Indictment”), which concerns alleged sexual abuse of minors, has nothing to do with Plaintiff, 
who alleges misconduct when she was an adult. Similarly, CPLR § 213-c fails because it does not 
apply retroactively, and Plaintiff’s claims had already expired by the time it was enacted in 
September 18, 2019. Plaintiff also fails to meet her burden at the pleadings stage to allege 
extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel. 
Finally, Plaintiff’s demand for punitive damages must also be dismissed as a matter of law. 
New York law, which applies here because New York has the greatest connection to this matter, 
expressly bars recovery of punitive damages in a personal injury action brought to recover 
damages from a decedent tortfeasor’s estate—i.e., exactly what Plaintiff attempts to do here.  
However, even if Florida, New Mexico, USVI, or French law applies (the only other locations 
where Plaintiff alleges she was harmed), Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim would likewise be 
barred under the laws of those jurisdictions, which are in accord with New York and the majority 
of U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit recovery of punitive damages against a decedent tortfeasor’s 
estate. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
I.
Plaintiff Alleges Decedent Sexually Assaulted Her From 2002-2004, When She Was 
An Adult 
Plaintiff claims she met Decedent in 2002, when she was twenty years old, in Cape Town, 
South Africa. (Compl. ¶ 38.) She alleges that an American woman approached her and asked if 
she wanted to meet Decedent. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges she met Decedent and, on some later date, 
another woman helped Plaintiff get a visa, passport, and airline tickets so she could visit Decedent 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 9 of 28

- 3 - 
in New York. (Id. ¶¶ 39-41.) Plaintiff claims that, shortly after arriving in New York, she was 
flown to the Caribbean on Decedent’s private plane. (Id. ¶¶ 42-43.) Plaintiff alleges that Decedent 
first sexually assaulted her in the USVI. (Id. ¶¶ 43-44.) 
Plaintiff further alleges that she was sexually abused multiple times thereafter, during a 
period of two years, when she was forced to travel and meet Decedent in New York, Paris, and 
New Mexico. (Id. ¶¶ 46, 49-50.) Plaintiff claims her final trip to the United States was in 2004, 
when she allegedly flew to see Decedent at his New Mexico ranch. (Id. ¶ 50.) During this trip, 
Decedent and Plaintiff allegedly had an argument because Plaintiff was “not being obedient.” (Id.) 
Decedent also asked Plaintiff to serve drinks on a plane headed to California, but Plaintiff and 
Decedent allegedly had another argument and Plaintiff flew home to South Africa instead. (Id.) 
This trip—sixteen years ago—was the last time she alleges she saw Decedent. (Id.) 
Apparently recognizing that her claims are time-barred under the applicable statutes of 
limitations, Plaintiff alleges generic legal conclusions that also appear in other time-barred 
complaints against the Co-Executors that Plaintiff’s counsel filed in this District on behalf of other 
individuals. Thus, Plaintiff alleges in conclusory fashion: 

This action has been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of a criminal action against 
the same defendant to commence an action with respect to the event or occurrence from 
which the criminal action arose. A criminal action against [Decedent] with respect to the 
same sex trafficking enterprise from which Plaintiff’s claims arise was terminated on 
August 29, 2019. (Id. ¶ 12.) 

This action has been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-C, which provides that 
a plaintiff shall have 20 years to file civil claims “for physical, psychological or other injury 
or condition suffered by such person as a result of conduct which would constitute rape in 
the first degree as defined in section 130.35 of the penal law.” [Decedent] raped Plaintiff 
within 20 years of filing this Complaint. (Id. ¶ 13.) 

Any statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiff’s claims is tolled due to the continuous 
and active deception, duress, threats of retaliation, and other forms of misconduct that 
[Decedent] and his co-conspirators used to silence his victims, including Plaintiff.  
[Decedent]’s actions deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity to commence this lawsuit before 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 10 of 28

- 4 - 
his death. Until his death, Plaintiff feared that [Decedent] and his co-conspirators would 
harm her or her family, or ruin her life, if she came forward. (Id. ¶ 14.) 

Defendants are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense.  
Allowing Defendants to do so would be unjust. [Decedent] and his co-conspirators 
intimidated each of his victims into silence by threatening their lives and their livelihoods, 
and therefore prevented Plaintiff from commencing this lawsuit before his death.  By using 
threats, along with his wealth and power, [Decedent] was able to escape punishment for 
his crimes against countless young women and underage girls for the duration of his life.  
(Id. ¶ 15.) 
None of these threadbare allegations rescues Plaintiff’s claims from being time-barred. 
ARGUMENT 
I.
Plaintiff’s Causes Of Action Expired In 2014 At The Latest 
Plaintiff claims she was sexually assaulted between 2002 and 2004 in New York, the USVI, 
Florida, New Mexico, and France. (Compl. ¶¶ 38, 50, 55.) Plaintiff asserts two causes of action 
based on these sexual assaults (battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress) and 
demands punitive damages. (Id. ¶¶ 54-64, p. 15.) CPLR § 202 provides that, when a non-New 
York resident such as Plaintiff sues on causes of action accruing outside New York, the complaint 
must be timely under the statute of limitations of both New York and the jurisdiction where the 
claim accrued.3 Here, Plaintiff’s claims are not timely under New York law or any of the 
jurisdictions where the alleged torts occurred and the Court must dismiss her claims. 
New York. New York law applies a one-year limitations period to actions for assault and 
battery and a three-year limitations period to actions for personal injury. CPLR §§ 214(5), 215(3). 
Under either statute, Plaintiff’s claims are untimely, as they expired in either 2005 or 2007. 
“In diversity cases in New York, federal courts apply … C.P.L.R. § 202.” Commerzbank AG v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l 
Tr. Co., 234 F. Supp. 3d 462, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (citation omitted). 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 11 of 28

- 5 - 
USVI. Under USVI law, which is where Decedent’s first sexual assault of Plaintiff 
allegedly occurred, the statute of limitations for battery actions is two years. 5 V.I.C. § 31(5)(A). 
Thus, under USVI law, Plaintiff’s causes of action expired by 2006 at the latest. 
Florida. Although the Complaint does not allege any specific acts that occurred in Florida 
(nor even that Plaintiff was ever in Florida), even if it did, these claims would be time-barred.  
Under Florida law, the statute of limitations for actions “for assault, battery, false arrest, malicious 
prosecution, malicious interference, false imprisonment, or any other intentional tort” is four years. 
Fla. Stat. § 95.11 (3)(O). Accordingly, under Florida law, Plaintiff’s causes of action expired by 
2008 at the latest. 
New Mexico. Under New Mexico law, actions for “injury to a person” must be brought 
within three years. N.M. Stat. § 37-1-8. Thus, under New Mexico law, Plaintiff’s claims expired 
in 2007 at the latest. 
France.  Under French law, the civil statute of limitations in the event of violence or sexual 
assault against an adult is 10 years. Art. 2226 (1) of the French Civil Code. Therefore, under French 
law, Plaintiff’s claims expired in 2014 at the latest. 
To avoid these statutes of limitations, Plaintiff argues in her response to the Co-Executors’ 
pre-motion letter that she was a resident of New York at the time of the alleged torts and, 
accordingly, CPLR § 202 is inapplicable. (ECF No. 13 at pp. 2-3.) This argument is unavailing for 
at least two reasons. 
First, even if Plaintiff is correct—and, as explained below, she is not—her claims are still 
untimely under the laws of each jurisdiction that could conceivably apply to her claims.  
Second, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts in her Complaint plausibly establishing she was 
ever a resident of New York. To the contrary, the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff is a South African 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 12 of 28

citizen and resident (Compl ¶ 16); refers to only one specific visit to New York and that Plaintiff 
was “not there for long” (id. ¶ 42); and asserts that Decedent “forced [Plaintiff] to travel to the 
United States many times to see [Decedent] and be subjected to repeated sexual abuse for one to 
two weeks at a time, sometimes staying in his New York apartment” (id. ¶ 46). 
As a matter of law, New York residency requires significantly more than an occasional 
visit there. Rather, Plaintiff must allege facts establishing that she intended to remain in New York 
with some degree of permanency.  
In Antone v. Gen. Motors Corp., Buick Motor Div., 64 N.Y.2d 20, 30, 484 N.Y.S.2d 514, 
518-19, 473 N.E.2d 742, 746-47 (1984), which Plaintiff cites in her pre-motion response letter, the 
court found that “[c]ases defining ‘resident’ for purposes of venue under CPLR 503 are useful 
precedents (see, e.g., Siegfried v Siegfried, 92 AD2d 916; Hammerman v Louis Watch Co., 7 AD2d 
817).” The courts in Siegfried and Hammerman found that, in order for a person to be deemed a 
resident of New York, “[s]he must stay there for some time and have the bona fide intent to retain 
the place as a residence for some length of time and with some degree of permanency.” Siegfried, 
A.D.2d 916, 916, 460 N.Y.S.2d 131, 133 (2nd Dept. 1983) (renting a room in Nassau County 
and party’s statements regarding her intent to remain in Nassau County were insufficient to support 
a finding that she was a resident of Nassau County); Hammerman v. Louis Watch Co., 7 A.D.2d 
817, 818, 181 N.Y.S.2d 65, 67 (3rd Dept. 1958) (“Residence requires more stability than 
occasional stopovers at a hotel … and the mere fact that the plaintiffs rent premises on a year round 
basis where they sleep while there on business, in our view, does not establish a residence.”). 
Here, Plaintiff’s allegations are insufficient to claim New York residency as a matter of 
law. Visiting New York “sometimes” over a two-year period hardly qualifies as evincing an intent 
to remain there with some degree of permanency. See Siegfried, 92 A.D.2d at 916.

II.
Plaintiff’s Attempts To Invoke Extraordinary Statute Of Limitations Exceptions 
Fail 
A.
CPLR § 215(8)(a) is inapplicable because the Indictment arises out of the 
alleged sex trafficking of minors, not adults such as Plaintiff. 
Contrary to Plaintiff’s contentions, CPLR § 215(8)(a) does not apply here. CPLR § 
215(8)(a) provides: “Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same defendant has 
been commenced with respect to the event or occurrence from which a claim governed by this 
section arises, the plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of the criminal action 
… to commence the civil action.” (Emphasis added). 
Decedent’s Indictment, which Plaintiff attaches to her Complaint, was not commenced 
with respect to Plaintiff. Rather, the Indictment alleges that Decedent sexually trafficked “minor
girls” (Ex. A to Compl., ¶ 1 (emphasis added)), stating throughout that it concerns sex trafficking 
of “minors” (id. ¶¶ 2-4, 6, 8, 11-15, 18-20, 22). Because Plaintiff alleges she was between 20 and 
years old when Decedent assaulted her (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 38, 50), this action and the Indictment 
necessarily arise from different events or occurrences. 
New York courts apply CPLR § 215(8)(a) narrowly. See Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 
A.D.2d 595, 596 (2d Dept. 1999) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied only to claims based on events of 
February 26, 1993 and December 28, 1993, because it was only in connection with events of those 
two days that a criminal prosecution was commenced against defendant); Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 
2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 8435 (Sup. Ct. Dutchess Cnty. Oct. 23, 2018) (CPLR § 
215(8)(a) inapplicable where incidents charged in criminal action and those alleged in civil action 
occurred on different dates); McElligott v. City of N.Y., No. 15-cv-7107 (LGS), 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 201829, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2017) (CPLR § 215(8)(a) inapplicable to claims against 
civil defendants not charged as co-defendants in criminal action, notwithstanding same events gave 
rise to both actions). 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 14 of 28

Gallina is especially instructive. In that case, an individual sued an attorney for battery and 
other claims based on the core allegation that, over the course of two years, the attorney committed 
various sexual misconduct against the plaintiff, including sexual assault. 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 
8435, at *1. Defendant had also been criminally charged with forceable touching for incidents that 
occurred with the plaintiff in 2017. Id. at *3. The court dismissed as time-barred plaintiff’s battery 
counts based on incidents alleged to have occurred in 2016. Id. at *2-3. 
In doing so, the court rejected plaintiff’s argument that CPLR § 215(8)(a) applied to the 
2016 incidents, finding: 
Plaintiff argues that the July and October 2016 incidents are part of the same 
ongoing course of events as the February, March and May 2017 incidents 
and should therefore be deemed timely commenced … the case law does 
not support Plaintiff’s interpretation of … CPLR §215(8)(a). The criminal 
instruments … demonstrate that Defendant was charged for incidents 
occurring on three (3) specific dates … Pursuant to CPLR §215(8)(a), 
tolling would apply only to claims based on these dates, “because it was 
only in connection with the events of these [three] days that a criminal 
prosecution was commenced against the defendant.” Christodoulou v. 
Terdeman, 262 AD2d 595, 596 [2d Dept. 1999]. As criminal charges were 
not commenced with respect to the July 2016 and October 2016 events, the 
tolling provisions of CPLR §215(8) do not apply. 
Id. at *3-4. Here, Plaintiff asserts a much more tenuous connection between this action and the 
Indictment than the one unsuccessfully asserted by the plaintiff in Gallina (and the other cited 
cases). Therefore, the Court should reject Plaintiff’s argument for the application of CPLR § 
215(8)(a). 
In Plaintiff’s response to the Co-Executors’ pre-motion letter, Plaintiff asserts three 
arguments for application of CPLR § 215(8)(a). First, Plaintiff argues that CPLR § 215(8)(a) does 
not require the Indictment to expressly identify Plaintiff as one of Decedent’s victims. This is a 
strawman argument: no one argues otherwise.

Plaintiff cites Clemens v. Nealon, 202 A.D.2d 747, 749 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994), for this 
assertion, stating that CPLR § 215(8)(a) “does not require that the plaintiff be ‘the victim or the 
specific person upon whom the crime had been committed.’” (ECF No. 13 at p. 1, quoting 
Clemens, 202 A.D.2d at 749, emphasis in letter). This characterization of Clemens is misleading. 
In Clemens, defendants were charged with criminal mischief resulting to damage to two boats. Id.
at 748. The six plaintiffs in Clemens were aboard the two boats and sued to recover damages for 
assault and battery, infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment. Id. Defendant asserted 
that CPLR § 215(8) did not apply because the victims of the crimes were the owners of the two 
damaged boats—not the plaintiffs who were on the boats. Id. at 749. The court disagreed, reading 
the plain language of CPLR § 215(8), expressly requiring that the action arise out of the same 
“event or occurrence.” Id. Thus, Clemens does not alter the requirement that Plaintiff must show 
she was a victim of the same “event or occurrence” on which the Indictment is based; she has not 
and cannot. The Indictment could not be clearer: it concerns sex trafficking of minors. Plaintiff 
does not allege she was a minor when Decedent sexually assaulted her. 
Second, Plaintiff urges a broad construction of CPLR § 215(8)(a) that effectively rewrites 
it by rendering the limitation therein—“with respect to the event or occurrence from which a 
claim governed by this section arises”—meaningless. Plaintiff effectively argues that, unless the 
Indictment expressly rules out that it arises from the same event as this action, then Plaintiff is 
entitled to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a). That argument is contrary to basic principles of statutory 
interpretation prohibiting a reading of a statute that would render its words meaningless (see 
McKinney’s Cons. Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 92), the case law cited above, a plain reading 
of the Indictment, and common sense. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 16 of 28

Plaintiff cites Kashef v. BNP Paribas S.A., 925 F.3d 53 (2d Cir. 2019), in support of her 
erroneous argument. However, Kashef is factually distinguishable. The civil and criminal actions 
in that case both arose out of the same conspiracy between BNP and Sudan to violate U.S. 
sanctions. Id. at 63. Here, Plaintiff’s allegations—that she traveled as an adult to visit Decedent in 
various places where he sexually assaulted her—do not comport with what is set forth repeatedly 
in the Indictment—namely, an alleged scheme to traffic minors. 
Acknowledging this critical defect, Plaintiff argues in her pre-motion response letter that 
the Indictment applies to trafficking of adults as well as minors, but deliberately misquotes the 
Indictment. According to Plaintiff: 
The charges were not limited to crimes committed against specific victims. For 
example, the overt acts alleged for the sex trafficking conspiracy charge were 
enticing and recruiting multiple victims, “including minor victims identified 
herein.” 
(ECF No. 13 at p. 1, citing Indictment (emphasis added).) However, this quote, and the argument 
relying on it, is disingenuous. The cited portion of the Indictment actually states: 
“In or about 2004, Jefferey Epstein, the defendant, enticed and recruited multiple 
minor victims, including minor victims identified herein….” 
(Ex. A to Compl. ¶ 22(a) (emphasis added).) In other words, Plaintiff removed the word “minor” 
from the first part of the sentence to make it appear as though the latter reference to “minor victims” 
identified merely a subset of the former “multiple victims.” Plaintiff’s alteration of the text and 
meaning of the Indictment indicates she is aware she has a losing argument. While Plaintiff may 
claim she, too, is a victim of Decedent, she is not a victim by reason of the events giving rise to 
the Indictment. 
B.
CPLR § 213-c is inapplicable because it is not retroactive. 
Plaintiff also attempts to plead around the applicable statutes of limitations by erroneously 
invoking CPLR § 213-c, which currently provides for a twenty-year limitation period for certain 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 17 of 28

- 11 - 
sexual offenses. However, the twenty-year limitation set forth in CPLR § 213-c became effective 
September 18, 2019, and is thus inapplicable here. (The statute of limitations was five years as of 
2006 and one year before then. L. 2006, ch. 3, § 5(b)). The twenty-year statute of limitations does 
not apply retroactively except “where the applicable [statute of limitations] in effect on the date 
of such act or omission has not yet expired.” L. 2019, ch. 315, § 4 (emphasis added). That is not 
the case here. Therefore, CPLR § 213-c cannot revive Plaintiff’s claims arising from torts 
committed in New York. 
In her pre-motion letter, Plaintiff contends—without legal authority and in complete 
disregard of what the enacting bill for CPLR § 213-c states very clearly—that CPLR § 213-c 
applies retroactively because CPLR § 213-c itself does not expressly state otherwise. This is 
wrong. Plaintiff provides no reason to disregard what the law amending CPLR § 213-c actually 
states, as quoted above. 
Plaintiff also has it backwards. Under New York law, “[i]t takes a clear expression of the 
legislative purpose … to justify a retroactive application of a statute which assures that [the 
legislative body] itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive 
application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.” 
Matter of Regina Metro. Co., LLC v. N.Y. State Div. of Hous. & Cmty. Renewal, 2020 NY Slip Op 
02127, ¶ 12 (citing Gleason v. Gleason, 26 NY2d 28, 36, 256 N.E.2d 513, 308 N.Y.S.2d 347 
(1970) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The rules for determining whether a statute 
is to be applied retroactively are contained in McKinney’s Consolidated Laws of NY, Book 1, 
Statutes § 51 et seq. See Gleason v. Holman Contract Warehousing, 170 Misc. 2d 668, 649 
N.Y.S.2d 647, 677 (Sup. Ct. 1996). McKinney’s states: 
Generally, statutes are construed as prospective, unless the language of the statute, 
either expressly or by necessary implication, requires that it be given a retroactive 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 18 of 28

- 12 - 
construction.  … Stated differently, a construction of a statute which will give it a 
retroactive operation is not favored by the courts, but on the contrary, the laws [sic] 
favors a prospective interpretation wherever possible. It is well settled also that a 
statute will not be given a retroactive construction unless an intention to make it 
retroactive is to be deduced from its wording, and a law will not receive a 
retroactive construction unless its language, either expressly or by necessary 
implication, requires that it be so construed. A clear expression of the legislative 
purpose is required to justify a retrospective application.… 
Gleason, 649 N.Y.S.2d at 677-678. 
Here, there is no “clear expression” that the New York State legislature intended CPLR § 
213-c to be applied retroactively. Rather, the legislature expressly stated the opposite. See L. 2019, 
ch. 315, § 4. 
By contrast, the recently-enacted New York Child Victim’s Act, a revival statute that 
provides a one-year window in which to bring claims of sexual abuse of minors that had previously 
expired, expressly states it “revive[s]” claims that are “barred as of the effective date of this section 
because the applicable period of limitation has expired.” CPLR § 214-g. This confirms the New 
York State Legislature is quite capable of indicating when a limitations period should be applied 
retroactively. Because the Legislature did not do that for CPLR § 213-c—it did the opposite—
Plaintiff’s claim cannot succeed.  
C.
Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege “extraordinary” circumstances 
sufficient to justify tolling or equitable estoppel. 
Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify 
tolling or equitable estoppel including on the pleadings. “Second Circuit cases discussing 
equitable tolling set a stringent standard for its application.” Fairley v. Collins, No. 09-Civ-6894 
(PGG), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26536, at *16 (Mar. 15, 2011 S.D.N.Y.) (Gardephe, J.) (finding 
equitable tolling did not apply and granting defendants’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to 
dismiss complaint on statute of limitations grounds). Equitable tolling only applies where a 
plaintiff is “prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising h[er] rights.” Viti v. Guardian

137152, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Johnson v. Nyack Hosp., 86 F.3d 8, 12 (2d Cir. 1996)).  
Under this doctrine, a court may, only “under compelling circumstances, make narrow 
exceptions to the statute of limitations … ‘to prevent inequity.’” Id. (emphasis added) (citing Yesh 
Diamonds, Inc. v. Yashaya, No. 09-CV-2016 (DLI) (RER), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101744, at *2 
(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2010); In re U.S. Lines, Inc., 318 F.3d 432, 436 (2d Cir. 2003)). “That the 
doctrine is to be employed only sparingly—in ‘extraordinary’ and ‘compelling’ circumstances—
is reflected in the fact that the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to show that tolling is 
justified.” Id.  (emphasis added) (citing Boos v. Runyon, 201 F.3d 178, 185 (2d Cir. 2000)). A late-
filing party seeking equitable tolling must also demonstrate she acted with “reasonable diligence” 
in pursuing her claims during the period she seeks to toll. Id. at *32 (citation omitted). 
Equitable estoppel only applies where a plaintiff knows her cause of action exists, but the 
defendant’s conduct caused her to delay bringing suit. See Yesh Diamonds, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
101744, at *5 (citing Cerbone v. Int’l Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union, 768 F.2d 45, 50 (2d Cir. 
1985)). “The rationale behind this equitable doctrine is to protect the person who brings their action 
after it would normally be barred because she was ‘lulled’ into believing that she should delay 
pursuing her cause of action.” Id. (quoting In re Higgins, 270 B.R. 147, 158 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 
2001)). Equitable estoppel requires a plaintiff to show: “(i) the defendant made a definite 
misrepresentation of fact and had reason to believe that the plaintiff would rely on it; and (ii) the 
plaintiff reasonably relied on that misrepresentation to h[er] detriment.” Id. (citation omitted). 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 20 of 28

- 14 - 
Tolling is inappropriate where, as here, a plaintiff fails to articulate any acts by a defendant that 
prevented the plaintiff from timely commencing suit. See id. at *6. 
Here, Plaintiff does not allege any particularized acts by Decedent that prevented her from 
exercising her rights. (Compl. ¶¶ 14-15.) Nor does Plaintiff allege that (i) Decedent made a 
misrepresentation to her and had reason to believe she would rely on it, or (ii) Plaintiff reasonably 
relied on it to her detriment. Therefore, there is no “extraordinary” basis alleged sufficient to toll 
the statute of limitations or estop the Co-Executors from asserting a statute of limitations defense. 
Plaintiff asserts in her pre-motion response letter that “the Complaint alleges in detail the 
methods of intimidation and control that [Decedent] and his co-conspirators used to deter their 
victims from seeking justice.” (ECF No. 13 at 3.) This is false. Rather, the complaint merely 
alleges—in two conclusory paragraphs identical to paragraphs included in other plaintiff’s 
complaints represented by the same counsel—that Decedent threatened and intimidated “his many 
victims, including Plaintiff.” (Compl. ¶¶ 14-15.) The remaining claims, even as retold by Plaintiff 
in her letter, do not allege any conduct by Decedent beyond “tr[ying] to keep in contact with 
Plaintiff after the abuse ended.” (ECF. No. 13 at p. 3, citing Compl. ¶ 51.)The allegations Plaintiff 
points to as demonstrating intimidation merely describe Plaintiff’s unextraordinary state of mind: 
Plaintiff was “afraid of betraying [Decedent] because of his money and power” (id., citing ¶ 47); 
Plaintiff was “afraid [Decedent] would hurt her or her family” (id.). There are no allegations 
explaining that Decedent did anything to impede Plaintiff from bringing this lawsuit for some 
fifteen years.  
Plaintiff’s assertion that such thin allegations are “extraordinary” is inconsistent with 
numerous court decisions in which far stronger allegations were deemed insufficient to justify 
equitable estoppel or tolling. See, e.g., Conklin v. Maidenbaum, No. 12-cv-3606, 2013 U.S. Dist. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 21 of 28

LEXIS 113975, at *27 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2013) (Ramos, J.) (finding equitable tolling 
inapplicable and dismissing complaint, notwithstanding that plaintiffs alleged they reasonably 
relied on defendants’ representations over a period spanning more than ten months and dozens of 
telephone calls). 
Plaintiff alternatively argues in her pre-motion response letter that her entitlement to 
equitable estoppel and tolling are “fact-specific doctrines” and thus should be resolved after 
discovery. (ECF No. 13 at 3.) Plaintiff misunderstands New York law and understates the 
deficiencies in her own Complaint. Where, as here, a plaintiff fails to allege facts that support 
invocation of an exception to the statute of limitations, there is no issue of fact sufficient to defeat 
a motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds: 
If properly pled, allegations of equitable estoppel normally create questions 
of fact which cannot be determined at a motion to dismiss … However, 
without adequate pleading, the issue is not properly raised and therefore 
cannot defeat a motion to dismiss based on statute of limitations grounds.
See Dep’t of Econ. Dev. v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 747 F. Supp. 922, 943 
(S.D.N.Y. 1990) (dismissing cause of action because plaintiff made no 
allegation in complaint that “its failure to timely institute its third-party 
action was due to its justified reliance upon a misrepresentation” by 
opposing party); Moll v. U.S. Life Title Ins. Co. of N.Y., 700 F. Supp. 1284, 
1293 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (“Plaintiffs have not alleged that defendant caused 
them to delay in bringing suit on a known cause of action.  On the contrary, 
plaintiffs repeatedly emphasize that they did not discover the alleged … 
violations until long after the limitations period had expired. Equitable 
estoppel is therefore not appropriate in this case.”). 
Abercrombie v. College, 438 F. Supp. 2d 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). 
Here, as in Abercrombie, “Plaintiff has failed to allege any facts that would support 
invocation of the equitable estoppel doctrine. First, Plaintiff does not identify the 
misrepresentations or other facts demonstrating fraudulent concealment that could serve as the 
basis for the claimed equitable estoppel. More particularly, Plaintiff has utterly failed to identify 
in the Complaint which statements led her to believe that she could delay bringing her lawsuit.”

Id. at 266. Nor does Plaintiff allege facts that would support invocation of equitable tolling. These 
are pleading deficiencies, not questions of fact. 
III.
Plaintiff’s Claim For Punitive Damages Are Barred As A Matter Of Law 
Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law because it is barred by the 
law of each potentially applicable jurisdiction. When determining what law applies, courts look to 
the choice-of-law rules of the forum state. Simons v. Marriott Corp., 92 Civ. 3762 (SWK), 1993 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14365, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 1993). Under New York law, the law of the 
state where a tort occurs generally applies to punitive damages. See Starr Indem. & Liab. Co. v. 
Am. Claims Mgmt., No. 14-cv-0463-JMF, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60272, *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 
2015) (“Because punitive damages are conduct-regulating, ‘the law of the jurisdiction where the 
tort occurred will generally apply.’” (quoting Deutsch v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 723 F. Supp. 2d 
521, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 2010)); Guidi v. Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., No. 95-CV-9006 (LAP), 
2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6390, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2003)). 
Here, Plaintiff alleges tortious conduct occurring in New York, Florida, New Mexico, the 
USVI, and France. (Compl. ¶¶ 25, 55.)  None of these jurisdictions permits recovery of punitive 
damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate. That is the law in most jurisdictions, as reflected 
in the Restatement. See Restat. (Second) Of Torts § 908 cmt. a (punitive damages not available 
against representatives of deceased tortfeasor). Each of these jurisdictions is addressed below in 
turn. 
New York: New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law provides: “No cause of action for 
injury to person or property is lost because of the death of the person liable for the injury. For any 
injury, an action may be brought or continued against the personal representative of the decedent, 
but punitive damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought 
to recover damages for personal injury.” NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1) (emphasis added). “Also, 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 23 of 28

- 17 - 
‘there is a strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an estate on account 
of wrongful conduct of the decedent.’” Graham v. Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) 
(quoting Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996)). 
New York General Construction Law § 37-a defines “personal injury” as including “an 
assault, battery, false imprisonment, or other actionable injury to the person either of the plaintiff, 
or of another.” Here, Plaintiff seeks to recover damages for her alleged personal injuries. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff may not recover punitive damages from Decedent’s estate based on alleged 
torts that occurred in New York. 
Florida: The result is the same under Florida law. “Florida law prohibits recovery of 
punitive damages from the estate of a wrongdoer who is deceased.” Poindexter v. Zacharzewski, 
No. 18-14155-CIV, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189861, at *6 (Nov. 5, 2018 S.D. Fla.) (citing Lohr v. 
Byrd, 522 So. 2d 845 (Fla. 1988) (“[A] decedent’s innocent heirs should not be punished when the 
wrongdoer is unavailable because of death.  In so holding, we join the majority of jurisdictions in 
this country that have considered this issue.”)). 
New Mexico: Likewise, the Supreme Court of New Mexico has unequivocally held that 
“punishment and deterrence are not accomplished by enabling recovery of punitive damages from 
the estate of deceased tortfeasors.” Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 117 N.M. 337, 346 
(N.M. 1994). Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot recover punitive damages under New Mexico law. 
France: Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages against a tortfeasor’s estate is barred under 
French law because France prohibits punitive damages altogether. See, e.g., In re Air Crash at 
Belle Harbor, No. 02 MDL 1448 (RWS), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109247, at *23-25 (S.D.N.Y. 
Mar. 10, 2008) (“Unlike many jurisdictions in the United States, including New York, France 
prohibits punitive damages claims as they are known in the United States. … Instead of employing 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 24 of 28

- 18 - 
punitive damages as a mechanism for punishing and deterring potentially harmful conduct, France 
has instead deemed liability for compensatory damages in conjunction with penal liability (where 
appropriate) to be a sufficient deterrent.”) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); 2 Linda 
L. Schlueter, Punitive Damages § 22.4 (7th ed. 2015) (citing Rouhette, The Availability of Punitive 
Damages in Europe: Growing Trend or Nonexistent Concept, 74 Def. Coun. J. 320 (2007)). 
USVI: USVI courts apply a “Banks analysis” to determine U.S.V.I. common law. Banks v. 
Int’l Rental & Leasing Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 979 (V.I. 2011). The Banks analysis includes 
consideration of three factors: (1) whether any USVI courts have previously adopted a particular 
rule; (2) the position taken by a majority of courts of other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, 
which approach represents the soundest rule for the USVI. Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Connor, No. 
S. CT. CIV. 2013-0095, 2014 WL 702639, at *1 (V.I. Feb. 24, 2014). Applying the Banks factors 
here demonstrates that USVI courts would adopt the rule in the Restatement (Second) of Torts—
which is also followed in the majority of United States jurisdictions, including New York—and 
hold that punitive damages are not available against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate. These factors 
are analyzed below. 
A.
Banks factor one: previously, USVI courts favorably cited the Restatement 
section that precludes punitive damages against estates. 
USVI courts have favorably recited the Restatement’s rule precluding punitive damages 
against a decedent tortfeasor’s estate. See, e.g., Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 
(D.V.I. 2009); Booth v. Bowen, No. CIV. 2006-217, 2008 WL 220067, at *5 (D.V.I. Jan. 10, 2008).  
In these cases, the U.S. District Court for the Virgin Islands considered the inverse of the issue 
here, i.e., whether the personal representatives of an estate may obtain punitive damages in an 
action arising from the decedent’s wrongful death. In determining that punitive damages were not 
available under such circumstances, the courts cited the Restatement, which provides that

“[p]unitive damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor nor, 
ordinarily, in an action under a death statute.” Restat. (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (emphasis 
added). Accordingly, this Banks factor favors the Co-Executors. 
B.
Banks factor two: a majority of U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an award of 
punitive damages based on the wrongful acts of a decedent. 
This Banks factor overwhelmingly supports the Co-Executors’ position. The majority of 
U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an award of punitive damages against the personal representatives 
of an estate based on the actions of the deceased tortfeasor. See, e.g., Crabtree v. Estate of 
Crabtree, 837 N.E.2d 135, 138 (Ind. 2005) (“The majority view denies punitive damages.”); 2 
Linda L. Schlueter, Punitive Damages § 20.4 (7th ed. 2015) (“[A] majority of jurisdictions will 
not award punitive damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate.” (citing Alec A. Beech, Adding 
Insult to Death: Why Punitive Damages Should Not Be Imposed Against a Deceased Tortfeasor’s 
Estate in Ohio, 49 Akron L. Rev. 553 (2016))); Timothy R. Robicheaux and Brian H. Bornstein, 
Punished, Dead Or Alive: Empirical Perspectives on Awarding Punitive Damages Against 
Deceased Defendants, 16 Psych. Pub. Pol. and L. 393, 398 (2010) (“The Restatement (Second) of 
Torts (1965) is one authority stating that punitive damages should not follow the death of a 
wrongdoer, and the majority of courts considering the issue have provided rulings consistent with 
this position.”). 
C.
Banks factor three: Post-Banks, USVI courts have favorably applied 
Restatement Section 908 to questions regarding punitive damages. 
The third Banks factor weighs strongly in favor of the Co-Executors as well. Post-Banks, 
USVI courts have found that Section 908 of the Restatement is “the soundest rule for the Virgin 
Islands with respect to the imposition of an award of punitive damages.” Pappas v. Hotel on the 
Cay Time-Sharing Ass’n, 69 V.I. 3, 15 n.8 (U.S.V.I. Super. Ct. 2015) (citing Davis v. Christian, 
V.I. 557 (D.V.I. App. Div. 2005), Isaac v. Crichlow, 63 V.I. 38, 2015 V.I. LEXIS 15 (V.I. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 26 of 28

- 20 - 
Super. Ct. 2015), St. Thomas House, Inc. v. Barrows, 15 V.I. 435 (V.I. Terr. Ct. 1979), Brandy v. 
Flamboyant Inv. Co., Ltd., 24 V.I. 249 (V.I. Terr. Ct. 1989), and Thomas v. Rijos, 780 F. Supp. 2d 
376, 380 (D.V.I. 2011)); Powell v. Chi-Co’s Distrib., No. ST-13-TOR-14, 2014 V.I. LEXIS 21, at 
*5 n.13 (U.S.V.I. Super. Ct. Apr. 3, 2014) (“Applying a Banks analysis, the Court finds that 
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(2) reflects the common law of this jurisdiction.”). There is 
no reason to think the USVI courts would adhere to one portion of Section 908 and not another. 
Because every Banks factor favors the Co-Executors’ position, to the extent USVI law 
applies to the alleged tortious conduct that occurred there, Plaintiff cannot recover an award of 
punitive damages against the Co-Executors. Therefore, even if any of Plaintiff’s claims survive, 
regardless of which state’s law applies here, the Court must dismiss her claim for punitive damages 
in its entirety.  
Finally, Plaintiff does not contend that her punitive damages claims are proper. Rather, in 
her pre-motion response letter, she asks the Court to delay ruling on the issue of punitive damages 
until after discovery. (ECF No. 13 at 3.) As there are no facts that would render Plaintiff’s punitive 
damages claim proper, there is no reason to allow it to stand. Not surprisingly, courts in this District 
regularly grant motions to dismiss claims for punitive damages. See, e.g., The Cookware Co. 
(USA), LLC v. Austin, No. 15 Civ. 5796, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177691, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 
8, 2016) (Batts, J.) (granting motion to dismiss claim for punitive damages without leave to replead 
because allegations regarding defendant’s bad-faith conduct were conclusory and did not rise to 
the required level of malice); SJB v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 03 Civ. 6653, 2004 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 13227, at *25-26 (S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2004) (Buchwald, J.) (granting motion to dismiss 
punitive damages claims because they were not statutorily available); Kunica v. St. Jean Fin., 97 
Civ. 3804, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11867, at *26 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 1998) (Sweet, J.) (granting 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 24   Filed 04/14/20   Page 27 of 28

- 21 - 
motion to dismiss claim for punitive damages because, even if conduct alleged in complaint was 
true, it did not rise to the level necessary to award punitive damages); Purdy v. Consumers Distrib. 
Co., 648 F. Supp. 980, 981, 984 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (Cedarbaum, J.) (granting motion to dismiss 
claim for punitive damages). 
Plaintiff merely seeks to delay the inevitable so she may use the prospect of punitive 
damages—despite the legal prohibition on their availability here—as (misplaced) leverage over 
the Co-Executors. This would serve no legitimate purpose. It would also impede productive 
settlement discussions. Like the punitive damages claims in the cases cited above, Plaintiff’s 
punitive damages claim should be dismissed. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the Co-Executors respectfully request that the Court grant their 
motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) 
because it is time-barred and Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages because it is prohibited by 
statute.

Re: 
Juliette Bryant v. Darren K. Indyke & Richard D. Kahn, 19-10479-ALC-DCF 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
We write on behalf of Plaintiff Juliette Bryant in the above-captioned litigation. Pursuant 
to Individual Rule II.A and Local Civil Rule 37.2, Plaintiff respectfully requests a pre-motion 
conference on Plaintiff’s anticipated motion to compel Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard 
D. Kahn (1) to produce responsive documents from the Relevant Period as defined in Plaintiff’s 
discovery requests; (2) to produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s requests, not simply 
documents that directly mention Plaintiff’s name; and (3) to respond to Plaintiff’s interrogatories.1  
The Court has made clear that discovery in this case would not be stayed pending the approval of 
the claims administration program or a motion to dismiss absent a contrary order from the Court. 
See Tr. of Nov. 21, 2019 Conf. at 26:10-12.  Yet by failing to comply with their clear and 
unequivocal discovery obligations, including not producing a single document to date, Defendants 
are attempting to grant themselves a de facto stay of discovery.  Defendants have provided no basis 
for their delay. 
I. 
Background 
Plaintiff alleges that Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators operated a decades-long 
sex-trafficking scheme by which they recruited young women for sexual abuse.  Compl. ¶¶ 27, 28.  
Plaintiff was one of those women.  Epstein and his associates trafficked her from South Africa in 
2002 and sexually abused her for several years thereafter in New York, Florida, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, New Mexico, and France.  Id. ¶¶ 41, 55. After years of suffering in silence due to fear and 
Epstein’s psychological manipulation, she filed a complaint against Defendants on November 14, 
2019. 
On January 23, 2020, the parties exchanged initial Rule 26 disclosures.  Defendants’ Rule 
Disclosures were vacuous.  Defendants provided the names of two witnesses—Plaintiff and her 
ex-boyfriend—and stated that they were not aware of any documents, ESI, or tangible things in 
Pursuant to Individual Rule I.C., Plaintiff states that she conferred in good faith 
with Defendants about the issues raised in this letter by telephone on April 27, 2020.

their possession, custody, or control that they would use to support their defenses.  Exhibit A, Jan. 
23, 2020 Initial Disclosures of Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn.  In response to 
Defendants’ lack of information as to what relevant documents were in their possession, custody, 
or control, on January 28, 2020, Plaintiff sent them a document preservation notice and identified 
various email accounts used by Jeffrey Epstein.  Exhibit B, Jan. 28, 2020 Document Preservation 
Notice.  Defendants responded on February 3, 2020, by stating that they were abiding by all of 
their discovery obligations, including their preservation obligations.  Exhibit C, Feb. 3, 2020 Letter 
from B. Moskowitz to S. McCawley. 
On March 10, 2020, Plaintiff served 91 Requests for Production (“RFPs”) and 17 
Interrogatories on Defendants (collectively, Plaintiff’s “discovery requests”).  In Plaintiff’s 
interrogatories, she again asked Defendants to identify potential witnesses, in addition to email 
accounts used by Epstein, telephone numbers used by Epstein, and other information to aid 
Plaintiff in identifying witnesses and the location of evidence necessary to prove her case.  On 
April 16, 2020, after Plaintiff provided Defendants a week-long extension, Defendants served 
responses and objections in which they failed to respond to a single Interrogatory (aside from 
identifying Plaintiff as a witness to her own abuse) and failed to produce a single document.  
Exhibit D, Defendants’ Apr. 16, 2020 Objections and Responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of 
Interrogatories; Exhibit E, Defendants’ Apr. 16, 2020 Objections and Responses to Plaintiff’s First 
Request for Production of Documents. 
On April 27, 2020, after sending Defendants a letter regarding the clear deficiencies in their 
responses and objections, Plaintiff met and conferred with Defendants for an hour and a half. 
See Ex. F, Apr. 20, 2020 Letter from S. McCawley to B. Moskowitz. Defendants stated that they 
had not yet fully processed the ESI in their possession, had not run any searches on the ESI, and 
were not in a position to provide information about the ESI, despite having received Plaintiff’s 
document retention notice in January and Plaintiff’s discovery requests in March.  During the meet 
and confer, Plaintiff also explained her position on the relevance and necessity of each of her 
discovery requests, and offered to answer any questions that Defendants had about the relevance 
of any of her requests.  Defendants refused to accept the Relevant Period that Plaintiff defined in 
her discovery requests, and stated that they would only produce documents that reference Plaintiff.  
They also stated, without providing any legal basis for their position, that they would not produce 
anything relating to Epstein’s sex trafficking or abuse of other victims. 
As of today, May 7, 2020, Plaintiff has yet to receive a single document or piece of 
information responsive to any of her discovery requests, including the documents that specifically 
reference Plaintiff that Defendants agreed to produce.  The only information Defendants have 
provided to Plaintiff in the course of discovery is their statement that Plaintiff is a witness in this 
case.  Plaintiff has produced more than 10,000 pages of documents responsive to Defendants’ 
discovery requests to date, and has responded to all of Defendants’ interrogatories to the best of 
her ability. 
II. 
Defendants’ Objection to the Relevant Period is Improper. 
Defendants have improperly objected to the Relevant Period that Plaintiff defined in her 
discovery requests as January 1, 2001 to the present.  Without providing any legal basis for their 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 27   Filed 05/07/20   Page 2 of 6

position, Defendants contend that the relevant time period should be limited to the dates of 
Plaintiff’s abuse as alleged in the Complaint.2 
Under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, parties may obtain discovery 
“regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense.”  Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 26(b)(1).  “[R]elevance for the purposes of discovery is an extremely broad concept.”  Melendez 
v. Greiner, No. 01 CIV.07888 SAS DF, 2003 WL 22434101, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2003) 
(Freeman, J.). 
This case turns on (1) whether Jeffrey Epstein sexually trafficked and sexually assaulted 
Plaintiff and (2) whether Plaintiff’s claims are timely, an affirmative defense that Defendants have 
already raised in a motion to dismiss.  ECF No. 24.  Discovery from the Relevant Period as defined 
by Plaintiff is relevant to both Plaintiff’s claims and Defendants’ statute of limitations defense, 
and is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
Epstein’s sexual trafficking and abuse of Plaintiff began in 2002 and lasted through 
approximately 2004.  But Plaintiff has reason to believe, based on publicly available documents, 
that Epstein and his co-conspirators began trafficking and sexually abusing young girls and women 
in the same manner that he trafficked and abused Plaintiff in the mid-1990s, and continued to do 
so up until the date of Epstein’s arrest on July 8, 2019.  Documents relating to the sexual trafficking 
and/or sexual assault of others at any point during that period would make the fact that Epstein 
trafficked and sexually assaulted Plaintiff, the key fact that Plaintiff bears the burden of proving 
in this case, more probable than it would be without such evidence.  See Fed. R. Evid. 401.  Plaintiff 
also bears the burden of proving Epstein’s intent to sexually assault her.  See Cerilli v. Kezis, 16 
A.D.3d 363, 364 (2d Dep’t 2005) (“The elements of battery are bodily contact, made with intent, 
and offensive in nature.”).  Evidence that he sexually trafficked and assaulted others would be 
directly relevant to proving such intent.  Such evidence would also likely be admissible at trial.  
See Fed. R. Evid. 415.   
Further, Defendants have raised a statute of limitations defense in this matter, ECF No. 24, 
and Plaintiff contends that they should be equitably estopped from doing so based on Epstein’s 
misconduct.  Compl. ¶ 15.  Although Plaintiff disagrees with Defendants’ interpretation of the case 
law, Defendants contend that to invoke equitable estoppel, Plaintiff bears the burden of proving 
that Epstein’s “conduct caused her to delay bringing suit,” that Epstein “made a definite 
misrepresentation of fact and had reason to believe that the plaintiff would rely on it,” and that 
“plaintiff reasonably relied on that misrepresentation.”  ECF No. 24 at 13.  Documents relating to 
Epstein’s misconduct after his abuse of Plaintiff ended could very well be relevant to equitable 
estoppel, including to whether Plaintiff reasonably relied on that misconduct in staying silent about 
her abuse until after Epstein’s death. 
The fact that Epstein and his co-conspirators carried out a sex-trafficking operation, which 
directly injured Plaintiff, for 20 years does not mean that Plaintiff is not entitled to discovery about 
that operation.  Yet Defendants have taken that position and have not indicated any willingness to 
change it.  The Court should direct Defendants to search documents within their possession, 
This is despite the fact that Defendants themselves served discovery requests on Plaintiff 
in which they defined the relevant time period as “the date on which you first learned of Decedent 
through the date of your responses to these requests.” 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 27   Filed 05/07/20   Page 3 of 6

custody, or control from the Relevant Period as described in Plaintiff’s discovery requests—2001 
to the present. 
III. 
Defendants Must Produce More than Documents That Explicitly Reference Plaintiff.   
In addition to their blanket objection to the production of documents from any year during 
which Plaintiff was not herself sexually assaulted, Defendants contend that they will only produce 
one category of documents—those that specifically mention Juliette Bryant.  Defendants have 
refused, without providing any legal basis for doing so, to produce any document that does not 
directly reference Plaintiff, regardless of the year.   
Defendant cannot broadly object to producing any documents that do not directly reference 
Plaintiff.  Documents relevant to Plaintiff’s claims and Defendants’ defenses go well beyond 
documents that reference Plaintiff.  The following is a small sampling of examples of relevant 
documents that would not necessarily mention Plaintiff: 
 As explained above, documents evidencing Epstein’s trafficking and sexual 
assaults of others, although not about Plaintiff herself, are directly relevant to 
whether he trafficked and sexually assaulted Plaintiff.   
 Epstein’s communications with his co-conspirators are likely to evidence the 
scheme by which Epstein recruited and abused Plaintiff, even if they do not 
specifically mention Plaintiff.  For example, documents in which Epstein and his 
co-conspirators discuss recruiting young models or arranging for the travel of 
foreign girls for sexual abuse would corroborate Plaintiff’s allegations. 
 Documents relating to payments from Epstein to his employees are relevant to 
whether Epstein paid his employees to keep them quiet, and would be relevant in 
impeaching witnesses in this case. 
 Documents relating to Epstein’s silencing, intimidation, and manipulation of 
victims other than Plaintiff is relevant to establishing whether Plaintiff reasonably 
feared Epstein, which is relevant to Defendants’ statute of limitations defense and 
Plaintiff’s equitable estoppel theory. 
 Documents relating to Epstein’s recruitment of Plaintiff while on the following trip 
to South Africa, including details about travel plans and itineraries, would not 
mention Plaintiff’s name but are nevertheless highly relevant to what transpired: 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 27   Filed 05/07/20   Page 4 of 6

Plaintiff explained these theories of relevance during a meet and confer call with 
Defendants.  Without any legal basis, and while purporting to understand Plaintiff’s position, 
Defendants consistently maintained that they would not produce any document that does not 
directly mention Juliette Bryant.  This position unwarranted, legally baseless, and unacceptable, 
and Defendants have not indicated that they are willing to change it.  The Court should direct 
Defendants to search for documents within their possession, custody, or control and not allow 
Defendants to unilaterally and arbitrarily limit their search to documents that reference Plaintiff’s 
name. 
IV. 
Defendants Must Respond to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories. 
Plaintiff served 17 interrogatories on Defendants, and Defendants failed to answer a single 
one, aside from listing Plaintiff as an “individual who may have knowledge concerning the issues 
in this lawsuit.”  Ex. D at 3.  Plaintiff asked Defendants to identify email accounts used by Epstein 
or his employees or agents on his behalf—Defendants provided no answer.  Id.  Plaintiff asked 
Defendants to identify telephone numbers used by Epstein or his employees or agents on his 
behalf—Defendants provided no answer.  Id. at 4.  Plaintiff asked Defendants to provide a list of 
Epstein’s employees in an effort to identify potential witnesses to Epstein’s abuse of Plaintiff and 
other victims—Defendants provided no answer.  Id.  This is despite the fact that Defendant Kahn 
is Epstein’s longtime accountant and likely knows who was on Epstein’s payroll.  This total failure 
to answer even basic questions about the location of documents and potential witnesses is 
egregious. 
When asked about their failure to respond to any interrogatories, in addition to raising their 
meritless objections to the Relevant Period and to producing information that does not relate 
directly to Plaintiff, Defendants stated that they do not have responsive information because 
Epstein is dead and Defendants do not know where to look for responsive information.  Defendants 
also drew a distinction between their capacities as Epstein’s lawyer and accountant, as opposed to 
their capacities as executors of his Estate, but could not give Plaintiff a clear answer as to their 
position on how that distinction affects their discovery obligations.  For example, Defendants’ 
counsel could not tell Plaintiff whether Darren Indyke—Epstein’s longtime lawyer who has ties to

Epstein’s co-conspirators3—or Richard Kahn—Epstein’s longtime accountant who assisted him 
for years with both personal and professional accounting work—had ever been directly asked 
whether they know of any individuals who might have information about Plaintiff’s claims. 
Plaintiff still has no understanding of how Defendants have attempted to fulfill their 
discovery obligations, or of what documents or information are within their possession, custody, 
or control.  At this stage in the litigation, such opaqueness is unacceptable and a clear attempt by 
Defendants to avoid their discovery obligations in the hopes that the claims administration process 
comes to fruition.  But Defendants cannot unilaterally decide to stay this case.  The Court should 
direct Defendants to respond to Plaintiff’s interrogatories. 
Respectfully submitted,

According to public records, Indyke, for example, helped Ghislaine Maxwell buy her 
townhouse, was listed on documents relating to one of Maxwell’s nonprofits, held a power of 
attorney over one of Leslie Wexner’s properties, and employed Lesley Groff as an executive 
assistant for his law practice.  See Julia La Roche et al., Jeffrey Epstein’s Lawyers Deeply Involved

Dear Mr. Moskowitz:  
This is a document preservation notice issued in connection with the above-captioned civil 
actions.  Please read this notice carefully and take all steps necessary to preserve all documents 
that might be relevant to this dispute.  You should take affirmative steps to suspend any automated 
deletion.  The documents covered by this notice are potentially subject to discovery and production 
in the above-captioned litigation and will be needed as evidence and/or to enable us to prepare 
fully to take your clients’ sworn testimony in a deposition and/or at a trial 
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26, you were required to identify “all 
documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in 
its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses.”  In your Initial 
Disclosures for Annie Farmer, Teresa Helm, and Juliette Bryant, however, you stated that “[a]t 
present, the Co-Executors are not aware of any such documents, electronically stored information, 
and tangible things.”  I assume that you mean that you are not aware that any “documents, 
electronically stored information, [or] tangible things” that would be supportive of your clients’ 
defenses.  If instead you are taking the position that your clients do not have possession, custody, 
or control over Mr. Epstein’s documents (including his electronically stored information), please 
state so in your reply so that we may bring that to the Court’s attention immediately.   
At the November 21, 2019, conference Judge Freeman stated:  “Counsel should know what 
their obligations are and those obligations are pretty clear under the law and counsel should take 
them seriously.  If you do not preserve evidence that should be preserved that you had a reason to 
believe was relevant to claims or defense in the case and that you didn’t take steps to preserve, 
there can be negative consequences down the road.”  Nov. 21, 2019, Hearing Tr. at 33:4-10.  The 
Court instructed that your preservation efforts should be “broad enough” to documents located at 
Mr. Epstein’s “multiple residences in multiple countries across the world.”

Dear Ms. McCawley:
As you know, we represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced actions
(the “Actions”).  We are writing in response to your letter dated January 28, 2020.
You state: “If … you are taking the position that your clients do not have possession, custody, or 
control over Mr. Epstein’s documents (including his electronically stored information), please 
state so in your reply so that we may bring that to the Court’s attention immediately.”  We have 
never taken that position.  Accordingly, there is nothing to raise with the Court.
Separately, we confirm that our clients are abiding by all of their discovery obligations including 
preservation obligations.  However, your list of subject matters is inappropriate because it is
argumentative, assumes many unproven facts not in evidence and is overly broad.1 Your 
interpretation of Local Rule 26.3 is likewise inappropriate; we defer to the rule itself.   
Very truly yours,
Bennet J. Moskowitz
Bennet J. Moskowitz
1It bears mentioning that counsel in another action against the Co-Executors previously attempted to 
extract positions from us concerning a similar list and, failing that, to obtain relief from Magistrate 
Freeman.  Such counsel obtained no such relief.  Nor was any relief necessary given our identical 
representation in that action that our clients are abiding by their preservation obligations.

JULIETTE BRYANT, 
Plaintiff,  
                       v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN 
in their capacities as the executors of the ESTATE  
OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN, 
Defendants.  
    Case No. 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF 
DEFENDANTS’ OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JULIETTE 
BRYANT’S FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES TO DEFENDANTS 
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as co-executors of the estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), by their attorneys, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
and 33, provide the following responses to Plaintiff Juliette Bryant’s (“Plaintiff”) First Set of 
Interrogatories to Defendants (the “Interrogatories”).  
RESERVATION OF RIGHTS 
These responses are made solely for the purpose of and in relation to discovery in the 
above-captioned action. The Co-Executors submit these responses subject to, and without 
intending to waive, and expressly preserving: (i) any objections as to relevancy, materiality, 
competency, privilege and admissibility of any documents and information produced in discovery, 
including without limitation herein; and (ii) the right to object to any other discovery requests. The 
Co-Executors reserve their right to amend these responses if and when appropriate.  Further, these 
responses are neither an admission nor acceptance of any alleged facts, including without 
limitation those stated in the Interrogatories. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 27-4   Filed 05/07/20   Page 2 of 16

SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS 
The Co-Executors object to Plaintiff’s definition of the term “Jeffrey Epstein” or “Epstein” 
on the grounds that, insofar as it includes “any entities owned or controlled by Jeffrey Epstein, any 
employee, agent, attorney, consultant, or representative of Jeffrey Epstein,” it is overbroad, unduly 
burdensome, vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors will interpret “Jeffrey Epstein” or 
“Epstein” as Jeffrey E. Epstein.  
The Co-Executors also object to Plaintiff’s definition of the term “Ghislaine Maxwell” or 
“Maxwell” on the grounds that, insofar as it includes “any entities owned or controlled by 
Ghislaine Maxwell, any employee, agent, attorney, consultant, or representative of Ghislaine 
Maxwell,” it is overbroad, unduly burdensome, vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors will 
interpret “Ghislaine Maxwell” or “Maxwell” as Ghislaine Maxwell.  
The Co-Executors also object to Plaintiff’s definition of the term “Massage” on the grounds 
that it is more expansive than the common use of the term and is inconsistent with the term’s usage 
in the Complaint. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS 
The Co-Executors object to the time period stated in the Instructions, which is inconsistent 
with the time frame alleged in the Complaint.  Unless otherwise indicated, the Co-Executors will 
confine their searches to the time periods at issue in Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES 
INTERROGATORY NO. 1 
List the names and addresses of all persons who are believed or known by You, Your 
agents, or Your attorneys to have any knowledge concerning any of the issues in this lawsuit, and 
specify the subject matter about which the witness has knowledge. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 27-4   Filed 05/07/20   Page 3 of 16

RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds and to the extent that it 
calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work 
product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.  The Co-
Executors also object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither 
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also overly broad and 
unduly burdensome.  Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objection, the Co-Executors 
identify the following individual who may have knowledge concerning the issues in this lawsuit: 
Plaintiff.  The Co-Executors will supplement this response if any additional responsive information 
is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 2 
Identify all email accounts used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents on his behalf. 
RESPONSE:  
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 2 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds it seeks “discovery about discovery,” which would result in unnecessary expense.  
Such matters are more appropriately and cost-effectively addressed in the context of the parties’ 
discussions regarding document discovery. The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it calls for the production of information protected by the 
attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or 
protection from disclosure.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 27-4   Filed 05/07/20   Page 4 of 16

and to the extent that it calls for the production of information outside their possession, custody, 
and control, and is unconstrained by time. 
INTERROGATORY NO. 3 
Identify all telephone numbers used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents acting 
on his behalf, including beepers, Blackberry or PDA devices, cellular phones and land lines in any 
of his residences, by stating the users name, complete telephone number(s), type of device and 
name of the service provider. 
RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 3 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
vague, overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory 
on the grounds and to the extent that it calls for the production of information outside their 
possession, custody, and control, and is unconstrained by time.  The Co-Executors further object 
to this Interrogatory on the grounds it seeks “discovery about discovery,” which would result in 
unnecessary expense.  Such matters are more appropriately and cost-effectively addressed in the 
context of the parties’ discussions regarding document discovery.  The Co-Executors also object 
to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it calls for the production of information 
protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine, and any other 
applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.   
INTERROGATORY NO. 4 
Identify all employees, including each employee’s position and dates and locations of 
employment, who performed work or services in or on any property owned, leased, occupied, or 
used by Epstein, including but not limited Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach, Florida, New York 
City, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, London and Paris, and provide the name and contact 
information of the individual who hired, trained and supervised each employee. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 27-4   Filed 05/07/20   Page 5 of 16

RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 4 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that it assumes facts not in evidence and that the phrase “performed work or services in 
or on any property” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory 
on the grounds and to the extent that it calls for the production of information protected by the 
attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or 
protection from disclosure.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds 
and to the extent that it calls for the production of information outside their possession, custody, 
and control, and is unconstrained by time. 
INTERROGATORY NO. 5 
Identify all employees, including each employee’s position and dates and locations of 
employment, who performed work as an assistant, scheduler, secretary, masseuse or traveling 
masseuse for Epstein and provide the name and contact information of the individual who hired, 
trained and supervised each employee. 
RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 5 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the terms “scheduler” and “traveling masseuse” are vague and ambiguous.  The Co-
Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it assumes facts 
not in evidence.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the 
extent that it calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the 
attorney work product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.

The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it calls

INTERROGATORY NO. 6

Re: 
Bryant v. Indyke et al., Case No. 1:19-10479 
Dear Bennet: 
I write on behalf of Plaintiff Juliette Bryant in response to Defendants Darren K. Indyke 
and Richard D. Kahn, as co-executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate”), responses 
and objections to the Plaintiff’s discovery requests provided on April 16, 2020.  As you likely have 
anticipated, I specifically write in response to your total failure to respond to your discovery 
obligations.  I ask that we meet and confer about your lack of responses as soon as practicable.  
First, as you are aware, Plaintiff served seventeen interrogatories on Defendants.  You 
answered none of them; rather, each interrogatory is met with an assortment of boilerplate 
objections, ranging from objections to relevancy or “discovery about discovery” or assuming 
“facts not in evidence” (which is especially puzzling, given that the very purpose of discovery is 
to find such facts).  At best, these objections are deficient; at worst, they are meritless and 
borderline frivolous.   
Similarly, you have failed to adequately respond to most of Plaintiff’s document requests.  
Again, your objections are premised on conclusory objections, ranging from objections to 
relevancy and claims that certain documents are outside Defendants’ possession, custody, and 
control.  As part of your discovery obligations, “generalized objections that discovery requests are 
vague, overly broad, or unduly burdensome are not acceptable.”  Shanchun Yu v. Diguojiaoyu, 
Inc., 18-CV-7303, 2019 WL 6174204, *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 2019) (granting plaintiffs’ motion 
to compel discovery after defendants “raised repeated and rote objections to Plaintiffs’ document 
requests, [] refused to provide Plaintiffs any documents whatsoever, and []answered the 
interrogatories in [a] substantially similar fashion”); see also Harris v. Bronx Parent Housing 
Network, Inc., 18-CV-11681, 2020 WL 763740, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2020) (“Boilerplate 
objections that include unsubstantiated claims of undue burden, overbreadth and lack of relevancy, 
accompanied by a lack of document production or interrogatory response, are a paradigm of 
discovery abuse.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “A party resisting discovery

has the burden of showing specifically how, despite the broad and liberal construction afforded 
the federal discovery rules, each interrogatory is not relevant or how each question is overly broad, 
burdensome or oppressive . . . by submitting affidavits or offering evidence revealing the nature 
of the burden.”  Harris, 2020 WL 763740, at *2 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   
Second, your relevance objections are meritless.  All of Plaintiff’s requests are relevant.  
For example, please explain how documents relating to Juliette Bryant are not relevant to her 
claims or are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  See 
Request 1.  Plaintiff alleges that Epstein abused her for years, organized her overseas travel on 
many occasions, obtained travel documents for her, housed her in his apartment building, and 
emailed her as recently as June 2019.  She is entitled to any document relating to her.  Plaintiff’s 
other requests are also directly relevant to her claims or the Estate’s anticipated affirmative 
defenses.  She is entitled to discovery, for example, about Epstein’s communications and 
relationships with the people who accompanied him to South Africa when he recruited her to be a 
part of his sex-trafficking operation (e.g., RFPs 15, 53, 67–70; Interrogatory 11); documents 
relating to the employees who helped him transport Plaintiff to the United States and schedule 
Plaintiff for sex (e.g., RFPs 3, 4, 29, 30, 31-38, 46-47); his pattern of enticing young models to fly 
to the United States by falsely claiming that he could get them modeling opportunities (e.g., RFPs 
18, 42, 76, 80–82); his communications with his associates who were present in Epstein’s homes 
when Plaintiff was abused (e.g., RFPs 63–66); and Epstein’s travel to the places in which he abused 
Plaintiff (e.g., RFPs 54–59). 
Moreover, Plaintiff is entitled to know the breadth and nature the sex-trafficking operation 
that she was victimized by.  See Fed. R. Evid. 415 (“In a civil case involving a claim for relief 
based on a party’s alleged sexual assault or child molestation, the court may admit evidence that 
the party committed any other sexual assault or child molestation.”).  Plaintiff alleges that Epstein 
utilized his sex-trafficking operation to recruit and abuse countless young girls and women in a 
methodical and similar fashion.  Epstein’s recruitment, trafficking, and assault of other girls in the 
same way that he recruited, trafficked, and assaulted Plaintiff would make Plaintiff’s allegations 
more probable.  See Fed. R. Evid. 401.  Plaintiff’s discovery requests are therefore directly relevant 
to the allegations in her Complaint, or, at a minimum, are reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence. 
Third, your objections to certain of the time periods stated in the Requests are meritless for 
several reasons.  As explained above, Epstein’s other sexual assaults would be both relevant and 
admissible in this case, regardless of time period.  Further, you have raised a statute of limitations 
defense in Plaintiff’s case, and Plaintiff has made an equitable estoppel argument in response.  
Plaintiff is entitled to discovery relevant to her equitable estoppel theory, including but not limited 
to any threats or misrepresentations that Epstein made to Plaintiff to prevent her from filing this 
lawsuit, outside of the time period during which Plaintiff was physically abused by Epstein. 
Fourth, your objection to Plaintiff’s definition of Jeffrey Epstein as including “any entities 
owned or controlled by Jeffrey Epstein, any employee, agent, attorney, consultant, or 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 27-6   Filed 05/07/20   Page 3 of 4

representative of Jeffrey Epstein” is an improper attempt to narrow your discovery obligations in 
this matter.  Your objection directly contradicts the Local Rules of this Court, which define the 
word “parties” as including a defendant’s “employees, partners,  . . . or affiliates.”  Local Rule 
26.3(c)(5).  Plaintiff’s definition is proper. 
Fifth, your responses and objections state many times that certain documents and 
information are outside of the Estate’s possession, custody, and control.  If that is the case, please 
explain what is and is not within the Estate’s possession and control.  For example, please explain 
in detail what computers, hard drives, email accounts, telephone records, or hard copy documents 
you have reviewed and provide a list of search terms that were used and specifically list what items 
you claim to not have access to. We know that Epstein at a minimum used the following email 
accounts: 
x jeffreye@mindspring.com; 
x jeeproject@yahoo.com; 
x jeevacation@gmail.com; 
x jepstein@revonet.com;

x cecilia@ellmax.com; 
x cecilia.steen@gmail.com;  
x jeffrey.epstein@centurytel.net; and 
x epsteinj@wanadoo.fr   
Confirm that you have accessed and searched each of these accounts and provide the 
protocol used for the search.  In the alternative, if the Estate contends that information that is 
responsive to Plaintiff’s discovery requests was destroyed, provide all details relating to the 
destruction.   
Please let us know your availability for a meet and confer on the following dates and times:   
x Wednesday, April 22, 2020 between 2:00 and 3:00 EST; 
x Thursday, April 23, 2020 between 3:00 EST and 6:00 EST; and

Juliette Bryant, 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced actions 
commenced by Plaintiffs Jane Doe 1000, Teresa Helm and Juliette Bryant (the “Actions”).  
Plaintiffs filed a letter in each of the Actions yesterday seeking a pre-motion conference on 
Plaintiffs’ anticipated motions to compel, among other things, interrogatory responses (the 
“Letters”).  While we address threshold issues with the Letters below – primarily that they are 
premature and inconsistent with Your Honor’s individual rules and directions regarding the parties’ 
obligation to engage in meaningful efforts to resolve discovery issues before seeking the court’s 
intervention – one of Your Honor’s explicitly stated pet peeves – we respectfully request that the 
Court deny the requests for pre-motion conferences as an unnecessary waste of the Court’s time.  
Alternatively, the Co-Executors request permission to submit a response to the substantive issues 
raised in the Letters by May 13, 2020, by which time Co-Executors expect to have supplemented 
their interrogatory responses, which is something the Co-Executors agreed to do as a 
compromise, before Plaintiffs went ahead and filed the Letters with the Court.
The timing of the Letters is particularly troubling considering that the parties’ meet-and-
confer process was still very much on-going with respect to issues raised by both sides.  In fact, 
we emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel on May 6 seeking confirmation that, in light of the parties’ continued 
communications to resolve certain discovery issues, which only commenced on April 27, 
neither side would seek judicial intervention at this time, consistent with Your Honor’s directives.   
Plaintiffs responded to that email yesterday at 5:41PM – 35 mins before they filed the 
Letters – leaving us no opportunity to respond to Plaintiffs’ suggestion that the Parties were at an 
impasse.  That is perplexing, given that the Co-Executors advised Plaintiffs’ counsel during our 
conversation on April 27 (and again as recently as May 5) that the Co-Executors would be 
supplementing their interrogatory responses and would consider their position on a number of the 
issues Plaintiffs raised and get back to them.  Plaintiffs’ inexplicable rush to demand a pre-motion

conference not only violates Your Honor’s rules and explicit directions, it appears designed to 
obtain a perceived litigation advantage in an effort to detract from Plaintiffs’ refusal to comply with 
their own discovery obligations (including, for example, their refusal to produce all of their medical 
records, and not just those that Plaintiffs unilaterally deem relevant to these actions).  Again, these 
are issues which the Co-Executors had believed the parties were still discussing in good faith. 
Accordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ request for a pre-motion conference on the 
grounds that the Letters are premature, misconstrue the nature of the Parties’ discussions and 
violate Your Honor’s rules concerning the Parties’ obligations to meet and confer in good faith in 
an effort to resolve or narrow discovery disputes.  However, if Your Honor is inclined to consider 
Plaintiffs’ request, then the Co-Executors respectfully request permission to submit a response to 
the substantive issues raised in the Letters by May 13, 2020. 
Respectfully submitted,

Re: 
Juliette Bryant v. Darren K. Indyke & Richard D. Kahn, 19-10479-ALC-DCF 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
We submit on behalf of Plaintiff Juliette Bryant this reply in further support of her letter 
motion for a conference to address Defendants’ complete failure to participate in discovery to date 
(ECF No. 27), and in response to Defendants’ letter, filed on May 8, 2020 (ECF No. 28).  As set 
forth in Plaintiff’s opening letter, Defendants refuse to produce documents concerning Jeffrey 
Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy.  Instead, they offer to produce only documents that directly 
mention Plaintiff’s name, and documents only from limited time periods surrounding the specific 
dates on which she was abused.  ECF No. 27.  Defendants also failed to respond to any of Plaintiff’s 
Rule 33 interrogatories.  Defendants’ opposition admittedly offers no “response to the substantive 
issues,” yet asks the Court to deny Plaintiff’s request for a conference because it would somehow 
be “an unnecessary waste of the Court’s time.”  ECF No. 28 at 1.  The Court should reject 
Defendants’ transparent delay tactic and order the Defendants to address their discovery 
deficiencies immediately.  
Defendants’ only basis for arguing that a conference would be “premature” is that, on April 
30, they promised to serve amended responses to Plaintiff’s interrogatories by the end of last week.  
But not only did Defendants fail to serve amended interrogatory responses last week (despite 
committing to do so), they have never even offered to amend their responses to Plaintiff’s Rule 34 
requests for production.  Defendants also made clear at a meet and confer held on Tuesday, May 
5, that they would not be changing their positions on the threshold disputes identified in Plaintiff’s 
letter.  These disputes, which the parties have already conferred over for hours, are therefore ripe 
for the Court’s review. 
Contrary to Defendants’ suggestion, Plaintiff has complied with her obligations to meet 
and confer in good faith.  She has also already produced hundreds of documents spanning over 
10,000 pages.  Instead, it is Defendants’ obstructionist conduct that requires immediate Court 
intervention.  Because this case was filed six months ago and the Court’s Rule 16 conference took 
place back in February, Defendants’ failure to produce a single document or meaningfully respond 
to discovery requests can only be viewed as an intentional effort to delay discovery.  As just one 
example, Defendants claim that they “expect” to be able to “supplement” their interrogatory 
responses by May 13.  But their initial responses, which are attached as exhibits to Plaintiff’s

opening letter, speak for themselves, and make clear that Defendants have not undertaken 
reasonable efforts to comply with their discovery obligations or meet Court-ordered deadlines in 
good faith.  Where, as here, Defendants (i) refused to answer interrogatories such as “Identify all 
email accounts used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents on his behalf”; (ii) failed to 
provide signatures, pursuant to Rule 33(b)(5), indicating that counsel even discussed the 
interrogatories with their clients before serving their responses; and (iii) did not send a single 
attorney involved in the drafting of their objections to the parties’ April 27 meet and confer, leaving 
Defendants unable to explain how their responses were crafted or even articulate what they meant; 
it is clear that Defendants are attempting to game the process to maximize delay.  Plaintiff’s 
decision to curtail these dilatory tactics therefore does not fall within what the Court described as 
a “pet peeve” at the February 11, 2020, conference.                              
Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her request for a conference to address 
these issues.

Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 6 of 32

Plaintiff Juliette Bryant, by and through her undersigned attorneys, respectfully submits 
this Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint.1   
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
For decades, Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators recruited countless young women to 
his homes across the world, and forced them to give him massages that escalated into sexual 
assault.  Juliette Bryant was just one of many victims that Epstein and his co-conspirators recruited 
to be a part of their sex-trafficking operation when she was a young woman.  Epstein offered to 
help Plaintiff with her dream of modeling in New York, but instead sexually abused her for years. 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely, but wholly ignore the burden that 
they bear to prove such an affirmative defense at this stage of this litigation.  First, Plaintiff’s 
claims are timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provided Plaintiff with one year from 
the termination of the criminal action again Epstein to file an action.  Second, Plaintiff’s claims 
are timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c, which provides rape victims with 20 years to bring an 
action against the perpetrator.  Third, Defendants have failed to meet their burden of showing that 
Plaintiff will be unable to invoke equitable estoppel and equitable tolling, highly factual doctrines.  
Finally, Defendants’ motion to “dismiss” Plaintiff’s demand for punitive damages is procedurally 
improper and incorrect.  The Court should deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss in full. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
In 2002, Juliette Bryant was a 20-year old aspiring model living in South Africa.  Compl. 
¶ 38.  She had never left the country, but dreamed of becoming a model in New York City.  Id. 
¶¶ 39, 41.  One day, she met Naja Hill, an American model visiting South Africa, who offered her 
the opportunity to meet a man who Hill called the “King of America” and who could help her

achieve her dream of modeling in New York City.  Id. ¶ 38.  That man was Jeffrey Epstein, who 
was visiting South Africa with an American government official, an actor, and a comedian.  Id.  
Juliette agreed, and met Epstein and his high-profile entourage at a restaurant.  Id. ¶ 39.  
They invited Juliette to attend the government official’s speech the next day, accompanied by a 
police escort.  Id.  Epstein asked Juliette to bring her modeling portfolio to his hotel for a “casting,” 
told her that he owned a modeling agency and could get her an agent in New York City, and 
bragged that he was good friends with Les Wexner, the owner of Victoria’s Secret.  Id.  ¶ 40.  
Because of his clear power and relationships with high-profile individuals, Juliette believed him.  
After assuring Juliette’s mother that she would be safe with him, Epstein’s employees facilitated 
her travel to New York City, including by getting her a passport.  Id. ¶¶ 40-41.  
When Juliette arrived in New York, Sarah Kellen, one of Epstein’s employees, called 
Juliette and told her that she would be traveling to the Caribbean with Epstein on his private plane.  
Id. ¶ 42.  On the flight, Juliette felt terrified and trapped.  Id. ¶¶ 43-45.  Juliette eventually arrived 
at Epstein’s island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”), and Kellen sent Juliette to Epstein’s room 
for a massage.  Id. ¶ 44.  That was when Epstein began sexually assaulting Juliette.  Id.  During 
the massages, he would touch her, use massage devices on her, force her to perform oral sex on 
him, and rape her.  Id.  She cried herself to sleep each night.  Id. ¶ 45.  For years, Epstein continued 
to sexually traffic Juliette.  Epstein sexually abused Juliette during each visit, and at all of his 
homes, including his New York mansion.  Id. ¶ 46.   
From the start, Juliette’s interactions with Epstein were always defined by his power and 
control:  immediately introducing her to a high-level government official who was traveling with 
two celebrities and a police escort, and showing her his private plane, numerous mansions, private 
island, and large staff that he used to give the false impression of legitimacy.   Id. ¶¶ 39, 42-44.  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 8 of 32

Epstein purposefully displayed photographs of powerful political figures in his mansion to show 
that he was well-connected and powerful.  Id. ¶ 48.  And if that was not clear enough, Epstein 
specifically told Juliette that he planted drugs on another girl who accused him of rape and had her 
sent to prison.  Id.  ¶ 47.  Even after Juliette was able to distance herself from Epstein in 2004, he 
continued to contact her over the years, and, two months before his death, asked her to send him 
nude photographs.  Id. ¶¶ 50, 51.  The experiences Epstein subjected her to left Juliette with an 
eating disorder, debilitating panic attacks, anxiety, and substance abuse issues.  Id. ¶ 52.  
After decades of escaping appropriate punishment for his extraordinarily far-reaching and 
disturbing crimes, Epstein was indicted in July 2019 on one count of sex trafficking conspiracy 
and one count of sex trafficking.  Compl., Ex. A (the “Indictment”).  The Indictment specifically 
described how Epstein recruited victims to come to his New York and Florida mansions to give 
him massages.  Indictment ¶¶ 3, 9, 15.  During the massages, Epstein “would escalate the nature 
and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim’s genitals” with his hands or sex toys.  Id.  
¶¶ 9, 15.  Afterwards, Epstein and his associates would continue to contact victims to schedule 
appointments for additional sexual encounters so that he could continue to abuse them.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 
17.  Juliette’s claims arise directly from this scheme of recruitment and sexual assault. 
On August 8, 2019, shortly after Epstein’s Indictment, Epstein executed his last will and 
testament, naming Defendants the executors of his Estate.  Compl. ¶ 30.  Two days later, Epstein 
was found dead in his jail cell.  Id. ¶ 31.  His last will and testament was filed in the USVI on 
August 15, 2019.  Id. ¶ 32.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office submitted a proposed nolle prosequi order 
and Judge Richard M. Berman dismissed the indictment on August 29, 2019.  Id. ¶ 36.  Plaintiff 
filed her Complaint shortly thereafter, on November 14, 2019.

ARGUMENT 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims and Plaintiff’s request for punitive 
damages should be denied.  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient 
factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. . . . A claim 
has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the 
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court must “accept[] all factual 
allegations in the complaint as true and draw[] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.”  
Kashef v. BNP Paribas S.A., 925 F.3d 53, 58 (2d Cir. 2019). 
Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor, Defendants have failed to meet their 
burden of proving that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely.  Further, Defendants’ argument that the 
Court should “dismiss” punitive damages is procedurally improper and substantively incorrect. 
I. 
Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden of Proving that Plaintiff’s Claims 
Are Untimely. 
Because the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, Defendants bear the burden of 
proving that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely.  See Childers v. New York & Presbyterian Hosp., 36 
F. Supp. 3d 292, 301 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).  “[A] complaint does not need to anticipate potential 
affirmative defenses, such as the statute of limitations, and to affirmatively plead facts in avoidance 
of such defenses.”  Id. at 315 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, “dismissal is 
appropriate only if a complaint clearly shows the claim is out of time.”  Harris v. City of New York, 
186 F.3d 243, 250 (2d Cir. 1999).  In this case, Plaintiff’s factual allegations demonstrate that 
(A) her claims are timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), (B) her claims are timely under 
C.P.L.R. § 213-c, (C) C.P.L.R. § 202 does not apply to her claims, (D) Defendants are equitably 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 10 of 32

estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense, and (E) the limitations period for bringing 
her claims was equitably tolled. 2 
A. 
Plaintiff’s Claims Are Timely Under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
Plaintiff’s claims fall squarely within N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which allowed Plaintiff 
to file her complaint within a year of the Indictment’s dismissal.  That provision provides that:  
Whenever it is shown that a criminal action against the same 
defendant has been commenced with respect to the event or 
occurrence from which a claim . . . arises, the plaintiff shall have at 
least one year from the termination of the criminal action . . . in 
which to commence the civil action . . . . 
Id.  Plaintiff filed the Complaint within one year of the Indictment’s dismissal—her claims are 
therefore timely.  Defendants’ only argument to the contrary is that the Indictment did not concern 
the same event or transaction from which Plaintiff’s civil action arose because the Indictment 
targeted, according to Defendants, some separate sex-trafficking operation that only involved 
underage girls.  Defs.’ Mem. at 7 (“Because Plaintiff alleges she was between 20 and 22 years old 
when Decedent assaulted her (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 38, 50), this action and the Indictment necessarily arise 
from different events or occurrences.”).  But Defendants mischaracterize § 215(8)(a), the case law, 
Plaintiff’s Complaint, and, most egregiously, the vast sex-trafficking operation that the Indictment 
targeted.   
In another victim’s action against the Estate, the court recognized that the doctrines of 
equitable estoppel and equitable tolling are “very fact specific” and accordingly asked Defendants 
to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss prior to discovery.  Transcript of Pre-Motion Conference 
at 3:4-8, Farmer v. Indyke, et al., No. 19-cv-10475 (LGS) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2020), Dkt. 39 (“[T]he 
doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling could, nevertheless, save the claims and make 
them timely and that is very fact specific, or early in the case I presumed there will be factual 
issues around those questions . . . .”).

1. 
The Indictment Was Not Restricted to Minors. 
As an initial matter, the Indictment covered the crimes Defendants committed against 
Plaintiff, notwithstanding the fact that she did not allege that she was a child when they occurred.  
Defendants seek to minimize the scope of the abuse alleged in the Indictment by focusing on its 
reference to “minors.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 7, 9-10.  But clinging to the use of the word “minors” does 
not change the nature of the vast and sophisticated operation alleged in the Indictment.  Epstein’s 
pattern and practice was to recruit and traffic young females that he knew he could exploit, and 
the Indictment spells out that pattern.  Age is not the deciding factor as to whether a female was a 
victim of Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation and the patterns of recruitment and abuse described 
in the Indictment.  And the fact that many of the victims were minors does not mean that 
non-minors were not also victimized by Epstein’s sophisticated sex-trafficking operation.  Indeed, 
the Indictment states that “many” of Epstein’s victims were minors, demonstrating that prosecutors 
were investigating Epstein’s crimes against young women over the age of 18 as well.  Indictment 
¶ 11 (“[Epstein] knew that many of his New York victims were underage.”); id. ¶ 17 (“JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain of his victims were underage . . . .” (emphasis added)).3 
The mere fact that Plaintiff did not allege that she was a minor at the time that she was 
recruited into Epstein’s sex-trafficking scheme does not negate the fact that Plaintiff’s civil claims 
arise from the acts described in the Indictment.  Plaintiff therefore had one year from August 29, 
The FBI confirmed this understanding of the Indictment’s scope in a press release issued 
two days after Epstein’s arrest, stating to Epstein’s victims: “We want to hear from you, regardless 
of the age you are now, or whatever age you were then, no matter where the incident took place.”

2019, the date on which Judge Berman formally dismissed the Indictment, to file the Complaint.  
Having filed suit on November 14, 2019, her claims fall well within that limitations period. 
2. 
Plaintiff’s Claims Concern the Same Sex-Trafficking Operation that the 
Indictment Concerned. 
Even if the Indictment was for some reason limited to Epstein’s trafficking of minors (to 
the exclusion of other victims), Plaintiff’s claims would nonetheless arise from the same “event or 
occurrence” for the purposes of § 215(8)(a).  See, e.g., Kashef, 925 F.3d at 62 (noting that “a New 
York appellate court explicitly rejected the theory that the tolling provisions of CPLR 215(8) are 
exclusively for the benefit of the victims of the crime charged in the criminal proceeding” (internal 
quotation marks omitted)).  Contrary to Defendants’ suggestion, the Court should not construe the 
Indictment “narrowly,” Defs.’ Mem. at 7, where the Indictment itself describes a pattern of abuse 
against numerous victims spanning a number of years.  Epstein repeated the same patterns of 
recruitment and abuse time and time again on countless young females, including Plaintiff.  See, 
e.g., Indictment ¶ 7 (explaining that Epstein “perpetuated [the] abuse in similar ways” against 
victims).  The Indictment was therefore not limited to neatly categorized events that happened on 
specified dates—it covered a sprawling sex-trafficking operation that occurred “over the course of 
many years” and affected an unspecified number of victims.  Id. ¶ 1. 
Defendants’ contention that the Indictment does not concern the same sex-trafficking 
operation that victimized her is incorrect.  Defs.’ Mem. at 9-10.  The sex-trafficking operation that 
the Indictment described is precisely the same sex-trafficking operation that Plaintiff was lured 
into.  Just as the Indictment alleged that Epstein enticed and recruited females to engage in sex 
acts with him in multiple locations, Indictment ¶ 1, Epstein enticed and recruited Plaintiff to engage 
in sex acts with him in New York, the USVI, France, Florida, and New Mexico.  Compl. ¶¶ 25, 
55.  Just as the Indictment alleges that the abuse would start out with the victim performing a 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 13 of 32

massage on Epstein, Indictment ¶¶ 9, 15, Plaintiff’s abuse started when Sarah Kellen sent her to 
massage Epstein.  Compl. ¶ 44.  The Indictment alleges that Epstein would escalate the nature and 
scope of physical contact during the massages to include sex acts such as groping and touching 
victims with sex toys, Indictment ¶¶ 9, 15, and Epstein escalated the nature and scope of Plaintiff’s 
massages to include touching her and using massage devices on her, among other things.  Compl. 
¶ 44.  And, finally, just as Epstein or his employees would contact victims to schedule their return 
to his home for additional sexual encounters, Indictment ¶ 11, Epstein contacted Plaintiff many 
times to arrange for her to travel back to the United States for sex.  Compl. ¶ 46.  The conduct 
alleged in the Indictment is precisely the conduct alleged in the Complaint. 
3. 
Defendants’ Attempts to Narrow the Scope of C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a) Fail. 
Defendants seek to advance a strained interpretation of § 215(8)(a)’s “event or occurrence” 
requirement, asserting that this Court must “apply C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a) narrowly” to limit its 
availability to the crimes committed against the specific victims identified in the Indictment.  
Defs.’ Mem. at 7.  But § 215(8) “is a remedial measure intended to alleviate victims of crime from 
the strict and arbitrary nature of the statute of limitations and to make it easier for such victims to 
obtain civil redress for the criminal wrongs that they have endured.”  LaRocca v. Collen IP, No. 
Civ. 6274, 2009 WL 10435869, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 6, 2009).  New York courts “are instructed 
to give broad and liberal construction to remedial statutes” like § 215(8).  Id.  Defendants’ narrow 
interpretation of § 215(8)(a) “would frustrate the Legislature’s goal of making it easier for victims 
of crimes to obtain civil redress for the criminal wrongs that they have endured.”  Id. 
Further, the cases that Defendants cite to narrow § 215(8)(a)’s scope are inapposite.  The 
criminal actions in those cases focused on crimes that occurred on specified dates and both cases 
explicitly recognized that the relevant criminal prosecutions were commenced “only in connection 
with the events of these [specific] days.”  See Christodoulou v. Terdeman, 262 A.D.2d 595, 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 14 of 32

595-596 (2d Dep’t 1999) (criminal prosecution against defendant commenced only in connection 
with events on two specific days); Gallina v. Thatcher, No. 2017-52980, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 
8435, at *3-4 (Sup. Ct. Oct. 23, 2018) (plaintiff sued for assault and battery that occurred over the 
course of two years but the indictment “charged [the defendant] for incidents occurring on three 
(3) specific dates”).  By contrast, the Indictment in this case was not limited to a specific day or 
discrete event.  Rather, the Indictment covered sexual abuse that occurred “over the course of many 
years.”  Indictment ¶¶ 1–2, 8, 20, 24.  Further, the Indictment charged Epstein with conspiracy and 
a broad sex-trafficking scheme, while the criminal actions in Christodoulou and Gallina charged 
the defendants with crimes stemming from isolated incidents.4 
In contrast, the Second Circuit’s opinion in Kashef controls and demonstrates why 
Plaintiff’s claims fall within § 215(8)(a) here.  In Kashef, BNP Paribas (“BNPP”) entered a guilty 
plea conceding “knowledge of the atrocities being committed in Sudan and of the consequences 
of providing Sudan access to U.S. financial markets.”  Kashef, 925 F.3d at 56.  The plaintiffs, 
Sudanese victims of mass rape, torture, deliberate infection with HIV, and other atrocities, filed a 
complaint against BNPP within a year of the judgment of conviction, contending that their claims 
were timely under C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a).  Id. at 57, 62–63.  BNPP attempted to argue—similar to 
Defendants’ argument here—that § 215(8)(a) did not apply because the plaintiffs “played no role 
in the proceedings surrounding BNP Paribas’s plea agreement,” the criminal action “required no 
investigation of or briefing on any injuries sustained by Plaintiffs,” and the facts in the criminal 
Defendants also cite McElligott v. City of New York, No. 15 CIV. 7107 (LGS), 2017 WL 
6210840, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2017), but that case is inapplicable because it hinged on whether 
the defendant in the civil action was the same defendant charged in the criminal action.   
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 15 of 32

case and the civil case were not “identical.”  Brief of Defendants-Appellees at 51–52, Kashef 
v. BNP Paribas S.A., No. 18-1304 (2d Cir. Aug. 9, 2018), Dkt. 92. 
The Second Circuit rejected BNPP’s argument, and instead found that the “event or 
occurrence” for § 215(8) purposes was more generally “BNPP’s conspiracy with Sudan to violate 
U.S. sanctions” for humanitarian violations.  925 F.3d at 62–63.  The court therefore held that the 
victims of those humanitarian violations could bring timely claims under § 215(8)(a).  Id.  That 
conspiracy, like the one here, was a broad scheme spanning many years, rather than a single event 
(such as an assault on a specified date).  Just as BNPP’s conspiracy to violate sanctions was the 
relevant event or occurrence in Kashef, Epstein’s widespread sex-trafficking scheme is the event 
or occurrence at issue in Plaintiff’s case for the purposes of applying § 215(8)(a).  Defendants 
attempt to distinguish Kashef by pointing out that “the civil and criminal actions in that case both 
arose out of the same conspiracy between BNP and Sudan to violate U.S. sanctions,” Defs.’ Mem. 
at 10, but that fact only highlights Kashef’s applicability to this case, which also involves a civil 
action and a criminal action arising from the same conspiracy.  Defendants have failed to meet 
their burden of proving that Plaintiff’s claims do not arise from the same event or occurrence as 
the Indictment, and therefore that § 215(8)(a) does not apply to her claims.5 
B. 
Plaintiff’s Claims are Timely Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c. 
Plaintiff’s claims are also timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c, which provides that: 
Notwithstanding any other limitation set forth in this article, . . . all 
civil claims or causes of action brought by any person for physical, 
psychological or other injury or condition suffered by such person 
Defendants argue that a broad construction of § 215(8)(a) would make the “event or 
occurrence” language “meaningless.” Defs.’ Mem. at 9.  But Plaintiff does not ask the Court to 
disregard the “event or occurrence” limitation.  Rather, she contends that the “event or occurrence” 
in this case is a sex-trafficking scheme, not the abuse of a delineated victim, and that because she 
was a victim of that sex-trafficking scheme, her claims arise from it.  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 16 of 32

as a result of conduct which would constitute rape in the first degree 
as defined in section 130.35 of the penal law, . . . may be brought . . . 
within twenty years.  
N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-c.6  Plaintiff alleges that Epstein sexually assaulted her multiple times within 
years of the filing of this lawsuit, and that the assaults constituted one or more sex crimes listed 
in § 213-c.  Compl. ¶¶ 44, 56.  Her claims are therefore timely under § 213-c. 
Defendants contend that the 20-year statute of limitations of § 213-c does not apply to 
Plaintiff’s claims because it was adopted in 2019 and does not apply retroactively.  Defs.’ Mem. 
at 10–12.  But New York “[c]ourts have employed customary tools of construction to find the 
requisite intent to give retroactive effect to new laws affecting periods of limitation.”  McGuirk 
v. City Sch. Dist. of Albany, 116 A.D.2d 363, 365 (3d Dep’t 1986).  Using those tools, New York 
courts have held that certain amendments to limitations periods apply retroactively.  See, e.g., 
Meegan S. v. Donald T., 475 N.E.2d 449, 450 (N.Y. 1984) (“[T]he enlargement of the Statute of 
Limitations for paternity suits is to be applied retroactively.”). 
Contrary to Defendants’ argument, the text and legislative history of § 213-c demonstrate 
the New York Legislature’s intent for it to apply retroactively.  The bill’s legislative history 
highlights the “ticking clock” that the former statute of limitations imposed on victims of sexual 
abuse:  “For crimes of sexual violence in particular, the clock ticks against the trauma and culture 
of silence that prevents victims from speaking out.  Over the last year, victims who have suffered 
in silence for decades have bravely spoken about their abuse . . . .”  N.Y. Comm. Rep., 2019 N.Y. 
S.B. No. 6574, 242nd Legis. Sess. (June 17, 2019).  The Legislature’s explicit reference to “victims 
who have suffered in silence for decades,” like Plaintiff, and victims that have been prevented 
“A person is guilty of rape in the first degree when he or she engages in sexual intercourse 
with another person . . . [b]y forcible compulsion.”  N.Y. Penal Law § 130.35.   
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 17 of 32

“from speaking out,” also like Plaintiff, evince an intent for the provision to apply retroactively to 
victims like Plaintiff.  In light of the legislative goals behind the amendment to § 213-c, the Court 
should hold that it applies retroactively to Plaintiff’s claims. 
Moreover, “remedial legislation should be given retroactive effect in order to effectuate its 
beneficial purpose.”  In re Gleason (Michael Vee, Ltd.), 749 N.E.2d 724, 726 (N.Y. 2001).  In 
citing N.Y. Stat. Law § 51 for the proposition that statutes are construed as applying only 
prospectively, Defendants wholly ignore § 54, which explicitly states that “[r]emedial statutes 
constitute an exception to the general rule that statutes are not to be given a retroactive operation.”  
The primary case the Defendants cite also recognizes that remedial statutes are given retroactive 
effect.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 11 (citing Gleason v. Holman Contract Warehousing, Inc., 649 
N.Y.S.2d 647, 651 (Sup. Ct. 1996) (recognizing that whether statute is remedial “does greatly 
impact upon the decision as to whether or not the new statute should be held to be retroactive”)). 
Legislative history establishes that the amendment to § 213-c was remedial in nature—it 
extended the statute of limitations for certain sexual offenses in order to correct the injustice that 
the shorter limitations period imposed on victims.  See Coffman v. Coffman, 60 A.D.2d 181, 188 
(2d Dep’t 1977) (“Remedial statutes are those designed to correct imperfections in prior law, by 
generally giving relief to the aggrieved party.”  (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also 
Meegan S., 475 N.E.2d at 450 (finding that amendment extending statute of limitations in paternity 
suits was remedial legislation); https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-joined-
leaders-times-movement-signs-legislation-extending-rape-statute (last visited March 30, 2020) 
(“This new law recognizes the injustice that has gone on for far too long . . . .”).  “[I]nsofar as 
remedial statutes are concerned, the court should consider the mischief sought to be remedied and 
should favor the construction which will suppress the evil and advance the remedy.”  Burrows 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 18 of 32

v. Bd. of Assessors for Town of Chatham, 98 A.D.2d 250, 253 (3d Dep’t 1983) (internal quotation 
marks and citations omitted), aff’d, 473 N.E.2d 748 (N.Y. 1984).  The remedial purpose of the 
amendment to § 213-c, to correct the injustice of providing rape victims who were prevented from 
speaking out with only five years to bring actions, would be undermined if the amendment were 
only applied prospectively.  Plaintiff’s claims are therefore timely under § 213-c. 
C. 
N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 202 Does Not Apply to Plaintiff’s Claims. 
By its express terms, New York’s borrowing statute, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 202, only applies to 
“[a]n action based upon a cause of action accruing without the state.”  Contrary to Defendants’ 
argument, § 202 does not apply to or bar Plaintiff’s claims for three independent reasons. 
1. 
Statutory Interpretation Precludes the Application of C.P.L.R. § 202. 
Under principles of statutory interpretation, § 202 does not apply.  In both § 215(8)(a) and 
§ 213-c, both of which apply to Plaintiff’s claims as argued above, the New York Legislature 
included language that explicitly precludes § 202’s application.  Section 215(8)(a) specifically 
states that a plaintiff has one year after an indictment’s dismissal to assert her claims, 
“notwithstanding that the time in which to commence such action has already expired.”  (Emphasis 
added).  That the Legislature intended to afford plaintiffs the ability to pursue civil actions in 
connection with a prosecuted crime, even if the statute of limitations had expired, is clear and 
unambiguous, and the Court need go no further to find that § 215(8)(a) precludes the application 
of § 202.  N.Y. Stat. Law § 76 (“Where words of a statute are free from ambiguity and express 
plainly, clearly and distinctly the legislative intent, resort may not be had to other means of 
interpretation.”); see also Clemens v. Nealon, 202 A.D.2d 747, 749 (3d Dep’t 1994) (citing Stat. 
Law § 76 and finding that § 215(8) is clear and unambiguous). 
Similarly, § 213-c provides that victims of certain criminal sexual acts have 20 years to 
assert a cause of action, “[n]otwithstanding any other limitation set forth in” Article 2, and § 202 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 19 of 32

is a limitation set forth in Article 2.  (Emphasis added).  Under the unambiguous language of 
§ 215(8)(a) and § 213-c, Plaintiff’s claims would be timely even if § 202 would otherwise render 
Plaintiff’s claims untimely under the statute of limitations of another jurisdiction. 
2. 
Plaintiff’s Claims Did Not Accrue “Without the State” of New York. 
Section 202 only applies to claims “accruing without the state.”  Defendants wholly ignore 
the concept of accrual, and argue that because Plaintiff was sexually assaulted in many places, her 
claims must fall within the limitations periods of all of the jurisdictions in which Epstein ever 
harmed her.  Defs.’ Mem. at 4-5.  This is incorrect.  As an initial matter, Defendants’ arguments 
on this point concede that Plaintiff’s claims are timely when based on the multiple assaults Plaintiff 
suffered in the state of New York.  See Compl. ¶ 46 (“Epstein forced her to travel to the United 
States many times to see Epstein and be subjected to repeated sexual abuse for one to two weeks 
at a time, sometimes staying in his New York apartment.”).  And as to the instances where Plaintiff 
was raped or abused in other locations, those crimes still accrued inside the state, as they were 
planned and initiated in New York, which served as the epicenter of Epstein’s sex-trafficking 
conspiracy.  For example, Epstein and his co-conspirators lured Plaintiff to New York, and it was 
from New York that Epstein sent Plaintiff to other locations to be abused.  See id. ¶ 41 (“Epstein 
called Juliette’s mother from New York to assure her that Juliette would be safe with him in New 
York.”); id. ¶ 42 (“Shortly after arriving at the apartment, Sarah Kellen, another one of Epstein’s 
co-conspirators, called and told Juliette that Juliette was going to the Caribbean.”).  
3. 
Plaintiff’s Residency When the Cause of Action Accrued Is a Factual 
Issue. 
Finally, § 202 does not apply if the plaintiff is a New York resident, and the controlling 
date for determining a plaintiff’s residence is the date on which the cause of action accrued, not 
the date on which the action was commenced.  See, e.g., DeMartino v. Rivera, 148 A.D.2d 568, 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 20 of 32

570 (2d Dep’t 1989).  “[T]he determination of whether a plaintiff is a New York resident, for 
purposes of CPLR 202, turns on whether [she] has a significant connection with some locality in 
the State as the result of living there for some length of time during the course of a year.”  Antone 
v. Gen. Motors Corp., 473 N.E.2d 742, 746 (N.Y. 1984).  The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff was 
a New York resident at all relevant times, as she had always wanted to live in New York, Epstein’s 
co-conspirators got Plaintiff a visa so that she could travel to New York often, and when she visited 
she stayed at Epstein’s New York home for one to two weeks at a time.  Compl. ¶ 39 (“Juliette 
considered meeting Epstein an amazing opportunity because modeling in New York City had 
always been one of her biggest dreams”); ¶ 41 (“Groff told Juliette that Epstein wanted to bring 
her to New York City to model” and “Epstein called Juliette’s mother from New York to assure 
her that Juliette would be safe with him in New York.”); ¶ 46.  Whether Plaintiff can establish that 
she was a New York resident at the time her cause of action accrued is a factual issue.  In fact, in 
each of the cases Defendants cite in contending that Plaintiff was not a New York resident at the 
time her cause of action accrued (two of which did not address § 202), the residency determination 
was made after fact-finding on the issue.  See Antone, 473 N.E.2d at 745 (hearing held on 
residence); Siegfried v. Siegfried, 92 A.D.2d 916, 916 (2d Dep’t 1983) (“residency hearing” held 
in connection with motion to transfer venue); Hammerman v. Louis Watch Co., 7 A.D.2d 817, 818 
(3d Dep’t 1958) (relying on affidavits in connection with motion to transfer venue). 
D. 
Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden of Proving that Plaintiff 
Cannot Invoke Equitable Estoppel. 
Even if the Court were to hold that C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a) and § 213-c do not apply to 
Plaintiff’s claims, or that § 202 does, it should hold that they are still timely under the doctrine of 
equitable estoppel.  The Complaint alleges in detail the methods of intimidation and control that 
Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators used to deter their victims from seeking justice, and the 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 21 of 32

scare tactics that he used on Plaintiff.   Due to Epstein’s conduct, Plaintiff did not take action until 
after she knew that Epstein was dead, and timely filed her claim approximately three months later.   
Defendants’ contend that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies only to situations in 
which the defendant makes a misrepresentation of fact.  Defs.’ Mem. at 13-14.  But “courts have 
long had the power, both at law and equity, to bar the assertion of the affirmative defense of the 
Statute of Limitations where it is the defendant’s affirmative wrongdoing—a carefully concealed 
crime here—which produced the long delay between the accrual of the cause of action and the 
institution of the legal proceeding.”  Gen. Stencils, Inc. v. Chiappa, 219 N.E.2d 169, 171 (N.Y. 
1966).  A defendant is therefore equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense 
if the defendant “wrongfully induced the plaintiff to refrain from timely commencing an action by 
deception, concealment, threats or other misconduct.”  Funk v. Belneftekhim, No. 14-CV-0376 
(BMC), 2019 WL 3035124, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 11, 2019) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). 
Assuming the truth of the allegations in Plaintiff’s Complaint and drawing all inferences 
in her favor, Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded misconduct that should equitably estop Defendants 
from asserting a statute of limitations defense.  Plaintiff was terrified of disobeying Epstein. 
Compl. ¶¶ 43-44, 47-48.  Defendants’ claim that Plaintiff has not alleged “any conduct” by Epstein 
beyond trying to keep into contact with her is incorrect—Epstein expressly told Plaintiff that he 
had a rape victim sent to prison.  Defs.’ Mem. at 14; Compl.  ¶ 47.  Epstein also flaunted his 
connections to powerful government officials, introduced her to a high government official and 
two celebrities while accompanied by a police escort, kept nude photographs of her, and continued 
to harass her via email up until he died.  Compl. ¶¶ 39-40, 42, 45, 47-51. 
Plaintiff’s allegations are more than sufficient to allow her claims to proceed under an 
equitable estoppel theory at this early stage of the litigation.  And even if they were not, Plaintiff 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 22 of 32

was not required to “affirmatively plead facts in avoidance of” Defendants’ statute of limitations 
defense.  Childers, 36 F. Supp. 3d at 315 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Further, 
“[w]hether equitable estoppel applies in a given case is ultimately a question of fact.”  Kosakow v. 
New Rochelle Radiology Assocs., P.C., 274 F.3d 706, 725 (2d Cir. 2001).  Courts applying New 
York law have therefore reserved the highly factual issue of equitable estoppel for after discovery.  
See, e.g., Gotlin v. Lederman, No. 05-CV-1899 (ILG), 2006 WL 1154817, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 
28, 2006) (“A vast majority of the cases on equitable estoppel permit plaintiffs to defeat a motion 
to dismiss on the pleadings, deferring the question until some discovery can be had.”). 
For example, Defendants unilaterally conclude that Plaintiff’s state of mind of fearing the 
man behind a transcontinental sex-trafficking operation who (1) manipulated and assaulted her and 
countless other victims for years, (2) specifically told her that he could have his accusers sent to 
jail, (3) introduced her to a former government official and two celebrities the very first time they 
met, and (4) used power to escape punishment for crimes committed over decades is 
“unextraordinary.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 14.  Whether Plaintiffs’ state of mind was “extraordinary” is a 
factual issue that should be decided after discovery, not by Defendants.  Defendants have failed to 
meet their burden of proving that Plaintiff can prove no set of facts demonstrating her entitlement 
to equitably estopping Defendants from asserting a statute of limitations defense. 
E. 
Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden of Proving that Plaintiff 
Cannot Invoke Equitable Tolling. 
Plaintiff’s claims are also timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling.  While equitable 
estoppel focuses on a defendant’s affirmative misconduct, equitable tolling focuses on the plaintiff 
and applies as a matter of fairness where the plaintiff has been “prevented in some extraordinary 
way from exercising [her] rights.”  Flight Sci., Inc. v. Cathay Pac. Airways Ltd., 647 F. Supp. 2d 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 23 of 32

285, 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  In this case, Plaintiff’s 
fear of retaliation prevented her from filing her claims prior to Epstein’s death.  
Defendants’ contention that Plaintiff has not alleged any compelling circumstances 
justifying equitable tolling is incorrect.  Defs.’ Mem. at 12-13.  A “reasonable fear of retaliation 
may be sufficient to constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling, 
particularly if the person threatening retaliation is a defendant.”  Davis v. Jackson, No. 15-cv-5359, 
2016 WL 5720811, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016).  In Davis, the court reasoned that fear of 
retaliation could support equitable tolling in the prison context because “sustained control tends to 
result in adverse psychological effects that invariably have behavioral consequences” and that 
“fear of retaliation [is a] natural consequence[] of this unique psychological environment.”  Id. at 
*10 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Epstein’s pattern of controlling, manipulating, and intimidating his victims caused similar 
psychological effects in his countless victims as described in Davis.  And Plaintiff alleges that 
Epstein’s abuse and psychological manipulation had such effects on her.  Compl. ¶¶ 44-48, 52-53.  
The Court should therefore extend equitable tolling to reach fear of retaliation in the context of 
Epstein’s unprecedented abuse of and control over his victims, including Plaintiff. 
In any event, as with equitable estoppel, “when plaintiffs raise an equitable tolling 
argument, a court must deny a motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations unless all 
assertions of the complaint, as read with required liberality, would not permit the plaintiffs to prove 
that this statute was tolled.”  In re S. African Apartheid Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d 228, 287 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to defeat a motion 
to dismiss and to proceed to discovery on the issue of equitable tolling.  See, e.g., Brown v. 
Parkchester S. Condos., 287 F.3d 58, 60–61 (2d Cir. 2002) (evidentiary hearing appropriate to 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 24 of 32

determine whether limitations period was equitably tolled); Guobadia v. Irowa, 103 F. Supp. 3d 
325, 341 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (equitable tolling “is a question appropriately reserved for a jury” due 
to “genuine issues of material fact”).  Defendants are not factfinders in this case and cannot decide 
whether the circumstances of Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation are “extraordinary” enough to 
warrant tolling.  They have failed to meet their burden of proving that Plaintiff can prove no set of 
facts demonstrating entitlement to equitable tolling. 
II. 
The Court Should Deny the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Punitive 
Damages. 
Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law 
is incorrect.  Not only are such damages available, they are warranted in this case.  Beyond the 
procedural impropriety of Defendants’ purported motion to dismiss punitive damages—that on its 
own warrants its denial—under New York choice-of-law principles the law of the USVI applies 
to the issue of punitive damages.  Under USVI law, a court may allow for punitive damages against 
the estate of a deceased tortfeasor, especially when that tortfeasor went to great lengths during his 
life to avoid punishment for causing immeasurable harm to countless victims.  
A. 
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Punitive Damages is Procedurally 
Improper. 
As an initial matter, the Court should not decide whether punitive damages are available at 
this early stage.  A motion to dismiss is not the proper vehicle for determining the availability of 
punitive damages.  Rule 12(b)(6) allows a defendant to file a motion to dismiss for “failure to state 
a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Accordingly, “[a] motion to 
dismiss is addressed to a ‘claim’—not to a form of damages.”  Jones v. City of New York, No. 
18-CV-1937 (VSB), 2020 WL 1644009, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2020) (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  Defendants’ request for the Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s demand for punitive damages 
does not relate to whether Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for battery or intentional infliction of 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 25 of 32

emotional distress. Addressing the issue of punitive damages at this stage would therefore be 
premature.  See, e.g., Denton v. McKee, 332 F. Supp. 2d 659, 667 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (finding “any 
discussion of damages, compensatory, punitive or otherwise, to be premature” at the motion to 
dismiss stage).  And Defendants’ argument that punitive damages are prohibited by law does not 
make their “motion to dismiss” a form of damages proper.  Jones, 2020 WL 1644009, at *17 
(holding that although punitive damages are not available against government entities, motion to 
dismiss punitive damages was premature). 
B. 
Plaintiff May Recover Punitive Damages in this Case.  
Even if a motion to dismiss punitive damages was an adequate way to address this issue, 
Defendants’ motion still fails.  Plaintiff may recover punitive damages because the USVI has the 
strongest interest in whether punitive damages are available in this case.7  And, under USVI law, 
Plaintiff can recover punitive damages.    
1. 
USVI Law on Punitive Damages Governs This Case. 
Federal courts look to the choice-of-law rules of the forum state in deciding choice-of-law 
disputes.  See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941).  “In the context of 
tort law, New York utilizes interest analysis to determine which of two competing jurisdictions 
has the greater interest in having its law applied in the litigation.  The greater interest is determined 
by an evaluation of the facts or contacts which relate to the purpose of the particular law in 
conflict.”  Padula v. Lilarn Prop. Corp., 644 N.E.2d 1001, 1002 (N.Y. 1994) (internal quotation 
marks and alterations omitted).  New York courts seek “[j]ustice, fairness and the best practical 
result.”  Babcock v. Jackson, 191 N.E.2d 279, 283 (N.Y. 1963). 
As explained below, under the doctrine of depecage New York law still governs as to the 
underlying claims and as to compensatory damages. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 26 of 32

“Punitive damages are conduct regulating,” and “[u]nder the doctrine of depecage, then, 
the choice-of law analysis for punitive damages is distinct from the analysis for compensatory 
damages.”  Nat’l Jewish Democratic Council v. Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d 416, 425-26 (S.D.N.Y. 
2019).  “[U]nder New York law—for punitive damages in particular—a court must consider the 
object or purpose of the wrongdoing to be punished and give controlling weight to the law of the 
jurisdiction with the strongest interest in the resolution of the particular issue presented.”  Id. at 
426 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  “[T]he choice-of-law inquiry for punitive 
damages provisions is necessarily ‘defendant-focused.’”  Id. 
In this case the USVI has a stronger interest in the resolution of whether punitive damages 
can be awarded in this case than New York, Florida, New Mexico, or France.8  In addition to flying 
Plaintiff to the USVI and sexually assaulting her there, Compl. ¶¶ 42–44, Epstein was domiciled 
in the USVI.  Id. ¶ 19; see also Schultz v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc., 65 N.Y.2d 189, 201 (1985) 
(holding that, although New York was the place of the wrong, New Jersey law applied because it 
“would further [New Jersey’s] interest in enforcing the decision of its domiciliaries to accept the 
burdens as well as the benefits of” New Jersey law).  Epstein also had a private island in the USVI, 
where he abused countless young females, including Plaintiff.  Compl. ¶¶ 24, 44.  Defendants then 
chose to probate his Estate in and under the laws of the USVI.  Id. ¶ 32.  Having availed themselves 
of all the benefits and protections that USVI probate and estate law have to offer, Defendants 
To the extent Defendants rely on Judge Engelmayer’s recent decisions in Mary Doe v. 
Indyke et al., 19-cv-10758 (PAE) (DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2020) and Jane Doe 15 v. Indyke, et 
al., 19-cv-10653 (PAE) (DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2020), those cases are easily 
distinguishable.  Neither of the victims in those cases was injured in the USVI.   Here, not only 
was Epstein domiciled in the USVI and his Estate probated in the USVI, but he flew Plaintiff to 
the USVI and injured her there on numerous occasions.  Compl. ¶ 55.   
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 27 of 32

cannot also seek to escape its drawbacks.  New York, Florida, New Mexico, and France have no 
conceivable interest in denying the USVI from advancing that interest.  As such, New York’s 
choice-of-law rules dictate the application of USVI law to the issue of punitive damages.9 
2. 
USVI Law Would Allow for Punitive Damages against Defendants. 
USVI law would allow for an award of punitive damages in this case.  When determining 
how best to apply common law, courts in the USVI apply what is known as the Banks analysis.  
See Gov’t of the V.I. v. Connor, 60 V.I. 597, 600, 602 (2016); Banks v. Int’l Rental & Leasing 
Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 979 (2011).  Under the Banks analysis, “instead of mechanistically following 
the Restatements, courts should consider three non-dispositive factors to determine Virgin Islands 
common law: (1) whether any Virgin Islands courts have previously adopted a particular rule; (2) 
the position taken by a majority of courts from other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, which 
approach represents the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands.”  Connor, 60 V.I. at 600 (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  Applying the Banks analysis, Plaintiff can pursue punitive damages 
against Defendants.  
a. 
Banks Factor One: Whether Any USVI Courts Have Adopted a 
Rule 
USVI courts have not adopted a rule as to whether a plaintiff can pursue punitive damages 
against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor.  And Defendants’ position that “USVI courts have 
favorably recited the Restatement’s rule precluding punitive damages against a decedent 
tortfeasor’s estate” is simply wrong.  Defs.’ Mem. at 18.  First, the Restatement’s position is 
As an indication of the Virgin Islands’ interest in matters concerning Epstein’s Estate, the 
Attorney General of the United States Virgin Islands filed suit against the Estate on January 15, 
2020, seeking, among other things, punitive damages.  Complaint, GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein, No. ST-20-CV-014 (V.I. Sup. Ct. Jan. 15, 2020), Dkt. No. 1.   
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 28 of 32

included only in commentary, and not the text of the Restatement itself.  Restat. (Second) of Torts 
§ 908 cmt. a.   Second, in both of the cases that Defendants cite, the issue before the court was 
whether punitive damages are available in wrongful death actions, and therefore whether an estate 
can recover punitive damages, not whether punitive damages are available against an estate.  See, 
e.g., Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 (D.V.I. 2009); Booth v. Bowen, No. CIV. 
2006-217, 2008 WL 220067, at *5 (D.V.I. Jan. 10, 2008).  Defendants have not cited a single 
USVI case adopting the Restatement’s commentary’s position on that specific issue, or addressing 
that issue at all.  Given the lack of any rule in the Virgins Islands, this Banks factor is neutral.  
b. 
Banks Factor Two: The Position Taken by a Majority of Courts 
from Other Jurisdictions  
As to the second Banks factor, Defendants overstate the number of jurisdictions that do not 
permit the award of punitive damages against an estate.  Defs.’ Mem. at 19.  Numerous courts have 
held that plaintiffs may recover punitive damages against the estate of a deceased tortfeasor.  See, 
e.g., Haralson v. Fisher Surveying, Inc., 31 P.3d 114, 117 (Ariz. 2001) (concluding that “there are 
situations in which it would be appropriate, and perhaps even necessary, to express society’s 
disapproval of outrageous conduct by rendering such an award against the estate of a deceased 
tortfeasor” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Tillett v. Lippert, 909 P.2d 1158, 1162 (Mont. 
1996); Perry v. Melton, 299 S.E.2d 8, 12 (W. Va. 1982).  Those courts have reasoned that punitive 
damages do not only serve to punish wrongdoers, but also to “motivate others not to engage in 
similar action in the future.”  Kaopuiki v. Kealoha, 87 P.3d 910, 928 (Haw. Ct. App. 2003).10  In 
See also, e.g., Ellis v. Zuck, 546 F.2d 643, 644–45 (5th Cir. 1977) (punitive damages 
allowed against estate because they provide “deterrents to others similarly situated from taking 
steps of the character condemned”); Estate of Farrell ex rel. Bennett v. Gordon, 770 A.2d 517, 
521-22 (Del. 2001); Hofer v. Lavender, 679 S.W.2d 470, 474 (Tex. 1984).   
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 29 of 32

this case, general deterrence is of the utmost importance—Epstein spent decades abusing countless 
young women and girls, intimidating them into silence, and gaming the justice system with his 
wealth and power to avoid punishment.  No person should be able to commit such acts while at 
the same time considering himself to be above the law. 
Further, in a case that Defendants cite, see Defs.’ Mem. at 19, the court recognized that 
punitive damages might be available where, as here, the deceased tortfeasor takes his own life “as 
an escape from punitive damages.”  Crabtree ex. Rel. Kemp v. Estate of Crabtree, 837 N.E.2d 135, 
139 (Ind. 2005) (“If we ever encounter a case where a tortfeasor seems to have considered his own 
death as an escape from punitive damages incident to some intentional tort, we can address that 
issue at that time.”).  Again, Epstein spent his life avoiding proportionate punishment for his 
countless crimes, and once he was finally imprisoned pending trial for his sex-trafficking 
operation, he signed his will and then almost immediately caused his own demise.  See Compl. 
¶¶ 8, 14, 30, 31.  Given the unique facts surrounding Epstein’s crimes and death and the importance 
of general deterrence, the second Banks factor weighs heavily in favor of allowing for punitive 
damages under these facts. 
c. 
Banks Factor Three: The Soundest Rule for the USVI  
Although none of the three Banks factors is dispositive, the third factor—“which approach 
represents the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands”—is the most important.  See Connor, 60 V.I. 
at 600.  Defendants cite seven cases to support the proposition that USVI courts have found that 
the Restatement is the soundest rule for the USVI, Defs.’ Mem. at 19–20, but not one of those 
cases addresses the question of whether punitive damages are available against an estate, nor do 
they consider the Restatement’s position on that point. 
Instead, the soundest rule for the USVI is to allow for punitive damages against an estate 
in circumstances as extraordinary as those in this case.  The USVI has expressly recognized the 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 33   Filed 05/12/20   Page 30 of 32

dual purpose of punitive damages to both punish wrongdoing and promote general deterrence.  
See, e.g., Guardian Ins. Co. v. Gumbs, No. ST-15-CV-195, 2016 WL 9525609, at *10 (V.I. Super. 
Aug. 22, 2016) (“[A] primary purpose behind punitive damages [is] . . . to further deter [the 
tortfeasor] and others like him from similar conduct in the future.”).  Allowing punitive damages 
in this case would be consistent with this view—punitive damages would deter other predators 
from manipulating the justice system and silencing victims of sexual abuse to avoid punishment.  
The absence of any USVI case adopting the Restatement’s commentary about punitive damages 
against estates, coupled with the extraordinary nature of Epstein’s transcontinental sex-trafficking 
enterprise, suggest that allowing for punitive damages in this case would be the soundest rule for 
the USVI.11  The Court should therefore deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss punitive damages.    
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s 
Complaint.  Because Defendants seek to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint in full, Plaintiff requests 
oral argument on Defendants’ motion. 
To the extent necessary, United States courts may certify questions to the Supreme Court 
of the Virgin Islands if there is “a question of law which may be determinative” and if “it appears 
there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Supreme Court.”  Banks, 55 V.I. at 972 
(internal citations omitted).  Because the issue would be a matter of first impression in the Virgin 
Islands, and given the split in common law authorities concerning the availability of punitive 
damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate, the Court should certify the question to the 
Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands if it deems it necessary to resolve the issue at this stage of the 
case.  See CIT Bank N.A. v. Schiffman, 948 F.3d 529, 537 (2d Cir. 2020), certified question 
accepted, No. 36, 2020 WL 729773 (N.Y. Feb. 13, 2020) (certifying questions where no precedent 
from state’s highest court is available, and the state court was better situated to make “value 
judgments and important public policy choices”).

Re:
Juliette Bryant, 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman:
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors 
of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced 
action (the “Action”).  We write to address the substantive issues raised in Plaintiff’s letters 
to the Court dated May 7 and May 11, prematurely requesting a pre-motion conference 
on Plaintiff’s anticipated motion to compel.  For the reasons set forth below and in our 
May 8 letter, we respectfully request that the Court deny Plaintiff’s request.  
The picture Plaintiff paints is a false one.  On their face, Plaintiff’s interrogatories 
are clearly overbroad and unduly burdensome. However, as a compromise and as the 
Co-Executors said they would do before Plaintiff filed her letter, the Co-Executors have 
supplemented their responses to those interrogatories.  Notwithstanding that Plaintiff has 
provided no transparency into her own efforts to produce responsive materials (something 
the Co-Executors hope to resolve before filing letters with the Court), the Co-Executors 
have collected and are, in connection with this and the numerous other cases against 
them before Your Honor, reviewing a database of over 730,000 documents.  We 
address Plaintiff’s specific points below.
First, Plaintiff’s proposed 18-year time frame for discovery is not proportional to 
the needs of this case and would impose an undue burden on the Co-Executors.  
Although Plaintiff asserts that her alleged abuse by Mr. Epstein occurred from 2002 to 
2004, she demands discovery from 2001 through July 2019.  Plaintiff’s proposed time 
frame is contrary to the goals of the 2015 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, which emphasize the pre-existing but often-unheeded requirement that all civil 
discovery be proportional to the needs of the case.  See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. 
v. Fayda, No. 14CIV9792WHPJCF, 2015 WL 7871037, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2015),

aff'd, No. 14CV9792, 2016 WL 4530890 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2016) (“[T]he amended rule 
is intended to encourage judges to be more aggressive in identifying and discouraging 
discovery overuse; by emphasizing the need to analyze proportionality before ordering 
production of relevant information.”). Requiring the Co-Executors to conduct a search for 
and produce documents over an 18-year time period is not proportional to the needs of 
this case – which relates to Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct over a two-year period that 
concluded in 2004. The Co-Executors advised Plaintiff’s counsel that the appropriate 
time period for discovery is the time period during which Plaintiff alleges she was abused 
and during which time her claims would have accrued.  Moreover, the Co-Executors will 
search for and produce all non-privileged communications between Mr. Epstein and 
Plaintiff or otherwise concerning Plaintiff, regardless of the year.
Plaintiff’s position, that all information relating to what Plaintiff describes as a “sex 
trafficking” scheme -- which is based on unproven allegations in the S.D.N.Y.’s 2019 
indictment of Mr. Epstein -- is relevant to Plaintiff’s alleged abuse, is untenable.  Plaintiff 
does not assert sex trafficking claims.  Rather, her claims are limited to battery and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
Moreover, conduct that occurred after Plaintiff’s alleged abuse cannot possibly be 
used to support her claims.  While Plaintiff posits that discovery relating to Mr. Epstein’s 
conduct with other individuals is “relevant” to her claims, that does not mean that such 
discovery is proper.  See Mamakos v. United Airlines, Inc., No. CV147294JFBAKT, 2018 
WL 4861392, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018) (“[A]lthough Rule 26 still permits a wide 
range of discovery based upon relevance and proportionality, the provision authorizing 
the court ... to order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the 
action has been eliminated.”) (internal citations omitted).  Accordingly, the Court should 
reject Plaintiff’s attempt to grossly expand the scope of discovery to obtain documents 
that extend “far beyond the scope of Plaintiff’s claims and would significantly burden” the 
Co-Executors.  See Robertson v. People Magazine, No. 14 CIV. 6759 (PAC), 2015 WL 
9077111, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2015) (denying discovery requests that are 
“burdensome and disproportionate” where Plaintiff sought “nearly unlimited” discovery 
that was not addressed to alleged discriminatory conduct and/or comments).
Contrary to her counsel’s assertion, Plaintiff does not need discovery about Mr. 
Epstein’s interactions with other individuals to meet her burden to prove her claims for 
battery or intentional infliction of emotional distress allegedly committed against her.  The 
mere fact that certain testimony regarding a defendant’s prior conduct could theoretically 
be admissible at trial does not mean that Plaintiff is entitled to wide-ranging discovery.  
Plaintiff cites no authority for that proposition.  
Nor does Plaintiff need discovery about Mr. Epstein’s interactions with other 
individuals to invoke her equitable estoppel defense to the Co-Executor’s assertion that 
her claims are barred by the statute of limitations.  In order to prevail on her equitable 
estoppel defense, Plaintiff is required to show that Mr. Epstein’s conduct towards Plaintiff

prevented her from bringing her suit earlier; his conduct towards others has no bearing 
on such a defense.  “To invoke equitable estoppel, a plaintiff must show that: ‘(i) the 
defendant made a definite misrepresentation of fact and had reason to believe that the 
plaintiff would rely on it; and (ii) the plaintiff reasonably relied on that misrepresentation 
to h[er] detriment.’” See Yesh Diamonds, Inc. v. Yashaya, No. 09-CV-2016 (DLI) (RER), 
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101744, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2010) (quoting Kavowras v. New 
York Times Co., 328 F.3d 50, 56-57 (2d Cir. 2003).
Second, Plaintiff suggests that the Co-Executors agreed to produce only 
documents that expressly reference Plaintiff.  That is an inaccurate representation of the 
parties’ conversations during the meet-and-confer sessions.  As we explained during the 
parties’ April 27 and May 5 meet-and-confers, the Co-Executors have and will continue 
to search for and produce documents that relate to Plaintiff and her claims of battery and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress, regardless of whether they specifically 
reference Plaintiff.  For example, if the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff traveled on Mr. 
Epstein’s plane, then flight logs for the relevant time period will be produced. Similarly, 
where phone records exist from the relevant time period and Plaintiff provides Co-
Executors with phone numbers that she used during the Relevant Time Period, Co-
Executors will search for calls to/from such phone numbers.  To the extent Plaintiff bases 
her argument on the Co-Executors’ search-term proposal for ESI, her counsel never 
engaged with us.  Rather than continue discussions that include bilateral search-term 
proposals – as is customary in this District and something other counsel in the other 
lawsuits against the Estate have done – Plaintiff burdened the Court in an apparent effort 
to obtain a wide-ranging Court order that would unduly burden the Co-Executors.  If 
Plaintiff had simply made a single proposal or engaged in any effort to compromise on 
her positions, this could have all been avoided. 
Third, Plaintiff’s request that the Co-Executors supplement their interrogatory 
responses is moot.  Again, this is exactly the situation the Court warned against.  The Co-
Executors supplemented their interrogatory responses earlier today, as they agreed to do 
before Plaintiff went ahead and burdened the Court with her initial lengthy letter on this 
issue.  The Co-Executors provided their initial and supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s 
interrogatories in the capacity in which they were sued.  Plaintiff provides no support for 
her position that the Co-Executors’ responses should be made in their personal or other 
professional capacity.  Plaintiff also misrepresents the parties’ communications regarding 
information provided by Co-Executors in connection with their interrogatory responses.  
As we advised Plaintiff on several occasions, the Co-Executors reviewed and approved 
the interrogatory responses before they were served.  
Plaintiff incorrectly states that counsel for Co-Executors represented that the Co-
Executors “do not know where to look for responsive documents.”  To the contrary, we 
stated that, despite the fact that obtaining documents and information from a large, 
complicated estate is more involved and thus takes longer than the collection of 
documents from an individual party such as Plaintiff, the Co-Executors retrieved hundreds

of thousands of documents and were reviewing the voluminous database in preparation 
for production, but that the task had been complicated by the need to track down such 
information and the attendant delays caused by the current pandemic.  The Co-Executors 
have compiled a database with over 730,000 documents that they have been searching 
for documents responsive to this and discovery requests in numerous other lawsuits.  
Subject to the execution of a mutually acceptable ESI protocol and confidentiality order 
(something made abundantly clear in the Co-Executors’ written responses to Plaintiff’s 
requests for production), they expect to begin production within the next week.  The only 
reason a confidentiality order was not already entered in this action (but was in several 
other lawsuits against the Co-Executors) is that, unlike the plaintiffs’ counsel in the other 
actions, Plaintiff’s counsel here insisted until shortly before filing their letter that the Co-
Executors accept unsupportable changes, such as the removal of several categories of 
confidentiality that the Co-Executors require but which Plaintiff does not believe she 
needs—a vexatious tactic.
Finally, contrary to her representations to the Court, Plaintiff has not complied with 
her discovery obligations.
Rather, Plaintiff produced a small set of self-selected, and 
useless materials so she could rush to Court under the guise of having made a meaningful 
production in the face of what she falsely claims was stonewalling from her adversaries.  
Approximately half of the documents Plaintiff produced are irrelevant documents from 
another case that was handled by Plaintiff’s counsel that has nothing to do with Plaintiff’s
claims in this action.1  There appears to have been no reason for the production of these 
documents other than to inflate the size of Plaintiff’s production.  Those same documents 
were also produced by the other Plaintiffs that Plaintiff’s counsel represents in actions 
against Mr. Epstein’s estate.  They do not appear to be documents that were in Plaintiff’s 
personal possession.  
Accordingly, we request that the Court deny Plaintiff’s request for a pre-motion 
conference and instead direct Plaintiff to engage in a good-faith meet-and-confer session 
to resolve the parties’ discovery disputes.

Re: 
Juliette Bryant v. Darren K. Indyke & Richard D. Kahn, 19-10479-ALC-DCF 
Dear Judge Freeman:  
We submit on behalf of Plaintiff Juliette Bryant this reply in further support of her letter 
motion for a conference to address Defendants’ failure to comply with their discovery obligations 
(ECF No. 27), and in response to Defendants’ second letter in opposition, filed on May 13, 2020 
(ECF No. 34).  As an initial matter, the Court should disregard Defendants’ latest response as 
untimely.  Pursuant to Individual Rule 1.D., “[u]nless the Court orders otherwise, opposition to 
any letter motion shall be filed within three (3) days of the moving letter.”  Notwithstanding this 
rule, Defendants filed an incomplete and non-substantive opposition on May 8, and requested 
“permission to submit a response to the substantive issues raised in the Letters by May 13, 2020.”  
ECF No. 28.  Defendants’ letter did not comply with Individual Rule 1.B., which governs “requests 
for adjournments or extensions of time.”  In any event, the Court did not issue an order extending 
Defendants’ time to respond, much less grant Defendants leave to file two oppositions as opposed 
to one.  But even if the Court were to consider Defendants’ untimely filing, each of their arguments 
is meritless, and confirms the need for immediate Court intervention to resolve the parties’ disputes.   
First, Defendants refuse to engage in discovery for more than a narrow, two-year period 
(2002-2004).  This is improper, as information concerning Epstein’s abuse of other girls and young 
women throughout the span of his sex-trafficking conspiracy is plainly relevant, and therefore 
discoverable under Rule 26.  Defendants deride Plaintiff’s allegations as a “sex trafficking 
scheme–which,” according to Defendants, “is based on unproven allegations in the S.D.N.Y.’s 
2019 indictment of Mr. Epstein.”  ECF No. 34 at 2 (emphases added).  But given all that has been 
discovered about the scope of Epstein’s operations and the numerous ways in which Plaintiff’s 
abuse mirrored Epstein’s abuse of others, Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff “does not need 
discovery about Mr. Epstein’s interactions with other individuals” is baseless.  As set forth in 
Plaintiff’s opening letter, “[d]ocuments relating to the sexual trafficking and/or sexual assault of 
others at any point during that period would make the fact that Epstein trafficked and sexually 
assaulted Plaintiff, the key fact that Plaintiff bears the burden of proving in this case, more probable 
than it would be without such evidence.”  ECF No. 27 at 2.  Moreover, Rule 415 (which Defendants 
fail to address) unambiguously provides that “[i]n a civil case involving a claim for relief based on 
a party’s alleged sexual assault or child molestation, the court may admit evidence that the party

committed any other sexual assault or child molestation.”  Fed. R. Evid. 415.  Defendants are free 
to attempt to prove Epstein innocent, and can try to prove that the allegations set forth in Plaintiff’s 
complaint and the S.D.N.Y.’s indictment are false.  They cannot, however, prevent Plaintiff from 
accessing the information that would prove otherwise. 
Defendants argue that allowing discovery into a period of time greater than two years is 
somehow “not proportional to the needs of this case and would impose an undue burden on the 
Co-Executors.”  ECF No. 34 at 1.  But “unsubstantiated claims of undue burden, overbreadth and 
lack of relevancy” in situations where a party has “produced no documents and answered no 
interrogatories . . . are a paradigm of discovery abuse.”  Jacoby v. Hartford Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 
254 F.R.D. 477, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).  Defendants do not even attempt to quantify what the burden 
of reviewing documents through the present would be, or how that number would compare to that 
for the two-year time period they propose.  The only information Defendants offer in their letter is 
a representation that they are “reviewing a database of over 730,000 documents.”  ECF No. 34 at 
(emphasis in original).  That representation is ambiguous, however, as it sheds no light on (i) 
how many of those documents Defendants will review (as opposed to just being a number of 
documents housed on a “database”); (ii) how those documents were collected; or (iii) whether any 
of those documents are currently being reviewed in response to the discovery requests Plaintiff 
served in this case (as opposed to those served in cases brought by other victims).  And the fact 
that Epstein’s Estate is “large and complicated” does not change Defendants’ discovery obligations 
or the deadlines that this Court imposed.  Absent any particularized showing that compliance with 
Plaintiff’s discovery requests would pose an undue burden, Defendants’ proposal to limit the 
discovery period to two years is unfounded. Again, to date Defendants have not produced a single 
document—not one.                      
Second, Defendants improperly refuse to answer interrogatories or produce documents that 
do not specifically reference Plaintiff or the specific instances in which she was abused.  
Defendants claim that they “have and will continue to search for and produce documents that relate 
to Plaintiff and her claims of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, regardless of 
whether they specifically reference Plaintiff.”  ECF No. 34 at 3.  As set forth above, however, 
Plaintiff is entitled to information concerning Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy as a whole, 
including his abuse of others, his communications with his co-conspirators, and the various ways 
in which he operated his scheme throughout the years.  Because the parties’ disagreement hinges 
on whether or not defined topics are discoverable under Rule 26, Defendants’ suggestion that the 
dispute can be resolved by exchanging “bilateral search-term proposals” is disingenuous at best.1  
Id. at 3.  Court intervention is required now so that Defendants can begin reviewing and producing 
documents concerning the sex-trafficking conspiracy they are trying to keep secret.                     
Third, the Court should compel Defendants to answer Plaintiff’s interrogatories in full.  In 
a desperate attempt to convince the Court that this issue is somehow “moot” or that Plaintiff’s pre-
motion letter was “premature,” Defendants claim that Plaintiff’s request was merely “that Co-
Plaintiff already offered to provide a list of search terms to Defendants, and their counsel 
responded by stating that Defendants would only consider any other names Plaintiff goes by as a 
search term.  If that was not Defendants’ position, they never corrected it or otherwise indicated 
that they would change it.

Executors supplement their interrogatory responses.”  ECF No. 34 at 3.  To be clear, Plaintiff’s 
anticipated motion will be to compel Defendants to respond meaningfully to all of Plaintiff’s 
interrogatories, which has still not happened despite Defendants’ belated “supplementation.”  
Defendants’ “supplemental responses,” attached hereto as Exhibit A, remain deficient, and only 
insert cosmetic changes based on information that should have been obvious to Defendants at the 
time they served their “initial” responses, 2 or parrot back information taken from Plaintiff’s 
complaint and Plaintiff’s own production of documents.  In any event, each of Defendants’ 
“supplemental” responses “is limited to the Relevant Time Period,” which means that Defendants 
still refuse to answer Plaintiff’s interrogatories for more than a two-year period.  Court 
intervention is required to compel Defendants to answer these interrogatories in full.     
Finally, although irrelevant to the pending motion concerning Defendants’ discovery 
efforts, Plaintiff has fully complied with her discovery obligations to date, and will continue to do 
so.  Defendants complain that Plaintiff included within her productions what they claim are 
“irrelevant documents from another case,”  ECF No. 34 at 4, but Plaintiff produced these 
documents because Defendants specifically asked for the documents identified in Plaintiff’s initial 
disclosures, and Plaintiff correctly produced those documents.  Plaintiff has and will continue to 
engage with opposing counsel in good faith to answer any questions they may have.3                                
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her request 
for a conference.   
Together with their “supplemental responses,” Defendants’ served verifications for their “initial 
responses” on May 13, 2020.  Ex. B.  Whereas the initial responses were served on April 16, the 
signatures for the verifications for those responses are dated May 12, 2020, which is the same date 
as the verifications for the supplemental responses.     
In a footnote, Defendants mention a ruling in Giuffre v. Dershowitz, which disqualified Boies 
Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) as counsel for another Epstein victim, Virginia Giuffre, in a 
defamation case brought by that victim against Alan Dershowitz.  Giuffre v. Dershowitz, 410 F. 
Supp. 3d 564, 578-79 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  Judge Preska’s disqualification of the law firm was not a 
sanction.  Instead, it was based on the advocate-witness rule because Dershowitz claimed that a 
BSF attorney (while representing the victim) said something to him during a settlement negotiation 
that would implicate the truth or falsity of one of Dershowitz’s allegedly defamatory statements.  
Id. at 579. Indeed, BSF continues to represent Virginia Giuffre before Judge Preska in the Giuffre 
v. Maxwell matter.  Defendants disingenuously state that “[t]he Court should be aware” of that 
ruling, despite the fact that it has nothing to do with whether or not Plaintiff herself was a victim 
of Epstein’s sex-trafficking conspiracy.  If Defendants and their counsel are actually seeking to 
prove Epstein innocent or otherwise insulated from accounting for his misconduct, they should 
drop their baseless objections to discovery, stop ad hominem attacks on counsel, cease their delay 
tactics, and welcome a trial on the merits.

JULIETTE BRYANT, 
Plaintiff,  
                       v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN 
in their capacities as the executors of the ESTATE  
OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN, 
Defendants.  
    Case No. 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF 
DEFENDANTS’ OBJECTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF 
JULIETTE BRYANT’S FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES TO DEFENDANTS 
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as co-executors of the estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), by their attorneys, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
and 33, provide the following supplemental responses to Plaintiff Juliette Bryant’s (“Plaintiff”) 
First Set of Interrogatories to Defendants (the “Interrogatories”).  
RESERVATION OF RIGHTS 
These supplemental responses are made solely for the purpose of and in relation to 
discovery in the above-captioned action. The Co-Executors submit these supplemental responses 
subject to, and without intending to waive, and expressly preserving: (i) any objections as to 
relevancy, materiality, competency, privilege and admissibility of any documents and information 
produced in discovery, including without limitation herein; and (ii) the right to object to any other 
discovery requests.  The Co-Executors have been placed in charge of a large and complex estate 
and are working to determine the existence of responsive information concerning the affairs of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Decedent”) and those efforts are continuing. Much of the requested 
information is outside of their knowledge, possession or control.  To the extent non privileged 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 35-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 2 of 15

42245537  
responsive information would be available to them at all, access to such information has been 
severely hampered by the current pandemic.  Accordingly, Co-Executors reserve their right to 
amend or further supplement these responses if and when appropriate.  Further, these supplemental 
responses are neither an admission nor acceptance of any alleged facts, including without 
limitation those stated in the Interrogatories. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS 
The Co-Executors incorporate their initial objections to the definitions and instructions as 
if stated fully herein. 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO 
INTERROGATORIES 
INTERROGATORY NO. 1 
List the names and addresses of all persons who are believed or known by You, Your 
agents, or Your attorneys to have any knowledge concerning any of the issues in this lawsuit, and 
specify the subject matter about which the witness has knowledge. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds and to the extent that it 
calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work 
product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.  The Co-
Executors also object to Interrogatory No. 1 on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither 
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also overly broad and 
unduly burdensome.   
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors identify the 
following individuals who have knowledge concerning the battery and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress allegedly committed by Decedent against Plaintiff:  Plaintiff and Sven

Stromnes. 
In addition, in her Complaint, Plaintiff identifies the following individuals with whom she 
alleges she interacted with or communicated with:  Naja Hill, “the former high U.S. Government 
official, the famous actor, and the well-known comedian” described in paragraph 39 of Plaintiff’s 
Complaint, Lesley Groff, Plaintiff’s mother, Sarah Kellen, the “other young girl” described in 
paragraph 44 of Plaintiff’s Complaint, and Ghislaine Maxwell.   Co-Executors do not know 
whether these individuals ever spoke with or interacted with Plaintiff, or have knowledge 
concerning Plaintiff’s claims. 
In addition, the Co-Executors identify the following individuals, believed to have worked 
at Decedent’s homes in New York, Paris, New Mexico, Palm Beach, Florida and United States 
Virgin Islands, which where Plaintiff alleges she encountered Decedent, during the period from 
2002 to 2004, which based upon the allegations of the Complaint, appears to cover the entire time 
period during which Plaintiff’s claims accrued (the “Relevant Time Period”):  Luciano Fontanilla, 
Rosalyn Fontanilla, Richard Barnett, Valdson Cotrin, Brice Gordon, Karen Gordon, Deidre 
Stratton, Floyd Stratton, Miles Alexander, Catherine Alexander, Ghislaine Maxwell, Alvin White, 
Juan Alessi, Maria Alessi, Adam Perry Lang, Michael Friedman, Rosalie Friedman, Louella 
Rabuyo and Alfredo Rodriguez.  Co-Executors do not know whether these individuals ever spoke 
with or interacted with Plaintiff, or have knowledge concerning Plaintiff’s allegations. 
To the extent additional individuals are identified in response to other interrogatories, those 
individuals may, but not necessarily, have such knowledge.  The Co-Executors’ search for relevant 
information remains ongoing; they will supplement this response if and when any additional 
responsive information is ascertained.

42245537  
INTERROGATORY NO. 2 
Identify all email accounts used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents on his behalf. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:  
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 2 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state that it is 
their understanding that the email addresses listed below were created for or on behalf of Decedent, 
but only jeevacation@gmail.com and jeeproject@yahoo.com were actively used by Decedent 
himself.  Moreover, Co-Executors currently do not believe that jeevacation@gmail.com existed or 
was in use during the Relevant Time Period and do not know whether jeeproject@yahoo.com was 
in use during the Relevant Time Period: 
• columbiadental1@yahoo.com 
• jeevacation@me.com 
• jeevacation1@me.com 
• jeeproject@yahoo.com 
• jeevacation@gmail.com

• jeffreyepsteinorg@gmail.com 
• jeffreyepsteinorg@yahoo.com 
• jeffreyepstein@live.com 
• jeeitunes@gmail.com 
• littlestjeff@yahoo.com 
The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.

42245537  
INTERROGATORY NO. 3 
Identify all telephone numbers used by Epstein or any of his employees or agents acting 
on his behalf, including beepers, Blackberry or PDA devices, cellular phones and land lines in any 
of his residences, by stating the users name, complete telephone number(s), type of device and 
name of the service provider. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 3 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state that it is 
their understanding that the following phone numbers were used by Decedent or registered to 
properties where Decedent stayed at different times, but are unaware of the specific time period 
that the numbers were in use:

used by Epstein, including but not limited Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach, Florida, New York 
City, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, London and Paris, and provide the name and contact 
information of the individual who hired, trained and supervised each employee. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 4 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on 
the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ 
response is limited to those individuals who are believed to have worked during the Relevant Time 
Period at Decedent’s homes in New York, the United States Virgin Islands, Paris, Palm Beach, 
Florida and New Mexico, where Plaintiff alleges she encountered Decedent.  Co-Executors do not 
know whether these individuals ever spoke with or interacted with Plaintiff during the Relevant 
Time Period.   
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors identify the 
following individuals: 
• Luciano Fontanilla 
• Rosalyn Fontanilla 
• Richard Barnett 
• Valdson Cotrin 
• Brice Gordon  
• Karen Gordon 
• Deidre Stratton

• Alfredo Rodriguez  
The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 5 
Identify all employees, including each employee’s position and dates and locations of 
employment, who performed work as an assistant, scheduler, secretary, masseuse or traveling 
masseuse for Epstein and provide the name and contact information of the individual who hired, 
trained and supervised each employee. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 5 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the terms “scheduler” and “traveling masseuse” are vague and ambiguous.  The Co-
Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is 
unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time 
Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors identify Lesley 
Groff and Sarah Kellen, who were Decedent’s assistants during the Relevant Time Period.  Co-
Executors do not know whether Ms. Groff or Ms. Kellen ever spoke with or interacted with 
Plaintiff.  Co-Executors also refer Plaintiff to the documents produced by Plaintiff at Bates Nos. 
JBRYANT 3736-3832, which purports to list contact information for masseuses.  Co-Executors 
do not know whether any individuals identified therein are masseuses or if those individuals 
provided massages to Decedent during the Relevant Time Period.  The Co-Executors’ search for

relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement this response if and when any 
additional responsive information is ascertained. 
INTERROGATORY NO. 6 
Identify all companies and/or persons who provided transportation services to Epstein, 
whether as an employee or independent contractor, including without limitation drivers, 
chauffeurs, boat captains, pilots, and aircraft crew, and provide the contact information for each 
listed person or company. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 6 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims; it is also overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The 
Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the grounds that the phrase “transportation 
services” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds and to the extent that is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is 
limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state the 
following individuals provided transportation services to Decedent during the Relevant Time 
Period: 
• David Rodgers 
• Larry Visoski 
• Larry Morrison 
• Alvin White 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors identify Shoppers 
Travel, Inc., which is a travel agency that provided travel-related services to Decedent during the 
Relevant Time Period.  The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they 
will supplement this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.

42245537  
INTERROGATORY NO. 7 
Identify all females by name and age for whom Epstein or his employees or agents provided 
accommodations at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York for any period of time. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 7 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the phrase “provided accommodations” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors 
further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.   
Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors state the 
following individuals stayed at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York for some period of time, 
but it is unknown whether any of them stayed at 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York during 
the Relevant Time Period: 
• Roslyn Fontanilla 
• Susan Hamblin 
• Sarah Kellen 
Co-Executors do not know whether the individuals listed have ever spoke with or interacted 
with Plaintiff during the Relevant Time Period. The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information 
remains ongoing; they will supplement this response if and when any additional responsive 
information is ascertained.    
INTERROGATORY NO. 8 
Identify by name and age all persons who gave a massage or were asked to give a massage 
to Epstein, Maxwell or a guest, or to whom Epstein or Maxwell gave a massage, at any of Epstein’s 
residences and provide the location of each massage. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 35-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 11 of 15

42245537  
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 8 on the grounds and to the extent that it 
calls for the production of information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work 
product doctrine, and any other applicable privilege or protection from disclosure.  The Co-
Executors further object on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither relevant to 
Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also overly broad and unduly 
burdensome.  The Co-Executors further object to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent 
that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant 
Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Co-Executors refer Plaintiff to 
the documents produced by Plaintiff at Bates Nos. JBRYANT 3736-3832, which purports to list 
contact information for masseuses.  Co-Executors do not know whether any individuals identified 
therein are masseuses or if those individuals provided massages to Decedent during the Relevant 
Time Period. The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will 
supplement this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained. 
INTERROGATORY NO. 12 
Identify any telecommunications, information technology, or audio-visual technology 
company that Epstein hired for work in any of his residences or offices and provide the name and 
contact information for each individual or company listed, in addition to the residence or office 
serviced. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE: 
The Co-Executors object to Interrogatory No. 12 on the grounds that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to Plaintiff’s claims nor proportional to the needs of this case; it is also 
overly broad and unduly burdensome.  The Co-Executors also object to this Interrogatory on the 
grounds that the phrase “hired for work” is vague and ambiguous.  The Co-Executors further object 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 35-1   Filed 05/14/20   Page 12 of 15

42245537  
to this Interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent that it is unconstrained by time.  Accordingly, 
Co-Executors’ response is limited to the Relevant Time Period. 
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the Co-Executors believe that 
Jermaine Ruan performed information technology work at Decedent’s home in the United States 
Virgin Islands during the Relevant Time Period.  Subject to and without waiving the foregoing 
objections, the Co-Executors also believe that Mark Lundberg may have performed information 
technology work in some or all of Decedent’s homes during the Relevant Time Period.   
The Co-Executors’ search for relevant information remains ongoing; they will supplement 
this response if and when any additional responsive information is ascertained.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JULIETTE BRYANT, 
Plaintiff, 
CASE NO: 19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF  
v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN,  
in their capacities as the executors of the  
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN,  
Defendants. 
_____________________________________  
STIPULATED CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER  
WHEREAS, Plaintiff Juliette Bryant and Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. 
Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, (collectively, the “Parties” and each 
individually, a “Party”) request that this Court issue a protective order pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 26(c) to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic and sensitive information that 
they may need to disclose in connection with discovery in this action;  
WHEREAS, the Parties, through counsel, agree to the following terms; and  
WHEREAS, this Court finds that good cause exists for issuance of an appropriately 
tailored confidentiality order governing the pretrial phase of this action;  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Parties to this action, their respective agents, 
employees, and attorneys, any other person in active concert or participation with any of the 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 1 of 13

foregoing, and all other persons with actual notice of this Order will adhere to the following 
terms, upon pain of contempt:  
1. 
“Producing Party” shall mean the parties to this action and any third parties 
producing Confidential Information. 
2. 
“Receiving Party” shall mean the party to this action and/or any non-party 
receiving Confidential Information. 
3. 
With respect to “Discovery Material” (i.e., documents, information or tangible 
things of any kind produced or disclosed in the course of discovery in this action) that a 
Producing Party has designated as “Confidential” pursuant to this Order, no Receiving Party may 
disclose such Confidential Discovery Material to anyone else except as expressly permitted 
hereunder.  
4. 
The Producing Party may designate as Confidential only the portion of such 
material that it reasonably and in good faith believes consists of:  
(a) medical, mental health and/or other health care records;  
(b) Social Security numbers, personal telephone numbers, tax returns, and credit 
and banking information of any person;  
(c) names of alleged minor victims of sexual abuse;  
(d) previously non-disclosed financial information; 
(e) non-public information that the producing person in good faith considers to be, 
reflect, or reveal business, marketing, financial, or regulatory information or data, 
or information of commercial value, including, without limitation, trade secrets, 
contracts with third parties, or other information required by law or agreement to 
be kept confidential;  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 2 of 13

(f) any other material the Parties agree in writing is Confidential; and 
(g) any other category of information given confidential status by this Court after 
the date of this Order.  
5. 
With respect to the Confidential portion of any Discovery Material other than 
deposition transcripts and exhibits, the Producing Party or its counsel may designate such portion 
as “Confidential” by: (a) stamping or otherwise clearly marking as “Confidential” the protected 
portion in a manner that will not interfere with legibility or audibility; and (b) producing for 
future public use another copy of said Discovery Material with the confidential information 
redacted.  
6. 
A Producing Party or its counsel may designate deposition exhibits or portions of 
deposition transcripts as Confidential Discovery Material either by: (a) indicating on the record 
during the deposition that a question calls for Confidential information, in which case the 
reporter will bind the transcript of the designated testimony in a separate volume and mark it as 
“Confidential Information Governed by Protective Order;” or (b) notifying the reporter and all 
counsel of record, in writing, within 30 days after a deposition has concluded, of the specific 
pages and lines of the transcript that are to be designated “Confidential,” in which case all 
counsel receiving the transcript will be responsible for marking the copies of the designated 
transcript in their possession or under their control as directed by the Producing Party or that 
person’s counsel. During the 30-day period following a deposition, all Parties will treat the entire 
deposition transcript as if it had been designated Confidential.  
7. 
If at any time before the termination of this action a Producing Party realizes that 
it should have designated as Confidential some portion(s) of Discovery Material that it 
previously produced without limitation, the Producing Party may so designate such material by 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 3 of 13

notifying all Parties in writing. Thereafter, the Receiving Party will treat such designated 
portion(s) of the Discovery Material as Confidential. In addition, the Producing Party shall 
provide each Receiving Party with replacement versions of such Discovery Material that bears 
the “Confidential” designation within two business days of providing such notice.  
8. 
Nothing contained in this Order will be construed as: (a) a waiver by a Party or 
person of its right to object to any discovery request; (b) a waiver of any privilege or protection; 
or (c) a ruling regarding the admissibility at trial of any document, testimony, or other evidence.  
9. 
Where a Producing Party has designated Discovery Material as Confidential, the 
Receiving Party may disclose such information only to the following persons:  
(a) the Parties to this action;  
(b) counsel retained specifically for this action, including any paralegal, clerical, 
or other assistant that such outside counsel employs and assigns to this matter; 
(c) outside vendors or service providers (such as copy-service providers and 
document-management consultants) that counsel hire and assign to this matter, 
provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form 
annexed as Exhibit A hereto;  
(d) any mediator or arbitrator that the Parties engage in this matter or that this 
Court appoints, provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure 
Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto;  
(e) as to any document, its author, its addressee, and any other person indicated on 
the face of the document as having received a copy;  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 4 of 13

(f) any witness who counsel for a Party in good faith believes may be called to 
testify at trial or deposition in this action, provided such person has first executed 
a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto; 
(g) any person a Party retains to serve as an expert witness or otherwise provide 
specialized advice to counsel in connection with this action, provided such person 
has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto;  
(h) stenographers engaged to transcribe depositions the Parties conduct in this 
action; and  
(i) this Court, including any appellate court, its support personnel, and court 
reporters.  
10. 
Before disclosing any Confidential Discovery Material to any person referred to 
in subparagraphs 9(c), 9(d), 9(f), or 9(g) above, counsel must provide a copy of this Order to 
such person, who must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto stating that he or she has read this Order and agrees to be bound by its terms. Said counsel 
must retain each signed Non-Disclosure Agreement, hold it in escrow, and produce it to 
opposing counsel either before such person is permitted to testify (at deposition or trial) or at the 
conclusion of the case including any and all appeals, whichever comes first.  
11. 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Paragraph 9 shall impose any limitation on 
the ability of a Producing Party to disclose its own Confidential Discovery Material. A 
Producing Party shall not be required to obtain an executed Non-Disclosure Agreement from its 
own current or former employees with respect to disclosure of its own Confidential Discovery 
Material.    
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 5 of 13

12. 
This Order binds the Parties and certain others to treat as Confidential any 
Discovery Materials so classified. The Court has not, however, made any finding regarding the 
confidentiality of any Discovery Materials, and retains full discretion to determine whether to 
afford confidential treatment to any Discovery Material designated as Confidential hereunder. 
All persons are placed on notice that the Court is unlikely to seal or otherwise afford confidential 
treatment to any Discovery Material introduced into evidence at trial, even if such material has 
previously been sealed or designated as Confidential.  
13. 
In filing Confidential Discovery Material with this Court, or filing portions of any 
pleadings, motions, or other papers that disclose such Confidential Discovery Material 
(“Confidential Court Submission”), the Parties shall publicly file a redacted copy of the 
Confidential Court Submission via the Electronic Case Filing System. The Parties shall file an 
unredacted copy of the Confidential Court Submission under seal with the Clerk of this Court, 
and the Parties shall serve this Court and opposing counsel with unredacted courtesy copies of 
the Confidential Court Submission.  Any Party that seeks to file Confidential Discovery Material 
under seal must file an application and supporting declaration justifying—on a particularized 
basis—the sealing of such documents. The parties should be aware that the Court will unseal 
documents if it is unable to make “specific, on the record findings . . . demonstrating that closure 
is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.”  Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2006).  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this paragraph, if the parties stipulate that specific portions of a document are both 
confidential and immaterial to this lawsuit, a party may publicly file a version of the document 
with those confidential and immaterial portions redacted, and that party need not submit an 
unredacted version to the Court or file a motion to seal.  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 6 of 13

14. 
Any Party who objects to any designation of confidentiality may at any time 
before the trial of this action serve upon counsel for the Producing Party a written notice stating 
with particularity the grounds of the objection. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, 
counsel for all affected Parties will address their dispute to the Court by motion.  The Party 
seeking confidentiality shall bear the burden of establishing that the material at issue was 
properly designated as confidential.  The Parties shall treat the disputed materials as Confidential 
pending the Court’s resolution of such motion.   
15. 
Any Party who requests additional limits on disclosure (such as “attorneys’ eyes 
only” in extraordinary circumstances), may at any time before the trial of this action serve upon 
counsel for the recipient Parties a written notice stating with particularity the grounds of the 
request. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, counsel for all affected Parties will 
address their dispute to the Court.   
16. 
Absent an Order from a court of competent jurisdiction, Recipients of 
Confidential Discovery Material under this Order may use such material solely for the 
prosecution and defense of this action, any appeals thereto, and any alternative dispute resolution 
proceeding intended to resolve this action with prior express permission of the producing party, 
and not for any other purpose or in any other litigation proceeding. Nothing contained in this 
Order, however, will affect or restrict the rights of any Party with respect to its own documents 
or information produced in this action.  Nor shall anything contained in this Order prejudice a 
Party’s ability to seek discovery in this and any other legal proceeding, without prejudice to any 
other Party’s right to object to such discovery.   
17. 
Nothing in this Order will prevent any Party from producing any Confidential 
Discovery Material in its possession in response to a lawful subpoena or other compulsory 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 7 of 13

process, or if required to produce by law or by any government agency having jurisdiction, 
provided that, unless precluded by applicable laws or rules, such Party gives written notice to the 
Producing Party as soon as reasonably possible, and if permitted by the time allowed under the 
request, at least 10 days before any disclosure. Upon receiving such notice, the Producing Party 
will bear the burden to oppose compliance with the subpoena, other compulsory process, or other 
legal notice if the Producing Party deems it appropriate to do so.  
18. 
Each person who has access to Discovery Material designated as Confidential 
pursuant to this Order must take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized or 
inadvertent disclosure of such material.  
19. 
If a Receiving Party receives documents or other materials that it has reason to 
believe are subject to a good faith claim of attorney-client privilege, work product protection, or 
other privilege or immunity from disclosure, the Receiving Party must refrain from examining 
the documents or other materials any more than is essential to ascertain whether the documents 
or other materials are reasonably subject to such a claim.  The Receiving Party shall promptly 
notify the producing person in writing that the Receiving Party possesses documents or other 
material that appears to be privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure.  
20. 
If, in connection with this litigation, a producing person inadvertently discloses 
information that is subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product 
protection, or any other privilege or immunity from disclosure (“Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information”), such disclosure shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of any 
claim of privilege, work product protection, or other privilege or immunity from discovery with 
respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information or its subject matter.  In addition, a producing 
person may use its own document (e.g., as a deposition exhibit) containing material that is 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 8 of 13

subject to a claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for the purpose of establishing the 
basis of such claim without waiver of any applicable privilege or immunity from disclosure, 
unless the producing person affirmatively uses or relies upon the specific material contained in 
the document that is subject to the claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for any 
purpose other than establishing the basis of such claim.  
21. 
If a producing person makes a claim of inadvertent disclosure, the Receiving 
Party shall, within five business days, return or destroy all copies of the Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information, and provide a certification of counsel that all such information has been returned or 
destroyed, unless the Receiving Party seeks to dispute that the information is privileged or 
otherwise protected as set forth below.  Until the dispute is resolved or ruled upon, the Receiving 
Party shall undertake to keep such information restricted solely for use in connection with the 
dispute over the privilege or protection.     
22. 
Within five business days after the notification that such Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information has been returned or destroyed, the producing person shall produce a privilege log 
with respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  
23. 
The Receiving Party may move the Court for an Order compelling production of 
the Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  Pursuant to the parties’ obligations set forth herein, the 
motion shall not quote or paraphrase the substance of the document subject to the motion to 
compel beyond the description of the document contained in the privilege log entry for the 
document.  The motion shall be filed under seal, and shall not assert as a ground for entering 
such an Order the fact or circumstances of the inadvertent production in this action.  
24. 
The Producing Party retains the burden of establishing the privileged or protected 
nature of any Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  Nothing in this Order shall limit the right of 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 9 of 13

any Producing Party or Receiving Party to request an in camera review of the Inadvertently 
Disclosed Information.  
25. 
Unless the parties otherwise agree or a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise 
orders, within 60 days of the final disposition of this action—including all appeals—all 
Receiving Parties must either return Confidential Discovery Material—including all copies 
thereof—to the Producing Party, or destroy such material—including all copies thereof. In either 
event, by the 60-day deadline, the Receiving Party must certify its return or destruction by 
submitting a written certification to the Producing Party that affirms that it has not retained any 
copies, abstracts, compilations, summaries, or other forms of reproducing or capturing any of the 
Confidential Discovery Material.  Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Discovery Materials that 
have been received electronically and that cannot be returned or destroyed must be electronically 
deleted and deleted from “trash” files, and the Receiving Party must take reasonable measures to 
ensure that unauthorized persons do not have access to Confidential information residing on the 
Receiving Party’s computer server and back-up media; and (ii) outside counsel for the parties are 
permitted to retain one archival copy of all pleadings, motion papers, court filings made under 
seal, transcripts, legal memoranda, correspondence, attorney work product, written discovery 
responses, deposition and trial exhibits, and expert reports, even if such materials contain 
Confidential Discovery Material, subject to a continuing obligation to protect information 
designated Confidential pursuant to this Order. 
26. 
This Order will survive the termination of the litigation and will continue to be 
binding upon each Receiving Party.  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 10 of 13

27. 
This Court will retain jurisdiction over all persons subject to this Order to the 
extent necessary to enforce any obligations arising hereunder or to impose sanctions for any 
contempt thereof.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JULIETTE BRYANT, 
Plaintiff, 
CASE NO: 19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF 
v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
in their capacities as the executors of the  
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN,  
Defendants. 
_____________________________________ 
STIPULATED CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER 
WHEREAS, Plaintiff Juliette Bryant and Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. 
Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, (collectively, the “Parties” and each 
individually, a “Party”) request that this Court issue a protective order pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 26(c) to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic and sensitive information that 
they may need to disclose in connection with discovery in this action; 
WHEREAS, the Parties, through counsel, agree to the following terms; and 
WHEREAS, this Court finds that good cause exists for issuance of an appropriately 
tailored confidentiality order governing the pretrial phase of this action; 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Parties to this action, their respective agents, 
employees, and attorneys, any other person in active concert or participation with any of the 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 1 of 13
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 1 of 13

foregoing, and all other persons with actual notice of this Order will adhere to the following 
terms, upon pain of contempt: 
1.
“Producing Party” shall mean the parties to this action and any third parties
producing Confidential Information. 
2.
“Receiving Party” shall mean the party to this action and/or any non-party
receiving Confidential Information. 
3.
With respect to “Discovery Material” (i.e., documents, information or tangible
things of any kind produced or disclosed in the course of discovery in this action) that a 
Producing Party has designated as “Confidential” pursuant to this Order, no Receiving Party may 
disclose such Confidential Discovery Material to anyone else except as expressly permitted 
hereunder. 
4.
The Producing Party may designate as Confidential only the portion of such
material that it reasonably and in good faith believes consists of: 
(a) medical, mental health and/or other health care records; 
(b) Social Security numbers, personal telephone numbers, tax returns, and credit 
and banking information of any person; 
(c) names of alleged minor victims of sexual abuse; 
(d) previously non-disclosed financial information; 
(e) non-public information that the producing person in good faith considers to be, 
reflect, or reveal business, marketing, financial, or regulatory information or data, 
or information of commercial value, including, without limitation, trade secrets, 
contracts with third parties, or other information required by law or agreement to 
be kept confidential; 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 2 of 13
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 2 of 13

(f) any other material the Parties agree in writing is Confidential; and 
(g) any other category of information given confidential status by this Court after 
the date of this Order. 
5.
With respect to the Confidential portion of any Discovery Material other than
deposition transcripts and exhibits, the Producing Party or its counsel may designate such portion 
as “Confidential” by: (a) stamping or otherwise clearly marking as “Confidential” the protected 
portion in a manner that will not interfere with legibility or audibility; and (b) producing for 
future public use another copy of said Discovery Material with the confidential information 
redacted. 
6.
A Producing Party or its counsel may designate deposition exhibits or portions of
deposition transcripts as Confidential Discovery Material either by: (a) indicating on the record 
during the deposition that a question calls for Confidential information, in which case the 
reporter will bind the transcript of the designated testimony in a separate volume and mark it as 
“Confidential Information Governed by Protective Order;” or (b) notifying the reporter and all 
counsel of record, in writing, within 30 days after a deposition has concluded, of the specific 
pages and lines of the transcript that are to be designated “Confidential,” in which case all 
counsel receiving the transcript will be responsible for marking the copies of the designated 
transcript in their possession or under their control as directed by the Producing Party or that 
person’s counsel. During the 30-day period following a deposition, all Parties will treat the entire 
deposition transcript as if it had been designated Confidential. 
7.
If at any time before the termination of this action a Producing Party realizes that
it should have designated as Confidential some portion(s) of Discovery Material that it 
previously produced without limitation, the Producing Party may so designate such material by 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 3 of 13
________________________________________________
 DF
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 3 of 13

notifying all Parties in writing. Thereafter, the Receiving Party will treat such designated 
portion(s) of the Discovery Material as Confidential. In addition, the Producing Party shall 
provide each Receiving Party with replacement versions of such Discovery Material that bears 
the “Confidential” designation within two business days of providing such notice.  
8. 
Nothing contained in this Order will be construed as: (a) a waiver by a Party or 
person of its right to object to any discovery request; (b) a waiver of any privilege or protection; 
or (c) a ruling regarding the admissibility at trial of any document, testimony, or other evidence.  
9. 
Where a Producing Party has designated Discovery Material as Confidential, the 
Receiving Party may disclose such information only to the following persons:  
(a) the Parties to this action;  
(b) counsel retained specifically for this action, including any paralegal, clerical, 
or other assistant that such outside counsel employs and assigns to this matter; 
(c) outside vendors or service providers (such as copy-service providers and 
document-management consultants) that counsel hire and assign to this matter, 
provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form 
annexed as Exhibit A hereto;  
(d) any mediator or arbitrator that the Parties engage in this matter or that this 
Court appoints, provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure 
Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto;  
(e) as to any document, its author, its addressee, and any other person indicated on 
the face of the document as having received a copy;  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 4 of 13
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 4 of 13

(f) any witness who counsel for a Party in good faith believes may be called to 
testify at trial or deposition in this action, provided such person has first executed 
a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto; 
(g) any person a Party retains to serve as an expert witness or otherwise provide 
specialized advice to counsel in connection with this action, provided such person 
has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto;  
(h) stenographers engaged to transcribe depositions the Parties conduct in this 
action; and  
(i) this Court, including any appellate court, its support personnel, and court 
reporters.  
10. 
Before disclosing any Confidential Discovery Material to any person referred to 
in subparagraphs 9(c), 9(d), 9(f), or 9(g) above, counsel must provide a copy of this Order to 
such person, who must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto stating that he or she has read this Order and agrees to be bound by its terms. Said counsel 
must retain each signed Non-Disclosure Agreement, hold it in escrow, and produce it to 
opposing counsel either before such person is permitted to testify (at deposition or trial) or at the 
conclusion of the case including any and all appeals, whichever comes first.  
11. 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Paragraph 9 shall impose any limitation on 
the ability of a Producing Party to disclose its own Confidential Discovery Material. A 
Producing Party shall not be required to obtain an executed Non-Disclosure Agreement from its 
own current or former employees with respect to disclosure of its own Confidential Discovery 
Material.    
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 5 of 13
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 5 of 13

12. 
This Order binds the Parties and certain others to treat as Confidential any 
Discovery Materials so classified. The Court has not, however, made any finding regarding the 
confidentiality of any Discovery Materials, and retains full discretion to determine whether to 
afford confidential treatment to any Discovery Material designated as Confidential hereunder. 
All persons are placed on notice that the Court is unlikely to seal or otherwise afford confidential 
treatment to any Discovery Material introduced into evidence at trial, even if such material has 
previously been sealed or designated as Confidential.  
13. 
In filing Confidential Discovery Material with this Court, or filing portions of any 
pleadings, motions, or other papers that disclose such Confidential Discovery Material 
(“Confidential Court Submission”), the Parties shall publicly file a redacted copy of the 
Confidential Court Submission via the Electronic Case Filing System. The Parties shall file an 
unredacted copy of the Confidential Court Submission under seal with the Clerk of this Court, 
and the Parties shall serve this Court and opposing counsel with unredacted courtesy copies of 
the Confidential Court Submission.  Any Party that seeks to file Confidential Discovery Material 
under seal must file an application and supporting declaration justifying—on a particularized 
basis—the sealing of such documents. The parties should be aware that the Court will unseal 
documents if it is unable to make “specific, on the record findings . . . demonstrating that closure 
is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.”  Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2006).  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this paragraph, if the parties stipulate that specific portions of a document are both 
confidential and immaterial to this lawsuit, a party may publicly file a version of the document 
with those confidential and immaterial portions redacted, and that party need not submit an 
unredacted version to the Court or file a motion to seal.  
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 6 of 13
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 6 of 13

14. 
Any Party who objects to any designation of confidentiality may at any time 
before the trial of this action serve upon counsel for the Producing Party a written notice stating 
with particularity the grounds of the objection. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, 
counsel for all affected Parties will address their dispute to the Court by motion.  The Party 
seeking confidentiality shall bear the burden of establishing that the material at issue was 
properly designated as confidential.  The Parties shall treat the disputed materials as Confidential 
pending the Court’s resolution of such motion.   
15. 
Any Party who requests additional limits on disclosure (such as “attorneys’ eyes 
only” in extraordinary circumstances), may at any time before the trial of this action serve upon 
counsel for the recipient Parties a written notice stating with particularity the grounds of the 
request. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, counsel for all affected Parties will 
address their dispute to the Court.   
16. 
Absent an Order from a court of competent jurisdiction, Recipients of 
Confidential Discovery Material under this Order may use such material solely for the 
prosecution and defense of this action, any appeals thereto, and any alternative dispute resolution 
proceeding intended to resolve this action with prior express permission of the producing party, 
and not for any other purpose or in any other litigation proceeding. Nothing contained in this 
Order, however, will affect or restrict the rights of any Party with respect to its own documents 
or information produced in this action.  Nor shall anything contained in this Order prejudice a 
Party’s ability to seek discovery in this and any other legal proceeding, without prejudice to any 
other Party’s right to object to such discovery.   
17. 
Nothing in this Order will prevent any Party from producing any Confidential 
Discovery Material in its possession in response to a lawful subpoena or other compulsory 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 7 of 13
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 7 of 13

process, or if required to produce by law or by any government agency having jurisdiction, 
provided that, unless precluded by applicable laws or rules, such Party gives written notice to the 
Producing Party as soon as reasonably possible, and if permitted by the time allowed under the 
request, at least 10 days before any disclosure. Upon receiving such notice, the Producing Party 
will bear the burden to oppose compliance with the subpoena, other compulsory process, or other 
legal notice if the Producing Party deems it appropriate to do so.  
18. 
Each person who has access to Discovery Material designated as Confidential 
pursuant to this Order must take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized or 
inadvertent disclosure of such material.  
19. 
If a Receiving Party receives documents or other materials that it has reason to 
believe are subject to a good faith claim of attorney-client privilege, work product protection, or 
other privilege or immunity from disclosure, the Receiving Party must refrain from examining 
the documents or other materials any more than is essential to ascertain whether the documents 
or other materials are reasonably subject to such a claim.  The Receiving Party shall promptly 
notify the producing person in writing that the Receiving Party possesses documents or other 
material that appears to be privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure.  
20. 
If, in connection with this litigation, a producing person inadvertently discloses 
information that is subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product 
protection, or any other privilege or immunity from disclosure (“Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information”), such disclosure shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of any 
claim of privilege, work product protection, or other privilege or immunity from discovery with 
respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information or its subject matter.  In addition, a producing 
person may use its own document (e.g., as a deposition exhibit) containing material that is 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 8 of 13
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 8 of 13

subject to a claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for the purpose of establishing the 
basis of such claim without waiver of any applicable privilege or immunity from disclosure, 
unless the producing person affirmatively uses or relies upon the specific material contained in 
the document that is subject to the claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for any 
purpose other than establishing the basis of such claim. 
21.
If a producing person makes a claim of inadvertent disclosure, the Receiving
Party shall, within five business days, return or destroy all copies of the Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information, and provide a certification of counsel that all such information has been returned or 
destroyed, unless the Receiving Party seeks to dispute that the information is privileged or 
otherwise protected as set forth below.  Until the dispute is resolved or ruled upon, the Receiving 
Party shall undertake to keep such information restricted solely for use in connection with the 
dispute over the privilege or protection.    
22.
Within five business days after the notification that such Inadvertently Disclosed
Information has been returned or destroyed, the producing person shall produce a privilege log 
with respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information. 
23.
The Receiving Party may move the Court for an Order compelling production of
the Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  Pursuant to the parties’ obligations set forth herein, the 
motion shall not quote or paraphrase the substance of the document subject to the motion to 
compel beyond the description of the document contained in the privilege log entry for the 
document.  The motion shall be filed under seal, and shall not assert as a ground for entering 
such an Order the fact or circumstances of the inadvertent production in this action. 
24.
The Producing Party retains the burden of establishing the privileged or protected
nature of any Inadvertently Disclosed Information.  Nothing in this Order shall limit the right of 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 36   Filed 05/21/20   Page 9 of 13
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 38   Filed 05/22/20   Page 9 of 13

any Producing Party or Receiving Party to request an in camera review of the Inadvertently 
Disclosed Information. 
25.
Unless the parties otherwise agree or a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise
orders, within 60 days of the final disposition of this action—including all appeals—all 
Receiving Parties must either return Confidential Discovery Material—including all copies 
thereof—to the Producing Party, or destroy such material—including all copies thereof. In either 
event, by the 60-day deadline, the Receiving Party must certify its return or destruction by 
submitting a written certification to the Producing Party that affirms that it has not retained any 
copies, abstracts, compilations, summaries, or other forms of reproducing or capturing any of the 
Confidential Discovery Material.  Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Discovery Materials that 
have been received electronically and that cannot be returned or destroyed must be electronically 
deleted and deleted from “trash” files, and the Receiving Party must take reasonable measures to 
ensure that unauthorized persons do not have access to Confidential information residing on the 
Receiving Party’s computer server and back-up media; and (ii) outside counsel for the parties are 
permitted to retain one archival copy of all pleadings, motion papers, court filings made under 
seal, transcripts, legal memoranda, correspondence, attorney work product, written discovery 
responses, deposition and trial exhibits, and expert reports, even if such materials contain 
Confidential Discovery Material, subject to a continuing obligation to protect information 
designated Confidential pursuant to this Order. 
26.
This Order will survive the termination of the litigation and will continue to be
binding upon each Receiving Party.

This Court will retain jurisdiction over all persons subject to this Order to the
extent necessary to enforce any obligations arising hereunder or to impose sanctions for any 
contempt thereof.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT ................................................................................................... 1 
ARGUMENT ................................................................................................................................. 1 
I. 
New York’s borrowing statute applies to Plaintiff’s claims because her 
own allegations firmly establish she was not, and is not, a New York 
resident. .................................................................................................................. 1 
II. 
The 20-year limitations period in CPLR § 213-c does not apply 
retroactively or to torts allegedly committed outside New York. .......................... 3 
III. 
Plaintiff is unable to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a) because she fails to assert a 
criminal indictment that arises from Decedent’s alleged conduct towards 
her. ......................................................................................................................... 4 
IV. 
Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege “extraordinary” circumstances 
sufficient to invoke equitable estoppel or tolling. .................................................. 6

The Co-Executors1 submit this reply memorandum of law in support of their motion to 
dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF No. 1). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
In her opposition brief, Plaintiff asks the Court to depart from well-established law to 
resuscitate her claims that expired over a decade ago.  First, Plaintiff attempts to create a non-
existent issue of fact – which does not alter the result of the proper legal analysis in any event – 
regarding her residence, which she unequivocally alleges was not in New York.  Second, Plaintiff 
asks the Court to disregard basic principles of statutory interpretation and numerous cases applying 
CPLR §§ 213-c and 215(8)(a) to support her erroneous application of those rules.  Third, Plaintiff 
asks the Court to disregard Second Circuit authority holding that it is Plaintiff’s burden to allege 
“extraordinary circumstances” to toll the applicable statutes of limitations, which she fails to do 
here.  Fourth, Plaintiff urges this Court to permit her to seek punitive damages notwithstanding 
that, in two other actions against the Co-Executors involving similar claims, Judge Engelmayer 
dismissed claims for punitive damages in the face of the very arguments Plaintiff raises here.  The 
Court should reject Plaintiff’s arguments. 
ARGUMENT 
I.
New York’s borrowing statute applies to Plaintiff’s claims because her own 
allegations firmly establish she was not, and is not, a New York resident. 
As laid out in the Co-Executors’ moving papers, the New York borrowing statute requires 
dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims to the extent that they are based on torts that allegedly occurred in 
France, New Mexico, and the USVI, as such claims are time-barred by the applicable laws of those 
Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Co-Executors’ moving brief (ECF 
No. 24).

jurisdictions.  (Mov. Br. pp. 4-6.)  In a failed attempt to avoid this result, Plaintiff now attempts to 
manufacture a fact issue regarding her residency.2  (Op. Br. p. 15.)   
Not only is this argument unsupported by case law, it is directly contradicted by Plaintiff’s 
own allegations in her Complaint.  Plaintiff argues that her “Complaint alleges that Plaintiff was a 
New York resident at all relevant times.”  (Op. Br. p. 15.)  However, nowhere in her Complaint 
does Plaintiff claim New York domicile or residency.  Rather, in addition to expressly alleging 
that “Plaintiff Juliette Bryant is a citizen and resident of South Africa,” all other supporting facts 
alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint -- including that she met Decedent when he was visiting Cape 
Town, that she repeatedly would “travel to the United States” “for one to two weeks at a time,” 
and that she “flew home to South Africa” (Compl. ¶¶ 16, 38, 46, & 50) -- confirm her claimed 
South African residency.   
Plaintiff further argues that there is a factual question regarding her New York residency 
because “she had always wanted to live in New York, Epstein’s co-conspirators got Plaintiff a visa 
so that she could travel to New York often, and when she visited she stayed at Epstein’s New York 
home for one to two weeks at a time.”  (Op. Br. p. 15).  None of these allegations, even if true, 
would suffice to establish Plaintiff’s residency in New York under the New York borrowing 
statute.  See Gold v. Katz, No. 90 CIV. 7726 (RLC), 1991 WL 237807, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 4, 
1991) (“The test for domicile has two elements: ‘[r]esidence in fact, coupled with the purpose to 
make the place of residence one’s home.’” (quoting Texas v. Florida, 306 U.S. 398, 424 (1939)); 
Bache Halsey Stuart Inc. v. Namm, 446 F. Supp. 692, 695 (S.D.N.Y. 1978)(in determining 
“An individual can have only one state of residence for purposes of the borrowing statute, and that is the state of his 
domicile.”  Bache Halsey Stuart Inc. v. Namm, 446 F. Supp. 692, 694 (S.D.N.Y. 1978).  Furthermore, “[a]n 
individual’s residence at the time a lawsuit is commenced provides prima facie evidence of his domicile.”  Willis v. 
Westin Hotel Co., 651 F. Supp. 598, 601 (S.D.N.Y. 1986).  Plaintiff’s Complaint expressly states that “Plaintiff Juliette 
Bryant is a citizen and resident of South Africa.”  (Compl. ⁋ 16).  Therefore, New York’s borrowing statute applies. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 39   Filed 05/26/20   Page 7 of 16

- 3 - 
residency under the borrowing statute, “[w]hat is vital is whether the Namms’ Connecticut or New 
York residence is where they intended to maintain their home”).  On their face, allegations that 
Plaintiff needed a visa to visit New York reveal her current claims of residency are nothing more 
than an after-the-fact concoction. 
Furthermore, even if Plaintiff had also alleged in her Complaint that she was a New York 
resident -- which she did not do -- such an allegation would not preclude dismissal of her claims 
in the face of her numerous allegations establishing she was not a New York resident during the 
relevant time period.  “‘Where [the] plaintiff’s own pleadings are internally inconsistent, a court 
is neither obligated to reconcile nor accept the contradictory allegations in the pleadings as true in 
deciding a motion to dismiss.’”  Whitley v. Bowden, No. 17-cv-3564 (KMK), 2018 WL 2170313, 
at *11 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2018) (quoting Carson Optical Inc. v. eBay Inc., 202 F. Supp. 3d 247, 
255 (E.D.N.Y. 2016)).    
Finally, even if New York’s borrowing statute does not apply, for the reasons set forth in 
the Co-Executors’ moving brief and herein, Plaintiff’s claims are still untimely under New York 
law. 
II.
The 20-year limitations period in CPLR § 213-c does not apply retroactively or to 
torts allegedly committed outside New York.  
In her opposition brief, Plaintiff argues that CPLR § 213-c, which provides a 20-year 
limitations period for certain civil claims based on sexual offenses that constitute specific New 
York penal law violations, revives her claims.  Plaintiff’s argument fails for at least two reasons. 
First, the 20-year limitations period in CPLR § 213-c does not apply to Plaintiff’s claims 
because they were already time-barred by 2007 at the latest, which was long before the non-
retroactive 20-year limitations period in CPLR § 213-c became effective.  The 20-year limitations 
period in CPLR § 213-c became effective as of September 18, 2019; the previous limitation period 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 39   Filed 05/26/20   Page 8 of 16
---

- 4 - 
therein was 5 years as of 2006 and 1 year before then.  L. 2006, ch. 3, § 5(b).  The law enacting 
the 20-year limitations period unequivocally states that it does not apply retroactively except 
“where the applicable statute of limitations in effect on the date of such act or omission has not yet 
expired.”  L. 2019, ch. 315, § 4.  Here, Plaintiff’s claims expired over a decade before the 20-year 
statute of limitations became effective—so it is inapplicable. 
Second, Plaintiff’s allegations of torts occurring outside New York cannot constitute 
violations of New York penal law that serve as necessary predicates to the application of CPLR § 
213-c.  See People v. McLaughlin, 80 N.Y.2d 466, 471 (1992) (“Because the State only has power 
to enact and enforce criminal laws within its territorial borders, there can be no criminal offense 
unless it has territorial jurisdiction”).  In an attempt to avoid this well-established principle, 
Plaintiff argues that her claims based on torts that occurred outside New York still somehow 
accrued under New York law.  This argument is both nonsensical and contrary to other black-letter 
law.  See Corcoran v. New York Power Auth., No. 95 CIV. 5357 (DLC), 1997 WL 603739, at *5 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 1997)  (“An action for battery accrues when the nonconsensual offensive 
contact occurs.”); Lettis v. U.S. Postal Serv., 39 F. Supp. 2d 181, 204 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (“Causes 
of action for assault and battery accrue immediately upon the occurrence of the- tortious act”); 
Wilson v. Erra, 94 A.D.3d 756, 756, 942 N.Y.S.2d 127, 129 (2012) (“A cause of action alleging 
intentional infliction of emotional distress accrues on the date of injury”).     
III.
Plaintiff is unable to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a) because she fails to assert a criminal 
indictment that arises from Decedent’s alleged conduct towards her.  
In her opposition brief, Plaintiff confirms her allegation is that she did not even meet 
Decedent until she was already an adult.  Nonetheless, Plaintiff continues to urge the application 
of CPLR § 215(8)(a) to this action based on an Indictment charging Decedent with sex trafficking 
of minors.  However, to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a), Plaintiff is required to assert allegations 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 39   Filed 05/26/20   Page 9 of 16

- 5 - 
establishing the Indictment and this lawsuit arise from the same “event or occurrence.”  Plaintiff 
fails to do this. 
Instead, Plaintiff attempts to recast the Indictment as broader in scope than its contents 
allow.  Specifically, Plaintiff takes two allegations concerning Decedent’s purported actual 
knowledge of the age of some of the “minor victims” out of context to imply adult women were 
the subject of the Indictment.  (Op. Br. p. 6).3  This is disingenuous.  The Indictment does not 
reference any adult victims.  Rather, all the facts alleged in the indictment refer to Decedent’s 
alleged conduct towards “minor girls” or “minor victims”  (Indictment at ¶¶ 1-4, 6, 8, 11-15 18-
19, et seq.); and the two counts of the indictment, for Sex Trafficking Conspiracy and Sex 
Trafficking, charge crimes involving minors (id at ¶¶ 20 & 24).  
Plaintiff next tries to expand the scope of CPLR § 215(8)(a)’s “event or occurrence” 
requirement.  However, the cases cited in the Co-Executors’ moving brief confirm that, even 
where it is undisputed that the subject criminal indictment concerns the civil plaintiff and the 
same kind of conduct alleged in the plaintiff’s civil complaint, CPLR § 215(8)(a) still does not 
apply where the indictment and civil action arise from different events or occurrences.  (See
Mov. Br. pp. 7-10.)  Plaintiff’s attempt to distinguish these cases on the ground that they 
“focused on events that occurred on specified dates” (Op. Br., p. 8) is based on Plaintiff’s 
dubious assertion that, because the Indictment at issue here “was not limited to a specific day or 
discrete event” (id., p. 10), anyone alleging she suffered the same type of misconduct described 
in the Indictment is free to invoke CPLR § 215(8)(a).  Such a reading is s contrary to basic 
The full sentences in the Indictment which Plaintiff references are as follows: “JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, 
knew that many of his New York victims were underage, including because certain victims told him their age;” and 
“JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain of his victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age.” (Indictment at ¶¶ 11 & 17.) 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 39   Filed 05/26/20   Page 10 of 16

- 6 - 
principles of statutory interpretation prohibiting a reading of a statute that would render its words 
meaningless (see 97 NY Jur Statutes § 185), the case law cited in the Co-Executors’ moving 
brief, a plain reading of the Indictment and common sense.4
IV.
Plaintiff fails to meet her burden to allege “extraordinary” circumstances sufficient 
to invoke equitable estoppel or tolling. 
Plaintiff misstates the pleading burden with respect to equitable estoppel and tolling, 
asserting that “Defendants have failed to meet their burden of showing that [she] will be unable to 
invoke equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.”  (Op. Br. p. 1.)  Plaintiff has it backwards. As 
explained in the Co-Executors’ moving brief, the burden is on Plaintiff to sufficiently allege 
“extraordinary circumstances” to invoke these doctrines.  (Mov. Br. pp. 1, 12-15.) 
In her opposition brief, Plaintiff does not address many of the cases that the Co-Executors 
cite on this point, but rather attempts to buttress her Complaint by painting a slightly more detailed 
(but still insufficient) picture of why she waited 15 years to bring this action.  However, Plaintiff’s 
Complaint is controlling.  In her Complaint, Plaintiff does not allege: any particularized acts by 
Decedent that prevented her from exercising her rights; that Decedent made a misrepresentation 
to her and had reason to believe she would rely on it; or that she reasonably relied on any 
misrepresentation by Decedent to her detriment.    
Excluding vague allegations concerning Decedent’s alleged misconduct directed at some 
unidentified set of alleged victims that does not include Plaintiff (see, e.g., Compl. ¶ 26 
(“[Decedent] utilized his seemingly unlimited power, wealth, and resources… intimidate and 
manipulate his victims”),5 Plaintiff primarily alleges her impressions and emotions between 
Plaintiff also once again relies on Kashef v. BNP Paribas S.A., 925 F.3d 53 (2d Cir. 2019), notwithstanding that the 
Co-Executors already demonstrated that it is distinguishable from this action.  (Mov. Br. p. 10.) 
Many of Plaintiff’s allegations are cut-and-pasted from the complaints of other plaintiffs represented by the same 
counsel and lack any ascribed basis other than Plaintiff’s impression of Decedent’s wealth.
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 39   Filed 05/26/20   Page 11 of 16

- 7 - 
2002 and 2004, rather than Decedent’s conduct.  (Id. ¶  44, 45, 48.)  Not a single case Plaintiff 
cites supports a finding that such allegations satisfy the “extraordinary circumstances” pleading 
burden required to invoke estoppel or tolling.  To the contrary, the cases Plaintiff cites are either 
inapplicable6 or confirm her allegations fall short of that threshold.7
While Plaintiff claims that “Epstein attempted to keep in contact with Juliette through e-
mail over the years” following Plaintiff’s cutting ties with him in 2004, she cites to two emails 
that neither contain threats nor misrepresentations—hardly “extraordinary circumstances.”  In 
any event, the cited emails, which are dated to 2016 and 2019, cannot serve as justification for 
Plaintiff’s failure to pursue her claims for the more-than-ten-year gap between when she “cut 
ties” with Decedent and when she corresponded with him. 
V.
Judge Engelmayer recently dismissed two other plaintiffs’ punitive damages claims 
as a matter of law, rejecting the very arguments Plaintiff raises here.  
The Hon. Paul A. Engelmayer recently dismissed punitive damages claims on the pleadings 
in two other actions against the Co-Executors involving claims similar to those Plaintiff raises in 
this action.  See e.g., Doe v. Indyke, No. 19-cv-10758 (PAE), 2020 WL 2036707, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 
Plaintiff’s reliance on Davis v. Jackson, No. 15-CV-5359 (KMK), 2016 WL 5720811, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 
2016)—to support her assertion that reasonable fear of retaliation “may be sufficient” to warrant equitable tolling (Op. 
Br. p. 17)—is misleading.  In that action, the court granted a pro se prisoner leave to allege facts sufficient to show he 
pursued his claims with reasonable diligence.  Id. at *39.  However, the Court was clear that its findings were based 
on plaintiff’s incarceration and pro se status.  See id. at *35, 39 (“in the prison context, reasonable fear of retaliation 
may be sufficient”; “given Plaintiff’s pro se status … the Court is hesitant to dismiss [his] claims”).  As Plaintiff is 
neither a prisoner nor proceeding pro se, Davis is inapplicable. 
In Funk v. Belneftekhim, No. 14-CV-0376 (BMC), 2019 WL 3035124 (E.D.N.Y. July 11, 2019), which Plaintiff also 
cites, the court found the plaintiffs “alleged extraordinary circumstances that could warrant the application of equitable 
tolling: they were drugged, kidnapped, flown to Belarus, held captive, and tortured for 383 and 483 days, respectively.”  
Id. at *2.  There are no such allegations here.  The other cases Plaintiff cites likewise support the conclusion she has 
not met her burden to allege extraordinary circumstances.  See Gotlin v. Lederman, No. 05-CV-1899 (ILG), 2006 WL 
1154817, at *30 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2006) (plaintiffs in medical malpractice action alleged defendants failed to provide 
them with, and intentionally and fraudulently attempted to discourage and prevent them from obtaining, their medical 
records); Gen. Stencils, Inc. v. Chiappa, 219 N.E.2d 169, 171 (N.Y. 1966) (plaintiff was allowed to invoke equitable 
estoppel against a bookkeeper who had used his position to carefully conceal his theft of the plaintiff’s money); Brown 
v. Parkchester S. Condos., 287 F.3d 58, 59 (2d Cir. 2002) (employee argued his medical condition prevented him 
from timely filing his complaint); Guobadia v. Irowa, 103 F. Supp. 3d 325, 341 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (plaintiff filed her 
lawsuit less than a year after leaving a home where she was allegedly forced to work without pay as a servant). 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 39   Filed 05/26/20   Page 12 of 16

- 8 - 
Apr. 28, 2020) (granting motion to dismiss punitive damages against the Co-Executors); Doe 15 
v. Indyke, No. 19-cv-10653 (PAE), 2020 WL 2086194, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2020) (same).  In 
doing so, Judge Engelmayer correctly rejected each of the arguments Plaintiff asserts here in 
support of her request to continue to pursue her legally deficient claim for punitive damages. 
First, Judge Engelmayer rejected the argument that a motion to dismiss a legally deficient 
claim for punitive damages on the pleadings is procedurally improper: “where punitive damages 
have been unavailable as a matter of law, courts have not hesitated to dismiss prayers for such 
damages at the threshold.”  Doe, 2020 WL 2036707, at *3; see also Doe 15, 2020 WL 2086194, 
at *1.  “[A]mple authority permits striking prayers for punitive damages where such relief is 
unavailable as a matter of law.”  Id. at *4 (citing In re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Sec. Litig., 851 
F. Supp. 2d at 544).8
Discarding the “conceptual debate” between motions filed under Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 
12(f), Judge Engelmayer further concluded that the Court could in any event dismiss claims for 
punitive damages sua sponte under Rule 12(f) because: “With numerous personal injury actions 
pending against the Epstein estate as a result of the recent enactment of the New York Child 
Victims Act, there is value in clarifying—for the parties and settlors—the damages available in 
actions where the law permits a sure answer on this point.”  Doe, 2020 WL 2036707, at *5.  The 
same practical wisdom applies here. 
Second, Judge Engelmayer rejected Mary Doe’s and Jane Doe 15’s attempts to apply 
United States Virgin Islands law to the issue of punitive damages, finding that the law of the place 
See also C. Wright & A. Miller, 5C Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1380 (3d ed.) (“the technical name given to a motion 
challenging a pleading is of little importance inasmuch as prejudice to the nonmoving party can hardly result from 
treating a motion that has been inaccurately denominated as a motion to strike as a motion to dismiss the complaint”); 
In re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Sec. Litig., 851 F. Supp. 2d 512, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting defendant’s motion 
to strike sections of first amended complaint asserting punitive damages); Nash v. Coram Healthcare Corp., No. 96 
Civ. 0298 (LMM), 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9101, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 1996) (“The motion to strike the punitive 
damages prayer from the Complaint is granted.”).

of the torts governs.  Doe, 2020 WL 2036707, at *5-6; Doe 15, 2020 WL 2086194, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Apr. 30, 2020).  As established in the Co-Executors’ moving brief, none of the jurisdictions where 
Plaintiff alleges the torts occurred permits punitive damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate. 
(ECF No. 24 pp. 16-18.) 
Moreover, Plaintiff here, like Mary Doe and Jane Doe 15, ignores Blisset v. Eisensmidt, 
940 F. Supp. 499, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996).  That well-reasoned decision establishes that Plaintiff 
may not have the Court simultaneously apply the first sentence of E.P.T.L. § 11-3.2(a)(1)—the 
portion of the statute permitting her to bring this action against the Co-Executors—but disregard 
the very next sentence precluding punitive damages.  See Blisset, 940 F. Supp. at 457.  To quote 
Judge Engelmayer, it would be “problematic for [Plaintiff] to cherrypick within that provision, 
invoking the part that authorizes a personal injury suit against an executor while disclaiming the 
balance, which delimits the recovery available in such a suit.”  Doe, 2020 WL 2036707, at *6 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2020) (citing Blisset, 940 F. Supp. at 457).9
Third, Judge Engelmayer ruled that the choice-of-law debate (i.e., New York law vs. USVI 
law) is “academic.”  Id. at  *7.  “That is because, while the USVI does not have a statute on point 
and USVI courts have not squarely resolved the issue, it is likely that USVI common law would 
not permit an award of punitive damages against an estate.”  Id.  See also Doe 15, 2020 WL 
2086194 *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2020) (“Doe does not have any stronger argument than did Mary 
Doe that USVI law applies … or, if it did, that it would permit such damages”).
Like the plaintiffs in Mary Doe and Doe 15, Plaintiff also erroneously relies on Nat’l Jewish Democratic Council v. 
Adelson, No. 18 Civ. 8787 (JPO), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168675, (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2019).  Even under the 
framework of Adelson, the place where a tort occurs has the greater interest in applying its laws and policies on 
punitive damages. Further, and as Judge Engelmayer found, Adelson is inapposite where, as here, the current lawsuit 
“does not build on a prior litigation in, or [is not] based on the law of, the USVI.”  See Mary Doe, 2020 WL 2036707, 
at *7. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF   Document 39   Filed 05/26/20   Page 14 of 16

Plaintiff in this action misapplies the Banks analysis factors, which USVI courts use to 
determine common law.  See Banks v. Int’l Rental & Leasing Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 979 (2011).  As 
Judge Engelmayer found, a proper Banks analysis demonstrates: (Factor 1) “USVI courts have 
repeatedly cited the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 favorably”; (Factor 2) consistent with 
the Restatement, most U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an award of punitive damages against a 
tortfeasor’s estate; and (Factor 3) USVI courts appear comfortable with the majority rule.  Doe,
2020 WL 2036707, at *8.
Plaintiff’s remaining arguments fail for the same reasons applied by Judge Engelmayer in 
Mary Doe and Jane Doe 15.  Plaintiff argues that, because the USVI Attorney General seeks 
punitive damages against the Estate in an unrelated civil racketeering lawsuit, punitive damages 
are allowed under USVI law. (Opp. at 22, n.9.) “But the decision by a government lawyer to 
attempt to obtain such damages in a high-profile case involving allegations of extreme conduct . . 
. do not speak to the question that the third Banks factor assays: which rule of law best durably 
servers the USVI’s interests.”  Doe v. Indyke, 2020 WL 2036707, at *8.   
Separately, Plaintiff’s reliance on Crabtree ex rel. Kemp v. Estate of Crabtree, 837 N.E.2d 
135, 139 (Ind. 2005), is misplaced.  The court in that action held “Indiana law does not permit 
recovery of punitive damages from the estate of a deceased tortfeasor.” 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated above and in their moving brief (ECF No. 24), the Co-Executors 
respectfully request that the Court grant their motion to dismiss, together with such other and 
further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

THE COURT:  This is Judge Freeman.  We might have a
court reporter, but I'm going to record this call anyway, so
hold on while I set that up.
All right.  So this is Judge Freeman, and this is a 
conference in four of the cases against the Jeffrey Epstein 
estate:  Farmer v. Indyke, 19 Civ. 10475; Helm v. Indyke, 
Civ. 10476; Bryant v. Indyke, 19 Civ. 10479; and Doe 1000 v. 
Indyke, 19 Civ. 10577.   
If you are here for some other case or you think I got 
those numbers wrong, please make sure I know about it.   
But I'm going to ask for your appearances.  We have 
quite a number of people on the line.  Let me have the 
appearance first by plaintiff's counsel in these cases. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  Good morning.  This
is Sigrid McCawley from the law firm of Boies, Schiller &
Flexner, and I'm representing the plaintiffs in the actions
that you listed.  Along with me, I have my colleague Sabina
Mariella and Andrew Villacastin.  We also have a few of our
summer associates who have joined the line as well.
THE COURT:  All right.
Do I have a court reporter on the line? 
THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes.  Good morning, Judge.  This
is Kristen Carannante.
THE COURT:  I'm going to ask anyone who is giving
appearances for the record to please spell your name.  So,

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
Ms. McCawley, if you could please spell your name and the names
of your colleagues.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course.  Sigrid McCawley, which is
spelled S-I-G-R-I-D, and the last name is McCawley,
M-c-C-A-W-L-E-Y.  I also have with me Sabina Mariella, which is
S-A-B-I-N-A M-A-R-I-E-L-L-A and Andrew Villacastin, and that's
A-N-D-R-E-W and Villacastin is V-I-L-L-A-C-A-S-T-I-N.  
THE COURT:  You are counsel in all of the cases that
are on for today?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Correct.  Correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Can I have defendants' counsel, please?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Hi, your Honor.  Again, this is Bennet
Moskowitz, B-E-N-N-E-T, last name M-O-S-K-O-W-I-T-Z, at
Troutman Sanders, for the co-executors in each of these cases.
My colleagues who handle the day-to-day discovery, 
Matthew Aaronson and Valerie Sirota, are on.  That's Matthew is 
M-A-T-T-H-E-W, last name is Aaronson, A-A-R-O-N-S-O-N; and 
Valerie, V-A-L-E-R-I-E, last name Sirota, S-I-R-O-T-A, and we 
are counsel for the co-executors in each of these cases. 
THE COURT:  All right.
Do I have any other attorneys who are on or 
representing plaintiffs in any of the other cases that are 
pending before the court?  No.  All right. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor --
THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. MENNINGER:  Sorry.  This is a defendant's counsel
for Ms. Maxwell, Laura Menninger.
THE COURT:  Oh, yes.
MS. MENNINGER:  I am in the 10475 case.
THE COURT:  Can you spell your name, please?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes.  It is L-A-U-R-A
M-E-N-N-I-N-G-E-R.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And, again, are there any other
attorneys on the line in any of the cases?
All right.  I'm going to assume, then, that anyone 
else on the phone is public or press and just ask you to please 
keep your lines muted.   
Sometimes on these calls we hear beeps which suggest 
that someone else may have joined in the call.  It can also 
suggest that someone may have dropped off the call.  And 
because of that, I will probably interrupt anyone who is 
speaking just to try to make sure that we didn't lose anybody 
or we didn't gain anyone we should know about.  It is not a 
courtroom where I can see people coming and going, so I just 
like to make sure we didn't accidentally lose one of the 
counsel who is supposed to be present.  And I apologize in 
advance for the interruptions. 
Do I have Hanna Martin on?
MS. MARTIN:  Yes, Judge, I'm here.
THE COURT:  Okay.  That's one of my law clerks, just
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 5 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
so you know.
All right.  So I have letters in these cases.  They
have come in clusters of letter and response and reply in the
three cases where Ms. Maxwell is not a party, and then there
are letters relating to her in the case where she is a party.
Let me start with the other cases where she is not the
party and deal with those letters first.  
Can I have, from Ms. McCawley, just a status update 
from you where things stand with your current request, with 
your understanding about potential settlements? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
So with respect to the requests, we have presented to 
the court a main threshold issue which has been unresolved at 
this point by the parties, and that is the issue of the time 
period within which the defendants, the estate, will produce 
documents.  That issue remains unresolved.   
It is the plaintiffs' position that documents for the 
entire relevant time period for each plaintiff, which runs from 
the date of their abuse, that year, to the present, are 
responsive and relevant to discovery in the case.  That goes to 
the evidence with respect to any of the conduct that Epstein 
was engaging in over those years that would prove the abuse, 
not simply, as in a car crash case, you don't just get the 
evidence of the date of the car crash, you get all evidence 
relating to anything that's relevant and could be used 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 6 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
potentially at trial.  Similarly, here, the defendants have 
attempted to limit the production to simply the year of the 
abuse or years of the abuse, if it happened in more than one 
year.  It is our position that all evidence relating to the 
over 20-year span of Epstein's abuse of not only our clients 
but other clients that are similarly situated, other women that 
are similarly situated, is highly relevant to the discovery in 
this matter.   
And of course, as your Honor knows, the plaintiff has 
the burden of proving her case in each of these instances, and 
the estate has taken the position of attempting to prove 
Epstein's innocence, therefore making all of this information 
highly relevant for the entire time period.   
This is similar to other cases that have come before 
in the Southern District of New York.  For example, Judge 
Sweet, in his case with one of the victims, allowed discovery 
for the entire time period from 2000 to the present; and that 
is, again, because, under 415, evidence of other abuse can be 
admissible at trial.  So we believe that the entire time period 
is highly relevant, and those documents need to be produced. 
The status of this, as of the date of filing our
letters, no documents have been produced.  In the last couple
of days, in Ms. Helm's case and in the Jane Doe 1000 case,
there has been one document produced by the defendants.  In the
case of Annie Farmer there have been three documents produced,
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 7 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
one of which was clawed back.  And in the case of Juliette
Bryant, there have been 90 documents produced, and that is on
their side.
So we are still in a position where we have not
received any substantial document production in this case.  The
court will remember that, back on January 28 -- the cases were
filed in November.  Back on January 28 we sent -- after your
hearing that you had in December asking them to preserve
documents, we sent a document preservation letter that outlined
in very specific detail the e-mail accounts for which we were
aware of that Mr. Epstein had utilized.
You are going to hear today, and you saw in the 
filings from the defendant about their claims of burdens, they 
have not justified burden at this point.  They have thrown 
around a number of 700,000 documents.  I will tell you that we 
have already gone through 600,000 documents in just Annie's 
case alone for our production.  They have not produced a hit 
list to show burden or otherwise establish why our request 
would be so burdensome.   
So with respect to -- and that is only -- now, they 
are only still responding to the time period that is the one- 
or two-year window, depending on the particular plaintiff.  So 
at this stage we do not have -- that is still the threshold 
issue that we are asking this court to resolve.  We need that 
issue resolved before we can undertake depositions or get this 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 8 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
case moving, because we at this point have no documents of any 
substance from the other side.  So that is the key issue that 
we have put before the court for resolution.   
They have produced supplemental interrogatory 
responses.  Again, those are still limited to the time period 
that they have set forth.  They have not agreed to produce 
information for the entire time period at this point.   
So that is the key issue that we put before the court 
that we need resolution on it in order to be able to move these 
cases forward at this point.   
THE COURT:  All right.  Before I ask some questions
about that, let me just ask about potential for settlement of
these cases.  What is plaintiffs' understanding?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Potential for settlement in these
cases, as your Honor knows, there was the proposal of a
potential claims administration program that came about in the
fall of this past year.  That program has been through a series
of back-and-forth between the U.S. Virgin Islands' A.G. and the
estate, with input from the various plaintiffs' attorneys, as
well.  The program has not yet been approved.  It has made
headway, but it has not yet been approved to move forward.
There are still issues with respect to a release and other
matters, so that has not gotten off the ground at all.  So
there have been no substantive settlement discussions of any
kind in these cases.
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 9 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
And, again, if --
THE COURT:  If the program --
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.
THE COURT:  If the program gets off the ground, the
program as you understand it to be fashioned, would these
plaintiffs be likely to participate in it?
MS. McCAWLEY:  We would still have to have those final
conversations with the clients pending what the final outcome
of the program is, but they have all been interested in trying
to participate in a program if it does go forward.
Our concern, of course, is that that program has been 
delayed and has not moved forward, so we have had the need to 
press  forward with our case.  Of course, in that program, too, 
any offer that could be made could be very substandard, where 
our clients would want to proceed with the merits of their 
action, which is why we are here before the court trying to 
seek resolution of our clients' claims, because there is no 
guarantee with respect to that program whatsoever.  So we are 
in a position where we need to and want to move forward with 
discovery without further delay to be able to get to the merits 
of our clients' claims.   
Any discovery they would receive in these matters 
would be relevant anyway to those discussions with our 
presenting claims to the claims administrator.  So we see that 
as coinciding and being relevant and responsive to Epstein 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 10 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
being able to establish our claim, again, before the claims 
administrator. 
THE COURT:  All right.  And going back to your request
to compel discovery from defendant, you say that the time frame
is the issue.  I believe the letter was presented, it appeared
to say in general you hadn't gotten discovery responses to
document requests or interrogatories, and then you highlighted
this issue.  Is this really the key issue or the only issue or
are there other issues with respect to just not getting
responses?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, you are correct, your Honor.  At
the time we wrote the initial letter, the responses were --
there were not responses, there were just objections.  They
have since supplemented their responses but, again, limiting it
only to the time frame.  So we still may have issues with those
responses, because at this point we only can see them as to the
time period within which they are saying the abuse victims --
that time period where they were abused, so we don't believe
that they are fulsome at this point.  But if the court could
resolve the threshold issue of whether or not they have to
produce for the entire time period, they would then supplement,
or our assumption is that they would supplement their responses
both to interrogatories and to the requests for production, and
then we could evaluate at that point if it appears there is
anything missing.
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 11 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
THE COURT:  And why would it not be the case that,
document request by document request or interrogatory by
interrogatory, the inquiry might be different as to what time
frame would be appropriate to look at?  There might be some,
depending upon how the request is framed, where it would be
appropriate to look at a longer time frame; and there may be
some, based on the nature of the request, where that would not
make sense to look at a longer time frame.  Why should I be
doing this on a global basis?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, that's a very fair question, your
Honor.  So the requests, for example, seek information
related -- like the request number one is information related
to the plaintiff including diary, diaries, journals, calendars,
any information, travel itineraries that relate to that
plaintiff, and that could be in any time period.  For example,
if Epstein's last year was talking about one of our client's
and had information that he had recorded in an e-mail about one
of our clients, that would be responsive.
So the time period does pertain, in my view, to all of
the requests.  We have not -- they have not come to us and said
a particular request only applies for these reasons to one
particular year.  In my view, the request, for example, for
flight logs, if there are not flight logs in a certain year,
they would only produce what they have, obviously.  But if they
have flight logs for the entire time period, we would want
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 12 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
those.  So it is -- your Honor is correct that there can be
some request-specific issues, but they haven't agreed to
produce anything outside of the year of the abuse at this
point.
THE COURT:  Are there some requests that relate to
people other than your clients?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.
THE COURT:  Other than --
MS. McCAWLEY:  For example -- yes.
So as I said before, it is our position that, with 
respect to our clients' claims in each of the cases, 
information relating to Epstein's abuse of other victims is 
highly relevant under 415, particularly to establish that this 
pattern of luring in young girls in the same way, for example, 
with saying they are interviewing for a modeling job or saying 
they are coming for an assistant's interview, the pattern of 
how he lured girls in, then abused them is relevant to our 
clients presenting their claims to the jury to prove the truth 
of the fact that they have before, as well, abused in a similar 
manner.  So we firmly believe that that information is highly 
relevant to the case.   
Again, the estate has taken the position, and you have 
seen it in our filings, that Epstein is innocent, and we have 
to prove the truth of that, as well as with respect to all of 
these cases.  So we are in a position where we are having to

fight to get discovery from the estate.  I would was certainly 
hoping it would not be this kind of a battle.  I was hoping 
that now that he is no longer taking his Fifth Amendment 
privileges, no longer with us, that we would be able to get 
substantive discovery in a more streamlined manner, but that is 
not the case.   
And any threshold issue is very important because it 
implicates our clients' ability to be able to present their 
case and to be able to substantively be able to depose witness.  
As your Honor knows our discovery deadline is looming in early 
July.  We need to be able to take the depositions of various 
people who either interacted with our clients or who were 
witnesses to the abuses that occurred in Epstein's various 
homes, and we need the information and the documents from his 
files that establish and relate to the abuse, and those are the 
requests that we have put forward. 
THE COURT:  All right.  I have some thoughts on this,
but let me hear from defendants first.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Hi, your Honor.  Bennet Moskowitz.
If I may, I would like to address the program issue
first, which I think is much quicker than the discovery.  My
colleague, Matt Aaronson, will discuss the discovery issues, if
that's okay.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MS. McCAWLEY:  So I am very, very surprised to hear
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 14 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

K5m2FarC                  
Ms. McCawley give a presentation that seems like her clients
are lukewarm on the program.  She is on the e-mails from this
week where Brad Edwards, who represents five plaintiffs and we
understand the vast majority of claimants all of whom want to
participate in the program according to him, announced to us on
the estate side that he was able to get the Attorney General to
finally step aside and let the program move forward.  So my
first surprise is hearing that Ms. McCawley thinks that the
program is still in some vast limbo.  It is not for all of the
reasons that I discussed this morning, which Ms. McCawley is
aware of.
THE COURT:  Hold on a second.  We have two separate
conferences.  One was at 10:00 and this one is 11:00.  So when
you say that we discussed this morning, Ms. McCawley, unless
she didn't announce herself, was not on that call and doesn't
know what you said at that conference.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.
MS. McCAWLEY:  (Inaudible).
THE COURT:  I'm sorry?
MS. McCAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  This is Sigrid McCawley.  
I was unaware of the 10:00 conference call.  I'm 
sorry. 
THE COURT:  We had a conference call in certain of the
other cases with different plaintiffs' counsel where there were
somewhat different issues raised.

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.  And I am trying --
THE COURT:  I'm trying to cluster these so we don't
have to have a marathon session with all cases at once.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I am happy to concisely, as best I
can, go through the same points, and I will say now that I know
Ms. McCawley knows all of the following with perhaps one
exception, which I will explain.
Ms. McCawley knows that around 69 individual 
claimants, including her clients, have publicly come forward to 
voice overwhelming support for the program, including to the 
USVI probate court.  We know that is the vast majority of known 
claimants.  We are aware of only one claimant who is a state 
court plaintiff who has publicly said that she is not 
participating, and that was through her counsel, and I don't 
even know if that's that person's current position.   
Ms. McCawley also knows that seven plaintiffs in the 
SDNY action, including one of her clients, Maria Farmer, most 
recently stayed their actions in favor of the program.  It 
bears mentioning that Maria Farmer's -- you know, the 
stipulation in that regard goes contrary to everything 
Ms. McCawley just said.   
Your Honor entered that order, so I don't think I need 
to repeat it verbatim.  But mentioned in there was the notion 
of conserving resources, and in that regard, as a side note, it 
bears mentioning that Boies Schiller has been the biggest 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 16 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
culprit in driving up the estate's litigation cost, money that 
will never be available for their clients or other alleged 
victims in the program.  We don't understand that.  We were 
staffed very leanly until recently, just me and an associate.  
Five attorneys on their side, including three partners.  I have 
lawyers, my colleagues are on now for the team more recently, 
because Boies Schiller takes the most unreasonable positions on 
discovery, grossly overbroad view -- again, Mr. Aaronson will 
get to that -- and they make the most constant threat to motion 
practice notwithstanding their clients participating in the 
program.  
Ms. McCawley also knows that the protocol for the
program, which was done in close consultation between the
administrator and designers and claimants' counsel, including
hers, her firm, and with -- in between co-executors is nearly
finalized.  
And Ms. McCawley also knows the only reason this 
hasn't gone forward until now was because of the USVI Attorney 
General.  But again, Mr. Edwards announced a couple of days ago 
in an email that Ms. McCawley is on that that last, quote, 
lingering issue, as Mr. Edwards put it, is now resolved.  And, 
again, there are a few less contentious matters to iron out, 
but it is our firm expectation that by sometime next week that 
resolution in principle will be formalized.   
The sole thing that Ms. McCawley may not be aware of 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 17 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
is that if something unexpected happens and that resolution in 
principle is not finalized, then by June 15, our current intent 
on the estate side is to move forward with the program absent 
the probate court entering an order directing us not to or 
otherwise impeding that, and I don't think that's going to 
happen because another person who has voiced support for the 
program is the probate judge who, on February 4, at a hearing 
that Ms. McCawley attended, as did David Boies, the probate 
judge said the following:  "I think we agreed that everybody 
believes this program is a great program."   
So I will say that I don't understand why we get one 
display of overwhelming support from Boies Schiller and others 
when we are not before your Honor, and then we come before your 
Honor and I hear a different story.  The program is going to go 
forward very soon.  I am confident of that.  And I'm confident 
that, per Ms. McCawley's own statements, all of her clients, 
not just the one who stayed her action already, are going to 
participate.  So, again, every dollar we are spending in the 
meantime is money that will never be available for that 
program.   
That's all I have to say on the program aspect.  
Unless your Honor has questions, I will refer to my colleague, 
Mr. Aaronson, to address the discovery issues. 
THE COURT:  Let me hear the discovery issues.
MR. AARONSON:  Good morning, your Honor.  Matthew

K5m2FarC                  
Aaronson.
I want to correct a couple of misstatements that 
Ms. McCawley made.   
It is not the estate's position that documents that 
relate to the claims asserted by the plaintiffs will not be 
produced.  In fact, all of our discovery responses have 
identified that to the extent the request seeks information 
about plaintiffs, they will be produced.   
We also identified to your Honor in the letter that we 
sent to you -- 
THE COURT:  Hold on.  Let me interrupt you.  Without
regard to time frame or only within a specific time frame?
MR. AARONSON:  I was about to clarify that.  We said
in our letter to your Honor without regard to time frame with
respect to the plaintiffs.  And in fact, that is something
that, your Honor, the problem we have here is, we were still
under the impression we were meeting and conferring with
plaintiffs' counsel on these issues, and we put that in our
letter.  And before we could even -- you know, we told them we
would consider their positions, and before we could even
conclude that, they filed a letter with the court.  I think you
are aware, our initial letter to the court said that we were
sort of surprised by that and we are saying it is premature.
We still think these issues are premature.  
But the simple fact is, your Honor, our position is we 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 19 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
are producing any documents that reference orally to the 
plaintiffs.  And in fact we have searched documents for that.  
So there is no dispute there, there is no issue there.   
We are not saying that the time period for documents 
relating to plaintiff is limited in that way, shape, or form.  
What we did say was, these are events in some situations, 
Theresa Helm, incidents that happened on one day in 2002, and 
we are saying it is not proportional to ask for our client, the 
estate, to search for documents relating to a 20 -- I guess it 
would be a 19-year period, your Honor, relating to people who 
may have worked at a property that Mr. Epstein owned and in 
fact property that Mr. Epstein -- Ms. Helm doesn't allege she 
ever visited.  You know, it's a scope issue.   
But, again, to the extent there is an allegation that 
Ms. Helm -- I'm sorry, there is a document that references 
Ms. Helm, we have agreed to produce it.  We searched for those 
documents.  And the same applies for all of the plaintiffs.   
So I want to make it very clear that that is a 
misstatement of what our position is. 
You know, again, the scope here is just so overbroad,
beyond plaintiff, that we think it is not proportional to the
case.  We disagree completely with Ms. McCawley's statement
that any of that discovery is necessary for her to prove her
claims.  Her claims in this case are a simple claim of battery.
That's the claim in this case.  That's her burden to prove and
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 20 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
that is it.  And we have agreed to provide documents that
relate to her claims.  If she says she was at a property on a
certain date, we have identified to the best of our ability
people who may have been at that property that date.
You know, I'm not sure what more we are obligated to 
do, your Honor.  And this is a part of the problem.  If they 
have complaints about search terms, then meet with us to talk 
about search terms.  Before we could finish the process, they 
ran into court.  We are open to a dialogue.  We have always 
been open to a dialogue to try to resolve these issues.  But, 
as we told you, they prematurely went to court to try to -- you 
know, to try to get in front of your Honor before we could even 
finish that. 
We have a lot of requests, your Honor, that are just
completely unrelated to these cases.  I don't think it's
appropriate now to go through each one right now.  But I just
wanted to clarify that this concept that it is a -- we are not
agreeing to produce documents about the plaintiffs is wholly
untrue, and I just wanted to make that very clear.
THE COURT:  Okay.  So let me go back on plaintiffs'
side.  I'm not going to make any blanket ruling, and I'm not
persuaded that you have conferred fully in good faith before
bringing the motion, in part, because you have already said
that some of it is moot because in fact when you got responses,
you no longer had a complete absence of information, and now
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 21 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
you are really just focused on the time frame issue.  That
tells me that when you wrote the initial letter you hadn't
conferred fully in good faith to see what really had to be put
before the court.
With respect to the time frame issue, it sounds like 
defendant is prepared to and planning to produce documents 
without regard to time frame that refer to your clients or 
relate to your clients, and it also sounds like defendants are 
willing to confer with respect to other requests.   
As far as those other requests go, the test for 
relevance is not whether something is relevant to a general 
subject matter of a case, it's whether it is relevant to a 
claim or defense asserted in the case.  It may be with respect 
to some of the requests where time frame is at issue that the 
documents sought are in fact highly relevant to a defense 
that's been asserted in the case, for example.  It may be that 
they are tangentially relevant.  It may be the burden is great.  
It may be the burden is modest.  It may be that -- let me just 
make sure I didn't lose counsel.   
Do I still have plaintiffs' counsel? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Do I still have defendants' counsel?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  If anyone joined from the public or
press, I will please ask you to mute your phone.
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 22 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
Did anyone join who is an attorney in one of the cases
in front of me?  No.  All right.
I lost the thread a little bit of what I was saying, 
but the point is that if this is in front of me with 
particularized disputes, I'm going to have to look at each 
document request at issue or each interrogatory at issue, hear 
from the parties about the particular relevance to a claim or a 
defense, hear from the defendant about the particular arguable 
lack of relevance or burden, and make item-by-item 
determinations.  I'm not going to do it in a blanket fashion, 
and you are going to have to confer on that kind of level to 
get it focused for me, if it comes back to me, so that I 
understand just what the documents are that are being sought, 
just what the claim of relevance is, just what the purported 
burden is, just what the proportionality is so that I can make 
that assessment balancing relevant factors. 
Now, the other issue that we have is resources and
settlement and whether the dollars that are spent by 
defendants in litigating the case and responding to discovery
requests might be better spent by being put into a fund if
plaintiffs are planning to participate in that and whether it
is a consideration that I should take into account, whether we
should have any kind of extended period of time for the
responses so that you can see if you are going to participate
in the program if the kinks are worked out.
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 23 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
In the earlier conference we had today, what I did was 
allow the parties to have a bit of a hiatus in their cases, to 
conserve resources, asking for a status letter by June 19 with 
the understanding that the estate was planning to move forward 
with the program no later than June 15 absent something they 
thought would be extraordinary to stop it from doing so. 
So on plaintiffs' side, let me hear whether you think
it makes sense to give it a window of time before there is
increased attorney's fees spent to see if in fact that program
is moving forward and you might be participating in it.
And in any event, let me hear what you have to say 
about my view that perhaps you should be conferring further in 
good faith about these time frame issues on a 
request-by-request basis. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course, your Honor.  This is Sigrid
McCawley for the plaintiff.
With respect to the issue of a hiatus, my concern
there would be that we, as you know, back in November, talked
about this program, and while Mr. Moskowitz has made
representations on this call, you will understand that those
were the same representations that he was making back in
December and January and, for a number of reasons, that program
has just not moved forward.  Now I'm hearing for the first time
this June 15 date that I have not heard before.
The problem I see with any kind of hiatus -- and, to 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 24 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
be clear, we don't want to, of course, expend unnecessary 
estate resources.  The issue that I have with that is it is the 
continued delay and the part of the disadvantage to my clients 
in that they don't have information, all of the information 
they need relevant to their claims because they haven't 
received -- even though we have tried diligently, they have not 
received substantial production in the case of any kind.   
So with respect to a hiatus, my concern would be that 
right now our discovery deadline is set for early July.  We 
were hoping to get documents in order to be able to start 
taking some of the necessary depositions to get information for 
our case to be able to move it forward, and I believe that is 
something that we would be entitled to.  I think that my 
concern is that, again, it would be a July 15 date, then it 
would be -- I'm sorry, a June 15 date, then a July 15 date, and 
it would continue without us being able to move the case 
forward.   
Also, as you know, the claims program is voluntary.  
So to the extent that a client does participate in that and 
gets paused, we don't know what that claims administration 
program is going to ultimately prove to be.  So to the extent 
that a client participates and is offered something or not 
offered anything, their case should be moving forward so that 
they are able to go to trial on the merits of their claims, if 
they need to, against the estate.  So that would be my concern 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 25 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
with making any change at this point.   
Again, we are not -- the discovery, in my view, has 
moved very, very slowly.  So just to pull back and not have 
them continue to engage with us on discovery, in my view, would 
be problematic, because it would just further delay the case.   
So those are my concerns generally with respect to 
that.   
And, again, I'm hearing from the other side this June 
date that I have no confidence that that is something that 
will necessarily move forward because we don't have anything in 
writing with respect to that or any statement from the court in 
the USVI that they have approved that or anything of that 
nature.  So that was my concern there. 
With respect to the issue before the court, we are in
a position where the time frame issue is significantly
problematic to us for the reasons that I have outlined.  While
they are representing to the court today that they will produce
documents related to the plaintiff, you will remember that we
have --
THE COURT:  What did they say in their responses that
you got in?  Did they say these documents will be produced or
is it just they are saying this for the first time to the court
today?
MS. McCAWLEY:  With respect to the plaintiff, they
represented they would run the name of the plaintiff in their
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 26 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
discovery searches and produce with respect to the plaintiff,
yes, that they did.  
THE COURT:  Why -- 
MS.McCAWLEY:  But the problem --
THE COURT:  Why did you tell me earlier on in the call
that they were refusing to produce any documents for the later
time frame even with regard to the plaintiff?
MS.McCAWLEY:  That is my understanding of their
position, your Honor.  I am hearing now that they are saying --
well, first of all, they have only produced one document for
Theresa Helm's case, one document for Jane Doe's case.
THE COURT:  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  This is
complete lack of meaningful dialogue between the parties,
because I'm hearing opposite things from the parties about what
defendants' position is.  Defendant, as I understand it from
this call, has said that they will, and have told you that they
will, produce documents regardless of time frame if they refer
or relate to the plaintiff, and that they are doing that in
fact in all cases and have not taken a position that they would
not.  And you are saying that is your understanding of their
position, that they will not.
How can that be if you have had a good conference 
between you? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, as we set forth in our
letter, we did have a two-hour conference where we asked them
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 27 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
about the time frame issues and made sure to get the full
position on that because that was our biggest concern.  And
that is what we discretely presented to the court because that
was the concern we have, that they were not going to be
producing anything beyond the time period of the abuse.
(Indiscernible crosstalk) 
THE COURT:  -- discretely presented to the court.  You
presented to the court in your opening letter that there was a
complete failure to respond to any of the requests, and now you
tell me on the call that since then there has been a response,
and so what is now being discretely presented on this telephone
call is what you say is a remaining issue, which seems like it
is only a remaining issue in part because it seemed like if
there are documents specifically relating or referring to the
plaintiff, defendants have agreed to produce it and according
to defendants have told you they have agreed to produce it in
their responses that you have since gotten.  Now, I haven't
seen those responses.  If they have been put before me, I'm
sorry, I have not reviewed them.  I don't think I have them.
For that matter, I'm not sure I have all of the requests, I'm
not sure I have an item-by-item explanation of relevance, and
I'm not sure that your discussion has been adequate between the
lawyers.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley for
the plaintiff.

K5m2FarC                  
I appreciate that.  I am hearing your Honor.  We will 
go back and address these issues again with the defendants in 
the hopes of being able to resolve them and not hopefully have 
to come before the court with respect to them.  We are, again, 
hopeful to be able to get discovery in this case.  We do not 
believe that has been the situation that we are in presently, 
and that's why we have presented it to the court.  But I 
understand your point, your Honor, and we will make sure to 
engage further in the hopes of being able to resolve this. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Let me ask, on defendants'
side, by when do you plan to produce -- assuming we have no
stay of discovery here and no hiatus, by when do you plan to
produce the documents referring or relating to plaintiff?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We have already started that, your
Honor.  Bennet Moskowitz, excuse me.  And in fact, I apologize.
Let me let Mr. Aaronson address that question.  And then, if I
can, I would like to just very quickly respond to something
Ms. McCawley said about the program.
THE COURT:  Let me hear first about the documents -- 
MR. AARONSON:  Yes -- 
THE COURT:  -- regarding the production.
MR. AARONSON:  Yes, your Honor.  Matthew Aaronson.  
We have already started the production.  We made a 
production I believe on Wednesday of documents, and I think in 
particular Ms. Bryant it was over 100 documents.

So with the process underway -- and, again, I think, 
your Honor, you have gotten this correct, is that we have told 
them that we will produce and search for -- search for and 
produce documents that relate to their clients.  To the extent 
that they think we need to add additional search terms, we 
searched the individual plaintiffs' names.  If there are 
additional search terms, we are open to a dialogue to discuss 
that.  If there are additional terms, as in every case, whether 
or not we can reach agreements on those terms.  You know, the 
thing -- 
THE COURT:  I would like to put a deadline on getting
the production complete with respect to any documents that in
any way refer or relate to the plaintiffs after you have had
some further discussion perhaps on search terms, if necessary.
But I would like to have a firm date when you are not just
producing a few documents and a few documents and say it is
underway, that that actually gets produced.  Once -- 
MR. AARONSON:  That's fair, your Honor.  Part of that
goes back to the same issue you raised earlier about the
expenditure of time and money on discovery issues versus
putting it towards the program.  
So to the extent the court is not inclined to issue a 
pause or some sort of temporary issue on that, it's hard to 
say.  The problem we have is that, you know, it is difficult to 
search all of our files, given the pandemic.  Some files have 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 30 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
not been able to be collected yet.  So I can tell you that, of 
the electronic documents that we have collected, I think we can 
keep that probably within 30 days of what we have collected 
already.   
But I will tell you, we have done the initial pass of 
that, and we have made those productions.  As I said, Juliette 
Bryant there was a significant number of documents.  Presumably 
other plaintiffs there were not.  So, again, we do believe that 
it would be appropriate (unintelligible) some of this, but to 
the extent the court is not inclined to do that, you know, I 
think 30 days for what we have.  But to be clear, your Honor, I 
don't know that we have collected every, you know, source at 
this point in time, given our inability to collect documents 
dues to the pandemic. 
THE COURT:  How has the pandemic affected your ability
to collect documents specifically?
MR. AARONSON:  I will let Mr. Moskowitz speak to that,
but my understanding is, you know, that we have not been able
to access and people are not traveling to different locations.
So we have collected electronic documents.  I'm not -- again,
I'm deferring to Mr. Moskowitz on that, whether or not the
additional documents are still out there.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  Bennet Moskowitz.  Happy to
clarify that point, your Honor.
There are two -- let me take a step back.  Yes.  It is 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 31 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
true that we have collected over 700 and I think 40,000 
documents, and we did search them for the plaintiffs' names.  
And we did produce what we found that wasn't privileged, and we 
will go back and make sure that that is complete.  But the fact 
that we located many documents for Juliette Bryant, which were 
dated to as late as I believe last year and have already been 
produced, so I don't understand Ms. McCawley's confusion about 
the time frame issue.  But in any event, the fact that we found 
those but didn't find such documents for the other cases just 
evidences a lack of documents, not something wrong with the 
search process.   
In terms of the pandemic difficulties, my problem with 
making a 30-day blanket representation is that there are at 
least some hard copy files that I would like certain people to 
look through, and while I have no reason one way or the other 
to expect their responsive materials are there, I would like 
that to happen before such deadline, and I'm not 100 percent 
certain that it can, because at least some of the documents are 
in places that are still under lockdown or there are still 
health concerns.   
In addition to that, this is somewhat subject to the 
disputes about the scope of the discovery.  If Ms. McCawley is, 
let's say, correct and these cases -- everything related to any 
allegedly bad thing Mr. Epstein ever did is relevant in each 
action, well, then, it could take me, you know, six months or a 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 32 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
year to finish looking for every piece of paper and every 
property Mr. Epstein owned.  So, again, it's with the context 
of just searching for names.  Mr. Aaronson is correct, that can 
be done in the next 30 days, with the exception of anything 
that we can't actually access to look through.   
And again I have -- 
THE COURT:  You have already --
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.
THE COURT:  You already have the documents
electronically, at least certain of the documents, most of the
documents.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.
THE COURT:  And you have already gone through them and
you have already made some production.  Why would you need
another 30 days before you can get to the end of that
particular road?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We may not.  It really depends on the
rest of the meet-and-confer process which never completed.  It
depends on the search terms that are proposed, whether there
are any additional search terms proposed.  For example, what we
wanted to happen during a full meet-and-confer process, which
is what we strive to do in every case, and what we are actually
doing in other actions against the estate, that Boies Schiller
is not involved with, is suggest search terms to us that you
think would satisfy your view of what a particular request
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 33 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
entails, let us run the report.  If the report comes back and
says 500 documents or even a thousand, we may deem that
reasonable for that request.  If it comes back at 10,000, we
may not deem that reasonable.
So this is part of what an ongoing discussion, I hope, 
would have entailed, which gives me pause to, again, say a 
blanket yes, we will get it all done in 30 days.  As to 
searching for things, I mentioned the plaintiffs in what we 
have already collected, to the extent we didn't complete that, 
you know, we don't need 30 days.  But I don't know that that 
will satisfy Ms. McCawley. 
THE COURT:  Okay.
If this case goes all the way forward in litigation
and goes to trial, you are going to try this case.  You are not
going to try ever case that is before this court or any other
court at the same trial.  That doesn't mean that evidence
regarding others who are claiming to have been victims of
Mr. Epstein might not have relevance to some claim or defenses
being raised, and I understand that it may, in some documents,
may have relevance.  
But you are going to have to get, on plaintiffs' side, 
a lot more focused with what you want and why you want it.  And 
if you are going to come back and make a renewed application to 
me, that application is going to have to be more focused on 
what kind of documents you are talking about, what claim or 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 34 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
defense they are relevant to, why they are relevant to that 
claim or defense, giving me an example of some case law that 
shows how it could be relevant, and I will make a decision on a 
request-by-request basis about what appropriate time frames 
should be used.  And with respect to search terms, in the first 
instance you need to talk to each other about that because you 
don't want the court coming up with search terms or trying to 
make judgment calls on that if it's not necessary.  You know, 
you are much better off trying to figure it out between you, 
getting an agreed protocol, an agreed list of custodians, an 
agreed list of search terms, and then go from there, as 
generally happens in cases where there might be a lot of 
documents that are kept electronically.  So I expect you to go 
through that process as you would in any other case.   
I am open to kicking out your deadlines a bit to give 
you time to talk this through and to see if we can get some 
progress.  I'm going to ask defendants, to the extent you 
already have a known universe of documents, if there are any 
you have not yet produced, get them produced within two weeks.  
If there are additional search terms, you will talk with each 
other in good faith about time frame for running any additional 
searches and getting any additional documents produced.  And if 
plaintiff wanted to come back to me on a renewed motion that's 
more specifically laid out on particular categories of 
documents or responses to interrogatories, you will do that 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 35 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
after you have tried to work these things through with an eye 
toward what is what is reasonable.  Plaintiff may reasonably 
need more than defendants want to give.  Defendants may have a 
reasonable point about conserving resources for the sake of a 
settlement program which should be taken seriously because it 
seems that very serious efforts are underway to try to get that 
program off the ground. 
I'm going to ask for a status letter by June 19, which
is the date that I gave in other cases.  It is geared to
Mr. Moskowitz's representation that this program should launch,
he thinks, by June 15.  So it seems to me by June 19 you will
have a better idea and you will also have a better idea of
where you are with respect to these discovery issues.
I'm going to caution plaintiffs' counsel in the
future, please do not send me something without being sure you
are at the end of the road in talking to your adversary.  I
don't want to get a response that says it is premature, we
haven't really talked.  Make sure you are clear on a
point-by-point basis that you have talked about specific
relevance, that you have talked about specific burden issues,
that you have talked about specific search terms, at least you
have try to engage in that kind of dialogue.  If you are
stymied, you are stymied, and I will hear from you.  But I
don't think you are at that point.
And I think that's it with respect to those disputes,
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 36 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
and I should probably turn to the dispute regarding
Ms. Maxwell.  What I am going to do is I am going to -- I don't
know if the letters were framed as a motion for a conference or
a motion to compel.  If they were framed as a motion for a
conference, I will say granted.  We had a conference.  As to
the underlying issue about compelling, go talk or in if
actually framed as a motion, I will say denied without
prejudice to renew, and I'm going to ask for a status letter by
June 19.  
Anybody want to say anything else on that before I 
turn to Ms. Maxwell's issue? 
No?  Okay.  I'm hearing no, or I am hearing nothing.  
Hopefully I haven't lost everybody on the entire call.  I'm 
hearing laughs, so hopefully that means not. 
Let me turn to Ms. Menninger's issue.  One thing I
want to understand, because there was a reference to a
potential criminal prosecution which of course could impact
whether there should be a stay as to a defendant who is being
criminally prosecuted.  Currently, if I'm understanding
correctly, Ms. Maxwell may be the target of an investigation,
or you may be concerned she is the target of an investigation
but there are no actual criminal charges pending, is that
right?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, that's correct, your Honor.  We
do not have any criminal charges pending anywhere, but we have
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 37 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
a number of public statements by the U.S. Attorney's office in
the Southern District, as well as statements made by
plaintiffs' counsel to the press that suggest that those --
that that investigation is underway and that it would encompass
Ms. Maxwell, and so that is our concern.  But it is correct to
say that there is no active criminal charges that I am aware
of.
THE COURT:  All right.  So if there were active
criminal charges filed or if that should happen, that might
influence the thinking about whether or not there should be a
stay, because of course if a defendant ends up taking the
Fifth, that could have consequences in a civil case and
defendant may feel there is little choice but to do that if the
person is under a criminal indictment or if plaintiffs have
filed.
So I just want to just note that if that circumstance 
change -- if that circumstance changes, let me know.  If it 
affects any ruling I make, let me know, because I may need to 
revisit a ruling. 
Let me hear what -- given the last conference, the
last subject, where there seem to be some changed landscapes
since the application was initially made, let me make sure that
I am aware of the current circumstance.
Let me just hear from Ms. Maxwell's counsel first on 
this. 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 38 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
MS. MENNINGER:  Thank you, your Honor, Ms. Menninger
here on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.
The landscape has not changed since our letters.  We 
have filed a motion to dismiss the claims which we believe are 
distinct and different from any sort of example that the estate 
may have, and we believe that they are strong grounds for 
dismissal.  The case -- the allegations against Ms. Maxwell in 
this case involve an allegation of battery that occurred one 
time in 1996 in New Mexico, and the statute of limitations and 
venue issues, you know, in New York versus New Mexico are very 
different for Maxwell than perhaps for the estate and we think 
provide the grounds for dismissal. 
The other two bases that we raise for a stay are the
claims program that your Honor has already spent some time
discussing on this call and the earlier call today.  We
believe -- we don't have any independent information.  We were
not party to the calls in the Virgin Islands, as were counsel
for plaintiffs and for the estate.  But I have heard on the
call today the representations made by the estate that they
believe that the program will be getting off the ground in a
matter of a few weeks, June 15, or three weeks or so from
today.  
Given that plaintiff has indicated an intent to 
participate in that program, at least in filings in the Virgin 
Islands, and the fact that that program would -- if she 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 39 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
participates and it is successful, would render this entire 
lawsuit moot, we think we believe balancing that fact against 
the extremely broad discovery demands that your Honor has heard 
something about, although not with respect to Ms. Maxwell yet, 
would counsel in favor of at least a short stay similar to the 
ones that other plaintiffs' counsel have agreed to, promoted, 
or even stipulated to in other cases pending before your Honor.   
We have received extensive discovery demands.  We have 
been advised that plaintiffs' counsel intends to take a number 
of depositions, including around the country, including for 
people that plaintiff in our case never met and had no dealings 
with.  And, your Honor, I can speak from personal experience 
with that same type of discovery happening with the same 
plaintiffs' counsel in the Giuffre v. Maxwell action that I was 
counsel for in front of Judge Sweet.  We had a number of 
significant discovery disputes in that case and we had 
depositions that occurred not only across the country, from 
California to New York and Florida and many places in between, 
but also abroad in that case, and the litigation costs were in 
the hundreds of thousands easily in that case.  And so looking 
at the pattern of discovery that I believe plaintiff intends to 
pursue here, balancing the costs of those to someone like my 
client, who is not a multimillionaire, and then viewing the 
claims program as something that could be successful in 
resolving this case in a short period of time, we would ask 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 40 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
your Honor to consider putting a stay on discovery in the 
Farmer case that I am party to, or I am counsel for a party to.   
I think I can second or third some of the things that 
have already been said earlier, so I don't want to waste the 
court's time with those.  But we have concerns that any money 
spent on this litigation is going to reduce the amount of money 
that would be available to any of the accusers in the Virgin 
Islands, and we don't think it makes sense to spend the money 
on these broad discovery requests if we can get the case 
resolved shortly.   
I think the only objection that I heard from 
plaintiffs' counsel to something like a hiatus was that there's 
a pending discovery cutoff of early July, and it seems to me 
reasonable that of course if the claims program gets off the 
ground in a few weeks, that discovery cutoff could be set out 
to see if it is successful or not.  And so it is sort of a 
false premise to say that the discovery cutoff in July is the 
reason we should be forging ahead full steam with this 
expensive discovery, rather than just taking the more logical 
approach, to me, which would be to at least put it on hold to 
see if the claims program is successful in the first instance; 
and, if not, then the cases can proceed with the court's 
blessing, pick back up where we left off.   
In this particular case, I think it also bears noting 
that the claim allegedly occurred in 1996, so it has been some 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 41 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
years since the allegations supposedly happened, and so I 
don't see that waiting one or two or three months balanced 
against 24 years is -- it's not as though we think documents 
will go missing in those three months that weren't already 
somehow lost to the winds of time over the last 24 years, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT:  So you are -- I will just note, by the
way, that in your initial letter you ask for an opportunity to
do full briefing, but it is all laid out in the letters.  So
let me just get some clarification on that.  What more briefing
would you be looking to do beyond what's in these letters?  You
have case citations in these letters and you lay out the bases
for a stay.  What would you be looking to do when you are
trying to conserve resources?  Do you really need full
briefing.
MS. MENNINGER:  I think it could be abbreviated
briefing; but, yes, there are more cases in support of the
request that we are making.  There are more cases in terms of
the criminal investigation versus active prosecution, and then
there is certainly a fair amount of exhibits that I could
tender to your Honor to display the breadth of discovery that
is part of the traditional balancing test when looking at a
motion to stay -- or good cause -- of grounds for good cause as
balanced against the breadth of discovery.
THE COURT:  I don't remember if at the beginning of
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 42 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
this call I asked if my law clerk Hanna Martin was on.  Hanna,
are you there?
MS. MARTIN:  Yes, I'm here, Judge.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, for the court reporter, it is
Hanna Martin, H-A-N-N-A.
And Hanna and I were conferring before this conference
about some case law about some criminal prosecution as opposed
to criminal investigation, and we weren't finding, at least on
an initial look, cases where the courts tended to stay civil
proceedings when there was an investigation proceeding.  You
have cases that say the opposite?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I have some.  They are not
in the Southern District, so there are -- 
THE COURT:  Okay. 
MS. MENNINGER:  -- cases that have occurred in various
federal and state cases across the country.
THE COURT:  And you are looking for a stay of the
entire case, not just as to proceedings against your client?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, it seems to me best to
stay the case, but I would be amenable just in regards to my
client or, as I said towards the end of my letter, there are
other alternatives that, you know, I think I would view as
intermediate steps, for example, bifurcation of discovery on
the statute of limitations issue, for example, if that were
something the court thought were appropriate or a stay on party
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 43 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
depositions until later in the discovery process to see where
the claims program and the criminal investigation end up, and
certainly with regard to the motion to dismiss, that should be,
I would think, decided at some point.
THE COURT:  I might consider, because there is a lot
to do in this case, I might consider putting a hold on
Ms. Maxwell having to make statements, so either responding to
substantive interrogatories or being deposed because of Fifth
Amendment issues, because it may be that she ends up the
subject of prosecution even if she is not yet and because there
are other things that can meanwhile be going forward.  If we
put her deposition further down the pike, maybe we will have
greater clarity on that before that issue actually comes to the
fore.
I'm also thinking that there are other interests 
besides hers in this case.  There are plaintiffs' interests and 
I'm sure that although your point is well taken that it's not 
that likely that documents will now not be preserved within 
these few months as opposed to not being preserved over the 
years, I'm sure plaintiff does not want to hear that after all 
of these years she must wait more time in order to have what 
she considers to be serious wrongs redressed.  So the factors 
can cut in more than one direction. 
So right now I'm not inclined to stay the whole case,
but I am inclined to keep one eye on settlement, to keep one
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 44 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
eye -- I'm not sure how many eyes I have -- to keep an eye on
the -- any criminal investigation and ask to have updates if
there are charges filed, and maybe put some things more at the
front end of the discovery period, some things more at the back
end of the discovery period.  And I am willing to move the
dates out some to accommodate the parties if the parties are
engaged in good-faith discussions, if there is a desire to
conserve resources because it looks like the claims program is
in fact going forward.  I am willing to do that.  I have done
that another cases.  I have stayed other cases.  I have
extended deadlines in other cases.  I don't really want to see
resources going to litigation if it's not necessary.  But right
now I'm not inclined to have a complete stay of everything.
Ms. Menninger, what would be your reaction to saying
hold off on anything that could be in the category of
affirmative statements made by Ms. Maxwell for now and having
other discovery going forward?
MS. MENNINGER:  It does address -- this is
Ms. Menninger, again, Laura Menninger.  
It does address many of my concerns.  I would say, you 
know, the costs related to the broad discovery demands that 
were propounded, written discovery requests and the like, are 
still of concern to me.  As I mentioned, we have been asked for 
every calendar she has had for the last 24 years and every 
Amazon account she has ever used for the last 24 years.  So 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 45 of 57

            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
I -- 
THE COURT:  That sounds to me, again, like you need to
have a discussion with plaintiffs' counsel and, plaintiffs'
counsel, it sounds like you need to have a discussion with
Ms. Menninger about what you really need, why you really need
it, how it can be done in a way that's manageable with no
absolute yeses and no absolute nos with respect to those sorts
of requests.
It may be that there is something about Amazon
accounts that's really critical, and you can explain that.  And
maybe there is something else that's not really critical, and
you can, you know, bend a bit on it.  So you need to have that
kind of discussion to keep, you know -- you know, to keep
discovery tailored to the case and proportionate to the needs
of the case.  That has to do with time frame, that has to do
with the scope of what's being claimed in a particular case,
and to some extent it has to do with Mr. Epstein's accused
conduct over time.  So you are going to have to try to have
that conversation and try to balance it.  And if you can't,
then I will.
MS. MENNINGER:  I appreciate that, your Honor.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is --
THE COURT:  Yes.
MS. McCAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  This is Ms. McCawley.  Can
I address --

THE COURT:  Absolutely.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Please go ahead.
MS. McCAWLEY:  With respect to the motion to stay that
Ms. Maxwell is proposing, one of the bases that she has filed
motion to dismiss, Judge Schofield held a premotion conference
with respect to that --
THE COURT:  Hold on a moment, please.  Do I still
have -- do I still have -- I know I still have Ms. McCawley.
Do I still have Ms. Menninger?
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Do I still have Mr. Moskowitz?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Did anyone join us who is another
attorney?  Okay.  Hopefully we didn't lose anybody.  If anyone
joined from the public or press, welcome.  Please keep your
phone on mute.  
Okay.  Go ahead.  You were saying, Ms. McCawley? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.  So we did hold in front of 
Judge Schofield a premotion conference on Ms. Maxwell's motion
to dismiss.  As Judge Schofield did with the estate, she
discouraged Ms. Maxwell from filing a motion to dismiss, giving
her preliminary views that they -- the arguments that she was
putting forth were not meritorious.  Ms. Maxwell insisted on
filing a motion to dismiss and has done that now, just this
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 47 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
week.  So in my view, that is -- bodes against any sort of stay
based on the motion to dismiss because the district judge has
set forth her views with respect to that at least as an initial
matter.
With respect to the case law, your Honor is correct,
the case law in New York is clear that unless there is an
indictment put forward, which there has not been, it doesn't
allow somebody in a civil case to stay the case on the basis of
a possible investigation.
With respect to your Honor's statements about the
investigation and potentially allowing Ms. Maxwell to not have
to make statements in this civil action, the concern I have
there is that we have no indication of any time frame with
respect to the Southern District of New York, how long that
investigation could go on or will go on or anything of that
nature.  So the concern, for me, is Ms. Maxwell, as we have
alleged, worked in concert with Mr. Epstein to abuse my client.
We brought those claims under the Child Victims Act, as we are
allowed to do, because she was a minor, and to not be able to
get a discovery and ask Ms. Maxwell questions and get responses
and keep the case moving forward puts us in handcuffs with
respect to being able to establish our claims because, as your
Honor has seen from the complaint, the allegations are that
they worked together hand in hand with respect to the abuse of
Annie Farmer.  So I would have concerns about some form of that
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 48 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
kind of a path for defendant Maxwell in the case at this time
until there is a criminal indictment that's put forward.
THE COURT:  All right.  Let me just say a few things
about that.
First of all, if the investigation is going on here in 
New York, or for that matter wherever it may be going on, 
because what we have in New York is not only in New York with 
respect to COVID-19, the grand jury process is understandably 
delayed because it is very difficult to have jurors convene.  
So there may be additional time before any case that is being 
investigated is indicted, and so we just have to recognize that 
we are in somewhat unusual circumstances. 
The second thing is that any stay that I might put in
place with respect to any aspect of the claims against
Ms. Maxwell would be temporary and would be revisited.  I would
not allow it to drag on indefinitely.  But in a case where some
things can be done to move the case forward and the case is not
completely stalled, I don't see any harm in putting some things
a little bit further down the road.
The third thing I will say is this is also an unusual
circumstance because of the potential of this claims process in
which plaintiff may well participate and which may well get off
the ground soon; and, if it does, I'm not sure whether it would
moot claims against Ms. Maxwell or not, but it might.  And as
you balance those factors, you have this situation where we may
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 49 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
know in the relatively near future whether plaintiff is
actively participating in the claims process, whether it looks
like it is going to resolve her claims, and we may never have
to get to the point where we jeopardize, potentially jeopardize
somebody's Fifth Amendment rights.
So I might be inclined to do this, to say, look, you 
can carry on with discovery in the case after a conference on 
all kinds of things, to try to keep costs under control and try 
to focus on what's most important.  I will extend deadlines out 
if you would like if you are feeling pressure from that.  We 
will hold off on -- not on production of documents from 
Ms. Maxwell but on the statements that she makes, whether sworn 
statements or interrogatories or deposition, we will put that a 
little bit further down.  You will give me status report 
regarding the process of settlement, and we will take stock.   
And with respect to holding off on interrogatory 
responses or deposition by Ms. Maxwell, that will not be a 
permanent situation, that will be revisited.  And if time is 
stretching out too far and if there is no indictment, then I 
may take further briefing on the subject and I will make a 
decision as to whether in fact that part of the case should 
also go forward.  But I will not let it drag out indefinitely.  
That is my current thinking. 
What say both of you on that?
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, this is Laura Menninger.
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 50 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
That would be -- we would welcome that ruling, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Plaintiff?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, obviously we disagree with
that because we believe that it's important to have
Ms. Maxwell's participation in this case.  We have noticed her
for a deposition already and that got moved because she -- you
know, the issue of just being able to be in person, things of
that nature.  We were trying to accommodate.  So we are
concerned about there being extended delay and are concerned
about not being able to get information from her through her
testimony.
We respect the court's concerns about a Fifth 
Amendment privilege but, again, we would ask that if you are 
going to be inclined to do something like this, you tie it to a 
date like the June 15 date, or something along those lines, so 
that we are not in a position where she is able to take 
depositions of all of our people and we are, you know, 
handcuffed with respect to any discovery with respect to 
Ms. Maxwell. 
THE COURT:  Like I said, I have no desire to have this
drag out.  If all things -- if we didn't have this potential
claim process out there with a fairly soon, seemingly likely,
start date, according to defendants, then I think the balance
would be different.  Because I don't think the case law in this
circuit would generally support the stay when there is no
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 51 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
prosecution pending yet.
But nonetheless, there are a number of factors one 
might look at on that, and whether or not an indictment is 
pending is only one of the factors.  There are several factors 
that could be relevant, including, and I'm going to refer you 
to the Louis Vuitton Malletier case.  For the court reporter, 
L-O-U-I-S V-U-I-T-T-O-N M-A-L-L-E-T-I-E-R v. Ly, L-Y, U.S.A., 
Inc., and the case number is 676 F.3d 83 from 2011.  So the 
Second Circuit noted that courts often take a look at a number 
of factors in deciding whether there should be a stay, 
including the extent to which the issues in the criminal case 
overlap with those presented in the civil case.  Here, there 
would be, I assume, a very strong overlap to the status of the 
case, including whether the defendants have been indicted.  So 
that's a factor.   
Three, the private interests of the plaintiff in 
proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to 
plaintiffs caused by the delay.  Here I'm looking at the 
potential settlement process and that, to me, is an unusual 
factor that suggests that the plaintiffs' interests may be 
divided here in proceeding fast with this case when there is a 
potential settlement within the next few months potentially 
available to plaintiffs and plaintiff may go for that.   
Another factor is the private interest of and burden 
on the defendants.  We do have an individual here.  We are not 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 52 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
talking about the estate, and there is somewhat more burden for 
discovery.   
There are the interests of the courts.  The interest 
of the court is not to have unnecessary litigation if the 
matters can be resolved amicably, and not to have it stretch 
out forever.  That's also an interest of the court.   
We also have this strange overlay of COVID-19 which 
affects the ability for criminal prosecutors to take matters to 
a grand jury.   
The public interest, I think the public interest is -- 
would be well served by a claims process.  If you look at this 
case in terms of there being a number of claim victims, and 
that is something that I definitely am looking at and is 
weighing into my consideration as to how any and all of these 
cases should be litigated.  And in several of the cases, which 
claims that are no more recent than the claims here, a lot of 
plaintiffs' counsel have agreed to stays or partial stays or 
are holding off on certain things to conserve resources and 
allow that process to play out a bit, and I think that those 
are factors that are unusual in this case.  This is a 
case-by-case, specific analysis that has to be made as to 
whether there should be a stay. 
So in this particular case, at this particular time,
with these particular circumstances, it seems to me to make
sense not to stay the case in its entirety, to send counsel 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 53 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
off to have the kind of good-faith conference you should have
had before contacting me in the first place and that you should
always have about anything and everything as you try to work
through discovery issues, but to hold off on the most serious
of the issues with respect to Ms. Maxwell, which are her
constitutional rights, and not forever, but at least long
enough to let us know whether the claims process is likely to
go forward.  And I will revisit it, and I will revisit it at
intervals that are reasonable and that does not put you in
limbo where you will never be able to get discovery from
Ms. Maxwell if this case proceeds.  All right?
So let me ask straight out, are you, under the 
circumstances I have described and the way in which I would 
envision this, which is some discovery going forward, 
good-faith conference, report to me by June 19 about the 
status, are you looking to have me move out the discovery 
schedules at all and, if so, by how long? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley.  
Would it be possible to have some time to consider 
that?  Right now the discovery deadline is set for July 10, I 
believe, and I of course have anticipated taking depositions 
throughout June and into early July.  So if I could have some 
time to consider what that would look like and confer with the 
other side, then if we can't agree, then maybe present 
something to the court with the timing of that? 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 54 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
THE COURT:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not usually in the
habit of suggesting extensions, but I think here, rather than
be crunched with depositions and panicking at the end of June
and beginning of July, putting another 30 days on it to give
you time to talk through your issues and for me to have fuller
briefing on the issue of a stay, should it come to that, it
might make sense to at least give you another 30.
MS. McCAWLEY:  That would be fine, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Mr. Moskowitz, do you want to say
anything?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Just very quickly, your Honor.  
That 30-day initial extension for the further 
discussion makes perfect sense to us.  I would say you laid 
out -- your Honor laid out very compelling reasons, one of 
which is unique to this action, but the others equally apply to 
the other actions that we are here now before you on, so I 
would hope that we could also discuss with Ms. McCawley keeping 
the extensions in line for each case with those other 
considerations in mind.  It's something we will discuss.   
The only other thing I wanted to mention is -- which I 
didn't get a chance to mention earlier is that Ms. McCawley 
mentioned various concerns about the program.  That could be 
more convincing from someone but for the fact that they already 
stayed one of their clients' actions in favor of the program.  
So I just don't -- it doesn't square with us that those 
Case 1:19-cv-10479-ALC-DCF     Document 40     Filed 06/03/20     Page 55 of 57

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
K5m2FarC                  
concerns are such that they can't take the same reasoned 
approach in the other actions when they found it reasonable for 
one of them already.   
But other than that, I have nothing to add, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So I'm going to ask for a status
report by June 19.  In that status report, I not only want to
hear about how discovery is going and how settlement prospects
are looking.  I also want to hear about further discussions
with counsel for Ms. Maxwell and mapping out of how the parties
would anticipate things moving further from that point, and,
you know, Ms. Maxwell permitting not to respond to
interrogatories and not to have her deposition until the
parties have had a chance to confer, until I have had that
status report June 19, until I hear again from counsel as to
the next logical way to proceed with that, and I will kick out
discovery deadlines 30 days, which is modest.  Others, I think,
are going to be kicked out longer.  You can do whatever
planning you do for depositions to be happening a little
further down the road in July, and you will get back to me.  As
need be, we will have another conference and we will take in
the next piece.  Okay?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Anything else -- 
MS. MENNINGER:  Thank you, your Honor.

K5m2FarC                  
THE COURT:  -- before we end this call?
All right.  Let me just say one last thing, which is, 
I did record this call into the conferencing system, but you 
also have a court reporter on the call.  You don't need to have 
a transcript made from the telephone recording.  And just be 
aware that if there are two transcripts made -- one from AT&T 
and one from the court reporter -- and there is any 
discrepancy, the court reporter's transcript will be the 
official transcript and will control.  Okay? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you all.  Take care,
everybody.

1At the hearing held on February 4, 2020, while the Court did not allow the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands to intervene, the Court did request the Co-Executors and the Attorney General to resolve their differences 
concerning the proposed compensation program. which has garnered the support of all interested parties, including 
claimants' counsel. The Co-Executors now inform that "(b]ecause the need for the Program has grown increasingly 
urgent, and with the support of claimants' counsel and the USVI Attorney General - and because the remaining 
impediments have been resolved and the interested parties have consented to the Protocol."' they and the Attorney 
General have reached an agreement in which the latter will promptly lift previously imposed liens to pay amounts 
owed for the Program and to begin funding the Program's active operations, including payment of compensation 
determinations to eligible claimants. Co-Executors' Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program and 
Presentation of Program Protocol, at 6, June I. 2020.
