psychological expenses. The plaintiff, L.M., has suffered a loss of income, a loss of the 
capacity to earn income in the future, and a loss of the capacity to enjoy life. These 
injuries are permanent in nature and the plaintiff, L.M., will continue to suffer these 
losses in the future.

and proper, and hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.

ELECTRONIC 
STEVEN M. LARIMORE 
CLERK U.S. DIST. CT, 
s. D. OF FLA. • MIAM I

1. At all times material to this cause of action, L.M .. , was a resident of Palm

STATEMENT OF FACTS 
8. 
Upon information and belief, the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, has 
demonstrated a sexual preference and obsession for minor girls. 
9. 
The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, developed a plan, scheme, and criminal 
enterprise that included an elaborate system wherein the then-minor L.M. was brought 
to the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's residence by the Defendant's employees, recruiters, 
and assistants. When the assistants and employees left the then-minor L.M. (and, on 
some occasions, other minor girls) alone in a room at the Defendant's mansion, the 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, himself would appear, remove his clothing, and direct the 
then-minor L.M. to remove her clothing. 
He would then perform one or more lewd, 
lascivious, and sexual acts, including, but not limited to, masturbation, touching of the 
then minor Plaintiffs sexual organs, coercing or forcing the then-minor L.M. to perform 
oral sex on him, using vibrators or sexual toys on the then-minor L.M., coercing the 
Page 2 of 234 

of 234
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 3 of 82
then-minor L.M. into sexual acts with himself or others, and digitally penetrating the 
then-minor L.M .. He would then pay L.M. for engaging in this sexual activity. 
10. 
L.M. was first brought to the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's mansion in 2002 
when she was a fourteen-year old in middle school. 
11. 
The then-minor L.M. was a vulnerable child without adequate parental 
support at all times material to this Complaint. 
The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, a 
wealthy financier with a lavish home, significant wealth, and a network of assistants and 
employees, used his resources and his influence over a vulnerable minor child to 
engage in a systematic pattern of sexually exploitive behavior. 
12. Beginning in approximately August 2002 and continuing until approximately 
the end of October 2005, the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, repeatedly coerced, induced 
and/or enticed the impressionable, vulnerable, and economically deprived then-minor 
L.M. to commit various acts of sexual misconduct and sexually abused L.M. These acts 
included, but were not limited to, fondling and inappropriate and illegal sexual touching 
of the then-minor L.M., forcing the then-minor L.M. into oral sex, sexual misconduct and 
masturbation of the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, in the presence of the then-minor L.M., 
handling and fondling of the then-minor L.M.'s sexual organs for the purpose of 
masturbation, and encouraging the then-minor L.M. to become involved in prostitution; 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, committed, and conspired with others to commit, numerous 
criminal sexual offenses against the then minor Plaintiff including, but not limited to, 
sexual battery, solicitation of prostitution, coercing a minor into a life of prostitution, and 
lewd and lascivious assaults upon the person of the then-minor L.M. Defendant Jeffrey 
Page 3 of 234 

of 234
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 4 of 82
Epstein knowingly transported L.M. and other minors in interstate commerce with the 
intent that the L.M. engage in prostitution and in other sexual activity for which he and 
others could be charged with criminal offenses. 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein also 
knowingly used means of interstate commerce to knowing persuade and induce minors, 
including L.M., to engage in prostitution and other sexual activity for which he and 
others could be charged with criminal offenses. 
13. 
In addition to the direct sexual abuse and molestation of the then-minor 
L.M., Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, instructed, coerced and otherwise induced the then-
minor L.M. to bring him numerous other minor girls (some as young at 12 years old) for 
the purposes of further satisfying his deviant sexual attraction to minors and for 
purposes of prostitution. On information and belief, Epstein sexually abused hundreds 
of minor girls through his recruiting system. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, used his 
money, wealth and power to unduly and improperly manipulate and influence the then-
minor L.M. to bring him these other minor girls for purposes of prostitution and in 
exchange for money. This influence led the then-minor L.M. away from the life of a 
middle school aged child and into a delinquent lifestyle. This conduct also involved 
transporting L.M .. and other minors in interstate commerce and using means of 
interstate commerce, to persuade and induce L.M. and others to engage in prostitution 
and in other sexual activity for which he and others could be charged with criminal 
offenses. 
14. The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, at all times material to this Complaint, knew 
and should have known of L.M.'s minority. The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, at all times 
Page 4 of 234 

of 234
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 5 of 82
material to this Complaint, knew and should have know of the minority of the other girls 
he was sexually abusing 
15. 
The acts referenced above in paragraphs 10 through 14, committed by 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, against the then-minor Plaintiff L.M. were committed in 
violation of numerous State criminal statutes condemning the sexual exploitation of 
minor children, prostitution and prostitution-related offenses, sexual performances by a 
child, lewd and lascivious assaults, sexual battery, contributing to the delinquency of a 
minor and other crimes, specifically including, but not limited to, those criminal offenses 
outlined in Chapters 794, 800, 827 and 84 7 of the Florida Statutes, as well as those 
designated in Florida Statutes §796.03, §796.07, §796.045, §796.04, §796.09, §39.01, 
and §827.04. 
16. 
The acts reference above in paragraphs 10 through 15, committed by 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, against the then-Minor Plaintiff L.M. were committed in 
violation of numerous federal criminal statutes condemning the coercion and 
enticement of a minor to engage in prostitution or sexual activity, travel with intent to 
engage in illicit sexual conduct, sex trafficking of children, sexual exploitation of minor 
children, child exploitation enterprises, and other crimes, specifically including, but not 
limited to, those crimes designated in 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), § 2423(b), and§ 2423(e). 
17. The crimes committed against L.M. by Epstein were committed, on average, 
four times per month from the beginning of August 2002 through the end of October 
2005, the exact dates being unknown to L.M ..

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 6 of 82
18. 
In June 2008, after investigations by the Palm Beach Police Department, 
the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the 
United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, entered pleas of "guilty" to various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation 
of minors for prostitution and the procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution 
in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in the Palm Beach County, Florida. Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, is in the same position as if he had been tried and convicted of the sexual 
offenses committed against Plaintiff and, as such, must admit liability unto Plaintiff, 
Jane Doe No. 101. 
In this action, Plaintiff hereby exclusively seeks civil remedies 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255. 
19. As a condition of his plea, and in exchange for the Federal Government not 
prosecuting the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, for numerous federal offenses, Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, additionally entered into an agreement with the Federal Government to 
the following: "Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of an offense enumerated in 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under 
section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and 
convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the 
United States shall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was 
prepared to name in an indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. 
Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
evidentiary burdens if any a Plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the 
parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been 
Page 6 of 234 

of 234
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 7 of 82
had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less." Plaintiff L.M. is covered by 
this paragraph and entitled to rights under this paragraph. 
20. The defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is thus estopped by his plea and agreement 
with the Federal Government from denying the acts alleged in this Complaint, and must 
effectively admit liability to the Plaintiff, L.M., including admitting liability for all counts 
enumerated in this Complaint. Plaintiff L.M. is entitled to damages, as further alleged 
below, including damages as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 2255, as amended by Pub. L. 
109-248, Title VII, § 707(b) and (c), 120 Stat. 650. 
COUNT1 
Cause of Action Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255 
August 2002- Incident 1 
21. 
Plaintiff, L.M. adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 20 above. 
22. 
On or about August 2002, the exact date being unknown to L.M., 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, committed a federal sexual offense against her, including a 
violation of numerous federal criminal statutes condemning the coercion and 
enticement of a minor to engage in prostitution or sexual activity, travel with intent to 
engage in illicit sexual conduct, sex trafficking of children, sexual exploitation of minor 
children, transport of visual depictions of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, 
child exploitation enterprises, and other crimes, specifically including, but not limited to, 
those crimes designated in 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), § 2423(a), § 2423(b), and § 2423(e). 
L.M. is therefore a victim of one or more offenses enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and, 
as such, asserts a cause of action against the defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, pursuant to 
Page 7 of 234 

of 234
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 8 of 82
this Section of the United States Code and the agreement between the Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, and the United States Government. 
. 
23. 
As a direct and proximate result of the offenses enumerated in Title 18, 
United States Code, Section 2255, being committed against her, L.M. has in the past 
suffered, and will in the future suffer, physical injury pain and suffering, emotional 
distress, psychological trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, loss of 
self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy and other damages associated with 
defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, controlling, manipulating and coercing her into a perverse 
and conventional way of life for a minor. The then-minor plaintiff L.M. incurred medical 
and psychological expenses and the plaintiff, L.M., will in the future suffer medical and 
psychological expenses. The plaintiff, L.M., has suffered a loss of income, a loss of the 
capacity to earn income in the future, and a loss of the capacity to enjoy life. These 
injuries are permanent in nature and the plaintiff, L.M., will continue to suffer these 
losses in the future. 
24. 
Wherefore, the plaintiff, L.M., demands judgments against the defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, for compensatory damages of at least the minimum amount provided 
by law, attorney's fees, costs, and such other and further relief as this Court deems just 
and proper, and hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by a jury.

L.M., 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
Case No.: __________ _ 
I 
--------------
MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY 
FILED by 
VT 
D.C. 
ELECTRONIC 
STEVEN M. LARIMORE 
CLERK U.S. DIST. CT. 
S. 0. OF FLA. • MIAMI 
Plaintiff, L.M., hereby moves this Court to enter an Order granting Plaintiff permission 
to proceed in this action under the pseudonym "L.M." and as grounds would state as follows: 
1. 
L.M. is currently a 20-year-old female. 
2. 
As outlined in detail in the Complaint, the Plaintiff, L.M., was sexually abused 
by the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, when she was very young, between the ages of 14 and 17 
years old. 
3. 
The abuse caused much embarrassment, humiliation, and psychological 
trauma for the Plaintiff, L.M .. 
4. 
This embarrassment, humiliation and psychological trauma would be greatly 
exacerbated if her name was revealed publicly as the subject of the alleged abuse. 
5. 
The subject matter of the Complaint clearly contains highly sensitive and 
intimate information about the Plaintiff, L.M .. 
6. 
Plaintiff, L.M., was an identified victim by the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office in a 
criminal investigation against the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein. 

of 4
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 2 of 4
7. 
During the criminal investigation, and up and through this point in time, Plaintiff, 
L.M.'s identity has been sealed, as all parties recognize the highly sensitive subject matter of 
the charges and the need to protect the privacy interest of the Plaintiff, L.M.'s true identity. 
8. 
The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, has been provided in the past with the true 
identity of Plaintiff, L.M .. 
9. 
In this civil action, the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, will be provided with Plaintiff, 
L.M.'s true identity; therefore, he will know the identity of Plaintiff, L.M., and will not be 
prejudiced by the non-disclosure of L.M.'s true identity in pleadings. 
10. 
There is a great need, in this case, to protect intimate information about 
Plaintiff, L.M., and to protect her privacy interest. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Despite the general presumption against anonymous or pseudonymous pleadings, it is 
common for this presumption to be overcome in certain types of cases, and courts have 
discretion to permit such pleading in appropriate circumstances. See Doe v. Del Rio, 241 
F.R.D. 154, 157 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (citing James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233, 238 (4th Cir. 1993)). 
The courts typically grant such requests for pseudonymity in matters of a sensitive and highly 
personal nature. Id at 157 (citing Heather K. v. City of Mallard, 887 F.Supp.1249, 1255 
(N.D.lowa 1995)). 
In deciding whether to permit pseudonymous pleadings, courts must 
balance "the Plaintiff's right to privacy and security against the public's interest in 
identification of the litigants and the harm to the defendant stemming from suppression of 
Plaintiff's name." Doe v. Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d 40, 44 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). The ultimate test for 
permitting a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is whether the plaintiff has a substantial privacy 

of 4
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 3 of 4
right which outweighs the customary presumption of openness in judicial proceedings. Free 
Speech v. Reno, 1999 WL 47310, at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 1999). In undertaking this balance, 
courts typically consider such factors as whether the plaintiff would be compelled to disclose 
intimate information, whether the plaintiff would be compelled to admit her intention to 
engage in illegal conduct, whether the plaintiff would risk injury if identified, whether the party 
defending the suit would be prejudiced by the non-disclosure of the plaintiffs name, the age 
of the plaintiff whose identity is being suppressed, the extent to which the identity of the 
plaintiff has been kept confidential, as well as the interest the public has in knowing the 
names of the litigants. 241 FRO at 157. 
The Supreme Court has implicitly recognized pseudonyms in abortion cases, with 
minimal discussion. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 120-121, 93 S.Ct. 705 (1973); See also, 
E.E.O.C. v. ABM Industries, Inc., 249 F.R.D. 588 (E.D. Cal. 2008). Likewise, pseudonym 
filing is typically accepted by the courts in other cases where the nature of the pleading 
unveils highly sensitive information and detail about the plaintiff, such that the non-disclosure 
of the party's name is necessary to protect her from harassment, injury, ridicule, or personal 
embarrassment. Does v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-1068 (9th Cir. 2000) 
(citing United States v. Doe, 655 F.2d 920; E.E.O.C., 249 F.R.D. at 588). 
In this case, it is clear from the allegations in the Complaint that the information is of a 
highly sensitive nature - i.e., allegations involving sexual abuse of a minor. Additionally, 
Jane Doe's name was kept anonymous in the Federal Court criminal case and all documents 
containing her name were redacted by the United States Government and Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein's attorney. The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, will not be prejudiced in any way by this 
pseudonym pleading, as he has been provided with her name in the past and will also be 

of 4
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2009   Page 4 of 4
privy to the sealed document containing Plaintiff, L.M. 's name. While the public does have a 
right to the openness of judicial proceedings, the right to know the true identity of Plaintiff, 
L.M., is greatly outweighed by L.M.'s privacy interest in this case. Of course, other than the 
identity of the then minor, all other aspects of the case will still be available to the public. 
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, L.M., moves this Court to enter an Order granting this 
Motion, and thus allowing her to proceed in this litigation under the L.M. pseudonym.

THIRD PARTY WITNESS, IGOR ZINOVIEW'S, 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LA ,v 
Third Paiiy Witness, Igor Zinoview's, ("Mr. Zinoview") by and through his 
undersigned attorney, moves this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) for a protective 
order regarding his deposition and as grounds therefore would state: 
1. 
As reflected on the affidavit of Igor Zinoview, attached as Exhibit A, he 
works for Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Mr. Epstein") as a driver and bodyguard. He did 
not know Mr. Epstein before November of 2005. He first became employed by Mr. 
Epstein in November of 2005. 
2. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview would testify as set forth on his affidavit, that 
at no time has he discussed with Mr. Epstein any issues involving Mr. Epstein's criminal 
case nor any of the cases or issues involved with civil plaintiffs. 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 2 of 26
3. 
In many of the depositions, counsel for L.M. and E.W., has asked them as 
witnesses to assume ce1iain facts about which they have no knowledge, and he then asks 
their opinions about certain facts. See Exhibit B ~Epstein's Motion for Protective Order 
to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions. 
4. 
There is no information which Mr. Zinoview has relating to the facts and 
circumstances surrounding any of the pending civil cases, in that none of their allegations 
directed to Mr. Epstein extend beyond September of 2005. 
Therefore whatever 
information Mr. Zinoview may have, postdates that time. 
5. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order (DE #377), "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, it 
is not without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 
1570 (11th Cir. 1992). . .. Cou1is have long held that ' [ w]hile the standard of relevancy 
[in discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear ge1111ane 
on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food & 
Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) (string 
cite omitted)." 
6. 
Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that, "[a] party or 
any person from whomn discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court 
where the action is pending.... The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect 
a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or 
expense, including one or more of the following: (A) forbidding the disclosure or 
discovery;". 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 3 of 26
7. 
As set forth in his affidavit, Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action. Accordingly, the 
Court should enter a protective order prohibiting his deposition. 
WHEREFORE, third~paity witness moves this comt for a protective order 
pursuant to Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that his deposition not take 
place or the questioning be limited.

EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER TO 
PROHIBIT INAPPROPRIATE DEPOSITION QUESTIONS 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), pursuant to Rule 1.280(c), Florida 
Rules of Civil Procedure, moves for a protective order to prohibit argumentative, 
harassing and inappropriate questions in depositions, and states: 
1. 
At numerous depositions, Plaintiff's counsel has repeatedly asked 
argumentative and harassing questions that are irrelevant and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
2. 
In particular, Plc;iintiff's counsel has asked questions that improperly 
sought to illicit lay opinions from fact witnesses, asked questions regarding witnesses' 
feelings towards Mr. Epstein and their beliefs regarding media reports of this case, 
asked whether they would leave their children with Mr. Epstein and asked whether they 
would go back to work for Mr. Epstein assuming the media reports were accurate, 
among other things. 
These questions and the responses thereto will never be 
admissible. 
They are argumentative, irrelevant and seek speculative answers and 
inadmissible lay opinions.

3. 
For example, in the deposition of Larry Visoski, one of Mr. Epstein's pilots, 
Plaintiff's counsel asked the following questions seeking to obtain Mr. Visoski's beliefs 
and opinions on Plaintiff's allegations: 
Q. 
All right. 
When you read in the newspapers 
the 
allegations that Mr. Epstein was involved with 
numerous 
underage girls for sexual reasons, were you surprised? 
A. I didn't believe it. 
Q. Do you believe it today? 
A. I don't believe it. 
Q. You don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was involved with 
underage girls in a sexual way? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: You're asking for my opinion, and I don't 
think my opinion is relevant in that matter. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I think it's relevant. Can you just tell me whether today 
you believe that Jeffrey Epstein has engag.ed in sex with 
underage girls? 
• 
• 
• 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation, irrelevant, always. 
THE WITNESS: It's irrelevant. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. I need an answer. 
A. I don't believe he had sex with underage women. 
Q. Or engaged in any· sexual acts with underage women? 
MR. CRITTON: Form.

Page 3 of 9 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
You think that this ls just a story that a bunch of 
underage women have made up? 
A. 
Speculatlon. 
* * * * 
Q. 
Then we'll handle the question this way: If you were to 
believe based on information and evidence that Mr. Epstein 
engaged in sex or some form of sex acts with people of the 
age range of 12, 13, 14, 15 years old, would you continue 
your employment with Mr. Epstein? 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation. 
THE 
WITNESS: 
I would 
certainly 
speculating 
and I have to discuss it with my wife long and hard. I don't 
think I could give you a correct and honest answer at this 
time. 
See Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Visokski at 66-67; 181-82 (attached as 
composite Exhibit A). Other examples of similar improper questions are included in 
Exhibit A. 
4. 
Not only do these questions seek improper lay opinions, Plaintiff's counsel 
asked Mr. Visoski his belief as to the truth of hearsay newspaper articles. 
The 
foregoing questions are obviously irrelevant, argumentative and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
5. 
Moreover, whether Mr. Visoski would continue working for Mr. Epstein if 
Plaintiff's allegations are true has absolutely no relevance to any claim or defense in this 
case. 
The questions are simply improper and meant to harass and embarrass the

witness. 
6. 
Mr. Visoski was questioned for over four hou'.s and much of the time was 
wasted on irrelevant and harassing questions. 
7. 
Plaintiff's counsel asked similar questions at the deposition of Larry 
Eugene Morrison, another one of Mr. Epstein's pilots: 
Q. 
Certainly you've read certain newspaper articles about 
the allegations, police reports, otherwise, the allegations that 
occurred or have been alleged to have occurred at his Palm 
Beach mansion, correct? 
A. 
Uh-huh. 
Q. 
Correct? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Given the nature of those allegations, would you leave 
your daughter of 17, 16, 15 years old with Mr. Epstein 
alone? 
MR PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. 
* * * * 
Q. 
And despite pleading guilty to procuring underage girls 
for the purposes of sex, you still feel comfortable leaving a 
13, 14, 15-year-old girl around him? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. I mean, with my daughter, yes. I don't know how 
he behaves around anybody else. 
I just know that the 
respect that he showed me, I feel safe with my daughter. 
Q. 
And have you read in detail the reports as to what 
happened at his house with the girls?

Epstein's Motion for Protective Order to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions 
Page 5 of 9 
A. 
Only --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
-- what's been in the newspapers and published. 
Q. 
If you read and hear testimony given - well, I can tell 
you now - testimony has been given in this case that what 
happens is: A 13 or 14 year old is led upstairs by herself, 
told to get naked, he lays down on his back, there is a brief 
massage before he turns over, exposes himself erect, 
masturbates while he tells this 13 or 14 year old to pinch his 
nipples as hard as she can while he inserts his fingers into 
their vagina and ejaculates all over them before saying, 
"Take your money and leave." 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Okay? Then, 
11You can continue to come back for $200 
every time or every girl you bring me within your age group 
and I get to do this again, I pay you $200 per person." If that 
is the testimony --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
Q. 
-- that what happens behind closed doors with him, do 
you still feel comfortable leaving a 13 or 14 year old in a 
room with Jeffrey Epstein? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
If that, in fact, is what actually happened, no. 
* * * * 
Q. 
[Would you] go back - considering what you've read and 
what you may or may not believe - would you go back to 
working for Jeffrey Epstein? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
I can't say. I still work for him on a maintenance - to

maintain the airplanes and stuff like that, so. 
§ee Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Eugene Morrison at 135-36; 175-76; 184 
(attached as composite Exhibit B). 
8. 
Again, whether Mr. Morrison would work for Mr. Epstein "considering what 
[he has] read and what [he] may or may not believe" (i.e. considering hearsay media 
accounts and inadmissible lay opinion) has no bearing on the instant case. 
9. 
ln addition, questions regarding whether Mr. Morrison would leave his 
children alone with Mr. Epstein could have only been meant to harass and embarrass 
Mr. Morrison. Nevertheless, Mr. Morrison testified that he would leave his children with 
Mr. Epstein. As Plaintiffs counsel was obviously not happy with the answer to this 
question, he proceeded to press Mr. Morrison with inflammatory statements until he got 
the answer he wanted. 
10. 
Plaintiff's counsel has also asked the same improper line of questions in 
other witnesses' depositions. 
11. 
The above-cited questions exceed the bounds of permissible discovery; 
they have absolutely no relevance to this case. Accordingly, the Court should enter a 
protective order prohibiting such questions and should sanction Plaintiff's counsel if 
such inappropriate questions are asked at future depositions. 
12. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order, 1 "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, lt is not 
The Omnibus Order (DE #377) was entered in the federal companion case Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, 
Case No. 08-CIV-80119 MARRNJOH NSON in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida.

without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 1570 (11th 
Cir. 1992). ... 
Courts have long held that '[w]hile the standard of relevancy [in 
discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear 
germane on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United 
Food & Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) 
(string .cite omitted)." §ee also Capco Properties, LLC v. Monterry Gardens of Pinecrest 
Condo., 982 So. 2d 1211, (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (holding that discovery in civil cases must 
be relevant to the subject matter of the case and must be admissible or reasonably 
calculated to lead to admissible evidence); Morton Plant Hospital Ass'n, lnc. v. 
Shahbas, 960 So. 2d 820, 824 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007) (holding that ''discovery should be 
denied when it has been established that the information requested is neither relevant 
F 
to any pending claim or defense nor will it lead to the discovery of admissible evidence," 
citing Tanchel v. Shoemaker, 928 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006)). 
13. 
As illustrated above, the questions are simply not germane to any pending 
'--.. 
claim or defense nor will they lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Whether 
Mr. Visoski believes or disbelieves the media accounts of this case, or whether Mr. 
Morrison would leave his children with Mr. Epstein is not relevant and cannot 
conceivably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
14. 
The Court should curtail these inappropriate lines of questions and enter a 
protective order prohibiting them. 
15. 
Rule 1.280(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides the Court with 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 8   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 15 of 26
LM v. Epstein

the power to "make any order to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense that justice requires including 
... (4) that certain matter not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be 
limited to certain matters." 
16. 
Accordingly, Epstein requests the Court enter a protective order 
prohibiting Plaintiff's counsel from asking witnesses' questions regarding opinions and 
beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case and whether they would 
leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar nature, and limiting the scope 
to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters relevant to the claims and 
defenses in this case. See Shahbas, 960 So. 2d at 824. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, respectfully requests the Court 
enter a protective order prohibiting Plaintiffs counsel from asking witnesses' questions 
regarding opinions and beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case 
and whether they would leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar 
nature, and limiting the scope to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters 
relevant to the claims and defenses in this case and grant any additional relief the Court 
deems just and proper.

MR. EDWARDS: Okay. There were --1 don't 
even think Mr. Willits is aware of this. There was 
a subpoena duces tecum for this witness, as well as 
the previous witness, which was another pilot, Dave 
Rogers, and that duces teoum was to bring the 
flight logs related from 1998 through 2005. What 
was produced at the previous deposition were flight 
logs from 2002 through 2005, ancl now Mr. Reinhart 
has agreed to produce the remainder of the flight 
logs requested, those going from 1998 t11rough 2002. 
MR. REINHART; Correct. They're pilot logs, 
not night logs. There are other records we 
indicated are corporate records, and with those you 
have to deal with Mr. Critton.

THE WITNESS: You said It was hypothetical? 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
O 
Q. Right, it is a hypothetical.

A. Why would I want to answer that? Because 
i2 
you're being hypothetical. I mean, it would obviously 
p 
be wrong.

legal question that I'm allowed to as!<,

MR, CRITTON: Form, 
MR. REINHART: Can we - for purposes of your 
hypothe\lcal, wha\ facts do you want him lo assume 
are true? You said \he facts to which he pied 
guilty, but the witness already said he doesn't 
know what he pied guflty to. He knows the charge 
he doesn't know the facts. .

Q, Solicitation of prostitution of a minor, 
somebody under the age of 18. 
MR. EDWARDS: That's the charge, right, 
soliclta\lon of prostitution of a minor? 
MR. CRITTON: No. I think you've got ii 
wrong. I'll object to the form, 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Then we'll handle the question this way: If 
you were to believe based on information and evidence 
o 
that Mr. Epstein engaged in sex or some form of sex act 
with people of the age range of 12, 13, 14, 15 years 
old, would you continue your employment with 
Mr. Epstein? 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation. 
THE WITNESS: I would certainly be speculating 
182 • 
and I have to discuss it with my wife long and 
hard. I don't think I could give you a correct and 
honest answer at this time. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Okay. Given the allegations that have been 
made in this case, is this something that you have 
discussed with anyone other than your attorney? 
B 
A. No, not really. Only from the fact that 
they're allegations and there's still a lot more work, 
I'm sure, to be discovered. 
MR. CRITTON: Let me put on there, for the --

REPLY TO ROTHSTEIN ROSENFELDT ADLER'S P.A.'S 
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S EMERGENCY MOTION FOR ORDER 
FOR THE PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE (DE 4051 
(AS TO JANE DOE v. EPSTEIN CASE NO.: 08-CIV- 80893) 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"), by and through his undersigned attorneys, 
hereby files his Reply to Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler P.A.' s ("RRA") Response to 
Defendant's Emergency Motion for Order for the Preservation of Evidence [DE 405], 
and states: 
1. 
It now appears that the Honorable Herbert Stettin ("Mr. Stettin") is the 
sole individual, as the Chief Restructuring Officer, in charge of RRA assets, including 
electronic and paper records. There also appears to be no objection to the entry of the 
preservation order consistent with his fiduciary/trustee duties for RRA, although certain 
documents may no longer exist within his possession. 
2. 
Par. 4 of the response reflects that some 40 plus boxes of documents were 
obtained by the Department of Justice from search warrants served on the offices of 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 2 of 5
RRA; "it is believed that the Department of Justice also sequestered about (13) boxes of 
documents related to this [Epstein] case." In fact there are three Epstein cases which 
have been brought by the RRA firm, one being in federal court, two in state court. Mr. 
Stettin confirms Defendant's belief that there are serious ethical and potentially criminal 
issues that may impact Plaintiffs' ability to pursue their cases. 
3. 
Unfortunately, time is critical with regard to this case in that there are 
deadlines to Disclose Experts and Exchange Reports by October 29, 2009 (but Plaintiff 
has not seen her expert, has no report and only made herself available for the Defendant's 
exam on November 13, 2009), deposition discovery deadline is November 28, 2009 and 
a calendar call of February 19, 2010 for the February 22, 2010 trial docket. While the 
undersigned understands that Mr. Stettin may be working expeditiously to deal with 
critical and pressing needs of stabilizing the firm, a delay of 45 days for his deposition 
(which has been set in the state court case in the 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach 
County, State of Florida, L.M. v. Epstein, Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB, 
not the case sub-judice) will place his deposition sometime during the first 15 days of 
January, after every pre-trial deadline has expired. 
4. 
If in fact there has been inappropriate and/or illegal conduct associated 
with the prosecution of this case by RRA or any of its attorneys or by the Plaintff herself, 
which might result in sanctions, dismissal or other remedy, Defendant Epstein will be 
severely prejudiced. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant Epstein request that the court's preservation order be 
made permanent, which does not seem inconsistent with Mr. Stettin's position as 
expressed by his lawyers but deny the relief sought for delaying the deposition unless the 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 3 of 5
court is disposed to modify the current scheduling deadlines and trial date that exist in 
this case.

PLAINTIFF, CAROLYN M. ANDRIANO’S, RESPONSE TO THIRD PARTY WITNESS, 
IGOR ZINOVIEW’S, MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND INCORPORATED 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, Carolyn M. Andriano, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby 
files her Response Third Party Witness, Igor Zinoview’s, Motion For Protective Order 
and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (D.E. 402), and in support thereof states as 
follows: 
1. 
Third party witness, Igor Zinoview, seeks to have this Court enter an order 
preventing his deposition from going forward at all, or, in the alternative, limiting the 
scope of permissible questioning during same.  Mr. Zinoview’s deposition is presently 
scheduled to be taken on December 18, 2009. 
2. 
Mr. Zinoview has been employed by Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” since November of 2005.  See Affidavit of Igor Zinoview 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 1 of 8

(D.E. 402) dated November 9, 2009.  Mr. Zinoview argues that his deposition should not 
go forward as scheduled because Defendant Epstein has never discussed nor 
attempted to discuss with him “any facts or information related to any legal matters in 
which he [Jeffrey Epstein] is involved.” Id.  From Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion springs 
the bold yet erroneous argument that “Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action.” 
3. 
It should initially be noted that a “complete prohibition of a deposition is an 
extraordinary measure which should be resorted to only in rare occasions.” Jennings v. 
Family Management, 201 F.R.D. 272 (D.D.C. 2001); See also, Salter v. Upjohn Co., 
593 F.2d 649, 651 (5th Circ. 1979)(It is very unusual for trial court to prohibit the taking 
of a deposition altogether, and absent extraordinary circumstances, such order would 
likely be in error.); Inv. Properties Intern., Ltd. v. IOS, Ltd., 459 F.2d. 705, 708 (2d Circ. 
1972)(“an order to vacate a notice of taking deposition is generally regarded as both 
unusual and unfavorable . . . “).  Neither Mr. Zinoview’s conclusory affidavit nor his 
Motion provide anything even approaching the “extraordinary circumstances” necessary 
to justify the entry of order precluding his deposition from going forward at all. 
4. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion that he and Defendant 
Epstein have never discussed any facts or information related to any legal matters that 
Mr. Epstein is involved in does not give rise to requisite “extraordinary circumstances” 
either. Detweiler Bros, Inc. v John Graham and Company, 412 F.Supp. 416 (E.D. Wash, 
1976)(Plaintiff could not properly seek to prohibit defendant from deposing plaintiff’s 
employee via a protective order on grounds that employee had no knowledge of matters 
at issue.) See also, 8 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. §2037, Wright and Miller(“A witness 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 2 of 8

ordinarily cannot escape examination by denying knowledge of any relevant facts, since 
the party seeking to take the deposition is entitled to test the witness’s lack of 
knowledge.”)  
5. 
The undersigned, as well as counsel for all of the other victims of Jeffrey 
Epstein, are entitled to question and challenge Mr. Zinoview on his purported lack of 
knowledge.  Mr. Zinoview and plaintiffs’ counsel very well might have a difference of 
opinion on what constitutes “facts and information related to any legal matters” in which 
Defendant Epstein is involved.  The victims of Jeffrey Epstein ought not to be forced to 
accept Mr. Zinoview’s opinion as to what constitutes “facts and information related to 
any legal matters” involving Jeffrey Epstein.  Instead, plaintiffs should be able to explore 
these relevant matters directly with Mr. Zinoview, rather than being forced to rely on his 
twenty seven (27) word claim of lacking any knowledge. 
6. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview worked for Defendant Epstein during portions of 
the Palm Beach Police Department’s months’ long investigation which spanned from 
March 15, 2005 through February 2006 into the illegal sexual contact committed by 
Defendant Epstein against these minor plaintiffs.  Accordingly, Mr. Zinoview certainly 
might have direct knowledge about what was going on in and around the Epstein 
residence during the time period in which he was employed by Defendant Epstein as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” while his employer was being investigated by law 
enforcement.  Given the Defendant’s voracious invocation of his Fifth Amendment 
privilege, the plaintiffs have consistently been denied the opportunity to seek any 
relevant information directly from Defendant Epstein himself.  Rather, plaintiffs have 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 3 of 8

been forced to build their cases against Mr. Epstein by other discovery methods, 
including deposing his employees who may have relevant information.  
7. 
Third party witness Igor Zinoview has failed to meet his very high burden 
of establishing “extraordinary circumstances.”  Mr. Zinoview has failed to demonstrate 
the “good cause” required by Rule 26(c) to protect a person from “annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” to overcome the liberal 
scope of permissible discovery.  The above proposed lines of inquiry of Mr. Zinoview 
are certainly reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  
Accordingly, to the extent that it seeks to preclude his deposition from going forward at 
all, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion should be denied 
8. 
Next, Mr. Zinoview also seeks to prevent questions being posed to him 
wherein he is first asked to “assume certain facts about which he has no knowledge,” 
and then be asked about his “opinions about certain facts.”  First, it remains to be seen 
exactly what facts about which Mr. Zinoview has no knowledge.  Second, Mr. Zinoview’s 
opinions and beliefs about the factual matters surrounding plaintiffs’ claims are relevant 
to exploring any potential bias and prejudice in favor of his employer and against 
Defendant Epstein’s victims.  For example, if Mr. Zinoview believes that these plaintiffs 
are simply inventing their claims against his employer that they were sexually victimized 
by Defendant Epstein while they were minor children, it very well might impact his 
impartiality as a witness.  Third, the undersigned has no present intention of engaging in 
this line of questioning unless the proverbial “door” has been opened by Mr. Zinoview 
first.  Lastly, counsel for Mr. Zinoview is certainly free to invoke the privileges afforded to 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 4 of 8

him by the applicable procedural rules should he feel that his client is being asked 
inappropriate questions during the deposition. 
9. 
In conclusion and for the reasons cited above, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion For 
Protective Order should be denied in its entirety. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Carolyn Margaret Andriano, respectfully requests that 
this Court deny Third Party Igor Zinoview’s Motion For Protective Order.

AO 88A (Rev. 01/09) Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition or to Produce Documents in a Civi! Action (Page 3) 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 (c), (d), and (e) (Effective 12/1/07) 
(c) Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena. 
(])Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or 
attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take 
reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a 
person subject to the subpoena. The issuing court must enforce this 
duty and impose an appropriate sanction -
which may include lost 
earnings and reasonable attorney's fees -
on a party or attorney 
who fails to comply. 
(2) Command to Produce Materials or Perl1Ut Inspection. 
(A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce 
documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or 
to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the 
place of production or inspection unless also commanded to appear 
for a deposition, hearing, or trial. 
(B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or 
tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or 
attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to 
inspecting, copying, testing or sampling any or all of the materials or 
to inspecting the premises -
or to producing electronically stored 
information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be 
served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 
days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the 
following rules apply: 
(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving 
party may move the issuing comt for an order compelling production 
or inspection. 
(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and 
the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's 
officer from significant expense resulting from compliance. 
(3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena. 
(A) When Required. On timely motion, the issuing court must 
quash or modify a subpoena that: 
(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; 
(ii) requires a person ·.vho is neither a party nor a party's officer 
to travel more than I 00 miles from where that person resides, is 
employed, or regularly transacts business in person -
except that, 
subject to Rule 45(c)(3)(B)(iii), the person may be commanded to 
attend a trial by traveling from any such place within the state where 
the trial is held; 
(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if 
no exception or waiver applies; or 
(iv) subjects a person to undue burden. 
(B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by 
a subpoena, the issuing court may, on motion, quash or modify the 
subpoena if it requires: 
(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, 
development, or commercial infonnation; 
(ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or information that 
does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from 
the expert's study that was not requested by a party; or 
(iii) a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer to incur 
substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial. 
(C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circumstances 
described in Rule 45(c)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or 
modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under 
specified conditions if the serving party: 
(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that 
cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and 
(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably 
compensated. 
(d) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena. 
(1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. 
These procedures apply 10 producing documents or electronically 
stored information: 
(A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce 
documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary 
course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to 
the categories in the demand. 
(B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not 
Specified. If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing 
electronically stored information, the person responding must 
produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or 
in a reasonably usable form or forms. 
(C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One 
Form. The person responding need not produce the same 
electronically stored information in more than one form. 
(D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information. The person 
responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored 
information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably 
accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel 
discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show 
that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue 
burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless 
order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows 
good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The 
court may specify conditions for the discovery. 
(2) Claiming Privilege or Protection. 
(A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed 
information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to 
protection as trial-preparation material must 
(i) expressly make the claim; and 
(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, 
communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without 
revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the 
parties to assess the claim. 
(B) Information Produced. If information produced in response to a 
subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-
preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any 
party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. 
After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or 
destroy the specified infonnation and any copies it has; must not use 
or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take 
reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it 
before being notified; and may promptly present the information to 
the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The person 
who produced the information must preserve the information until 
the claim is resolved. 
(e) Contempt. The issuing court may hold in contempt a person 
who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the 
subpoena. A nonparty's failure to obey must be excused if the 
subpoena purports to require the nonparty to attend or produce at a 
place outside the limits ofRule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii).

NON-PARTY, JEAN LUC BRUHNEL’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF 
JANE DOE’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND FOR 
AN ORDER TO COMPEL AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Non-party Jean Luc Bruhnel hereby files his Response to Plaintiff, Jane Doe’s Motion
for an Order to Show Cause and for an Order to Compel and Incorporated Memorandum of Law
which was filed on March 10, 2010. (DE#483).  Plaintiff’s counsel seeks to compel Mr. Bruhnel,
a french citizen who is not a party to the instant action, to sit for a deposition that was canceled
and for which he has never been re-noticed.  This motion is premature at best, and frivolous. 
 While visiting New York, Mr. Bruhnel was served with a Subpoena and Notice of
Videotape Deposition in this matter.1  As a courtesy, undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 1 of 6

Please see Exhibit B, annexed hereto and incorporated by reference.
-2-
agreed to produce Mr. Bruhnel for deposition in Florida on November 3, 2010 for the
convenience of the parties because Mr. Bruhnel had plans to travel to Florida at that time.  The
videotape deposition was accordingly canceled.  Two new deposition notices were then e-mailed
to counsel for Bruhnel, both of which emanated from related cases in Florida Circuit Court, with
no additional notice emanating from the instant matter before this Court. 2  That scheduled
deposition was then canceled by agreement of the parties, who mutually agreed that plaintiff’s
counsel’s secretary would call counsel for Mr. Bruhnel to reset the deposition. 
Neither plaintiff’s counsel nor his secretary called to reschedule the deposition until
January, 2010.  In the intervening time, all depositions in the myriad related matters had been
canceled, upon information and belief, due to the scandal involving plaintiff’s counsel’s previous
law partner.  Further, Mr. Bruhnel had left the United States with no firm plan to return, which
was conveyed to plaintiff’s counsel during a telephone conversation in January.  
Mr. Bruhnel’s counsel attempted to secure firm dates on which Mr. Bruhnel would be
traveling to the United States, but was unable to do so. Undersigned counsel accordingly
informed planitiff’s counsel that she could not secure any firm dates.  When plaintiff’s counsel
insisted that Mr. Bruhnel provide deposition dates, plaintiff’s counsel was informed that Mr.
Bruhnel could not be compelled to return to the United States.  Undersigned counsel told
plaintiff’s counsel that there were appropriate mechanisms through which he could secure Mr.

Bruhnel’s testimony abroad pursuant to Florida, Federal and International law.  Indeed,
undersigned counsel directed plaintiff’s counsel to the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and the
Hague Convention, each of which provide specific mechanisms for the securing of testimony
abroad.  
Plaintiff’s counsel has never served Mr. Bruhnel or undersigned counsel with a re-notice
for deposition since the cancellation of the prior scheduled depositions, and has never attempted
to avail himself of proper legal procedures to secure Mr. Bruhnel’s testimony abroad.  Further,
contrary to plaintiff’s counsel’s Certification to this court, plaintiff’s counsel never conferred
with undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel regarding the instant Order to Show Cause and for an
Order to Compel.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
As stated above, the previously scheduled depositions were canceled by agreement of the
parties herein and Mr. Bruhnel has never been re-noticed for deposition.  The motion currently
before the court is therefore premature and frivolous.  Regardless, it is respectfully noted that the
Court lacks authority to compel Mr. Bruhnel to return to the United States for deposition. 
Indeed, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure specifically decline to confer upon the Court the
power to compel foreign nationals to appear before it. See Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. Rule 45, 28 USC
§ 1783.
The Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and the Hague Convention, however, have each
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 3 of 6

-4-
adopted procedural rules to facilitate the deposition of a non-party foreign national.  Indeed,  The
Uniform Foreign Depositions Act,  as adopted by Florida in section 92.251 (“UFDL”) provides
a road map for litigants seeking to secure evidence from foreign non-party witnesses, stating:
(2) Whenever any mandate, writ or commission is issued out of any court of record in any
other state, territory, district, or foreign jurisdiction, or whenever upon notice or
agreement it is required to take the testimony of a witness or witnesses in this state,
witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify in the same manner and by the same
process and proceeding as may be employed for the purposes of taking testimony in
proceedings pending in this state.
§ 92.251 Florida statutes.
Thus, whenever a Florida litigant desires to depose a witness residing in another state,
that litigant must first secure the appointment of a commissioner from the court where the
litigation originates. See Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 507 So.2d 1180 (Fla 2d DCA 1987), at 1183.
The foreign litigant may then apply to the court having personal jurisdiction over the witness for
the process necessary to secure the attendance of the witness. Id. (citing Travelers Indem. Co. v.
Hill, 388 So.2d 648 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980)).  See Greenlight Financial Services, Inc. v. Union
America Mortg., Inc., 971 So.2d 983 (Fla. 3d DCA 2008). This may be done through mechanisms
provided via The Hague Convention, to which France is a signatory.  Given that several cases are
currently pending in Florida Circuit Court that are related to the instant matter, plaintiff may
avail herself of this mechanism to secure Mr. Bruhnel’s testimony, but has chosen not to. 
Accordingly, there has been no malfeasance herein by Mr. Bruhnel or his counsel, only
nonfeasance by plaintiff’s counsel.

Plaintiff’s counsel has misrepresented to this court that he spoke to Mr. Bruhnel’s
counsel about this motion prior to filing it with the Court. Undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel
was never notified in any manner that any such motion was being prepared or filed.
Plaintiff’s counsel has further misrepresented to this Court that undersigned counsel for
Mr. Bruhnel stated that Mr. Bruhnel, “has been out of this country since prior to the New Year
with no plans to return.”   In fact, undersigned counsel has consistently told Plaintiff’s counsel
that she was unaware of Mr. Bruhnel’s travel schedule and that she did not know when Mr.
Bruhnel planned to return to this country. 
WHEREFORE, JEAN LUC BRUHNEL, a non-party to the instant matter, and
undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel, respectfully request that the Court DENY plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order to Show Cause and an Order to Compel in its entirety.  Mr. Bruhnel and
undersigned counsel further respectfully request that the Court impose sanctions and attorney’s
fees incurred in the defense of Plaintiff’s frivolous motion, and for whatever further relief this
Court deems appropriate.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES 2-8’ MEMORANDUM IN  
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S RULE 4 APPEAL  
Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-8 (“Plaintiffs”), by and through undersigned counsel, file this 
Memorandum in Response to Defendant’s Rule 4 Appeal of the Magistrate Judge’s Orders (DE 
480 and DE 513) directing Defendant to produce his income tax returns, as follows:  
Introduction 
Defendant appeals the Magistrate Judge’s Orders (DE 480 and DE 513) compelling 
Defendant to produce income tax returns and related forms and schedules.  He fails, however, to 
demonstrate that the Magistrate Judge’s decision as to tax returns is clearly erroneous or contrary 
to law.  The applicable case law establishes that the tax returns are not protected from discovery 
by the Fifth Amendment privilege under the act of production doctrine, or alternatively, that they 
fall within the “required records” exception to the Fifth Amendment privilege.   
The tax returns are indisputably relevant in these cases, particularly as to Plaintiff’s 
claims for punitive damages, and given the Defendant’s invocation of the Fifth Amendment in 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 1 of 10

blanket fashion to all requests for net worth discovery, there is a compelling need for this 
discovery.  Even if Plaintiffs could not demonstrate a compelling need for the tax returns in 
discovery, under applicable Eleventh Circuit precedent and reported cases in this District, 
Plaintiffs would be entitled to this discovery under the broad relevance standard of Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 26(b).  Finally, there is no basis to delay this discovery, as the tax returns are relevant to 
punitive damages, which is an important, current issue in these cases.  For the reasons set forth 
herein, Plaintiff’s request that the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to Defendant’s tax returns be 
affirmed and that Defendant be ordered to produce the tax return discovery requested by 
Plaintiffs.    
Argument 
I. 
DEFENDANT HAS BURDEN TO SHOW THAT MAGISTRATE  
JUDGE’S ORDER IS CLEARLY ERRONEOUS OR CONTRARY TO LAW 
In seeking reversal of the Magistrate Judge’s Order as to discovery of tax returns, it is the 
Defendant’s burden to show that the order is “clearly erroneous or contrary to law”.  28 U.S.C. 
§636(b)(1).  Absent such a showing, the Magistrate Judge’s decision “shall not be disturbed.” 
Emmisive Energy Corp. v. Novatac, Inc., 2009 WL 2834841 *1 (S.D. Fla. 2009).  In the instant 
appeal, Defendant has not shown that the Magistrate Judge’s Order to produce tax returns is 
clearly erroneous or contrary to law.  
II. 
THE ACT OF PRODUCTION OF TAX RETURNS IS NOT  
PROTECTED BY THE FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE 
The Plaintiffs served the following document request in discovery, to which Defendant 
asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege:  
Request No. 1:  All Federal and State income tax returns, including all W-2 
forms, 1099 forms and schedules, for tax years 2003-2008. 
The Magistrate Judge rejected the Defendant’s privilege assertion as to tax returns.  (De 480, pp. 
8-9).  In so holding, the Magistrate Judge applied the act of production doctrine set forth in 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 2 of 10

Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 410 (1976) and United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 35-
(2000).  As noted by the Magistrate Judge, “Defendant cannot reasonably and in good faith 
argue that in producing these documents to Plaintiff he will somehow be incriminating himself.”  
(Order, p. 9).  Yet, Defendant argues just that.  In Hubbell, the Supreme Court made express 
reference to tax returns in discussing documents that cannot be protected by the Fifth 
Amendment privilege under the act of production doctrine:  
[T]he fact that incriminating evidence may be the byproduct of 
obedience to a regulatory requirement, such as filing an income 
tax return, maintaining required records, or reporting an accident, 
does not clothe such required conduct with the testimonial 
privilege.  
120 U.S. at 2043, 530 U.S. at 35 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis supplied).  Accord United States 
v. Hammes, 3 F.3d 1081, 1083 (7th Cir. 1993) (“[w]e reject [defendant’s] compulsory self-
incrimination claim because the government may use voluntarily filed tax returns against a 
defendant without violating the Fifth Amendment”).  See also Garner v. United States, 96 S.Ct. 
1178, 424 U.S. 648 (1976) (holding that disclosures in tax returns are not compelled 
incriminations and may be used as evidence in criminal prosecution); Ebay, Inc. v. Digital Point 
Solutions, Inc., 2010 WL 147967 *8 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (holding that a person cannot incriminate 
himself by turning over a document already in the government’s possession); Federal Savings 
and Loan Ins. Corp. v. Hardee, 686 F. Supp 885 (N.D. Fla. 1988) (holding that personal income 
tax returns and supporting schedules are not protected by the “act of production” doctrine under 
Fisher).  
As an alternative to finding that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply because 
the act of producing documents is not testimonial and communicative, courts have invoked the 
“required records” exception to the act of production doctrine.  See Federal Saving & Loan Ins. 
Corp. v. Rodrigues, 717 F. Supp. 1424, 1427 (N.D. Cal 1988) (“required records” exception is a 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 3 of 10

distinct basis to deny Fifth Amendment privilege alternative to the “foregone conclusion” 
rationale under Fisher).  The “required records” exception defeats the Fifth Amendment privilege 
where: “(1) because of the public aspect of the required records the individual admits little of 
significance by their production; and (2) by doing business in an area where the government 
requires record keeping, an individual may be deemed to have waived the Fifth Amendment 
privilege as to the production of those records.”   In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 21 F.3d 226, 229 
(8th Cir. 1994).    
Defendant contends that the “required records” exception does not apply to tax returns 
because they cannot be accessed by the public.  This is wrong, however, as the “required 
records” exception requires only that there be “public aspects” to the documents at issue.  Id. 
Numerous courts that have addressed this precise issue have found that tax returns have “public 
aspects”. See Rodrigues, 717 F. Supp. at 1426-27 (citing cases); accord Doe v. United States, 
711 F.2d 1187, 1191 (2d Cir. 1983).1   Accordingly, the “required records” exception applies to 
the production of tax returns.   In Rodrigues, the Court denied the Fifth Amendment privilege for 
the act of producing tax returns under the “required records” exception, noting that “records filed 
with a public body pursuant to a valid regulatory scheme have been held to have public aspects.”  
Id. at 1427.  Accordingly, the fact that federal tax returns cannot be accessed by the general 
public does not aid the Defendant.  Accord Resolution Trust Corp. v. Lopez, 794 F. Supp. 1, 3 
(D.D.C. 1992). 
Thus, there are two alternative grounds for holding that Defendant’s assertion of the Fifth 
Amendment privilege to production of tax returns is invalid:  (1) the tax returns are in the 
Defendant further appears to argue that the “required records” exception should be limited to 
“highly regulated business (e.g., physicians)”, citing In re Dr. John Doe, 97 F.R.D. 640, 641-643 
(S.D.N.Y. 1982).  In Dr. John Doe, however, the Court held contrary to Defendant’s assertion 
and consistent with the case law cited herein stating, “[w]e agree that some of these records (e.g. 
W-2 and other tax forms) may indeed fall within the required records exception.”  Id. at 644 
(ordering that Dr. Doe comply with subpoena for W-2 forms).  
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 4 of 10

possession of the government, their existence is a foregone conclusion, and there is no risk of 
“implicit authentication” by Defendant’s production of these documents; or (2) tax returns fall 
within the “required records” exception to the act of production doctrine, and are thus not 
protected by the Fifth Amendment.  Under either of these grounds, the Defendant’s tax returns 
are not privileged and must be produced in discovery.  
II. 
THERE IS NO HEIGHTENED BURDEN 
FOR DISCOVERY OF TAX RETURNS 
Defendant asserts that there is a heightened burden on a party seeking discovery of tax 
returns, requiring that party to show not only relevance, but also that “a compelling need for the 
tax returns exists because the information contained therein is not otherwise available.”  (Appeal, 
p. 24).  However, in the Eleventh Circuit this heightened burden has been rejected. “[T]he 
Eleventh Circuit does not require a showing of compelling need before tax information may be 
obtained by a party in discovery.” Bellosa v. Universal Tile Restoration, Inc., 2008 WL 2620735 
(S.D. Fla. 2008) (citing Maddow v. Procter & Gamble Co., 107 F.3d 846 (11th Cir. 1997)); 
accord U.S. v. Certain Real Property, 444 F.Supp. 2d 1258 (S.D.Fla. 2006); Platypus Wear, Inc. 
v. Clarke Modet & Co., 2008 W.L. 728540 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Preferred Care Partners Holding 
Corp. v. Humana, Inc., 2008 WL 4500258 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Ruskin Co. v. Greenheck Fan Corp., 
2009 WL 383349 (S.D. Fla. 2009).  Significantly, in both Preferred Care and Ruskin the Court 
affirmed the decision of a Magistrate Judge rejecting a higher standard for production of tax 
returns, holding that, despite an arguable split of authority, 2 the Magistrate Judge’s decision was 
not “contrary to law.”  Id.  Likewise, the Magistrate Judge’s decision in this case compelling 
Defendant relies upon Pendlebury v. Starbucks Coffee Co., 2008 WL 2105024 (S.D. Fla. 2005) 
and Dunkin Donuts, Inc. v. Mary’s Donuts, Inc., 2001 WL 34079319 (S.D. Fla. 2001), in which 
the Court applied the higher standard.  These cases do not consider the Eleventh Circuit’s 
opinion in Maddow, and the federal judges in this District over the past five years since 
Pendlebury have consistently rejected the “compelling need” standard for production of tax 
returns.  See cases cited above.  
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 5 of 10

production of tax returns is consistent with authority in this District and the Eleventh Circuit, and 
thus should be affirmed.  
III. 
EVIDENCE OF DEFENDANT’S FINANCIAL 
STATUS AND HISTORY IS RELEVANT TO  
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AMONG OTHER ISSUES 
Defendant does not go so far as to contend that the discovery of his tax returns is not 
relevant under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26.  Defendant only argues that the Magistrate Judge did not address 
the relevancy standard in her Order.  (Appeal, p. 25).  As a result, Defendant does nothing to 
show that the Magistrate Judge’s Order as to tax returns is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.  
In any event, it is abundantly clear that Defendant’s financial status and history are relevant to 
punitive damages, among other issues in these cases, and in this regard the Defendant’s tax 
returns are pertinent and discoverable.  Tennant v. Charlton, 377 So.2d 1169 (Fla. 1979) (holding 
that party may obtain tax returns for purposes of net worth discovery on issue of punitive 
damages).  See also State v. O’Malley, 53 S.W. 3d 623 (Mo. App. 2001) (“[i]t is well settled that 
when a plaintiff seeks punitive damages against a defendant, evidence of the defendant’s 
financial status is both relevant and admissible”); Interstate Narrow Fabrics, Inc. v. Century 
USA, Inc., 2004 WL 444570 (M.D. N.C. 2004) (holding that tax returns are relevant to the jury’s 
determination of the amount of punitive damages to award); E.J. Lavino & Co. v. Universal 
Health Services, Inc., 1991 WL 275767 (E.D. Pa. 1991) (“[m]ost courts that have considered this 
issue have held that a plaintiff seeking punitive damages may discovery information pertaining 
to a defendant’s net worth”).  
Defendant further argues that he should not have to produce his tax returns until “it 
becomes apparent” that “punitive damages will be an issue.”  (Appeal, p. 26).  This argument 
ignores Florida law on punitive damages.  It is well established that “punitive damages are 
always recoverable in intentional tort cases where malice is one of the essential elements of the 
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 6 of 10

tort.”  Ciamar Marcay, Inc. v. Monteiro Da Costa, 508 So.2d 1282 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987) 
(emphasis supplied).  “In Florida it is clear that an act of intentional assault and battery 
committed without legal justification supplies proof of malice.”  Joab, Inc. v. Thrall, 245 So.2d 
291 (Fla. 3d DCA 1971).  Therefore, it is clear in this intentional tort case that punitive damages 
are an issue.  As this Court knows, Defendant Epstein is alleged to have perpetrated a plan and 
scheme to sexually molest dozens of underage teenage girls.3 
Even assuming that the “compelling need” standard were applicable for discovery of tax 
returns, clearly in this case there is a compelling need. Defendant has provided no net worth 
discovery, asserting a blanket Fifth Amendment privilege.4   Defendant nonetheless contends that 
there exists an “alternative” - not to discovery of the necessary information, but through his offer 
to “stipulate” to a net worth in the nine figures.  Of course, a stipulation requires the consent of 
the parties and there is no agreement in this case on the Defendant’s net worth.  Defendant 
cannot unilaterally by fiat claim a certain net worth for purposes of trial.5  The law is well 
established that a jury may determine punitive damages “by exacting from [the defendant’s] 
pocketbook a sum of money which, according to his financial ability, will hurt, but not 
Defendant’s reliance on Gallina v. Commerce and Industry Ins., 2008 WL 3895918 (M.D. Fla. 
2008) is misplaced.  Gallina is an insurance bad faith case and does not involve a claim of 
punitive damages against an intentional tortfeasor. Moreover, in the present case it would make 
no sense to have a different “stage” for punitive damages discovery or trial.   
“[T]he burden to identify an alternative source of the information lies with the resisting party.”  
Interstate Narrow Fabrics, 2004 WL 444570 at *2.  Here, Epstein’s blanket Fifth Amendment 
privilege assertion to all net worth discovery makes it clear that there is a compelling need for 
any net worth discovery not protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege.  
Defendant relies upon Myers v. Central Florida Investment, Inc., 592 F.3d 1201 (11th Cir. 
2010) for its “stipulation” argument.  In Myers, however, the district court heard testimony 
regarding each of the defendant’s net worth.  There was no unilateral statement of net worth in 
Myers as Defendant wishes to create in the instant case.   To the extent that Defendant relies 
upon the Court’s holding in Myers regarding the reasonableness of the trial court’s award of 
punitive damages, the issue of reasonableness is determined by the particular facts and 
circumstances of the case and the discussion in Myers of this issue has no relevance here. Id.  
Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 7 of 10

bankrupt.”  Joab, Inc. v. Thrall, 245 So.2d 291 (Fla. 3d DCA 1971) (emphasis supplied).  
Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to discovery on the Defendant’s real net worth so that the jury 
will be in a position to make an award that “will hurt”.   In any event, it seems beyond dispute 
that Defendant’s tax returns are relevant and discoverable, either under a straight relevance test 
under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 or a heightened “compelling need” standard. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to Defendant’s production of 
tax returns in response to Plaintiffs’ document request no. 1 are not clearly erroneous and not 
contrary to law.  As a result, the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to production of tax returns should 
be affirmed.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ document 
request no. 1 be ordered to be produced forthwith.

to Quash and Motion for Attorneys' fees and Costs, With Incorporated Memorandum Of 
Law. In support, Defendant states as follows: 
1. As this Court is well aware, these cases have been consolidated for discovery. 
However, on April 1, 2010, Plaintiffs counsel, Spencer Kuvin, filed C.L. v. Epstein, 
Case No. 10-80447-cv-Marra/Johnson, and that case has not been consolidated with the 
other related cases for purposes of discovery. 
2. On April 20, 2010, Mr. Kuvin served Maritza Milagros Vasquez with a subpoena 
for deposition, which is set to occur tomorrow. See Exhibit "A". However, this Notice 
and subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed as Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his 
client, has failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 (d). That rule states, in pertinent part, 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010   Page 2 of 9
j 
that: "[a] party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred 
as required by Rule 26(t) .... " Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, has not complied with 
Rule 26(t) and, therefore, the subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed and a 
Protective Order should be entered pursuant to Rule 26( c) forbidding the deposition from 
occurring for non-compliance with the applicable rules. In Varo, Inc. v. Litton Systems, 
Inc., 129 F.R.D. 139, 141 (N.D. TX 1989), the court held that one cannot be compelled to 
comply with a withdrawn subpoena. Id. Likewise, the court here cannot compel Maritza 
Milagros Vasquez to attend any deposition when the subpoena itself is invalid, especially 
when it will require those involved in these matters to incur substantial attorneys' fees. 
3. Next, Mr. Brad Edwards, counsel for Jane Doe, cross-noticed Maritza Milagros 
Vasquez's deposition in Jane Doe (#08-80893 - Exhibit "B"), which matter is already set 
for trial in July 2010. 
Discovery concluded on May 31, 2010 (see DE 531). 
Accordingly, the cross notice served by Jane Doe must be stricken/quashed and a 
protective order entered because the subpoena itself in invalid due to C.L.'s counsel's 
failure to comply with Rule 26(d) and discovery in Jane Doe (80893) has concluded. 
Rule 7 .1 Certification 
I hereby certify that counsel for the respective parties communicated by e-mail in a 
good faith effort to resolve the issues set forth above prior to the filing of this Motion and 
none of the issues were resolved. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court enter an order granting 
. 
Defendant's motion for protective order and motion to quash. Defendant further requests 
that this Court award his attorney's fees and costs associated with this motion, m 
accordance with Rule 37, Fed.R.Civ.P. and applicable Local Rules and specifically: 
a. Quash CL's subpoena attached as Exhibit "A"; 
1I

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010   Page 3 of 9
b. Quash and/or strike Jane Doe's cross notice as to Exhibit "A" because 
Exhibit "A" is invalid and discovery has concluded in Jane Doe; 
c. Award attorneys to Defendant for CL and Jane Doe's noncompliance with 
these discovery matters; and 
d. for such other and further relief as this co

herewith involved, however, with the full and unfettered cooperation of the federal 
agencies now involved in this matter, following the posting by Morse of $15,000,000.00 
associated wi1h the seizme of the funds located in the Caymans, all other bond umounts

PETITIONERS' MOTION FOR EMERGENCY WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
Petitioners, EDWARD MORSE and CAROL MORSE, by and through their undersigned 
counsel, file this, their Motion for Emergency Writ of Mandamus and would state as follows: 
l. 
This matter is before this Honorable Court on an Emergency Writ of Mandamus. 
2. 
This matter and the entire file below have been presented to the court as SEALED 
pursuant to prior order of the Court below. 
3. 
This matter is pending before the Honorable United States District Court Judge, 
Kenneth Marra. 
4. 
On March 25, 2009 and on April 23, 2009, Judge Marra entered detailed orders 
in this matter, copies of which are attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein. 
5. 
As set forth in the Orders, Judge Marra ordered that cert,ain specific acts take 
place on certain specific dates. Many of these acts involved return of a large sum of money to the 
Plaintiffs.

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 20-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/16/2010   Page 15 of 22
6. 
Upon receipt of the orders, the undersigned began to put into place all actions 
·necessary to timely comply with·said orders. 
7. 
In hearings held subsequent to the entry of these orders, it became abundantly 
clear to the undersigned that Judge Marra was in some way uncomfortable with his orders and 
was either staying th\l orders or reversing his prior decisions by vacating the orders. 
8. 
Howe:ver, despite continuous inquiry by the undersigned, counsel was unable to 
determine what Judge Marra intended to do and how he intended to proceed. 
9. 
A thorough review of the record below which is available to this Court under seal 
clearly indicates that the undersigned, as counsel for the plaintiff had significant basis for 
concern based upon comments and ore tenus rulings made by Judge Marra in the court below. 
I 0. 
Most importantly, as can be seen by the sealed record now before this court, when 
the undersigned spei;ifically inquired of the Court as to whether he was permitted to move 
forward with the on:jers entered on M~h 25th and April 23ro , the courts responses to the 
undersigned are non-descriptive and completely without guidance at best. 
. 
. 
11. 
Wben the undersigned inquired of the court below further and specifically asked 
the court whether the orders were stayed, vacated, reversed or in full force and effect, the court 
clearly replied that the. court believes it had made itself clear. 
12. 
Not wanting to viol.ate a court order of a respected district court judge, the 
under~igned detennined that" the only course of conduct rem~g in order to protect his clients' 
rights was to file an Emergency Writ of Mandamus with this court 
13. 
ft is the position of the Plaintiffs that they have a clear and unwavering legal right 
to the relief awarded them in the courts orders as set forth herein.

14. 
Moreover, it is without doubt that the undersigned bad every right to be concerned 
with the ore tenus rulings of the court bel9w which post c!JJ,ted the orders in question. 
15. 
As an officer of the court, the undersigned has a direct responsibility to zealously 
protect the rights of his client. And, as an officer of the court, the undersigned has il direct 
responsibility to fully and completely obey the orders of court and when, he is given reason to 
doubt the efficacy of subsequent orders of court that appear to taint the order in question, to 
attempt to ascertain the validity of said order. That is exactly what the undersigned has done 
here. 
16. 
Upon determining that the validity of the orders in question were in doubt, and 
upon detennining that he could not proceed without further order of a higher cou,t, this 
Emergency Writ was filed. 
17. 
Plaintifls have a clear legal right to the relief specifically set forth in the or,lers in 
question. 
I 8. 
The court below had an indisputable duty to act but failed to do so and failed to 
given the undersigned any guidance. 
. 
~ '' 
19. 
At this stage in the proceedings, the Plaintiffs have no other remedy at Jaw other 
than this Writ. 
20. 
1f this writ is not entered in Plaintiffs favor, the Plaintiffs will suffer unfair 
prejudice as a matte, of law.

contrary, made multiple ore tenus rulings on the record which gave counsel for Plaintiff 
clear room for pause in following said orders. 
3. 
In multiple subsequent hearings, Plaintiffs counsel clearly attempted to 
ascertain whether the orders stood as entered or whether they had been reversed or 
stayed. Based upon our full and complete review of the record it became clear that Judge 
Marra had no intention of proceeding as he previously ordered and was either reversing 
or staying his prior orders as set forth above. Whichever his intention is not for this Court 
to decide. We simply review this matter as it is presented to us, to wit; lawful orders were 
• entered and then Vacated or stayed for no clear and convincing reason and without a 
stated basis in law or fact. We make no finding whether Judge Marra was correct in his 
conclusion, but simply that the record lacked the thoroughness and completeness that is 
mandated when reversing orders of this lllJlgnitude. 
4. 
Thus, we find that counsel for Plaintiff properly and timely filed a sealed 
Emergency Writ of Mandamus with this Court in an attempt to properly protect his 
clients rights under the order. 
Conclusions of Law 
l. 
This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to tl,e laws 
conlTO!ling Writs of Mandamus 
2. 
This matter is properly before this court 
3. 
The findings of Judge Marra in the court below, in the orders dated March 
and Apr:! 23, 2009, are well based in fact and law. 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 20-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/16/2010   Page 20 of 22
4. 
The subsequent ore tenus rulings of Judge Marra are without basis in law 
or fact. 
5. 
The subsequent ore tenus rulings by Judge Marra fail to provide a 
sufficient record, as mandated by the rules of court, to allow this court to enter a ruling as 
to whether Judge M?JTa had the legal right to stay or reverse his prior order. 
6. 
Plaintiffs writ of mandamus is legally sufficient to allow this court to 
rule in full on all matters pending before it. 
Thus, we as a Court with jurisdiction over this matter find as follows: 
7. 
Judge Marra's prior orders are hereby reinstated and remain in full force 
and effect. To the extent that the later order conflicts with the earlier order, the later order 
shall prevail and control. 
8. 
Judge Marra's concerns regarding protection of the Governments role in 
this matter are wen founded in both law and fact. We specifically defer furiher comroent 
on this portion of th.is matter to maintain the integrity of the governments investigation. 
9. 
As a matter of procedure we note that a confidentiality order remains in 
full force and effect l1i this matter. We specifically mandate that our rulings herein shall 
have no effect, whatsoever, on said order and th.at same shall remain in full force and 
effect in perpetuity. We again strongly caution all counsel and mandate that they caution 
and counsel their respect,ve clients that this matter is governed by a strict confidentiality 
order that th..is court hereby holds shall remain in foil force and effect and which this court 
si:rongl:f cautions, contains severe prnalt:es for any violation of same.

l 0. 
This order and the complete sealed record shall be forwarded to the 
Department of Treasury, forthwith. The clerk of this court is ordered to expedite same. 
Sealed instructions shall be provided by this court to the Clerk. 
l 1. 
The Department of Treasu.ry is ordered to expeditiously review the

Writ has been granted in full and that be is free to comply fully and completely with 
Judge Marra's orders. A copy of this order shall fuen be provided to all counsel of record. 
12. 
This order shall not be fumished to any counsel of record until such time 
as the Department of Treasury has. completed its review of the sealed record and has 
forwarded said letter as mandated above th.is court. Th.is order is self executing and thus, 
nothing need be brought back before this court on any of these issues.

L.M., 
V. 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CIV-81092- MARRNJOHNSON 
Plaintiff, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendants. 
I 
EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT 
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), moves to 
dismiss the Complaint (DE #1) filed by Plaintiff, L.M. due to her failure to serve the Complaint 
on Epstein within the time specified in Rule 4(m), and states: 
I. 
On July 24, 2009, L.M. filed a two hundred thirty-four (234) page, one hundred 
fifty-six (156) count Complaint (DE#!) against Epstein. 
2. 
Each of the one hundred fifty-six (I 56) counts is a separate cause of action pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. §2255. 
3. 
The Complaint was filed by Bradley J. Edwards while he was employed by the now 
defunct Rothstein, Rosenfeldt & Adler firm. 
4. 
However, this Complaint served no legal purpose whatsoever in that at the time the 
Complaint was filed LM had a pending state court action (which is still currently pending) seeking 
damages under theories other than the exclusive remedies in 18 U.S.C. §2255. See L.M. v. Jeffrey 
Epstein, Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMB in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm 
Beach County, Florida. 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/16/2010   Page 2 of 6
L.M. v. Epstein 
Case No. 09-CIV-81092-Marra/Johnson 
Page 2 
5. 
This Complaint was never served on Epstein within the time required by Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 4(m) and should therefore be dismissed. Epstein files this motion for the sole purpose of having 
the cause dismissed and not to subject himself to service. More importantly, the Complaint may 
have been used by Scott Rothstein and the criminal enterprise Rothstein, Rosenfeldt & Adler, P.A., 
("RRA") (so identified by the United States of America in 
U.S. v. Rothstein, Case No. 09-
6033 I CR-Cohn, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida), in connection with his massive 
Ponzi scheme, which sold investments in fabricated settlements and cases (see infra). 
BACKGROUND 
6. 
The Complaint (DE #1) was filed on July 24, 2009, four months before RRA's 
$1.2 billion Ponzi scheme was exposed in November 2009 and the RRA firm imploded. 
7. 
The U.S government brought an action for Racketeering Conspiracy, Money 
Laundering Conspiracy, Mail and Wire Fraud Conspiracy and Wire Fraud against its chairman 
and CEO, Scott W. Rothstein, for using RRA to run a Ponzi scheme. See Information (DE #1) filed 
in U.S. v. Rothstein, Case No. 09-60331 CR-Cohn, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida. 
8. 
The Information asserts that "RRA was utilized by [Rothstein] ... to unlawfully 
obtain approximately $1.2 billion from investors by fraud in connection with an investment scheme 
commonly known as a 'Ponzi' scheme, in which new investors' funds are utilized to pay previous 
investors in the absence of any underlying security, legitimate investment vehicle or other 
commodity." The Information references Rothstein and other unidentified "co-conspirators". See 
Information ,r6 (DE #1) in Case No. 09-60331CR-Cohn. 
9. 
Rothstein conducted the Ponzi scheme "by fraudulently inducing investors through 
the use of false statements, documents, and computer records to . . . invest funds based upon 
anticipated pay-outs from purported confidential settlement agreement which had been reached 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/16/2010   Page 3 of 6
L.M. v. Epstein 
Case No. 09-CIV-81092-Marra/Johnson 
Page 3 
between and among certain individuals .... " See Information if7A (DE #1) in Case No. 09-60331CR-
Cohn. 
10. 
Rothstein manufactured false and fraudulent Court opinions/orders including forging 
the signature of U.S. District Judge, Kenneth A. Marra and U.S. Circuit Court Judge, Susan H. Black, 
Ith Circuit in other cases (attached as Exhibit 1 hereto). 
11. 
At Rothstein's June 9, 2010 sentencing hearing, Judge James Cohn departed 
upward from the government's recommendation of 40 years and sentenced Rothstein to 50 years; 
the underlying basis for this upward departure was quoted to be: 
He forged these court orders [referring to the Morse case] to 
perpetrate the Ponzi scheme. 
There can be no conduct more 
reviled than a lawyer perpetrating a fraud on the court. 
12. 
Epstein sued Rothstein, Bradley Edwards and LM for their participation in the 
aforementioned Ponzi scheme in the case styled Epstein v. Rothstein, et al., Case No. 
502009CA040800XXXXMBAG, in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, 
Florida. 
13. 
Specifically, Epstein alleged that Rothstein used the cases against Epstein (Jane Doe 
v. Epstein, Case No. 08-CIV-80893, U.S.D.C. S.D. Fla., L.M. v. Epstein, Case No. 
502008CA028051XXXXMB AB in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit; and E.W. v. Epstein, Case No. 
502008CA028058XXXXMB AB in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit) as "bait" to lure potential 
investors. 
See 
Complaint 
,r20 
in 
Epstein 
v. 
Rothstein, 
et 
al., 
Case 
No. 
502009CA040800XXXXMBAG. In addition, Epstein alleged that "ROTHSTEIN attempted to lure 
the entity known as D3 Capital Club, LLC, ("D3"), by offering D3 'the opportunity' to invest in 
a pre-suit $30,000,000.00 court settlement against EPSTEIN; yet this supposed settlement never 
existed and was entirely fabricated." Id. if28. 

Case 9:09-cv-81092-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/16/2010   Page 4 of 6
L.M. v. Epstein 
Case No. 09-CIV-81092-Marra/Johnson 
Page4 
14. 
Consistent with Rothstein's Ponzi scheme, the Complaint makes a number of 
false allegations and may have been shown to investors as part of the Ponzi scheme. These 
include: 
a. LM was identified as a victim by the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office in a criminal 
investigation against Epstein. See DE #1119. However, LM was not on the FBl's or 
U.S. Attorney's "list" referenced in paragraph 19 of the Complaint. 
b. Epstein "coerc[ ed] or fore[ ed] the then-minor L.M. to perform oral sex on him." See 
DE #1 19, However, in her September 24, 2009 deposition LM testified under oath 
(at page 71), that she never had oral sex with Epstein. 
c. Epstein "knowingly transported L.M. and other minors in interstate commerce with 
the intent that the [sic] L.M. engage in prostitution ... " See DE #1 112. However, in 
her February 9, 2010 deposition LM testified under oath (at page 611) she never 
traveled with Epstein. 
15. 
Counsel for L.M. also should know that this action does not and cannot benefit 
from the Non-Prosecution Agreement ("NPA") referenced in the Complaint. L.M. has not 
exclusively pursued 18 U.S.C. §2255 remedies against Epstein in that L.M. has other pending 
litigation where she seeks damages from various state court claims. 
THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THE COMPLAINT 
16. 
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), "[i]fa defendant is not served within 120 days after 
the complaint is filed, the court - on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff - must dismiss 
the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified 
time." (Emphasis added).

L.M. v. Epstein 
Case No. 09-CIV-8 l 092 - Marra/Johnson 
Page 5 
17. 
Epstein requests that the Court dismiss the Complaint (DE #1) due to LM's 
failure to timely effect service pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) and because the Complaint may 
have been used as part of the RRA Ponzi scheme and serves no other legitimate purpose. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, requests the Court enter an order 
dismissing the Complaint (DE #1) and grant any additional relief the Court deems just and 
proper.
