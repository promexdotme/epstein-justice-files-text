day, you were calling for some edits that really reflected --
seemed to reflect a real discomfort --
A 
Q 
-- as you identify. 
A 
Again, I'm perhaps supporting -- I'm supporting the 
point you're trying to make that we were focused on getting 
this done, and real concern that he would not go to jail. 
And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did 
the focus on, let's just get this done and get a jail term, 
mean that we didn't take a step back and say, let's evaluate 
how this train is moving? 
Q 
You --
A 
From my perspective. 
Q 
Okay. I want to just sort of round out the little 
bit of this -- the state -- the state only resolution. You 
used the term a couple of times backstopping. What do you 
mean by that? 
A 
What I mean by that is, a sense that the state 
wasn't doing enough, and perhaps backstopping is a polite way 
of saying encouraging the state to do a little bit more. 
Q 
MM-hmm. All right. Did you have any discussions 
about whether this disposition comported with the Ashcroft 
memo in that you were hunting to the state for a minor 
charge, for a fairly minor charge, what you -- your office 
had already understood from the evidence was a quite wide 
EFTA00009016

ranging scheme of predatory, my term, behavior regarding 
minor victims? 
A 
So, I don't recall a discussion around the Ashcroft 
memo. I would characterize what we did differently, in that 
there are any number of instances where the federal 
government or the state government can proceed, and state 
charges are substantially less and different, and on a fairly 
regular basis, the federal government allows the state 
no: 
allows, but stands aside and lets the state proceed. 
Q 
But in this case, you actually had an active 
investigation that had been proceeding for a year. 
A 
So, let's take the drug context, where there might 
be any number of active investigations where the federal 
charges can be rather substantial, but ultimately, the 
Q 
But the state goes forward with what? 
A 
Forward with different charges that -- that have a 
lesser term. And so, I don't think it's unusual. We can 
talk about, you know, whether this was the best disposition 
or not, but I don't think it's unusual to have fact patterns 
that are under investigation that proceed in state court, 
federal government says just let the state proceed with this, 
or violent crime cases where the federal government could 
bring gun charges using felon in possession or another 
mandatory minimum, but the state goes forward with -- so, in 
that sense --
EFTA00009017

Page 202 
where the disposition is different than -- and would have 
been if it had proceeded in federal court. 
Q 
All right. Do you have anything on that? 
: On the two years, or something else? 
: No. I'm going back to the two 
years. 
: Okay. 
BY 
Q 
Did you think -- did you believe at the time, if 
this was part of your thinking, that because it was so 
important to get sex offender registration, and even later 
developed damages -- monetary damages for the victims, under 
the state plea arrangement, that pretty much the only thing 
that the government had -- the federal government had to give 
up in this negotiation was jail time? If you wanted -- you 
wanted --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- three things --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- you've said, jail time, sex offender status, and 
some kind of restitution or damages --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- mechanisms. Sex offender registration, there's 
no -- really no give there. You either register or you 
don't. I'm being binary --
EFTA00009018

Page 203 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- again, I'm sorry. 
A 
But it is binary, so --
Q 
It is binary. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And likewise, the --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- monetary recovery provisions. So, really, the 
only thing to negotiate is time, right? 
A 
And so, your question is why did we not start at 
three so we ended up at two? 
Q 
Well, that's -- that's -- that's a consequence of 
what --
A 
So --
Q 
-- I was asking. 
A 
So, again, my recollection is I understood this to 
reflect what he would have received as opposed to some 
arbitrary, let's start at three so we end up at two. I 
also -- I'm sorry, you have a question? 
Q 
No, go ahead. Go ahead. I'll get to my question. 
A 
You know, I also -- from my perspective, was, you 
know, early on when we set firm on the two years, I thought 
two years would have been the right outcome. We ended up on 
months. I can't say how. There's some documents that 
might help, but I -- but I was at least initially firm on 
EFTA00009019

Page 204 
those two years. 
Q 
Right, so you -- when you say, I thought the two 
years was the right amount, is that based on your 
understanding that that's what he would have gotten in the 
state? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
That -- and the point I'm trying to convey there is 
that this wasn't, to my understanding, a random number, but 
it was informed by, this is what he would have received, and 
therefore it is a reasonable -- agree or disagree with the 
analysis, but it was an informed number to begin with. 
BY 
Q 
But you don't recall how that analysis was done, or 
who conducted --
A 
Q 
-- that analysis? 
A 
-- don't recall that. 
BY -: 
Q 
Or even whether it was accurate, actually? 
A 
I -- again, I don't recall that. 
Q 
All right. 
BY 
Q 
And I understand the explanation. 
A 
Right. 
EFTA00009020

Page 205 
Q 
And --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- what it's tied to, but was there any 
consideration -- because this case --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was not about one or two victims. It was a very 
large scheme by this older, wealthy man, to essentially turn 
minors into prostitutes, have sex with them, oral sex, get 
other people involved. 
You've described it in prior statements as 
grotesque and deserving of punishment. What I'm not hearing 
through this process is anybody taking a look at this overall 
conduct, and saying, what is the appropriate punishment for 
this man's conduct? Was there such a consideration, and did 
you feel that two years adequately punished him for the scope 
of his conduct? 
A 
Fair question, and perhaps going back to where we 
started, which is petite. To my mind at the time, there was 
a distinction between what would be the adequate punishment 
if this was a purely federal case, versus what is necessary 
so that it is not a -- to put it in petite language 
a 
manifest injustice, so that it wouldn't have come to the 
office in the first place. 
And that I think is the important distinction, 
because if the two years is what he would have received, and 
EFTA00009021

Page 206 
therefore it would not have come into the office under 
petite, then if there is a state disposition to that, that is 
one possible outcome. 
It would be a different outcome if this was truly a 
federal pro=section independent of the state, which goes back 
to the point I was making about concern about a federal 
precedent with this kind of sentence, because then when the 
next person comes along, they say, well, here is this 
precedent under 371, or whatnot. 
And so, this was, rightly or wrongly, and I 
understand the -- the pushback -- an analysis that 
distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest 
injustice, versus what is the appropriate federal outcome to 
that. Agree or disagree with the logic is one thing, but did 
I explain the logic? 
Q 
You've -- yes, you've explained the logic. 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
And I'm going to push back a little bit --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- on that, because the petite policy specifically 
says it does not apply where the state conduct is only a 
minor part -- an insignificant part of the entire course of 
conduct, and they give examples about where you have some 
type of a RICO scheme, and the state has indicted or 
convicted the perpetrator based on something that could be 
EFTA00009022

one single overt act in the government's conspiracy, and 
doesn't that really show what is going on here, that what the 
state had done was really just a small, minor part of this 
scheme that the federal government had a --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- had a real opportunity to punish him for this 
entire course of conduct? 
A 
So, possibly, but if I can circle back to your 
question previously, it's interesting that you characterize 
this as, he's turning these girls into prostitutes, and then 
I think that's really interesting, because in 2019, 13 years 
afterwards, despite all the changes in the law, there is 
still some element somewhere that says he's turning these 
girls into prostitutes, whereas this was a typical 
trafficking case of the kind that you'd see in the Lou De 
Baca days where, you know, it was called modern day slavery. 
That's a very different fact pattern. 
So, you know, a girl that's held captive, is forced 
to service multiple men per day, where this is part of an 
ongoing business arrangement. And so, I hear what you're 
saying, but if here at this table at least some element of 
that characterization is live, what would it mean in 2006 
when these laws are still being developed? And that 
consideration, rightly or wrongly, was part of this analysis. 
BY 
EFTA00009023

Q 
Was it explicitly -- in other words, was -- was 
that aspect of it, the -- I -- the perception that this was 
perhaps activity that -- in which the victims cooperated? 
Was that part of the --
S 
A 
No, no. Let me -- let me distinguish. I didn't 
say the perception that this was activities in which the 
victims cooperated. What I was going to -- what I -- and 
I've gone to before is, would jurors -- is there at least one 
juror that might say, look, we've got conflicting victim 
testimony. 
1.1 
Some of them said he did nothing wrong. They all 
knew each other. They kept going back and taking payment. 
Is this trafficking, or is this prostitution? I'm not --
not saying I agree with that, and I don't think -- I don't 
think prosecutors do, I'm saying is there -- is there at 
least a possibility of that? And --
Q 
Was that articulated to you by the people you were 
listening to by 
and --
A 
So --
A 
So, that certainly was part of the discussions when 
I talk about the victim issues, would at least some jurors 
view it that way, rightly or wrongly? 
Q 
And you recall having that -- those --
A 
EFTA00009024

Page 
Q 
-- conversations? 
A 
I recall having not only how would the witnesses 
stand up in court, but how would jurors view them? And then 
the second part of that is, as it goes up in the appellate 
process with respect to the -- the federal nexus. And so, I 
hear you, but you know, I -- it's -- it's sort of one of the 
factors. And so --
BY 
Q 
And so --
A 
Q 
-- what I'm getting though is that there didn't 
seem like there was a consideration or discussion about, is 
this two years capturing the scope of his conduct, versus, 
we're just going to tie it to this potential state crime that 
could have been charged? 
.6 
A 
Fair, and I would -- I would say that the two years 
was not meant -- so, the petite policy has several prongs, 
and to my recollection, the petite analysis was not based 
on -- and let's not even call it petite analysis. That 
overstates it. 
But it was much more of a, is this a manifest 
injustice, and -- and if the original -- and so, you sort of 
see it in the Exhibit 3. This would not have been brought to 
the office in the first place if -- you know, if he had plead 
to jail time and registration, and rightly or wrongly, that 
EFTA00009025

Page 210 
was understood from the very beginning of the case, and was a 
factor in how the case was viewed. 
Q 
And how do you know that it wouldn't have -- that 
wouldn't have been upset with a minimal jail 
time, even if there was sex registration? 
A 
So, I can't 12 years later say how we knew that. I 
: They did. 
THE WITNESS: I can't speak for certain, but you 
probably have that from the record, and that when they 
changed the ASA involved and took it to grand jury, the 
charges that came back were substantially less. 
BY 
Q 
Do you remember the circumstances? Did you know 
the circumstances under which that ASA was changed? 
A 
I don't know. 
Q 
All right. The -- by the way, do you remember an 
occasion in which 
came to your office in Miami 
to press you on what was going to be happening with the 
can say that my -- my general impression was that this was 
proceeding at the state, that there were certain charges, and 
that those charges changed when it went to a grand jury, and 
that it went from -- I think they even changed the ASA 
involved. 
federal case? 
A 
I don't recall. 
• 
EFTA00009026

Q 
You don't recall. I --
: Just one more, 
: Yeah. 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
BY 
Q 
So, before we --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- leave this --
Yeah. 
Q 
-- one little thing. So, if this case had come 
into the federal system as apart from the --
Ficht. 
Q 
-- taken the digression through the --
A 
Rlunt. 
-- state system, do you think that the two years 
was an appropriate punishment, given the scope of his 
conduct? 
A 
I think if it had come into the federal system 
apart from the whole state and the petite considerations and 
all that, we may have ended up in a different place. I 
viewed the two years, to my recollection, as a manifest 
injustice standard, and not an appropriate punishment 
standard. 
Q 
Meaning whether it was manifestly unjust that he 
get two years? 
EFTA00009027

Page 212 
A 
No, whether it was -- so, let me -- let me -- let 
me rephrase. No jail time was a manifest injustice. If he 
had gone to jail for two years in the state system and 
registered, the question of whether it would have come to the 
office at all, and to my recollection, the consensus was, and 
based on Exhibit 3, agrees with that, that it would 
never have come to the office in the first place, because we 
would not view that under petite as a manifest injustice. 
There are any number of cases that are prosecuted 
around the country where an individual gets a jail time that 
the federal government may not agree with, but that doesn't 
mean that the federal government reprosecutes those cases. 
The instances where the federal government reprosecutes a 
state case are pretty rare, to my knowledge. 
And so, under the petite standard, and the 
petite -- the manifest injustice would -- it would have been 
a manifest injustice to have zero jail time, and zero 
registration, but if the original charges had remained, that 
would be a different matter. That does not mean that that is 
the best outcome in the state system. 
and so, perhaps beating a -- you know, an issue, 
but let me maybe give an example. One concern that I had was 
that in the violent crime side, the state brings a case, and 
you know, there is a deferment, no jail time. The state then 
brings a second case, and there's minimal jail time. Well, 
EFTA00009028

Page 213 
now the person has done three violent crimes, they have a 
gun, they go federal, and it's like, please don't do that. 
Pretty please don't do that. 
You know, we're going to punish you a little bit, 
and then all of a sudden in comes the federal government with 
the big, big punch to the face, because the federal sentences 
are so different than the state sentences. And that happens 
all the time in any number of contexts in Florida. That 
doesn't mean that all of those cases get reprosecuted as gun 
cases in Florida. 
That means that we understand that the Florida 
system is different than the federal system. And so, the way 
we looked at, at least based on my recollection, those two 
years was not, what would he have received if this was a 
purely federal case, but would this case have been prosecuted 
by the federal system additionally if he had received jail 
time and registration in the state system? 
Q 
And would -- is it fair to say that this particular 
concern about, for lack of a better word, federalism or the 
petite policy, was that a primary concern of yours versus any 
of your employees in terms of 
or 
A 
I think it's fair to say that I focused more on the 
legal side of things, and my team focused more on the trial 
and how this would play out at trial, and both of them 
both of them sort of informed the outcome. 
EFTA00009029

Page 214 
Q 
And are you including this petite policy in your 
consideration of the legal issues? 
A 
Yes. Yeah. I think those are all tied together. 
BY 
Q 
So, you mentioned victim --
A 
But -- but could I -- could I --
Q 
Yes. 
A 
But to clarify, I thought we had sufficient to go 
forward so it wasn't an ethical violation to proceed. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. Okay. The victim -- you mentioned the 
victims coming into state court, and you talked about all the 
victims coming into state court. Do you have any idea what 
victims formed the basis for the original charge that --
A 
I do not. 
Q 
-- he was indicted on? Do you know whether it was 
one -- was it a felony assault pros of a non-minor. 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
It could have been -- it was three instances to 
felonize it. You don't know whether it was one person three 
times, three people? 
A 
I do not. 
Q 
And you don't know whether that person was a minor 
or not? 
A 
I do not. 
Q 
All right. 
EFTA00009030

Page 215 
A 
I would assume they were, but I do not. 
Q 
Likewise, do you know who was the victim, or who 
the victims were who formed the basis for the 796.03 charge 
to which Epstein ultimately pled in June of 2008? 
A 
I did not at the time. I've read various accounts 
of that, but that's based on matters that I've read and not 
an independent recollection. 
Q 
And what's your understanding? 
A 
My understanding is that there's some 
that there 
is at least some issue in the media over whether the -- the 
right or the best victims were chosen from the prosecution's 
perspective. 
Q 
And do you know -- was there any indication of who 
the victims were? Do you know who the victims were who were 
the subject of the state charges? 
A 
Which particular names? No, I don't. 
Q 
Right, I'm not asking you --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- other than names --
A 
Yeah. 
I just want to know if you know who they are or 
how many they were. 
A 
I -- I do not. 
Q 
Right, it could be one, right? For this -- for the 
solicitation. It could be one conceivably. Both the charges 
EFTA00009031

Page 216 
could relate to one victim. 
A 
Right. So -- so, those matters were very much part 
of the negotiation that
 and to some extent Andy were 
involved in. I did not --
Q 
What makes you think that -- that -- the -- your 
people were negotiating which victims would form the basis? 
A 
Fair. Fair point. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
Fair point. I withdraw. They may not have. I 
don't know -- I don't know how in the weeds and how much our 
folks, as a federal system, sort of interacted with the state 
in terms of what punishment. I -- there's at least some 
discussion in the media regarding whether the punishment was 
a function of the victims and registration, and I can't speak 
to that. 
Q 
All right. Are you aware, just as a point of 
interest, that the public record of the proceedings in the 
state court related to Epstein are utterly silent as to who 
or how many victims form the basis of the charges to which he 
pled? 
A 
I -- no. I was not aware. 
Q 
Okay. So, this idea of many victims coming forth 
in state court and so on are not -- is not -- it's not really 
in play. All right. So, you have a two year -- two years 
has been now -- a two year state deal has been announced to 
EFTA00009032

Page 217 
the team by 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
With your knowledge and approval, right? Because 
he wouldn't do it otherwise. Is that right? 
A 
Fair. 
Q 
Though at least one was surprised. Do you know 
what drove the timing of the plea offer? In other words, why 
did it have to be made at that point? 
A 
I do not. 
Q 
Okay. You know that 
submitted his 
resignation on the 23rd of July. 
A 
I saw that in the --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- in the -- in the documents. 
Q 
In the documents, and he submitted that to you 
among other -- as well as the --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
HR people. Why not -- well, then there was a 
July 31st meeting at which the term sheet was presented. 
This document 15 is the term sheet that was presented, as 
indicates in her September 6th cover note -- cover e-
mail. And you said you approved it. You happen to be copied 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- though --
EFTA00009033

A 
So --
Q 
A 
Let me --
Q 
-- forwards this, but --
A 
Let me -- let me be -- let me be accurate. I 
approved these terms, whether it was this specific term sheet 
or another -- another document that might have been earlier 
that looked highly similar to this. 
My recollection is approving a, 
you know, 
approving a resolution that had him pleading to certain state 
counts that had a binding two-year plus recommendation that - 
- and that provided for 22.55 restitution. 
Q 
Right, but you don't know if it was this sheet of 
paper? 
A 
I can't say 12 years after the fact whether it was 
this specific sheet --
Q 
Right. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- or others. I -- based on the fact that this was 
in the e-mail, I think it's safe to -- to assume, but --
Q 
To assume what? 
A 
To assume that it was this. 
Q 
oh. 
2S 
A 
But it's possible that there was as slight 
EFTA00009034

Page 219 
difference in --
Q 
All right. In fact, this -- this same document 
with a couple of --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- additional bullets that had to do with the date 
of entry of the plea, sort of ministerial, is what was 
prepared by 
on or about the 31st -- on or 
before the 31st of July, and this document, as indicated --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- here, along with the attached guidelines 
calculation is what was provided to the folks who met on the 
31st --
A 
Fair. 
Q 
-- of July. Okay. So, on that 31st, it was 
, Jerry Lefcourt, 
Sanchez, and the purpose of 
the meeting with Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and 
as 
well as the case agents was to present the plea offer. And 
did you get briefed on how that plea offer went? 
A 
I don't recall being briefed, but in the regular 
course, I would have been. 
Q 
All right, and at that meeting, there was an 
expression of concern by the defense team that Epstein wanted 
to avoid being incarcerated in the state system because of 
concerns for his physical safety, and that concern was 
accommodated to the extent that the U.S. Attorney's Office 
EFTA00009035

Page 
team agreed to explore federal resolution. How does that 
square with your decision that a state plea is how this case 
was going to be --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- decided? 
A 
So, I think I indicated later that it's a little 
bit more fluid than a decision here or a decision 
you 
know, than binary situations. My recollection is we were 
very focused on, this man should go to jail, and this man 
should register. 
The two year plea to the state charges seemed 
reasonable and seemed a way to go. We can agree or disagree. 
Reasonable in terms of -- not in terms of, was it the -- the 
most just outcome, but seemed like a disposition that we 
Is 
would agree to. 
:6 
But ultimately, the focus was on getting him to 
:7 
jail, and if that meant exploring a 371, it's at least worth 
exploring. And so, I don't think it was inconsistent, 
because the focus really was on, he needs to go to jail. 
Q 
Okay. In this case, that -- that push back of 
the -- that resulted --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- in the agreement to explore a federal plea --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was because Epstein was afraid to be in prison. 
EFTA00009036

Page 221 
Why would the U.S. Attorney's Office accommodate that? And 
here, we're getting to -- we're beginning to talk about a 
major point of criticism of this whole process and the 
outcome and that is that it appeared that the U.S. Attorney's 
Office was bending over backward to accommodate the concerns 
of Jeffrey Epstein, and in this case, he was uncomfortable 
going to a federal or state prison, but all child sex 
predators who go to prison are going to face some --
Yeah. 
Q 
-- challenges, right? 
A 
Right, and I remember along the way a heavy push 
that he be incarcerated at this home under some kind of home 
confinement, and my reaction to that was no way. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And okay, you don't like prison, but that doesn't 
mean you get to be incarcerated in your house. 
Q 
Mm-hr. 
A 
Which is interesting, because subsequently 
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
And so --
Q 
Because subsequently, what? You might as well 
finish --
A 
Well, because --
Q 
-- that. 
A 
-- subsequently, the way that the state executed 
EFTA00009037

Page 22
the terms of incarceration were not what I would have 
expected. And so, again, the focus from my perspective is, 
he needs to go to jail. If the team agreed to explore it, 
you know, the 371 was on the table to the extent we had 
been -- I'm speculating now. This is not to make the record 
clear. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. Thank you. 
A 
I'm speculating, not recalling. I can speculate a 
371 with a two year rule 11 had been discussed based on the 
contemporaneous record, and so, to the extent it had already 
been discussed, even if it was not the direction we were 
taking, would it have been unusual for folks in the room to 
say, well, look, we've discussed that, let's go back. You 
know, let's see where it goes. I can't fault -- to the 
extent it had been discussed -- I can't fault anyone for 
saying, let's go back and look at it. I think that's 
distinguishable at least from subsequent --
Q 
All right. At that point, the defense was given 
two weeks to take it or leave it, and if not, you would 
indict, and there were several occasions --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- when that kind of ultimately was made. Did that 
mean -- I mean, given all of your concerns about barriers to 
what you would consider a successful federal prosecution, was 
that a bluff? 
EFTA00009038

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Page 223 
No. 
It was not. 
It was not. 
You were at some level at least prepared to approve 
the presentation of the -- or, the presentment of --
A 
We --
Q 
-- an indictment? 
A 
We should not have gone forward with these 
negotiations if we weren't ready to --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- to approve. Whether in this form or a different 
form and indictment, and I say that because it was very much 
a draft indictment that hadn't been reviewed fully by the 
chain, but it wasn't a bluff. 
Q 
Well, by this time it -- it had been reviewed, and 
it --
A 
Had it been reviewed, and revised, and --
Q 
It had -- there -- there had been some efforts to 
begin revising, so --
A 
So --
A 
A 
Yeah. 
Some --
It wasn't finalized. 
Yeah. Some efforts to begin --
Q 
Exactly. 
EFTA00009039

Page 224 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Okay. Looking at 11a, this is a letter that 
drafted to sort of actually respond to a 
counteroffer by the defense. The counteroffer is represented 
in Exhibit 10b, which is a letter from 
Sanchez 
which we don't need to go into in detail, because as you've 
already pointed out, essentially it was a home confinement, 
and you know, very, very soft --
Yeah. 
Q 
-- landing counteroffer. In 11a, 
tweaks 
letter, you're copied on this, and the date is 
August 2, Thursday, and he notes that he hadn't discussed it 
in detail with you, but he wanted to -- he hoped that 
tomorrow, Friday the 3rd --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- he'd have a chance to, and what's notable here 
is that -- is that the -- there's strong language that the 
"Office believes that the federal interest would not be 
vindicated in the absence of a two year term of state 
imprisonment for Mr. Epstein. That offer was not meant as a 
starting point for negotiation. It is the minimum term of 
imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal 
prosecution." 
A 
You're on paragraph two? 
Q 
One. 
EFTA00009040

Page 225 
A 
One, yes. 
Q 
Oh, two. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
It's the first --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- long paragraph. And then he also states that --
that you in the last paragraph -- the U.S. Attorney, "U.S. 
Attorney Acosta has asked me to communicate that the two year 
term of incarceration is non-negotiable." 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
That's pretty firm. That's a -- that's a line --
A 
It is. 
Q 
-- in the concrete that is setting, right? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
And lib is the letter as it actually went out the 
next day. 
A 
And it's got the same language. 
Q 
It's identical. It has the same language. It has 
one typo corrected. This is 
last day in the 
office. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And he's gone after that. Do you think that this 
was an -- the appropriate timing to extend this offer, or to 
set this as the minimum offer, or was it something that you 
would've liked to have seen more fully developed in 
EFTA00009041

Page 226 
negotiations with defense counsel? 
A 
I'm sorry, I don't understand your question when 
you say more fully developed. 
Q 
Well, you -- you have two years. Would -- would 
further consideration have led the U.S. Attorney's Office to 
decide that, well, maybe the two years is too much of a 
giveaway; we should stick with a five year federal plea? 
A 
Yeah. I can't -- so, I can't speculate this far 
after the fact whether waiting an additional time period and 
further discussion would have changed things. I can tell you 
how we came up with it, but that -- that's a lot of 
speculation. 
Q 
Would you say that 
was -- as the 
criminal chief, was essentially the driver of this -- of the 
resolution --
A 
Right. 
(2 
-- presented in this letter? 
A 
I can't. Again, you're asking me to speak to 
something from 12 years ago. I can't speak to it. I was 
aware of the multiple prongs. I approved it. If we had had, 
you know, if -- if a -- at some point -- is your question is 
if at some point there had been a, let's sit down and 
reconsider meeting, would we have gone in a different 
direction? Perhaps, but I can't, 12 years after the fact, 
speculate as to what may have happened if something had 
EFTA00009042

Page 227 
happened. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
That's just a lot of hypotheticals. 
Q 
Understood. The question though is whether Matt 
Menchel, who was the author --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- of this, who first raised it --
A 
Right. 
-- with 
Q 
Sanchez --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- in an informal discussion, and who presented it 
to the U.S. Attorney's Office team, was this really his baby? 
A 
I can't --
Q 
Approved by you. 
A 
I can't -- I don't remember who I talked to about 
what, and so it wouldn't be fair for me to -- you know, I 
can't single out any one person as having a greater or lesser 
role. 
Q 
Well, you were not the architect of this, right? 
You approved it as you've described it. 
A 
No, I haven't said I wasn't the architect. What I 
said is I don't recall --
Q 
Right. 
A 
I recall approving it. You know, I -- I think what 
I'm trying to convey is these discussions are much more fluid 
EFTA00009043

Page 228 
than I think any one single architect. You've got multiple 
lawyers. They interact on a daily basis. They talk back and 
forth. 
To -- to sort of put it in an OPR context, there's 
probably not going to be a single author to the report. 
You're all going to go back and forth, and there might be 
someone that has 
maybe there is a single author. Who 
knows? But it's -- I think it's difficult to say there's a 
single person, and ultimately I was U.S. Attorney, and so I 
approved it and 
Q 
To your knowledge, did anyone in that chain of 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that five person chain or anyone else disagree 
with this offer? 
A 
To --
Q 
I'm not talking about --
A 
To my knowledge -- to my knowledge, I think 
at sometimes may have felt uncomfortable, but whether there 
was explicit disagreement or not, I don't recall. In terms 
of my management chain, I don't recall any disagreement. 
Q 
That you were aware of? 
A 
That I was aware of. I -- I recalled discussions. 
So, for example, 
might say I might proceed with a 371 
with a two year cap under rule 11, but then we move in this 
other direction, and I don't recall anyone saying, let's take 
EFTA00009044

Page 229 
a time out, let's reconsider. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And let me -- let me just clarify, I think at 
various points in this case -- and it's hard -- it's hard to 
sort of single out the timeline. Ms. 
was 
supportive, or maybe I wish we would go in a different 
direction, and that sort of went in and out a little bit. 
Q 
On her part? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Let me ask you this. Having reached the decision 
that you approved --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that this was the offer, and the term sheet, or 
the terms, having that decision made, would you have expected 
your line AUSA to frustrate that, or to not abide by that, 
since it was your decision? 
A 
No, with a caveat that if at any point someone felt 
truly uncomfortable, I would expect them to come and talk to 
me about it. 
Q 
And can you recall any instance in which an AUSA --
a line AUSA came and talked to you about a disposition that 
he or she was uncomfortable with? 
A 
Yes. So, I'll give you an example. I don't recall 
who, before you ask me, but there was this AUSA who was new 
to the office who impressed the hell out of me. I'm sorry, 
EFTA00009045

Page 230 
that's not appropriate language -- who impressed me 
significantly. 
He had inherited a case, and it was a fraud case, 
and the -- the bigger players had been charged, and he was 
basically given a lesser player to -- to basically just 
finish up on, right? 
It was a done deal. The person was ready to plead 
Q 
Me-hom. 
A 
Which, for a new AUSA in the office is pretty gusty 
and unusual, but if this person really felt that this lesser 
player wasn't deserving, then that was the right thing to do. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And so, I don't -- and the person was not punished 
for it. 
Q 
Mm-hem. 
A 
If anything --
Q 
Mm-hmo. 
A 
-- you know, I recounted that story to others. 
Q 
Okay. A question, shifting gears --
to some minor count, no jail time, and he felt uncomfortable 
with it, and went to his supervisor, and then ultimately came 
up to me, and I had a discussion with this person about it, 
and it ended up with my telling him to go back and call the 
defense counsel and tell them we were dropping the case. 
EFTA00009046

Page 231 
Q 
-- a little bit, about 18 USC 22.55. 
Yes, okay. 
Q 
Not to be confused with 22 -- 28 USC 22.55, which 
every prosecutor is familiar with. So, whose idea was that? 
It's, it's a civil provision, a civil -- it's not 
restitution, it's damages. It's a damages recovery provision 
in the criminal code. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Who came up with that? 
A 
I can't speak to who came up with it. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
I can speak to -- to the reasoning behind it. 
Q 
Your reasoning, or the proponent's reasoning? 
A 
My recollection of the reasoning as to why we 
thought it was important. 
Q 
And the importance was to provide a mechanism for 
recovery of damages? 
A 
To -- yeah. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
Yeah. I mean, the victims bad situation, and we 
just 
and here is -- well, go on. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
I might circle back on something. 
Q 
So, is it fair to say that's a fairly -- had you 
2'. 
ever heard of it before? Had you come across it before? 
EFTA00009047

Page 232 
A 
I don't know, but I don't think so. 
Q 
Okay. So, is it fair to say it was novel to the 
office? To you, and to this team? 
A 
I don't want -- I don't think it's fair to say that 
it's novel to the office. 
Q 
Well, to the -- do you -- do you recall whether 
anybody in the team had had experience with 18 USC 22.55 in a 
criminal --
A 
I don't have a recollection of any discussion as to 
whether people had experience with this or not. 
Q 
Did you believe that any legal research was needed, 
or should be undertaken to ensure that the procedure was in 
fact legally sound when embedded, as it was in this case, in 
a criminal plea? 
A 
So, I would have expected to the extent that there 
were concerns. Again, we had incredibly experienced --
between the various individuals on my management team, we 
probably had 50 years plus of criminal experience. I would 
have expected to the extent their concerns, for those 
concerns to be raised. 
Q 
Did you raise any -- any such concerns about it, or 
did it seem to make sense to you? 
A 
From my perspective, I recall -- I don't know if it 
was at the time or subsequent to it, reading it, and 
and 
it seemed -- it seemed to -- to make sense. 
EFTA00009048

Page 233 
Q 
Okay. After 
letter went out on the 
3rd of August, you almost immediately -- it appears you 
received a telephone call from Kirkland S Ellis, is that 
correct? 
A 
That -- I don't recall it independently, but that's 
what the record shows. 
Q 
All right, and that's reflected in Exhibit 12. Do 
you remember who called you? 
A 
I do not. 
Q 
Do you recall -- it apparently was from the context 
of this Exhibit 12, it -- and the caption, Epstein. 
A 
Right. Right. 
Q 
It appears that the call related to Epstein, 
correct? 
A 
Correct. Again, I don't remember the phone call, 
but from the e-mail, I accept that it happened. 
Q 
So, what had been your knowledge and relationship 
of -- with Ken Starr of Kirkland S Ellis --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- up to this point? 
A 
So, I had been an associate at Kirkland, I think I 
indicated, what was it --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- from '94 to '90 -- what was it? Was it '96 or 
'97? 
EFTA00009049

Page 234 
Q 
A couple of years. 
A 
For a couple of years. I worked on at least one 
case that I recall with him. I was the junior associate on a 
merits brief that he argued. He, at the time, was also 
special counsel. And so he wasn't in the office nearly as 
much because he was double hatting as special counsel --
Q 
Me-ham. 
A 
-- and partner. 
Q 
mm-hmm. All right, and what about 
A 
Sc, 
was a partner at the time. 
don't recall working with him on any particular case, 
although I think I worked with him on at least a matter. He 
was on my hallway. He had an outside office. I had the 
typical inside office. 
Q 
Had you had any interaction -- any contact with 
them in the intervening years, socially or professionally? 
A 
Off and on, I was in Washington. They -- you know, 
Ken Starr was in Washington. I think III had moved to New 
York but then came back to Washington to be in the 
administration, and he was in the policy office, and we may 
have -- not may have. We likely interacted. 
Q 
And while you were here at the criminal -- at the 
civil rights division? 
A 
Correc. . 
Q 
All right, and did you -- were you friends? Were 
EFTA00009050

Page 235 
you professional acquaintances? Were you what? How would 
you characterize that? 
A 
We were professional acquaintances that had worked 
together several years ago that continued to interact. 
Q 
Is that true as to the two of them? 
A 
I mean, it's hard to characterize these things. I 
think -- I think that's fair to say. 
Q 
Did Ken Starr know who you were? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And obviously 
as well? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay. So, what was your reaction to being 
contacted by them in -- by their firm, them, presumably one 
of --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- them perhaps? 
A 
So --
Q 
In --
A 
So, I don't know who called based on the e-mail. I 
can infer that it was one of them. 
Q 
14M-hmm. 
A 
And you know -- and I think my reaction is captured 
by not my e-mail, but -- but by Jeff's comment, and what -- I 
don't have a clear recollection, but I'm going to 
speculate/infer that I heard they were being brought onto the 
EFTA00009051

Page 23E 
case, and I probably walked down to Jeff's office and said, 
hey, Kirkland's coming onto the case, I bet you they're going 
to come on to try to take this up to D.C. 
And then I get a phone call, and -- you know, and 
then I tell Matt, who tells Jeff, you know, I didn't know, 
maybe -- Kirkland made a call to -- you're right, 
unbelievable. 
And then I say they're likely to go to D.C. 
We 
should strategize a bit. My concerns behind that are, will 
D.C. look at this as sort of legally troubled, going back to 
the earlier points that I made about the policy issues around 
the trafficking issues up here in D.C. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
And I really do think he should go to jail. And 
so, I want to strategize a bit. 
Q 
So, did you have concern about the fact that you 
were -- that the defense team was sort of appealing you to 
the big house? 
A 
I think based on this, I almost predicted this 
would happen. 
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
And Jeff is saying, you were right, unbelievable, 
where I in some way, shape, or form predicted that something 
would -- someone would be hired, or something would happen to 
take this all up to D.C. 
EFTA00009052

Page 237 
Q 
And had you experienced other cases 
other 
instances in which defense team went to D.C. while you were 
at U.S. Attorney's Office -- while you were the U.S. 
Attorney? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Was that a concern to you? 
A 
It wasn't a concern. It was a, how do we address 
this so that we can back our position and our office. 
Q 
Did you have concerns about the disposition that 
was underway? About -- main justice scrutiny of the NPA 
scheme? 
A 
So, I had no concerns about main justice scrutiny 
of the NPA scheme. In fact, I invited Drew to come down --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- and he was part of the meeting where we 
discussed the NPA. And so, I say that because if I had 
concerns, I wouldn't have invited him. If anything, my 
concern was, is main justice on board, or are we going to 
basically be told to drop this case when it goes up to main 
justice? 
MM-hmm. In your e-mail to 
, when 
Sloman's on vacation --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- you say that -- you make reference to a process 
foul, that the attorneys in the defense team want to go to 
EFTA00009053

Page 238 
D.C. on the case on the grounds of a process foul, i.e., that 
I have not met with them, and you expressed concern that that 
would delay matters. Is that what led you to agree to meet 
with the defense team on the 7th of September? 
A 
It is. My concern was it they came up to D.C., and 
the first talking about was the U.S. Attorney didn't even 
agree to meet with us, that's not the best -- that's not the 
best foot to start with when you're having your case 
reviewed. 
Q 
So, what was your understanding of what the purpose 
of the meeting on September 7th was supposed to be? 
A 
They wanted to argue -- they, being defense 
counsel, wanted to argue why we should not pursue this case. 
Q 
And in this case, it was Starr and Lefkowitz from 
Kirkland & Ellis, and Lilly Ann Sanchez, I believe who met 
with you. 
A 
Fair. I remember it was Starr and Lefkowitz. I 
don't know if it was Lilly Ann. 
Q 
All right, and our information is it was you, Drew 
Oosterbaan, Sloman, 
, and John MacMillan. Do you --
do you know John MacMillan? 
A 
Vaguely. 
Q 
All right. He was an AUSA as well. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Correct? In West Palm? 
EFTA00009054

Page 239 
A 
Right, and if I can just add, again, I -- I invited 
Drew --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- so, Drew became fully aware of that, and my 
concern in getting Drew into the meeting was to not have them 
appeal us, and then having Drew say, not a good case. 
Q 
All right. So, were you aware that Drew Oosterbaan 
had, in preparation for this, gone to West Palm and actually 
gone through the evidence and met with the case agent and the 
line AUSA 
A 
I was not. Drew is an independent actor and could 
do what -- yeah, what he thought appropriate. 
Q 
Did that -- does that seem like an appropriate 
thing for him to have done in your eyes? 
A 
Sure. 
Q 
Okay. Would you describe the meeting -- oh, and 
two other people who were there were, again ASAC Val Parlave 
and Junior Ortiz --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the SSA. So, and the meeting I think was in 
West Palm Beach. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So, what do you recall about the meeting? The 
dynamics? Who spoke? How did it go down? 
A 
I recall there were a lot of people. I think Mr. 
EFTA00009055

Page 240 
Starr spoke most of the time. I think -- my recollection, as 
best as I can -- you know, with the caveat I thought 
was there and clearly he wasn't. So, presented 
several arguments. I then either left the room with my team, 
or I think I most likely asked them to leave the room. I 
then went around and --
Q 
Asked who to leave the room? 
A 
Asked the --
Q 
The defense? 
A 
-- defense. I then went around the table, and
said, does anyone have any concerns, or something to that 
effect. And then hearing none, I asked them to come back in, 
and I reaffirmed the position of the office. 
'4 
Q 
In other words, you sort of decided -- you ruled 
from the bench, as it were. Fair enough? 
A 
Fair enough. 
Q 
Okay. You didn't take -- take it under advisement. 
You gave them what your position was right then and there. 
A 
That -- that's my recollection. I don't know if 
you have information contrary, but at least --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- that's my recollection. 
Q 
Okay. So, is it fair to say it was more of a 
presentation on the part of Ken Starr and his side rather 
2; 
than a debate or discussion? 
EFTA00009056

Page 241 
A 
I think that that's fair to say. I may have asked 
a question or two, but my -- my recollection was not 
was 
not a negotiation, but a, let's hear you out. 
Q 
And so, we understand it was mainly a federalism 
presentation, as opposed to evidence, is that accurate? 
A 
I believe that's accurate, yes. 
Q 
And in your letter to Ken Starr dated -- the letter 
is actually not dated, but we know that it was sent on the 
4th of December --
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- of 2007, and it's in this package. You noted 
that --
A 
Which exhibit? 
MR. GONZALEZ: 34. 
BY 
Q 
Thank you. Exhibit 34. You note on page four --
I'm sorry, page five, you -- you referred to the federalism 
arguments, and you say that after considering the arguments 
and conferring with the FBI and Drew Oosterbaan, you decided 
to proceed with the indictment, but that you would delay 
presentation of the indictment to allow the defense to appeal 
to D.C. Does that mean that you didn't find the federalism 
arguments sufficiently persuasive to you to change your 
position? 
A 
Yes, with the position defined as some concern, but 
EFTA00009057

Page 242 
if we need to -- if we don't come to a resolution based on 
the sheet, then we indict. 
Q 
And there is a letter of --
BY 
Q 
I'm sorry, when you say some concern, some concern 
about the federalism argument? 
A 
Yeah. Going -- going back to what we talked about 
with respect to the earlier conversation about solicitation 
versus trafficking, and the federal nexus. But back in July, 
we had decided that we were going forward, that either there 
is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an 
indictment. The September meeting did not alter or shift our 
position. 
BY 
Q 
Even though you had some federalism concerns of 
your own, they didn't rise to a sufficiently high level. 
A 
So, their request -- their request was to drop the 
matter. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And -- and --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- going back again, understood. There is -- there 
is legal risk. There is witness risk. All of these. If we 
can get pre-indictment resolution, good. If not, the 
indictment was not a bluff. It was -- it was real. 
EFTA00009058

Page 243 
Q 
So, was -- I mean, Ken Starr is of course well 
known. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
He was solicitor general, he's -- you know, 
etcetera. Did you find his arguments well set forth? 
Impressive? 
A 
So, you're asking for something that's 12 years 
if I had to characterize, by the time this meeting took 
place, there had been a fair amount of thought around these. 
There had been a fair amount of -- and I at least felt 
comfortable that while there was some legal risk, he 
needed -- we needed -- you've got to balance the legal risk 
and the precedent risk with -- with outcomes, and Mr. Epstein 
should go to jail, and should register, and I felt 
comfortable -- I felt comfortable enough to basically 
reiterate our position that --
Q 
But my -- but my question with respect to --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was, did you enjoy the give and take with --
with a man of Mr. Starr's --
A 
In all candor, no. 
Q 
-- standing? 
A 
No. 
Q 
No? Not at all. 
A 
Not at all, because --
EFTA00009059

Page 244 
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- it would have been easier to not have the 
meeting in the first place. 
Q 
All right. Do you recall an exchange -- was he --
was -- were you the parson to whom he was directing most of 
his comments? 
A 
Most 
most likely. 
Q 
And do you recall any exchange with him about the 
A 
Do you mean --
Q 
-- a bell? 
A 
-- was he trying to butter me up? 
Q 
Was he? I mean, was he? 
A 
I don't -- I -- look, this was 12 years ago. I 
don't recall. You know, I think as we talk about this, it's 
important to note that the position did not change. Whatever 
exchange there may have had, our position did not change. 
Q 
Right. After this meeting, within a few days, in 
furtherance of the resolution that had been offered, 
and 
Lourie met with the state attorney's 
office to sit down and try to work out how this thing would 
fact that -- sort of an observation that the two of you, you 
and he, were the only two people in the room who had been 
presidentially nominated and senate confirmed to any position 
so that the two of you had kind of that commonality. Does 
that ring --
EFTA00009060

Page 245 
work, and mind you, this was before -- well before the NPA 
is --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- actually formulated. Did you learn what 
happened at that meeting? Do you know how it devolved? 
A 
I may have. I don't -- I don't recall, you know, 
sitting here today. 
Q 
All right. It's at this meeting that somehow, the 
three charges that you specified -- your office specified in 
the term sheet became one. So, suddenly Epstein was to plead 
only to one charge, and this was agreed to by the U.S. 
Attorney's Office folks who were there. Do you know how or 
why that happened? 
A 
I haven't the slightest idea. 
Q 
If you had known -- if they had called you on the 
phone, sort of the mid-trial --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- call to the boss, asking what you wanted them to 
do, what would you have said? 
A 
So from my perspective, when I said -- you know, 
when I indicated I approved this term sheet, this is the 
minimum, I meant what I said. I also recognize that AUSAs in 
the usual course need some degree of discretion to negotiate. 
and so, my assumption after that September meeting, I think I 
indicated that there was a deadline --
EFTA00009061

Page 246 
Q 
mm-hmm. 
A 
-- that was fairly short, was that 
and UM 
and some -- working together would go back and work out an 
agreement based on those terms, and you know, in the give and 
take, if they think that this is an important concession, 
that's within their discretion, but I would have been 
comfortable sticking to that --
Q 
With --
A 
-- charge sheet. With -- something that drove me 
is when I -- when I said something, I -- as a general matter, 
I didn't bluff. I really meant what I said. 
Q 
So, in that terms sheet, I mean, to be fair, what 
Menchel's letter says is two years --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- is the minimum. If the decision to agree to let 
him plead to one as opposed to all three had no impact on 
that two years, would -- would you have cared? 
A 
Fair enough, and so going -- going back to where 
I -- you know, to an earlier discussion -- can I get another 
Red Bull? Going -- going back to earlier discussion, I think 
I indicated that the charges -- the state charges I wasn't 
familiar with. And so if in the give and take, those charges 
changed, my focus was on two years registration and 
restitution, as long as those charges were -- captured the 
conduct in some appropriate way. 
EFTA00009062

Q 
Page 247 
So, later -- rather much later, the defense counsel 
admitted that at this meeting, they thought --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- that under misinformation from the state 
attorney's office that that charge that they got the U.S. 
Attorney's Office, or somehow the -- the U.S. Attorney's 
Office approved, the 793 -- 796.03 charge was not sex 
offender registerable, and that's a -- that's pretty --
that's a pretty major mistake, right? 
A 
It is, and --
Q 
I mean, that's -- that goes to the heart of you --
A 
And --
-- one of your major concerns. 
A 
And they tried -- they tried to get us to change 
that, and I said no. 
Q 
The defense tried to get you off sex offender 
registration. 
A 
Pretty vigorously. 
Q 
Right? But at this point, the focus is on the 
charge, and the defense is -- one might characterize it as 
trying to pull a fast one by agreeing wholeheartedly to plead 
to one charge, knowing or at least believing incorrectly that 
it was not registerable, and the U.S. Attorney's Office not 
having that belief, but thinking it was registerable. 
So, there's a disconnect. There is error, and the 
EFTA00009063

Page 248 
error stems, as they later learned, from the ASA herself. 
So, we look at that, and wonder whether that shouldn't have 
raised some concern that this plan to put things back in the 
hands of the state, which had kind of mishandled the case to 
being with, as at this point even not a good idea, because 
they were continually -- continuing to be -- well, I won't 
characterize it, but less than reliable. Was that a -- is 
that a fair comment of concern? 
A 
So, one question I would have is, at what point did 
we become aware that there had been, first, the error was in 
our favor, not the defense's favor, because 
got it 
right as opposed to the ASA. 
Q 
Correct. 
A 
And secondly, at what point did our team become 
aware of them trying to pull a fast one? Was it before or 
after the signing of the NPA? 
Q 
It was well after. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
But the -- the point here is that the V.S. 
Attorney's Office folks were not as familiar with the state 
procedure -- the state criminal procedure, and the ins and 
outs of the sentencing and incarceration, as you learned 
later. 
So, didn't this put the U.S. Attorney's Office side 
at a substantial disadvantage in trying to play in the 
EFTA00009064

Page 249 
sandbox in which both the defense -- local defense counsel 
and the ASA, were very comfortable? 
A 
Possibly, although I would point out that it was 
the AUSA who got it right. 
Q 
Eventually. 
A 
Not eventually. The AUSA --
Q 
Oh. 
A 
-- was correct in her analysis. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
So, in this case, she was more familiar than the 
state attorney. 
Q 
Not by practice, but by research, or --
A 
By research, and so --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- my point is we had good people that were able 
to, if they weren't familiar with something, the research 
clearly worked. 
Q 
But it took, as you saw in the -- in the -- in the 
process of dealing with the work release and all of that, it 
took a lot of --
A 
It --
Q 
-- work to keep up with those --
A 
It did. 
errors. 
A 
Which is why I say in hindsight, if, given all the 
EFTA00009065

Page 250 
effort that took place after this defer to the state was 
reached, if all that had been known, I really think the 
analysis would have proceeded differently, because that 
was -- what was a lot of work. That was probably as much 
work, if not more than a trial. 
Q 
Right. Right. Right. Meanwhile, the -- we'll 
talk about the actual text of the NPA in a moment, but 
following that -- actually, no, before it was being 
finalized -- before it was finalized, 
was 
working to identify a federal charge, as we discussed before. 
In that process, she came up with a plan that would have 
resulted -- cobbling things together in an 18 month sentence 
instead of --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- 24 months. Somehow, that became the new floor. 
The -- the new standard. Do you know how that came about, 
and who actually agreed to that? 
A 
I -- I don't. I -- I referenced the one e-mail 
where I think 
says, he argued 12. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
I said 24. We agreed to 18. I assume in the give 
and take, this was an agreement that was reached, and --
Q 
But that was 18, as -- as to the potential federal 
charges. It somehow became imported --
A 
EFTA00009066

Page 251 
Q 
-- into the state disposition. 
A 
I can't -- I can't speak to that. This was -- this 
was something that the "trial team" was negotiating, and from 
my perspective, this is -- these were the terms that we 
wanted. These were the terms that I expected if they came 
back and said, no deal. Disappointed, but go forward, but 
they tried to get a deal, and -- and --
Q 
The defense tried? 
A 
No, but our prosecutors. 
Q 
Oh. 
A 
And to some extent, you know, they -- and the give 
and take of any negotiation, I don't think it's unfair for an 
AUSA to -- to give up some things. 
Q 
But did -- you had -- had stated clearly to not 
only the defense team through the Menchel letter, but also I 
believe at the end of the September 7 meeting, that two years 
was the deal. So, did somebody come to you and say, looks 
like it's going to be 18 months, and allow you to then 
approve that? 
A 
I don't recall if someone came to me separately or 
independently of the final language. I clearly approved it 
at some point. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
And so to the extent it was approved, that's --
that's on me, but I would -- I would argue that, you know, 
EFTA00009067

Page 252 
someone's negotiating, one said says 24, another side says 
12. They say, let's agree to 18. To some extent as U.S. 
Attorney, I think I have to back the -- the negotiating 
discretion of my AUSAs. 
But you -- you explained quite eloquently the 
reasoning for the two year plea as being what Epstein would 
have faced if he'd been prosecuted --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- you know, absentia, by the state appropriately, 
and then suddenly, without any apparent relationship to that 
analysis, the 18 months pops up from an effort to try to get 
federal charges. And so how do you -- how -- does that not 
undercut the basis for the two years? 
A 
So, I can provide the reasoning for the two years. 
I also though think as a 
as a supervisor, as U.S. 
Attorney, it's important to understand that when individuals 
go out into the field, negotiations take place. And if every 
time there is some give, they need to come back to the U.S. 
Attorney, or there is a fear that the U.S. Attorney will not 
back us. 
You know, there is -- there's a certain -- I think 
there's a management issue there in that if an AUSA speaking 
on behalf of the U.S. makes an agreement, as long as that 
agreement is within a certain range, the U.S. Attorney should 
back that, because they're the ones that are in the -- on the 
EFTA00009068

Page 253 
line. They're the ones that are managing the case, and it's 
sort of unfair to consistently second guess those late 
night -- I don't -- I don't want to characterize it --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- as a late night negotiation, but those -- that 
give and take that happens sometimes in a conference room or 
on the phone. 
Q 
Do you know exactly what give and take occurred in 
this case regarding the 18 months? 
A 
I do not. I read that one document. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
But I do not. 
Q 
All right. Any other questions on this one? 
BY 
Q 
Really quick. I agree with what you're saying in 
principle, but in this case, you had had a -- almost like a 
mandatory, two years is the minimum that the --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- V.S. Attorney will accept. Under those 
circumstances, where you have come out and said, this is the 
minimum we'll accept, would you have expected them to have to 
come back to you to get approval for any kind of reduction in 
that amount? 
A 
Would I have expected them? I think Ms. 
was in a tough position, because opposing counsel was coming 
EFTA00009069

Page 254 
at her. It was a tough negotiation. Would I have wanted two 
years? Yes. Would I fault her for agreeing to 18 months? I 
don't think that's fair to her. 
BY 
Q 
You could have said no, right? 
A 
I could have, but it was an -- but she had agreed 
to it. The process had gone further down, and to some 
extent, 
I think there is a need to respect that process. 
That happens -- I guess I was getting -- you know, this is 
not the only case where a supervisor sort of says, this is 
our -- this is our standard, and -- and at some point, things 
move, and you've got to provide some discretion. 
Q 
All right. 
BY 
Q 
Do you think she misunderstood the priorities? 
That she thought you wanted to get to a resolution, and so 
the two years could -- could be undercut, versus taking your 
words literally and saying this is the line in the sand 
beyond which you should not go, even if it means kill this 
kill the resolution? 
A 
So, if I had to speculate, I don't think it was a 
misunderstanding of priorities as opposed to opposing counsel 
was exhausting, and if you go through the full record, it 
really was an exhausting -- opposing counsel in this case was 
very good at taking any slight millimeter, and turning it 
EFTA00009070

Page 255 
into, oh, so you said we could do this, and in that back and 
forth, sometimes there is a, can't we just agree in the 
middle? 
Q 
And I understand what you're saying, but weren't 
they exhausting because the U.S. Attorney's Office would not 
say no to them? And so they always believed from the get-go, 
because they have a two year minimum that the --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that the office is willing to then say, oh, we 
can go down from there, and that that set the tone from then 
on that they could continually chip away at you on virtually 
every single term that came about? So, yes, they were 
exhausting, but isn't that because the V.S. Attorney's Office 
would not tell them no? 
A 
So I would push back, because after the agreement 
was signed, I would argue they did not chip away. They --
they certainly kept appealing collaterally, and we can talk 
about that, because there were other concerns raised there, 
but once we had that September meeting, between that 
September meeting and the signing of the deferment in favor 
of the state, that was all negotiated by the trial team. 
That wasn't a, come back to the U.S. Attorney, or come to the 
first assistant. That really, to my recollection, was, go 
negotiate with the state -- with the line. 
Q 
Well, but there were a number of things that came 
EFTA00009071

about later on. I mean, they -- they continually griped 
about the 22.55, and that got -- you know, that got modified. 
A 
Later on -- and I think later on's are different 
for some reasons we can talk about now or later, but there 
was an attempt to work this out later on that was clearly 
there. 
: The --
THE WITNESS But I think that's very different 
than, how was the agreement negotiated? And I think that's a 
very different -- a different sort of timeline. 
BY 
Q 
So in your mind, was she prepared to walk away from 
the deal if need be? 
A 
After it was signed? 
Q 
Before it was signed. 
A 
Before it was signed, it honestly was, get a deal 
or ultimately if we have to indict, we indict, and that's 
what I said, and -- and look at it this way. After having 
said that, if that really was a bluff, what would I look 
like, right? I would look awful. 
And so, for that reason, that was not a bluff. 
That was a thought through, this is what we will do, and if 
you don't agree to this, then we indict, and we indict. You 
can't make those kinds of statements and not follow through. 
The office loses credibility if you do. 
EFTA00009072

Page 257 
Q 
Right, but you can keep giving on certain terms. 
A 
But we 
and my point is we did not give, with the 
exception of that 24 to 18, we did not give. 
BY 
Q 
Well, you also gave up two charges. 
A 
Again, I'm thinking of a two years, registration, 
restitution, and so with the exception of that 24 to 18, we 
did not give. 
Q 
I want to go back. This morning, we were talking 
about our tracks, and we talked about the legal track, and a 
little bit about the evidence track. There's another aspect 
of the evidence track that is in play here, because there was 
a substantial type of evidence, and the question is, to what 
extent were you aware of this. 
In October of 2005, the local police executed a 
search warrant on Epstein's residence, and among things they 
found there were cables and cords where there had been 
computers -- computer equipment, video surveillance, cameras, 
and CPUs, all of that, that computer based stuff. It had 
been removed, forgetting why necessarily. If you look at 
Exhibit 29, were you aware of that, by the way? That that 
had occurred? 
A 
I was aware that the state had gathered evidence, 
but not much more --
Q 
Beyond that. 
EFTA00009073

Page 258 
A 
-- beyond that. 
Q 
Okay. So, 29 is --
A 
I'm sorry, I'm on 21. 
Q 
Wait a minute, this is not the one I'm looking for. 
73? Let's do -- do you know what? Okay. That's not -- this 
is not the exhibit I'm looking for, and the numbers are a 
little bit messed up. 
There is a -- an e-mail, which I may or may not be 
able to put my hands on -- in which 
informs 
you that she really wants to get her hands on important 
potential -- on computer evidence, that it's important 
potential evidence, and she had a plan to get it. 
So, the question is whether you knew at the time 
that there was -- that the investigators had identified this 
computer evidence as being out there, and that they believed 
it contained a potentially very significant evidence against 
Epstein, computers, surveillance cameras, given his 
activity --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- in his home --
: He's not on it. 
BY 
Q 
All right. She did not inform you. She informed 
someone else that we -- she informed Sloman and Manche]. on 
July 3rd, and Lourie. My apologies. You're not on this. 
EFTA00009074

Page 259 
Where she advises them that she wants -- we want to -- "we 
want to get the computer equipment that was removed from 
Epstein's home prior to the state search warrant as soon as 
possible." So, there was the stuff out there, and 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- as of July, there was an abiding keen interest 
in getting it, and the defense team was resisting the 
prosecutors efforts to get it. Were you aware of that at 
all? 
A 
So, you -- I think you asked about that in your 
questions to me. 
Q 
Right, I did. 
A 
I have no recollection of -- of this computer 
evidence that --
Q 
All right. 
A 
Did the question say that -- without getting into 
specifics, that there was a grand jury issue around this? 
Q 
It does. It --
A 
I don't have that --
Q 
It is addressed in the non-prosecution agreement if 
you look at the final non-pros --
A 
Yeah. I don't have --
Q 
It's referred to --
A 
The question that you asked, what question was 
that? 
EFTA00009075

Page 260 
Q 
The question was whether you were aware that that 
was something that the prosecutors wanted to get? 
A 
I don't -- I don't have a recollection of some 
computer evidence. 
Q 
All right, and -- and --
A 
But I think -- is there? 
Q 
Are you --
A 
What was the question? 
Q 
aware that 
was instructed by her managers 
to delay her efforts to get this computer evidence, because 
the defense were resisting those efforts, and it became an 
issue of -- an issue that was in play in the negotiations? 
A 
I have -- I have no recollection of that. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
If you can give me one second? 
Q 
Sure. 
A 
Pending federal -- and so, your question said that 
there was litigation pending in federal court relating to the 
U.S. Attorney's efforts to obtain --
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
-- computer evidence? 
Q 
Without going into further detail. 
A 
I -- I have no recollection of any litigation 
pending in federal court regarding that. 
Q 
All right, and were you -- did anyone suggest to 
EFTA00009076

Page 261 
you and your team that the -- or, getting to a plea deal was 
premature, because it -- you needed to get this evidence 
first, so that you knew whether you had potentially some very 
important evidence again Epstein? 
A 
I have no recollection, and if anything --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- I think there was a desire to move quickly as 
opposed to slowly. 
Q 
On the plea? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And do you -- do you know where that energy came 
from? Who was --
A 
Q 
--wanting to --
A 
I don't, but --
Q 
move quickly? 
A 
as I recall -- so, for example, when we were 
setting up the meeting in September, there was a -- a request 
to set it up in August as opposed to September, and we had to 
push it back to September because of vacations or something. 
Q 
All right. So, in addition to not getting the 
computer evidence, the government curtailed the investigation 
to a large extent, despite finding more victims. There were 
witnesses who were not interviewed, things that were not 
searched, property that wasn't searched, target letters not 
EFTA00009077

Page 262 
served. Do you -- so, these all would have been steps taken 
by the FBI to enhance the federal investigation, right? As 
opposed to back to the state --
BY 
Q 
Were you aware of all -- of those steps that were 
being foregone, or foreclosed? 
A 
No. My -- my assumption would have been, we may 
have to go to trial, and so we should continue to develop the 
basis for trial. So, if I could, for example, I think I --
after Drew came down, I said if we go to trial, can you be on 
the trial team? I cite that, because I'm thinking, we may 
have to go to trial. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
Why not get Drew who's from Miami on the trial 
team? 
Q 
So, is it -- is it your understanding that the 
federal investigation, notwithstanding the drafting of this 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- case that this was sort of --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- being returned to. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Was this --
MR. TODD: Are you asking Alex if he's aware of all 
the things you just said? 
EFTA00009078

Page 263 
NPA, was still continuing? 
A 
Yes. We -- you know, my understanding is you run 
these on parallel tracks, and again, I'm -- I'm sitting here 
inviting the head of CEOS to be part of the trial team, and 
talking about how to formulate the trial team. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
That -- that implies that I was clearly thinking we 
might be going to trial. 
Q 
All right. When you first received the draft of 
the non-pros agreement, and this is 16a, it's a draft by 
. Do you know who came up with the -- the --
it sounds like you didn't, but who came up with the name or 
the moniker non-prosecution agreement? 
A 
i do not. 
Q 
Do you know what this was modelled on, if anything? 
Where it --
A 
I --
Q 
What the genesis was? 
A 
I do not. I noticed from the contemporaneous e-
mails that initially it was done differently, and I think it 
was 
Lourie who said write it as a contract, or I think 
there is -- there is an e-mail to that effect. Someone may 
recall it better than I, but --
Q 
This version of September 10, which is the first 
business day after that --
EFTA00009079

Page 264 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- September 7th meeting, from
goes to her management up through you, and you do a rewrite 
almost right away, adding original state charges which at 
that point were all still in play, and you also added -- this 
is Exhibit 16b -- a statement that it would be Epstein's job 
to move the state to add additional charges, and that -- that 
latter piece is on page three, just below paragraph eight. 
So, you were --
A 
Can I -- can I back up a second? 
Q 
Sure. 
A 
When you say I did a rewrite, is there some 
indication of what I did a rewrite of? 
Q 
Yes. If you compare the two --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- there's -- there are things that are bracketed 
in yellow in Exhibit 16b, which represent --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the changes from 16a. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Okay. So, those are the two things that are 
different, and they're referenced in your -- your message --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- at the beginning. We bracketed them just to 
make it easier for you to -- to recognize --
EFTA00009080

Page 265 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that. So, my point is that right from the 
beginning, you were participating in the process -- in the 
drafting process. 
A 
Oh. So -- so, I would -- I would characterize that 
as not participating in the drafting process, but approving a 
draft. There is -- there is a --
Q 
I --
A 
-- slight --
Q 
-- I did a small --
A 
-- difference. 
Q 
-- rewrite. 
A 
Yeah. And so, something comes -- here's how I 
would distinguish. Someone that's participating in the 
drafting process is sitting at the table with two or three 
people, drafting it as they go, versus something goes through 
the management chain, and someone in the supervisory chain 
says, can you change A, B, or C? 
Q 
All right. 
A 
I -- I clearly -- you know, here and in other 
places, it looks like I'm inserting the same themes, which is 
deferring to the state -- let's mention the state charges 
Q 
14M-hmm. 
A 
-- and we can't force the state to do anything. 
And so, I -- I'm adding to this. I'm clearly aware of it and 
EFTA00009081

Page 266 
approving it, but I wouldn't say that I was drafting. 
Q 
Fair enough. Did you read it? 
A 
I would assume that I read it, or else I wouldn't 
have edited it. 
Q 
All right. So, we have a draft from 
working draft on September 10 with a small rewrite from you. 
There is in the Exhibit 17 series indication that -- of the 
kind of activity that 
was going through to come up 
with a federal plea, but eventually she and the defense 
attorney who is most actively working on this, Jay Lefkowitz, 
turn back to the NPA, and if you look at 17d, just to make 
the sort of staffing clear, you know, of course 
has left, 
is going on vacation as of September 
15, and so 
Lourie has helped finalize. So, the 
finalizing of the NPA, the final version of which is in 
Exhibit 22, falls to 
with 
, right? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay, and 
puts you on notice in 18b in that 
process. This e-mail in 18b is sort of a follow on to 18a. 
Do you see it comes one minute after your e-mail in 18a? 
It's a response from her to you, only in which she makes note 
that the defense, "tried to reopen all the loopholes that I 
had sewn shut." 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So, it's fair to say that you're kind of -- you're 
EFTA00009082

Page 267 
on notice that they're being difficult? 
A 
I -- I -- that's fair. 
Q 
Okay. In the course of that being difficult, 19a 
is an e-mail to you from
 on September 18 in which she 
represents that -- or, explains that the defense is -- is --
that things are kind of falling apart with the negotiations, 
and she fears the deal is going to fall apart completely. 
MR. TODD: Should we take a quick break here? 
You're losing your voice. 
: I'm fine. 
MR. TODD: You could probably use a minute. 
: All right. We'll take a break. 
THE WITNESS All right. 
: A four minute break. 
MR. TODD: Four minutes, that's --
: Okay. 
(Off the record.) 
BY 
Q 
Back on the record. Looking at Exhibit 19c, you 
say -- you write to 
regarding whether you're 
available to -- at a time when she's going to be hashing out 
language. You advise her that -- but I -- "I don't think I 
should be part of negotiations. I'd rather leave that to you 
if that's okay." 
A 
Yes. 
EFTA00009083

Page 268 
Q 
Why did you say that to her? 
A 
Because she was the line lawyer involved, and I 
thought -- I think it's important for a U.S. Attorney to, 
absent truly exceptional circumstances, to not get involved 
in sort of the negotiations. You can meet, like I did in 
September, reaffirm the position of the office, back your 
AUSA, but ultimately, I think your trial lawyer needs 
discretion to do their job. 
Q 
At this point, of course we know 
vacation. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
And you were aware, were you not, that 
is on 
Lourie 
was about to decamp for Washington? In other words, he left 
at the end of September --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- to become the chief of staff and principle 
deputy, assistant attorney general --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- for 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- who headed the criminal division. Okay, so it 
was really just the two of them at this point, and with 
nobody apparently involved between them and you. 
A 
So, fair, but when you say just the two of them, 
is an incredibly experienced lawyer. So, to say just 
EFTA00009084

Page 269 
the two of them is not to take -- not -- should not imply 
that there was an experience in that --
Q 
A 
-- table. 
Q 
I certainly in no way intended to --
A 
Right. 
A 
Fair. 
Q 
-- suggest that. 
A 
Fair enough.

Looking at 19d, in which

two, looking at the latest draft from 
meaning
:3 
, and this is in the -- in the -- in the throes of 
negotiating the NPA. 
is essentially telling you 
he agrees with 
observations that the defense are just 
up to all kinds of nonsense in this deal, and constantly 
changing their terms, and just not apparently negotiating or 
dealing with these warring drafts with the drafting process 
in good faith. 
Again, that's my characterization, but 
says to you in this e-mail, "I suggest we simply tell him, 
that his counteroffer is rejected, and that we 
intend to move forward with our case." Right? And then 
response is interesting. You say to him, why don't we 
just -- why don't we just call him? Tell him, one, you 
your 
EFTA00009085

Page 270 
agree, and then change things. Two --
A 
You being III agrees and changes things? 
Q 
Correct. Tell him you agree, meaning, 
agrees? 
A 
No. No. 
Q 
I see. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Tell him --
A 
Tell him, you, III, agree, and you change things. 
Q 
I see. 
A 
That is not acceptable to us, and is in bad faith. 
Stop it, or we'll just indict, and then try to work it out. 
Q 
So, is the try to work it out -- if the -- if 
numbers one and two are what you should tell -- what 
:4 
should tell 
, is number three something 
should tell 
or what you're telling III"? Try to work it 
out? 
A 
It's what I'm -- what I'm -- what I'm telling 
Q 
okay. So, just to be clear, you say, tell him, 
meaning you, 
, tell Jay, number one --
A 
So --
Q 
-- and number two, but number three is then what 
you're instructing 
to do? I --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- I'm just trying to understand. 
A 
Yes. So --
EFTA00009086

Q 
Okay. 
A 
So, my understanding of this is, they're being 
difficult. Hey, this isn't the first time that an attorney 
agrees to something and then goes back and tries to pull a 
fast one. So, tell him you're onto this, that they need to 
stop it, or we'll indict, but then that we'll try to -- you 
know, 
should try to work it out. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
But they need to stop this tactic. 
Q 
Did you really think that was going to be effective 
with this defense --
A 
I don't know. 
Q 
-- team? 
A 
You know, I think one of the hard things with this 
is, if it was right on September 6th, it remained right, 
irrespective of really -- I think I say, sorry, I know it's a 
pain. 
Q 
You do. 
A 
This negotiation was a pain, but if it was the 
right position, the fact that you've got annoying counsel on 
the other side doesn't it make it less of a right position. 
You tell them stop being annoying, you try to work it out, 
and if not, then you indict. 
Q 
All right, and is that sort of --
A 
You had a question? 
EFTA00009087

Page 272 
: I was going to, but 
was going 
ahead. 
BY 
Q 
Is that -- is that consistent with your sort of way 
of doing business, being even, and working it out? 
A 
Yeah. This is our position. It's not a bluff. 
It's what we want. You work it out. People yell and scream 
on the other side. You work it out. If not, then we indict. 
Q 
What would have been the tipping point for you? 
What would have caused you to say, okay, I agree with you, 
I agree with you, 
. Let's indict? 
A 
So, it's really difficult to speculate, but I think 
the tipping point would have been a failure to reach -- it 
was pretty clear. Jail time, registration, restitution. 
Okay, we moved from 24 to 18 months. That was a give and 
take. But ultimately, if they came back and said, we can't 
agree to these terms, then we indict. 
Q 
All right. 
BY 
Q 
It seemed like your troops were telling you, we've 
reached the end of our rope. We really want to just go 
forward and indict. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
And you were coming back with, tell them again that 
the defense is being difficult, but I want you to work it 
EFTA00009088

Page 273 
out. Does that tell your troops basically that where your 
priority is, you want them to get to this resolution, and if 
they have to give up stuff, it's okay -- it's really okay, 
but you want this resolution? 
A 
So, it's not if you have to give up stuff. I'm not 
telling them to give up stuff. I'm not telling them to 
negotiate things away, but I think -- the dynamic from my 
perspective is incredibly -- so, there's a tactic that 
counsel sometimes take where they negotiate, and then they 
try to come back and renegotiate, and that is, to my 
thinking, one of the most annoying tactics that you can have, 
and it -- and it creates a lot of -- of frustration, and what 
I'm trying to say is, look, they might be frustrating folks, 
but if this had been worked out -- so -- so, looking at this, 
we thought we had an agreement, and then they changed things, 
and I'm saying, look, if you thought you had an agreement, 
tell them you had an agreement. 
Don't let them change things. I understand it's 
frustrating to you, but if it was right two weeks ago, the 
fact that they are frustrating attorneys doesn't change the 
underlying legal analysis. The attorney's behavior doesn't 
inform the rightness or wrongness of a certain disposition, 
to a point. 
BY 
Q 
What's that point? 
EFTA00009089

Page 274 
A 
So, I think after the -- now I'm calling it an NPA. 
I was personally very frustrated with the failure to report 
on October 20, and had I envisioned that entire collateral 
attack, I think I would have looked at this very differently. 
Q 
In what respect? 
A 
To the extent that this was -- going back to, for 
example, the public corruption prosecutions that we had, one 
of the values of it was to have a public figure stand up and 
say, I did this, and plead. 
One of the values was the, you know, avoiding a 
long and messy legal process. And so when you put all of 
that together, those -- you know, this is why I say it's not 
quite -- this was the factor that we'd consider, that it's 
all of this put together, and in something that could have 
been very positive for the victims and for sending a signal, 
as it dragged on, became exhausting and negative for the 
victims. 
It put us in a position of what do we do with 
notifications. It put us in the position of a lot of appeals 
to Washington. It put us in the position of having to deal 
with complicated legal issues that actually got more messy in 
terms of how does a federal 22.55 relate to a -- to a state 
charge, and had all of that been known, I do think this would 
have proceeded differently. 
Q 
Differently in what way? 
EFTA00009090

Page 275 
A 
So -- so, if I had factored all of that -- like, I 
can't predict it's --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- what I would have done, but I think if I had 
known all that, this could have proceeded very differently. 
I was very frustrated with the October to June time period. 
Q 
So, if you had been back in that timeframe in early 
September, looking at this with, I don't know, what, Harry 
Potter character it is --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- but whoever can see into the future, and -- and 
anticipated or foresaw --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- what would have happened, would you have simply 
said, look, we're not going to go the state route, we'll go 
the federal route? 
A 
Quite possibly. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And let me sort of -- we'll probably get into it, 
but at some point, I do think the post versus the pre-
signature time period was different for any number of 
reasons, and we'll probably want to talk about that. 
Q 
All right. We will, but now, I'd like to turn to 
some of the terms of the --
A 
Fair. 
EFTA00009091

Page 276 
Q 
the NPA, because you did make -- let me -- let 
me make sure that this is correct 
: You skipped this one. 
BY 
Q 
Oh yeah, before that -- thank you, my colleague 
reminds me 19e is an exhibit that has a -- an exchange 
between you and 
Lourie about the -- at a time when the 
plea agreement -- the federal plea agreement --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was still in play, and the issue is whether you 
should sign it, and --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- you didn't want to, because you never do, but 
you say at the bottom, we should only go forward if the trial 
team supports and signs this agreement. What did you mean by 
that? The -- the first part of it? 
A 
So -- so, what I meant by that was I got something 
that the -- that is -- the document was unusual. So, my 
signature appearing on this document is not in and of itself 
unusual. 
Q 
And this would have been the plea agreement -- not 
the federal plea agreement, not the -- or was this about the 
NPA? 
A 
This was about the NPA. 
Q 
Okay. 
EFTA00009092

Page 277 
A 
Right, and so the NPA had my signature. Now, the 
NPA's almost too generous. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
So, that in and of itself is not indicative of 
something, but it does raise my concern. Is this something 
that ultimately the trial team does not feel comfortable 
with? And if it's something they don't feel comfortable 
with, then they should speak up and let me know, because we 
shouldn't go forward with it. 
Q 
And did you ever have a conversation or a 
discussion about that issue, other than mentioning it? 
A 
Not -- not to my recollection. I would --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- assume based on this that 
would read it and 
would take me at my word and say, look, if -- I think you're 
going in the wrong direction, Alex. You know, I think you're 
going in the wrong direction, or I'm uncomfortable with it. 
Q 
Okay. All right. 
BY 
Q 
Did you ever have a direct conversation with 
about wanting her to sign the agreement as opposed 
to yourself? 
A 
I -- I did not. This was my -- my communications 
with 
, and -- and I really meant that if at the end of 
the day, my team isn't comfortable, then you shouldn't go 
EFTA00009093

Page 278 
forward. 
Q 
You never recall hearing from 
that she was 
not comfortable moving forward with the plea agreement? 
BY 
Q 
The NPA? 
A 
I did not hear -- I don't recall hearing from 
that she was not comfortable. I know that at various points 
she became frustrated. At various points, 
became 
frustrated, but they were negotiating this. If at some point 
they did not -- they thought this was a mistake, or wrong, or 
unjust, I would think that they would tell me. 
Q 
What would you have done? 
A 
Sit down and really have a serious conversation 
about where this is going, and sit down and hear them out, 
again, even if -- at this late phase. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
Would be -- I would -- I would think that that's 
what I would have done. 
Q 
All right. Let's turn to the NPA. What is it? 
Exhibit 22? Did you read it? We know that you made some 
final tweaks to it. 22. 
A 
So --
Q 
Is the final -- as signed --
A 
22. And so, I would -- again, I don't have an 
independent recollection of reading it. I would not have 
EFTA00009094

Page 279 
made tweaks to it without reading it. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And so, I think you can infer that I read it. 
Q 
All right, and let me say, you -- you were clerk to 
an appellate -- a very eminent appellate judge, and you 
did -- did you do appellate work --
A 
I did. 
Q 
-- yourself? So, you were somebody who's an 
appellate lawyer, who has that experience at a high level, is 
often more sensitive to words, and phrasings, and to 
documents, contents, than might be, again, to be -- to 
caricaturize a little bit, but a more of a shoot from the hip 
trial attorney who spends his days, you know, in a -- in a 
rough and tumble courtroom, and is it fair to say that you 
were more of the former, and more --
A 
So, I would push back. I think that's not 
respecting the talent of the trial lawyer, and particularly 
on these types of agreements or documents, these are folks 
that sort of have expertise, because even if this was sui 
generis, they have seen a lot of this. 
Q 
I am not suggesting that 
and 
Lourie --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- were not up to this. 
A 
Right. 
EFTA00009095

Page 280 
Q 
Because certainly she also had a lot of appellate 
experience. I'm simply noting that -- that this seems to be 
sort of in your wheelhouse. 
A 
What -- look, I apologize. Whether -- I'm not sure 
what in my wheelhouse means. I -- you know, I appear to have 
read this. I suggested some edits. As I would have 
approached this document, my assumption would have been I'm 
looking at it from my earlier concerns, that -- the policy 
level concerns. 
Does it capture that we're deferring to the state? 
Going back to the put in the petite policy versus not. Does 
it capture the policy concerns of -- of appropriately 
understanding that we can't force the state to do something? 
And does it capture the essential elements of the terms that 
we had looked for, the 
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- you know, the imprisonment, registration, and 
restitution. 
Q 
All right. So, one of the things that is a little 
striking that's different from the original draft NPA, even 
as amended by you. So, let's pull out the 16b. Is that --
is what I would call the non-admission of guilty, so, in 
the -- in the first page of 16b, the first paragraph that's 
the first clause after the one through five statutes listing, 
in 16b, reads, "It appearing that Epstein has accepted 
EFTA00009096

Page 2 
responsibility for his behavior by his signature on this 
agreement." 
A 
I'm sorry, you're on 16b? 
Q 
16b. 
A 
Okay. It appearing, yes. 
Q 
Okay. So, his is -- and this is not 
I mean, 
this seems to be fairly typical sort of plea agreement 
language, right? 
Q 
And if you look at the top of the final NPA, 22, 
the third, it appearing clause 
A 
I'm sorry. Where --
Q 
Fine. 
A 
-- where are you? 
Q 
16b. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Has 
A 
The third, it appearing? 
Q 
It appearing he has -- the 
down at the bottom. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
It says -- refers to at the --
A 
It has accepted responsibility. 
Q 
second up. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Exactly. He's accepted responsibility. 
EFTA00009097

Page 282 
A 
Right. 
Q 
And then above in the fourth, it appearing --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- it references the fact that, it appearing, 
"Epstein has committed offenses against the United States." 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay? So, he -- there's a sense of acceptance of 
responsibility. In the final NPA, which is 22 in your right 
hand, the --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- third it appearing clause says nothing about 
Epstein committing offenses. It simply references the U.S. 
Attorney's Office and the FBI having conducted their own 
investigation into Epstein's background and any offenses that 
may have been committed by Epstein, including --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the enumerated statutes. And then following the 
enumerated federal statutes, there's no reference at all to 
Epstein accepting responsibility. Do you -- do you -- do you 
view that -- the removal of that acceptance of responsibility 
to be something that was appropriate? 
A 
So, trying to reconstruct, the focus was on -- and 
I know I'm repeating myself, but jail time, registration, 
restitution. Whether he accepted responsibility for a 
federal or for a state, I think my focus would have been on, 
EFTA00009098

Page 283 
these were the terms. Does this encompass those terms? 
Q 
So, as that concession is not something material as 
far as -- I don't want to use the legal term material, but it 
wasn't important --
A 
So -- so --
Q 
-- to your objectives? 
A 
So --
Q 
Is that right? 
A 
First, I'm not sure -- so, it wasn't a concession 
from that -- that -- those four bullets, right? It was a 
concession from an earlier draft. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And so to say it's not important is, again, there 
was an early draft. It changed. The focus was in any give 
and take, drafts change. The focus was, did he go to jail? 
Did he have to register? Did we have restitution? 
Q 
All right. 
BY 
Q 
Do you remember noticing that change, and thinking 
it --
A 
Q 
-- just doesn't matter? 
A 
I don't. In all -- in all candor, until right now, 
I was not aware of that -- of that change. I doubt I would 
have taken two documents and sort of put them side by side, 
EFTA00009099

Page 284 
as opposed to, does this capture what we're trying to get to. 
BY 
Q 
So, does that --
A 
I was aware of the 24 to 18. 
Q 
Me-ham. 
A 
But up until this question, I wasn't aware of that 
change, to my recollection. 
Q 
So --
BY 
Q 
And you're aware of the 24 to 18 because you 
noticed it in the NPA, or because somebody told you 
separately? Or do you know? 
A 
I can't -- I can't say other than I was aware. 
BY 
Q 
In the final NPA on page five, there's a series of 
things that are included at the bottom of that page, in that 
long paragraph, and the one that I want to focus on is the 
immunity portion. 
That was certainly not in the original draft 
proposed by the U.S. Attorney's Office. In this paragraph, 
the United States agrees, "That it will not institute any 
criminal charges against any potential coconspirators of 
Epstein, including but not limited t 
Did you notice 
that provision? 
EFTA00009100

Page 285 
A 
I -- I don't recall focusing on the coconspirator 
provision. To the extent I reviewed this coconspirator 
provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been 
the focus is on Epstein's -- Epstein's going to jail. 
Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other, lesser 
involved, is not the focus of this. 
Q 
All right. This particular provision, as you know, 
has been --
A 
It has --
Q 
-- enormously --
A 
-- generated --
Q 
-- criticized. 
A 
Enormous, yes. 
Q 
For a number of reasons. One of which is that it 
is blanket transactional immunity. It gives blanket immunity 
to unnamed, unidentified --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- potential coconspirators. People who, even in 
the future, if evidence is developed against them, as long as 
they could be considered coconspirators of Epstein in this 
conduct, they have a get out of jail free card. Do you have 
any idea where that came from? 
A 
I don't, and I don't want to characterize it as 
giving -- I understand how it could be read that way in the 
record. I don't want to characterize it, but I don't know 
EFTA00009101

Page 286 
where this could have come from. 
I was -- I would have reviewed this for the policy 
concerns. Did it do the -- the sort of the bullet points, 
and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that 
al 
and 
would have looked at this, and that this 
was -- was appropriate. I understand your point. 
Q 
All right, and I believe the point you were 
referring to is that when I use the term jail -- get out of 
jail free card, that you recognize this is limited to your 
district? 
A 
And that's an important point --
Q 
Of course. 
A 
-- to recognize. 
Q 
Of course, but nonetheless, this does give blanket 
immunity to people -- you have no idea who they might be, 
correct? If you had focused on it, would that have raised 
some question in your mind? 
A 
If -- if there was a discussion like what we're 
having here, then it very possibly could have raised. It's 
difficult to say it would have, but I understand your 
concern. 
Q 
All right, and the named individuals, 
are all 
individuals who were described in the pros memo and so on, 
and the pros memo does identify that at least one of these 
EFTA00009102

Page 287 
women herself engaged in sexual activity with minor -- with 
minor girls. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
So that she has liability in and of her own --
A 
So, I don't have an independent recollection of 
that, but when I reviewed the pros memo, I did notice that. 
Q 
All right. Now, you told us this morning that you 
have no recollection of that actually having read the pros 
memo back at that time. 
A 
I think what I said was I don't have a recollection 
of whether I did or did not read the pros memo. I have 
since, when you've provided it, read it, and I note that it 
does reference her. 
Q 
Having read it now, does that change your view of 
anything that we've talked about so far today? 
A 
So, reading it 12 years later, knowing all of this, 
possibly, and part of it is I do think we approach these 
cases differently, and I think these cases would play out 
very differently in court today. I think it's very difficult 
to sort of go back and recreate a thought process from 12 
years ago. 
Q 
And if you were relying back then on the 
characterization and summary and recounting of this case to 
you by your people -- your senior people, 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
EFTA00009103

Page 288 
Q 
-- and in particular, 
A 
Right. 
Q 
would you -- do you -- do you have a 
did --
did anyone in that ground, including IIIIILourie, in any way 
to your recollection characterize this case as not serious, 
or as trivial, or as involving non-important -- unimportant 
victims? In any way try to diminish either the conduct or 
the victims? 
A 
Not to my recollection. I -- I do think there was 
a concern as to how the victims would present in court, given 
impeachment, and given contradictory statements, but that's 
different than trivializing the case. 
Q 
All right. Okay. Back to the immunity provision. 
Were you aware that none of the four named coconspirators had 
cooperated? 
A 
I was not. To my recollection. 
Q 
And do you recall any other case in which blanket 
immunity in the V.S. Attorney's Office --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was -- in which blanket immunity, really 
without -- virtually without limitation --
A 
I -- SO, I --
Q 
-- was granted? 
A 
I don't recall discussion around this provision, 
and a general matter, I did not discuss the -- in typical 
EFTA00009104

Page 289 
cases that came -- that bubbled up to my level, it was -- the 
focus was on who the prime, you know, target is, and not on 
what we would do with the coconspirators. And so, I don't 
recall, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. That's just 
not typically something that I got involved with. 
Q 
And likewise, non -- immunity being given to non-
cooperating coconspirators, or codefendants? Is that 
something that was done in your office? 
A 
Again, I -- as a typical matter, we -- I did not 
get involved with these, but let me -- let me also say that 
this wasn't a federal prosecution in the first place. And 
so, this whole thing is sui generis to some extent. 
Q 
/t is, but the -- but the grant of immunity is 
real, right? 
A 
I understand where you're coming from. 
Q 
All right. If you had focused on that provision, 
would you have insisted it come out? 
A 
One question I would have had is, if we're 
naming -- as I sit here and sort of focus as we are now, but 
this is with the benefit of hindsight and criticism --
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
-- if there are specific folks, why do we have any 
potential language? Because that seems quite broad. 
Q 
It's -- it's without limitation as to people as 
long as they're coconspirators, right? 
EFTA00009105

Page 290 
A 
But -- and so what is -- what is the need for that? 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And I would --
Q 
i see. 
A 
And so, if we had this kind of discussion, I would 
be sending 
an e-mail saying, what's the need for this? 
What's up? 
Q 
But to be clear, as we sit here today, you have no 
recollection of having noticed that? 
A 
I -- I don't have a recollection of -- if I read 
over it, my assumption would have been that 
and 
thought this through and sort of addressed it for a reason. 
Q 
All right, and if --
BY 
Q 
And did you have any -- anyone ever come to you 
with the evidentiary issues and say, we need to track this 
down before we give such a blanket immunity? 
A 
I don't recall any conversation around 
coconspirators. 
BY 
Q 
This is where there is a mention of computer 
equipment. There is a provision later in that -- in that 
same paragraph that provides that, "The federal grand jury 
investigation will be suspended, and all pending federal 
grand jury subpoenas will be held in abeyance unless and 
EFTA00009106

Page 291 
until the defendant," --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- "violates any term of this agreement. The 
defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to 
intervene and quash certain grand jury subpoenas. Both 
parties agree to maintain their evidence, specifically 
evidence requested by or directly related to the grand jury 
subpoenas that have been issued, and including certain 
computer equipment in violate until all of the terms of the 
agreement have been satisfied." Do you -- do you -- do you 
view that this agreement to suspect the -- at least certain 
aspects of the federal investigation to have been an 
appropriate concession? 
A 
You know, again, my -- my focus was on certain 
points. I would have assumed reading this that this was 
thought through. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And that -- and that people had. 
Q 
Had -- had --
A 
Had thought it through, you. 
Q 
All right. Okay. There is what's been criticized 
as a confidentiality provision. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Right? And that's on that same page, page five, 
paragraph -- numbered paragraph 13, which provides that, "The 
EFTA00009107

Page 292 
parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part 
of any public record." 
And then there is an exception for FOIA or 
compulsory process from a court, in which the government will 
provide notice to Epstein. That seems to be limited to the 
placing of this document on the public record, right? As 
opposed to sharing it, or disclosing it for whatever purpose 
to individuals. Did -- is that -- is that a distinction that 
makes sense? 
A 
That is -- that is a fair distinction upon reading 
this. I'm not sure that that is a distinction that was -- I 
mean, I'm basing that on my reading currently, and not as a 
recollection. 
Q 
And in fact the parties, both defense counsel and 
even the U.S. Attorney's Office took the position that this 
should never have seen the light of day, even to be disclosed 
to, you know, victims or other parties and interest, except 
for filing it, or except for sharing it on a limited basis 
with law enforcement. I think there were e-mails that talk 
about if we share it, we'll tell them not to disclose it. 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
Is that sort of overstating what this paragraph 
requires? 
A 
Possibly. I can 
you know, we can get into that, 
and we can discuss it. I would need to understand a little 
EFTA00009108

Page 293 
bit more. I know there was litigation around disclosure on 
this, and I'd need to understand much more the positions that 
we took and the why before commenting on them. 
Q 
There's -- in Exhibit 23, there is a discussion of 
the -- the -- whether the NPA after it has been signed could 
be revealed -- the existence of it could be revealed to the 
police chief, or even the FBI, or the girls, and 
in the middle of page one, or two thirds of the way 
down on page one of Exhibit 23, proposes that if we tell 
anybody about the NPA, you just ask that -- that the 
recipient of that information not disclose it. 
And you then at the top of the page to Lourie and 
who is going to take over 
Lourie's position as the managing AUSA in West Palm Beach, 
should talk with you about it on Wednesday, about the -- you 
should talk about who we tell, and how much. Do you remember 
that conversation, and --
A 
I -- I don't. I know there were several concerns 
about leaks and media, and I imagine that we had a 
conversation quite literally about who to tell, and how much. 
Q 
And did you -- did you feel that this -- at the 
time, as best as you recall, did you feel that that clause 
bound you to not tell anyone? 
A 
So, my recollection of the clause, whether it 
was -- whether it was this clause or whether there was a 
EFTA00009109

Page 294 
discussion, I was 
was aware of this provision, and my 
recollection of this provision is at some point it was raised 
as something that -- that was the subject of negotiation. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
That the office policy was that we -- that these 
types of deferred prosecution agreement is not made part of 
the public record, and --
Q 
Me-hmm. 
A 
-- therefore that this is not a substantial 
concession --
Q 
Me-hmm. 
A 
-- because in the typical course of business, this 
would not be part of the public record. 
Q 
And that's because it's a non-prosecution as 
opposed -- agreement as opposed to a deferred prosecution 
agreement? 
A 
So, deferred prosecution is not -- to analogize 
from a non-prosecution to a deferred prosecution, these 
are -- you know, if the non-prosecution is not typically part 
of the public record, the deferred prosecution, it makes 
sense that it follows the same. 
And so, it seemed that -- it seemed a concession --
I understand how it was perceived publicly after the fact. 
At the time, it seemed that we weren't giving up much, 
because the typical policy is this is not part of the public 
EFTA00009110

Page 295 
record, and individuals need to file a FOIA. And so by 
saying it's not part of the public record, and individuals 
need to follow FOIA, if that -- if that is viewed as a 
concession, it really isn't. 
Q 
So, how would -- I mean, did -- is it -- is it 
understandable that Epstein would not want this document to 
see the light of day, because it describes the existence and 
nature and scope of the federal investigation --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and also his concession to liability under 
22.55? 
A 
It's understandable. It was also my impression at 
the time that it would see the light of day, because --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- if victims have 22.55, the ability to get 22.55, 
they obviously have to hear about it from somewhere, and 
given the press interest, eventually this would be FOIA'd. 
And so, from my thinking at the time, rightly or wrongly, 
this is a concession that's basically saying we'll follow 
office policy, and we're likely going to be FOIA'd on this 
anyhow, and it can play out in the FOIA. And so, is this 
really a --
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
-- concession? 
Q 
All right. Another piece of the -- the agreement 
EFTA00009111

Page 296 
is -- is something that is absent, and that's the sort of 
typical language that you find in a -- I think in pretty much 
any federal plea agreement, which is, this agreement 
only -- the defendant understands that this agreement only 
binds the U.S. Attorney's Office for whatever district he or 
she is in, or --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- you know, and that -- and that truly what you 
would call global dispositions are unusual 
:0 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- for the federal government. 
A 
And I would note, you know, and this is after the 
fact that it does say this district agrees. 
Q 
okay. Understood, and it's also has you as a 
party, not the Department of Justice. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
But it does omit that standard language, and do you 
know whether that was done sort of by mistake, or 
consciously? 
A 
I -- I have no -- I can't speak to that. 
Q 
All right. another piece is phrasing that you 
injected at the -- when you addressed the first -- where it 
was -- it was toward the end. Where --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- you talked about injecting the best efforts 
EFTA00009112

Page 297 
language. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay. Does it -- what -- what's -- I believe you 
made clear why you did that. That is, to avoid the 
appearance of having the federal government be dictating 
anything, but why rely on best efforts, and to what extent is 
that even enforceable? 
A 
So, first, let me -- let me say it was not to avoid 
the appearance. It was to avoid the actual legal discovery 
dictating, but -- so, Epstein understands that he has no 
authority to require -- that -- to undertake discussions and 
to use -- so, as I recall, if he did not plead, then there 
was no agreement. 
Q 
No, no, no. This -- I'm sorry. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
I don't mean to -- it appears in paragraph --
numbered paragraph --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- 11, Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter 
his guilty plea and be sentenced no later than the --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- set date, and then in the first paragraph after 
numbered clause 11, he will use his best efforts to ensure 
compliance with certain procedures, and best efforts to 
convince the judge of the Florida court to accept his binding 
EFTA00009113

Page 298 
recommendation. So, best efforts kind of became a sticking 
point in enforcement, didn't it? Because what does it mean? 
F 
What does best efforts mean? 
A 
So, I think it's fair to say that one of the issues 
that came up after this was entered into was the U.S. 
Attorney's Office, at least from my perspective, was in a 
little bit of a bind because we had agreed to this, yet he 
wasn't turning himself in. And so, how do we deal with that? 
And so, that's not a phrase that I focused on at the time. I 
understand your point. 
Q 
All right. I'm going to move on from those. Is 
there anything else on those NPA clauses? 
A 
And finally, let me -- let me just say you didn't 
ask, we had incredibly experienced attorneys in the office. 
I assumed, rightly or wrongly, that this language had been 
thought through and vetted, and you know, sitting here 12 
years later, I understand the issues that have arisen from 
it, but at the time, these were not issues that were focused 
on. 
Q 
to your knowledge, who was involved in the 
drafting, other than 
on your side --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and 
Lourie, and you, to some extent? 
A 
So, I can't say 12 years after the fact, but again, 
Lourie, very experienced head of the Palm Beach Office 
EFTA00009114

Page 299 
has prosecuted any number of cases. 
Q 
In -- again, just to keep --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- perspective and context, the final week that 
this was being negotiated, 
Lourie was in Washington, and 
bouncing back and forth on the weekends, because he was in 
transition to the front office here in the criminal division 
in this building. That's a factor in terms of being able to 
give attention to some details. Would you agree with that? 
It could be a factor? 
A 
So, it could be a factor. On the other hand, I'd 
say that 
wasn't leaving the department. He is 
professional. He knows his stuff, and you would expect a 
professional -- if they're reviewing a document, whether 
they're on vacation, whether they're looking to move from one 
part of the department to another, that you would expect them 
to review it, you know, fulfilling their -- their 
responsibility to sort of focus in and make sure that -- that 
it's -- that it encompasses what it should. And that's not a 
criticism of 
. That -- that's saying that, well, that 
might be a factor. That doesn't lessen from my perspective 
reliance on his expertise. 
Q 
NM-hmm. Understood. After the NPA was signed --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and 
came back --

Page 300 
A 
Yeah. 
right about that same time, he quite quickly 
identified a potential problem, and that was the commitment 
for the -- or, the agreement that the U.S. Attorney's Office 
would identify the representative for the victims. Do you 
recall him raising that? 
A 
I don't recall him raising that as an issue, but I 
know it was an issue. 
Q 
All right. /t was an issue, and it was one that he 
raised as soon as he came back. So, there was an effort, 
which he conducted then in Ma 
absence to craft 
an NPA addendum to address that issue. 
Do you -- are you -- are you aware that MI 
received a copy of the NPA in November when Ken 
Starr wrote a letter to 
asking her to review the 
22.55 portion of it? Do you -- do you remember that issue? 
A 
I remember that the issue was appealed to CEOS. 
Q 
Okay. Well, it was -- it was appealed initially by 
letter to 
, raising an issue that was new to --
that had not been raised with you, and that is what led to 
your letter to Ken Starr on December 4. 
A 
I will accept the timeline. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
It's difficult without all the documents --
Q 
Sure. 
EFTA00009116

Page 301 
A 
-- but yes. 
Q 
And at the time theta/MEM 
saw the NPA, 
he sent a message to 
MO about the -- about his view 
of the NPA, and you didn't see it, but I just wanted to name 
some problems that he identified with the disposition, and 
get your reaction --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- to it. So, first, he says I'm not thrilled 
about the agreement, but he acknowledges that's out of his 
hands. He says in terms of the charging and sentencing 
provisions, he's getting -- Epstein is getting a much better 
deal than the average defendant, with the exception of 
defendants who have done physical harm to their victims or 
abused very young children, we haven't seen more egregious 
conduct, because of its serial nature. The area we need to 
be most careful about relates to the victims. 
The U.S. should seek to ensure that the plea, which 
is not giving him serious jail time, provides the best means 
possible to address the harm he caused to the victims. That 
generally means restitution and/or therapy. While the 
agreement provides facility for the victims, the relevant 
terms still seem pretty advantageous for the defendant, and 
not all that helpful to the victims. 
They get an attorney who will be paid by the 
defendant, which involves at least some conflict of interest, 
EFTA00009117

Page 302 
or they could hire their own attorneys on a contingency 
basis, and they get waivers from the defendant when his plea 
would facilitate their civil cases in any event. Then, they 
still have to sue him to get anything. 
Most times with wealthy defendants, we make them 
agree to a restitution fund, and then still provide that the 
victims can sue the defendant independently if they choose. 
We always make them clearly admit their guilt, no nolo pleas. 
This is incredibly important to the victims. I 
would have taken the guy to trial unless the victims were 
clearly against it, and I don't think most of them are here. 
He then says to 
, who by this time is working 
for --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
So, that's the context in which he's addressing it. 
specifies that, ' 
wouldn't and 
shouldn't address the agreement." So, that -- so that the 
issue that was then before 
put there by Ken 
Starr, was the -- whether this 22.55 scheme or scenario set 
out in the NPA was appropriate. It appears that she then 
sent that back to you to address. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
But as far as 
commentary on the NPA, 
EFTA00009118

Pagel 303 
if you had been aware of this perspective at the time you 
were -- that you and your people were fashioning the NPA, 
would that have been helpful to you in -- in deciding out to 
proceed? 
A 
So, may I? 
Q 
Yes. 
A 
Okay. I assume you've read the whole thing, but 
let me just take a 
Q 
I have. 
A 
And so, a few comments. First, let me say, he was 
part of the September meeting. 
Q 
Me-hmm. 
A 
And -- and to my recollection, these 
perspectives -- so, so, at least the outlines of the 
agreement were -- were disclosed at that meeting, and I don't 
recall this type of communication at that time. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
I also recall that there was a lot of back and 
forth around this restitution fund concept, and our 
perspective was that the restitution fund puts the victim at 
a disadvantage --
Q 
Me-hmm. 
A 
-- because -- let me -- let me try to recreate. I 
don't recall the details, but I recall that there was a 
perspective that the restitution fund --
EFTA00009119

Page 304 
Q 
MO-hmm. 
-- put the victims as a disadvantage --
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- and there is some reference to --
Q 
It's the --
A 
Was it an Alaska case? 
Q 
It's called the 
case. 
MR. 
THE WITNESS I'm sorry? 
IC 
MR. 
THE WITNESS NM 
MS. 
or 
THE WITNESS a=? 
BY MS. 
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
And so to the extent that there were better ways of 
crafting this, that certainly would have been -- been highly 
relevant, because to my recollection, we were not wed to any 
particular way of crafting it. 
The -- the intent of the 22.55 was to come as close 
as possible to putting the victims in the -- in the position 
they would have been had he been tried and convicted 
federally. And so, the answer to your question is yes. 
Q 
Is yes, that would have --
A 
Would have been helpful. 
EFTA00009120

Page 305 
Q 
Okay. As you set about addressing the 22.55, you 
consulted with 
. Do you recall that? 
A 
I -- I recall consultations. I don't recall that 
it was specifically with a 
but --
Q 
Did you know her? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay, and do you recall the nature of your 
interaction with her? 
A 
I -- I don't. I know from contemporary review of 
the record, that there is an e-mail from her. 
Q 
It's 41a. 
A 
41a. 
Q 
And what I -- what I want to ask is, is simply, 41a 
is -- is an e-mail in which you ask -- you note to 
, who was 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- one of her deputies, and she oversaw CEOS. She, 
, mentioned to you that 
was looking at 
this, which is the --
A 
22.55. 
Q 
-- 22.55, she contacts her counterpart in the civil 
division, 
and there's an e-mail from him, 
which is the second page of this exhibit, which he copies you 
on. So, my question is, is this the extent of your 
interaction with 
on this issue? 
EFTA00009121

Page 306 
A 
I -- 12 years --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- after the fact, I don't remember. 
Q 
Okay. All right. The -- in Exhibit 35, there is a 
letter from Jay Lefkowitz in which -- I'm sorry, it's an e-
mail from Jay Lefkowitz. 
A 
Exhibit? 
Q 
Exhibit 35 to you, and this is substantially later, 
but it has a sentence that -- or a phrase that we'd like to 
ask you about, and -- all right, it's highlighted at the top. 
It says, back in the beginning of -- back at the beginning of 
January, when we both agreed that there were significant 
irregularities with the deferred prosecution agreement, you 
called a time out. Is that accurate? Did you and he agree 
that --
A 
No. 
Q 
-- there were significant irregularities? 
A 
No. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And if I could, there are -- there are several 
instances where not just, to me, but to other people as well, 
Jay recharacterizes conversations. 
Q 
Recharactorizes them inaccurately? 
A 
Inaccurately. 
Q 
Or misleadingly? 
EFTA00009122

Page 307 
A 
Or misleadingly. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
What I recall agreeing to at some point is there 
was an appeal to the DAG, or there was an appeal in place, 
and I basically said -- I think there was a letter that I 
sent, saying if you want to appeal, go ahead. We're not 
concerned about this. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
But that doesn't mean that I agree that there were 
irregularities --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- or that there was a time out, that's -- I'm part 
of a department. I'm part of a hierarchy. If someone wants 
to overrule me, that's okay by me. 
Q 
All right. So, the NPA addendum was worked out, 
and the defense team continued its sort of multi-pronged 
assault. In the middle of the negotiations between 
and Lefkowitz about the NPA addendum, that's when you had the 
much commented on breakfast --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- on October 12, and you have stated publicly that 
at -- perfectly accurately that the NPA was signed, and that 
was a done deal. And so, that -- that this was not tied in 
any way to any effort to influence the terms of the NPA, 
fair? 
EFTA00009123

Page 308 
A 
Fair, because the way this was reported was that I 
negotiated it over breakfast. It was signed, and that's 
really important. 
Q 
Of course. There were, however, a number of open 
S 
issues --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- right? And in Exhibit 28, Jay Lefkowitz on page 
two, this is an e-mail to you, acknowledges your -- your 
breakfast on Friday. This is dated October 18, and -- and 
following -- following up on -- your conversation with him 
about the date for Epstein's plea. 
So, he notes that, "You said you didn't want to 
dictate a schedule to the state." So, all I want to note is 
that when you had the breakfast, there was 
there was 
there were issues still open that were the subject of 
discussions between the defense and the U.S. Attorney's 
Office. 
And -- and so, I guess my question is, while that 
was a meeting of convenience in a public place, in a location 
where you had business later that day, a speech, I believe, 
optically, do you understand the public concern that this was 
sort of a one on one negotiation on pending issues? 
A 
So, I -- I understand how there can be concern. 
This, you know, it is -- it was not unusual -- in this case, 
I actually very intentionally waited, and tried not to have 
EFTA00009124

Page 309 
one on one meetings, but there are other instances where : 
might from time to time have one on one conversations with 
the opposing counsel. 
I don't remember the breakfast. I can speculate 
that one of the issues that was informing this was somewhere 
around this time, and I can't say with certainty that this 
was what it was, but somewhere around this time, there arose 
allegations that 
had directed the designation to her 
boyfriend's partner, or something along those lines. 
Q 
A former -- I believe it was a former law school 
classmate of her former -- of her then boyfriend. 
A 
don't -- yeah, and so I don't remember what the 
details --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- were, but I know that that was a topic that he 
wanted to raise --
Q 
A 
-- with me. 
Q 
Did he at that breakfast? 
A 
I honestly -- I don't recall the breakfast. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
You asked me about one characterization of what I 
said in the record, you know, of that breakfast. I think I 
responded --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
EFTA00009125

Page 310 
A 
through, or my counsel responded, and they're 
pointing out that I seem fairly perturbed at how he 
inaccurately characterized something that I said. And so, we 
don't need to revisit that, but --
Q 
Uh-uh. All right. If you look at Exhibit 27, 
another sort of point, just to kind of --
A 
All right. 
MR. 
: Could we -- before we --
MS. 
: Yes? 
MR. 
: -- leave -- are we leaving the 
breakfast meeting? 
MS. 
: No. This is --
THE WITNESS Okay. 
MS. 
: -- this is directly related. 
MR. 
: Okay. 
BY MS. 
Q 
And that is, Exhibit 27 is the second e-mail down, 
is from 
to Jay Lefkowitz. The date is October 
12, so that's the same day as your breakfast. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
And the date of it is not 
I'm sorry, the time is 
9:48 a.m. Your breakfast was at 7:00. So, this would have 
been pretty shortly after your breakfast, and 
writes 
to Jay Lefkowitz with a copy to you and 
stating that he just got off the phone with you, that is, 
EFTA00009126

S 
Page 311 
just got off the phone with you, and then he furnishes 
a revised paragraph one, which suggests -- I mean, I infer 
from that that shortly after the breakfast, you had a phone 
conversation with i 
a 
about a revision to this 
paragraph, and that -- that that was likely something that 
you talked to him about. Again, I'm not --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- suggesting that this --
A 
Again, I -- I don't -- I don't recall the 
breakfast, so I can't say one way or the other. I -- I 
take -- I take your point. I don't recall seeing this. 
Q 
All right. Well, it was --
A 
But --
Q 
-- you were copied on it. Okay. All right. 
you wanted to --
BY MR. 
Q 
I just wanted to point to Exhibit 30. 
A 
Can -- can we back up a second? 
MS. 
: Sure. 
THE WITNESS 
, I'm not sure whether your 
concerns are -- so, I would -- I would only raise the 
question where -- or, the point where, based on this, and I 
don't recall, so I can't speak, but 
is saying, Jay 
suggests revision has been rejected. Here is our latest, 
EFTA00009127

Page 312 
And so, to -- there are multiple ways to read this. 
One is that this was raised. Another is that we're rejecting 
something that Jay had proposed, and --
MS. 
: Mm-hmm. 
THE WITNESS -- because I was meeting with Jay, I 
asked that 
not reject it until after I met with him, and 
I -- I'm speculating, because I don't recall the topic, but 
it does appear that it says, Jay suggested revision has been 
rejected. Here is our latest. 
MS. 
: All right. Thank you. 
BY MR. 
Q 
Can we just go to Exhibit 30 quickly? There's some 
highlighted language. This is a letter from Lefkowitz to you 
on October 23rd, 2007, where he recounts, again, the things 
that happened, or his version of the October 12th breakfast 
meeting. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Are you at that --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- at that point right there, Exhibit 30? 
A 
Yeah, I'm there. 
Q 
Okay. So, in the highlighted language, if you 
could just take a look at that quickly? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So, he is recounting that you had assured him that 
EFTA00009128

EVEN/NG 
SESSION 
6:00 P.M. 
the office would not intervene with the state's attorney's 
office, and -- or contact the civil claimants, or intervene 
S 
regarding the sentence that Epstein receives pursuant to a 
plea agreement. 
Q 
So, is he correct in his recounting that? 
A 
Can you -- can you find that for me? 
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
So, again, I don't have an independent 
recollection. Oh, no, I'm looking --
MS. 
: Oh, you have it. 
THE WITNESS -- for something -- I don't have an 
independent recollection of that breakfast, but in the 
contemporaneous e-mails and the contemporaneous record, there 
is correspondence between -- between 
and I, and you all 
asked for this, and I 
I spoke with my counsel, who then 
responded, and there's an e-mail exchange where there's an 
October 20 -- this was an October 23rd e-mail -- October 23rd 
letter. 
And then there is a response that's drafted on 
October 25th. I don't know if we can find that. From 
to Jay that specifically addresses the point, and then I 
respond -- 
runs that by me, and I respond -- I edit the 
EFTA00009129

Page 314 
letter, and I move it -- I sort of emphasize -- like, I make 
it firmer, and my edit says our office cannot and will not 
agree to this, and then my comment to
 is, what do you 
think of this rewrite? Is it too strong? 
S 
BY MR.IIMIE: 
Q 
What day was that? 
A 
That was two days after this. I don't know if we 
can find that in the -- in the chronological record. That 
was October 25th. Let's just take a minute. Is that what 
you have? 
MR. 
: Sorry, apparently my ability to separate 
paper has failed. 
THE WITNESS Okay. So, this is --
MR. 
: Oh, I see. 
THE WITNESS So --
MR. 
: Sorry, go ahead. 
THE WITNESS So, October 25th, I'm writing to 
what do you think of this rewrite? Is it too strong? And it 
says, dear Jay, I'd like to take this opportunity to document 
our conversation of October 24th which clarified some of the 
representations in your October 23rd letter. 
I write in particular because you indicated that 
your intent in writing the letter was to memorialize our 
conversations. Our agreement is limited to blank, blank, 
blank, dot, dot, dot. 
EFTA00009130

Page 315 
I specifically want to clarify one of the items 
that I believe was inaccurate in the October 23rd letter. 
Your office claims that this office would not intervene with 
the state attorney's office regarding this matter, or contact 
any of the individuals, potential witnesses, or potential 
civil claimants, and their respective counsel in this matter, 
and neither your office nor the FBI would intervene regarding 
the sentence Mr. Epstein received. 
I'm quoting Jay's letter. As we discussed and 
hopefully clarified, and as the U.S. Attorney previously 
explained in an earlier conference call, such promises equate 
to the imposition of a gag order. Our office cannot and will 
not agree to this. It is the intent of this office to treat 
this matter like any other case. 
Thus, as is typical, we do not desire or intend to 
"intervene" the state attorney's office. The non-prosecution 
agreement provides sufficient mechanisms to achieve the goals 
of the federal investigation. You should understand, 
however, that there are some communications that are typical 
in these matters. 
And so, I go on, and so my point is this was 
pretty -- based on -- if you reviewed my -- my e-mails and 
language, for me to write something up saying, what do you 
think of this rewrite, is it too strong? 
Q 
Mist-hmm. 
EFTA00009131

Page 31E 
A 
And to edit 
language to, our office cannot 
and will not agree to this, is not my agreeing with this 
characterization, but my polite way of saying, this ain't 
what I said. 
Q 
Mn-hmm. 
A 
Let me be clear. 
Q 
And then --
A 
Again, no independent recollection. This is just 
based on inferring from the contemporaneous e-mails. 
Q 
Okay. 
BY MS. 
What I would like to do is ask a couple of 
questions in a couple of areas about the main justice review. 
Q 
Then take a short break, and then 
has some 
questions that are CVRA related, and then we have some 
summary questions. 
A 
Q 
Is that all right? 
A 
Can I -- before you -- you move on, can I address 
something that 
was getting at, but it's getting late, 
so I'm going to circle back to -- to --
Q 
Please. 
A 
-- something that I thought you would bring up. 
MS. 
: Sure. 
EFTA00009132

Page 317 
THE WITNESS So, I think something to talk about 
is, pre-agreement and post-agreement, I think are different, 
and one concern that I had, and I certainly shared with --
with Mr.e 
was once it was signed -- so, we had the 
initial issues with the case. 
Once the agreement was signed, we now have an 
overlying issue of, is there 
is the agreement binding? To 
what extent it's binding. And so, you -- your question was, 
why this level of process after the agreement was signed, and 
I said I think you'll get back to that. And I think to some 
extent, there are two parts to that. 
One is, the office shouldn't be afraid of review. 
We're part of the Department of Justice, and review, whether 
it by main justice or now you all, is -- is part of the 
process. 
criminal case, but we're litigating a civil/criminal issue on 
top of that, which is, did the agreement bind? And that's 
something that did inform the exhausting amount of process 
that they -- that they received, which didn't change any of 
the outcome. 
And so, to the extent that they want to appeal to 
main, it would be unseemly to sort of say, don't review us, 
and I don't think it would help reviewing this, but the 
second part of it is if we were to walk away from the 
agreement, that not only are we litigating the underlying 
EFTA00009133

Page 
BY MS. 
Q 
Didn't bind what? 
A 
So, if we were to walk away, were -- could we still 
prosecute? 
Q 
I see. 
A 
Right? Because having signed that, we were now 
parties to an agreement, and that would overlay any sort of 
prosecution. And So, you had these collateral issues coming. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Just to make sure we're clear, are you saying that 
there is -- there would have been difficulty in declaring a 
breach so that you could then indict? 
A 
Correct, and so we'd have to litigate over a 
breach, because as much as they had collateral challenges, 
they are very careful in saying, this is not a breach, we 
would just like review. 
And so, one of the issues that overlaid the post --
the October going forward time period is on top of this, do 
we now want litigation over a breach? And so, I think that 
is why the post-agreement time period is different than the 
pre-agreement --
MS. 
Mm-hmm. 
THE WITNESS -- time period. 
BY MS. 
Q 
But was part of that problem the result of the 
EFTA00009134

change from, here is the date that you must comply, to, you 
must use best efforts to comply? 
A 
Possibly. I would -- whether it was that, or 
others, or other parts of the agreement, we can talk about, 
but how -- once the agreement was signed, and they do not --
and they start pushing the date, there becomes a legal issue 
over, are they really in breach or not? 
And I'm not -- I understand your perspective. I'm 
just saying, you know, earlier I said that there was a 
difference. You asked about the process, and I said from my 
perspective, there's a difference between the pre-agreement 
and the post-agreement time period. 
And much of that difference is informed by, if we 
declare a unilateral breach, how does this hold up in court? 
Because now there's a signed agreement that the United States 
is a party to. 
Q 
And are you saying that part of the reason, or 
maybe all of the reason that you continued to give 
accommodations and process and delay was because of the 
concern that you couldn't actually win a breach argument? 
A 
I think that was a consideration. Another part of 
the considerations are if someone -- if a party wants to 
take -- I mean, main justice gave a lot of process. It 
wasn't -- it wasn't, you know, it wasn't just to -- to 
but it was up to the -- it was just up to the assistant 
EFTA00009135

Page 32C 
attorney general for criminal division, to be polite, but it 
was up to the DAG. 
And so, if main justice is going to give this 
degree of process, we should -- we should be in the position 
of saying go forward, as opposed to, I don't think it looks 
positive for the office to be viewed as fearing department 
review. 
Q 
But were you giving the impression to the 
Department of Justice that you were the one who wanted this 
review so that they felt like, well, it's not just these 
defense attorneys who we can blow off, it is an United States 
Attorney who is asking for this review, and so therefore we 
need to give the courtesy of reviewing this? 
A 
I don't think I asked for it as opposed to saying, 
if you would -- so, from the very beginning, they said that 
they're going to take this to the Deputy Attorney General and 
Attorney General. 
And I said, if you want to, fine. They just 
finally did, but that was not -- that was not -- I think they 
raised that as early as August or September. And so, I'm not 
surprised that it ended up there. I also thought it was 
important to not be in the position of fearing review. 
think if you look at the contemporaneous record, there's an 
effort on our part to expedite the review. 
BY MS. 
EFTA00009136

Page 321 
Q 
But there's a difference between, have at it, go, 
do what you want, up at main, and getting that --
Right. 
Q 
-- that non-opposition, and actually sending a 
signal to -- in the -- in the case of the criminal division, 
the assistant attorney general, in the case of the DAG's 
office, Mark Filip or his assignee, that you supported their 
review, that the -- this appeal process. You could have 
said, look, we're going to go ahead and get on with our 
business. 
If they want to -- if -- you could have not so much 
opposed a review, but not seconded their request for -- the 
defense request for reviews, or not in fact invited the 
reviews. 
A 
So, I'd be curious as to the timeline. I would 
take issue with, I invited the reviews, and I question 
whether, did they initiate the reviews on their own, and then 
I said have at it, or did I -- based on -- I mean, you've got 
more of a record than I do, or did I invite -- I don't -- I 
would say I did not invite the reviews. 
Q 
Well, let me -- bad terminology, perhaps. Let me 
ask you this. If -- would've -- did you convey to the 
criminal division that you wanted them to review this matter, 
as requested by the defense attorneys? 
A 
So, from my perspective, I'm thinking back 12 --
EFTA00009137

Page 322 
Q 
Min-hmm. 
A 
-- 12 years now. The very reason that we invited 
to come down to Miami back in August was a sense that it 
would end up up here. And so, if it's going to end up up 
here, let's bring 
down. 
Let's make him part of the initial meeting. You 
know, if there are concerns, let's raise these. Let's 
address them. Let's get them out so that we don't end up, 
after we go forward with all of this, back in front of 
and 
And it's much better to involve main justice 
earlier. 
And so, I would say I was trying, if anything, 
to 
to involve main justice so that we didn't end up where 
we were, and it had been my expectation that that October 
date would have been met. 
The collateral reviews afterwards, the collateral 
appeals, obviously did not go as -- as we planned, and -- and 
it was my sense, we were going to end up at main justice one 
way or another. 
Q 
So, my question is in December, after the December 
meeting --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that you had with defense counsel, and they told 
you they were going to go to main justice. 
A 
Correct. 
EFTA00009138

Page 323 
Q 
To the criminal division. Did you convey to main 
justice criminal division that you wanted them to conduct the 
review that defense counsel were seeking? 
A 
So, I don't recall what I may or may not have 
conveyed. I think my recollection was, if they want a 
review, that's their right. We're not -- as a department, 
we're not in the business of telling individuals that they 
can't take something to your supervisor, or your superior. 
Whether -- whether main justice takes this on or not is 
ultimately at their discretion. 
Q 
Would it surprise you to learn that the criminal 
division front office understood you to be requesting their 
review, the review that was sought by defense counsel? 
A 
Would it surprise me? Perhaps. My -- my -- my 
understanding -- recollection is we shouldn't fear it. If 
they want it --
Q 
mm-hmm. 
A 
-- that's their right. I thought by inviting 
down in the first place that we had at least tried to address 
that early on, but I also thought that we might end up there 
in the first place. 
Q 
Were you -- were you aware that a decision was made 
to grant the decision by your office to grant defense 
counsel's request 
their insistence that 
role in the criminal division review be limited to review 
EFTA00009139

Page 324 
only, and that he not be permitted to -- or that the criminal 
divisions -- that the -- I'm sorry, I misspoke. That because 
IIIMINIMIllhad already been involved in essentially 
being a prosecutor on the case --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that the -- the criminal division and CEOs' role 
vis a vis this review should be review only. That is, they 
should be taken off the case as a -- as a partner? 
A 
So, I sought e-mails to that affect in the record. 
I don't have an independent recollection 12 years --
Q 
you --
A 
Q 
Do you think you were involved in that decision? 
A 
To take them off? 
Q 
Yes. 
A 
To my recollection, I wanted them on as a partner, 
and I think the contemporaneous --
Q 
ME-hmm. 
A 
-- e-mails from 
is, can you please come on 
board? 
Q 
But that was earlier, before this review process? 
A 
No. No. Even after the --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- review process, I think there are 
contemporaneous e-mails where we're saying it's important 
EFTA00009140

Page 325 
that you be part. If we go to trial, it's important that you 
be part of the trial. As I -- as I went through the record, 
at least I remember --
Q 
Me-hmm. 
A 
-- an e-mail, perhaps from 
to 
that I'm 
copied on saying, hey, can you reconsider? It's important 
that you be part of this. 
Q 
Reconsider the review only limitation? 
A 
No, no. Reconsider being a part of the trial 
Q 
Oh. All right. 
A 
-- team. 
Q 
All right. 
So, to be clear, do I understand that 
you -- correct me, that you don't have a recollection one way 
or the other whether you requested the criminal division to 
conduct the review, or could it have happened, or --
A 
So --
Q 
-- what? 
A 
-- to the extent I -- again, I'm going back --
Q 
Nm-hmm. 
A 
-- 12 years. To the extent there is a request to, 
it would be in the context of, this is going to Washington. 
We're not fearful of this. Have at it. 
Q 
And you would have conveyed that to Washington? 
Not just to the defense attorneys, is that correct? 
A 
I imagine in some way. It's --
EFTA00009141

Page 326 
Q 
All right. 
BY MS. 
Q 
And just one --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- just one point. This one -- this one was a 
little bit of an --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- odd posture, however, because you had a signed 
agreement. And so, you know, basically a contract between 
parties --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and particularly on Mr. Epstein's side, a party 
who was -- who was extremely well represented. So, was there 
any consideration on your part, instead of saying, hey, 
everybody's got a right to review, knock yourself out, go up 
to Washington, as opposed to saying something like, that ship 
has sailed, guys. You signed this agreement. We're going 
forward. You don't go forward. You're in breach. End of 
story? 
A 
So, his counsel are raising serious issues that go 
to ethics and go to fundamental relationships between 
sovereigns. Is this 22.55 appropriate as a matter of federal 
policy? Is what we're doing an overreach, you know, is what 
we're doing contrary to law? Are we extracting -- I'm 
characterizing. This may or may not 
EFTA00009142

Page 327 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
-- be accurate. Are we extracting unduly? Are we 
using criminal law to extract civil concessions in an 
ethically suspect way? Those are serious issues. That isn't 
just, is this a good case? 
Those are -- those are genuine issues. I happen to 
think that, as I recall, that we were in the right or we 
wouldn't have agreed to it, but by the same token, let's 
assume that main justice ultimately disagreed. Is that from 
a main justice perspective? And maybe I'm coming at this 
from a -- you know, being informed by having been at main 
justice. 
Q 
mm-hmm. 
A 
Where there was talk about, can you believe what 
this AUSA -- this AUSA may have done or may not have done 
without consulting, that these are serious issues. They 
establish precedent. 
They -- you know, maybe the DAG would have said, 
this is not the kind of thing we'd support, and this is 
wrong. And so, at the end of the day, let's move forward, 
but if -- once these issues are raised, I don't think a U.S. 
Attorney should say main justice should not review this. 
I think we're part of one department, and these are 
valid issues. Main justice doesn't need to take months to 
review this. Main justice can expedite their review, but 
EFTA00009143

Page 328 
those are valid issues for the deputy and the AAG to review. 
Q 
But one could look at it and say, well, those are 
all issues that the defense certainly knew about before they 
signed that agreement, and having signed the agreement, they 
are waiving all of that. That's what contracts are for. 
You've got all these issues, don't sign the contract. 
A 
And if I could, I think there's a December letter. 
I don't know if it's -- if it's in the exhibits, but there's 
a December letter that I wrote that, for me, is --
Q 
This is the 19th? 
A 
Maybe it's the 19th. Let me --
Q 
Or the --
M . 
The 19th is the -- your sort of 
ill-fated NPA addendum effort. 
THE WITNESS No. No, a letter to -- to Ken Starr 
that I -- that I wrote. But --
MR. 
: The 4th letter is to Ken Starr. 
THE WITNESS I'm sorry? 
MR. 
: Is it the December 4th letter? 
THE WITNESS Yeah, it's probably --
MR. 
: December 4? 
THE WITNESS It's the December 4th. 
MS. 
: Yeah, it didn't have a date. 
MS. 
: All right. That's the one you 
wrote --
EFTA00009144

Page 329 
THE WITNESS So --
MS. 
: -- to him --
THE WITNESS -- so --
MS. 
: -- in response to the --
THE WITNESS So --
MS. 
-- 22.55 issue. 
THE WITNESS I think, you know, I -- you know, I'm 
starting on page four. I have responded personally in some 
detail to your concerns because I care deeply about both the 
law and the integrity of this office. I have responded 
personally and in detail as well, because your letter 
troubled me on a number of levels. Upon your understanding 
of the negotiations are. The 22.55 was first discussed July 
31st. 
You know, and one of these four points in -- in the 
middle of 2007, your defense team decides -- asked to meet 
with me. On September 7th, I met. After considering of the 
arguments, and after conferring with FBI and 
our office decided to proceed with the indictment. At that 
time, I offered to delay -- our prosecutors to delay 
presentation to allow you to appeal our decision if you 
choose. You chose not to. 
Instead, you elected to enter into the NPA. Since 
the signing of this agreement, the feds in our office have 
addressed several issues that have arisen, although the 
EFTA00009145

Page 330 
exchanges at the time were a bit litigious. 
BY MS. 
Q 
This -- could I -- could I thought point out --
i•. 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- that this letter is in response to not the at 
the request for a review by the criminal division, that comes 
later. This is in response to Ken Starr's letter to 
about -- raising 22.55 -- 22.55 issues that had not 
been raised with you before. 
A 
Right, which is -- which is in essence a review. 
mean, he -- they're coming to main justice, and you know, 
it's against these many previous foregone opportunities to 
object that I receive with surprise your letter requesting an 
11th hour after the fact review of our agreement. Although 
it happens rarely, I don't mind this office's decision being 
appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our 
prosecutors to delay. 
Indeed, I'm confident in our prosecutor's evidence 
and legal analysis. I nonetheless 
directed them to consult with subject matter experts in the 
criminal CEOS division to confer to our interpretation of the 
law before proceeding with this indictment. So, I guess, you 
know, we consulted CEOS. 
I'm thus surprised to read a letter addressed to 
the department headquarters that raises issues that either 
EFTA00009146

Page 331 
have not been raised with this office previously, or have 
been raised and in fact resolved in your client's favor. 
I'm troubled likewise by the apparent lack of 
finality in this agreement. The AUSAs have been negotiating 
with defense counsel and have for sometimes complained to me 
regarding the tactics used by the defense team. It appears 
to them that as soon as resolution is reached on one issue, 
defense counsel finds ways to challenge the resolution 
collaterally. 
Q 
So, this is your protest of, it sounds like Starr's 
effort to bypass you and go to 
with new issues? 
A 
It is, and I'm pushing back in that, was I inviting 
this, or was I sort of saying -- you know, that said, there 
must be some closure on this matter. 
Some in our office are deeply concerned that 
defense counsel will continue to mount collateral challenges 
to provisions of this agreement, even after Mr. Epstein has 
entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the agreement 
difficult, if not impossible to unwind. In closing, I ask 
that you consult with co-counsel. 
If after consultation with your defense team you 
believe that our agreement is unethical, unlawful, or 
unconstitutional, I'd ask us that you notify us immediately 
so we can discuss the matter by phone or in person. I've 
consulted the chief prosecutor in this case who has advised 
EFTA00009147

Page 332 
me that she's ready to unwind the agreement and proceed to 
trial if necessary, or appropriate. 
Q 
So, are you suggesting that this represents your 
protest of their appeal to 
A 
So 
o' 
Q
-- on this point? 
A 
So, protest is a 
is a loaded word. What I'm 
suggesting is, this is not an invitation to appeal to main 
justice. This is sort of saying, enough is enough is enough. 
Q 
But Mr. Acosta, in fairness, this, to clarify --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- this is in response to a letter directed to 
dated November 28th --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- 2007 raising issues that he had not raised with 
you. The appeal subsequently that I was asking about was --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- an appeal for a de novo review -- a de novo 
review of the whole case. 
A 
Understood, and my -- the reason that I -- that I 
read this, you know, is this is not -- on the one hand, I'm 
saying we do not fear review, but I don't -- this is not an 
invitation to defense counsel to do a de novo -- I am not 
inviting them. I'm not saying, let's have more review. I'm 
saying, enough's enough. If they appeal, that's fine, but 
EFTA00009148

Page 333 
this is not an invitation to appeal. 
Q 
But there was nothing you could do to stop their 
appeal, right? Except indict? 
A 
And so the department shouldn't stop an appeal to 
main justice by -- you know, by threatening. 
Q 
Fair enough. 
A 
Because main justice has a right to review. 
Q 
I should have said that -- that this -- that this 
appeal process was stymying progress in resolving the Epstein 
case. 
A 
It was. 
Q 
And you had no way -- you had no recourse, other 
than, at least theoretically, you could have just said, you 
know, we're --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- going to tear it up and indict, because you're 
in breach, in effect. 
A 
Which would have raised civil litigation --
Q 
Litigation. 
A 
-- overlays, which is the point that I thought 
merited --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- at least flushing out. 
BY MS. 
: 
Q 
So, short of the department itself getting a move 
EFTA00009149

Page 334 
on, and getting this thing through expeditiously, did you 
feel like you just had to sit there and wait for everything 
to get done? 
A 
I'm not sure sit there and wait, but -- but 
ultimately, the case did not get better with time, and there.
was frustration on our apart about, you know, the witnesses 
are not getting better. You know, time 
Q 
They're getting older. 
A 
They're getting -- which goes back to how a juror 
may see them. 
MS. 
: Right. 
THE WITNESS And I do recall conversations of their 
getting older, you know, this case is not getting better. We 
now have the civil overlay that we need to deal with. And 
so, yes, that -- there was process, but while there was, 
should we just call it a day, all of that factored into, 
well, if the department is reviewing the department is 
reviewing. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Okay. Are you -- what is your view of whether the 
criminal division's review encompassed the NPA itself? 
A 
So, the criminal division, by its terms, did not 
did not encompass the -- the NPA. I would say that's 
different than the deputy's review that encompassed the 
totality of the -- of the circumstances. 
EFTA00009150

Page 335 
Q 
Okay. Did you discuss the -- did you have 
conversations with the DAG -- with Mark Filip about this 
case? 
A 
Not to my recollection. 
Q 
Okay, and we've already talked about the submission 
that
 made on behalf of your office? 
A 
Which -- which -- yes, which I thought was a 
fulsome submission, and included the draft indictment, the 
NPA. I believe it included the term sheet and other 
documents. 
Q 
Did you or anyone else to your knowledge ask ODAG 
to review or assess the NPA, or approve it? 
A 
Not to -- before signature, not to my recollection, 
but it was part of the ultimate review when 
submitted 
the matter to the deputy, he included the --
Q 
It was --
A 
-- the agreement. 
Q 
It was included. Their very brief letter, you 
remember --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- the letter that 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- authored, that he authored. Addressed really 
only the issue of the appropriateness of the case for 
prosecution in your office. It did not in any way reference 
EFTA00009151

Page 336 
the disposition, the plea agreement, or the NPA. 
A 
So -- so, it was a brief letter. Based on 
submission, I would have read that letter as, they had all 
the material in front of them, and they were saying that 
there was no misconduct or abuse of discretion. 
Q 
That's correct, but they did not say that they 
contacted -- that they addressed or assessed, reviewed even. 
They didn't say they reviewed or approved the NPA. 
A 
They -- I again, you know, I -- if the letter is 
here, I don't know, but --
Q 
Yeah. I have it right here. It's not marked as an 
exhibit, but this is an 
letter to Jay Lefkowitz and 
Ken Starr dated --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- June 23, 2008 It states that this office, 
meaning the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, has 
completed a thorough review of the U.S. Attorney's handling 
of the matter involving your client. 
A 
And --
Q 
And addresses the -- or, states that they've 
received and reviewed submissions from both parties, and then 
states that the deputy attorney general, "Will intervene only 
in the most unusual of circumstances," in a U.S. Attorney's 
matter, and, "we do not believe such intervention is 
warranted here. Even if we were to substitute our judgement 
EFTA00009152

Page 337 
for that of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal 
prosecution of this case is appropriate. Moreover, having 
reviewed your allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and 
the facts underlying them, we see nothing in the conduct of 
the U.S. Attorney's Office that gives us any reason to 
alter," --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- "our opinion." 
A 
And so, so, if I could point out, this office has 
completed a thorough review of the U.S. Attorney's handling 
of the matter. And so, handling is a broad -- is a broad 
term, and in reference to, we believe that federal 
prosecution of this case is appropriate, the way I recalled 
reading that is, the federal prosecution of this case, the 
argument was that the agreement was inappropriate because 
this case should not have even been prosecuted, and therefore 
that the disposition -- the federal prosecution of this case, 
was appropriate. 
And so, the handling of the matter, we reviewed the 
handling of the matter, not -- not the agreement, but the 
handling of the matter, and that the ultimate disposition, 
if -- you know, is at least not an abuse of discretion, or is 
appropriate. 
Q 
That's how you read it? 
A 
That -- that is how I read it. 
EFTA00009153

Page 338 
Q 
And did you ever discuss that -- did you ever 
discuss with anyone in ODAG what the scope of their review 
was? 
A 
Not to -- not to my recollection. It was a fulsome 
submission. 
Q 
Correct, but if -- if -- but the issues presented 
by the defense were essentially federalism issues, right? 
A 
So, the -- the -- again, this is -- this is based 
on, you know, as much recollection as contemporaneous record. 
The issues presented by the defense were, it -- in essence, 
it was the heart of the non-prosecution agreement, which is, 
was it -- was it an abuse of discretion to -- to proceed in 
this case in the way that we did on the grounds that there 
may not -- there should not have been a federal prosecution 
in the first place, or that we were using federal criminal 
law to -- to elicit a civil outcome. 
And so, I don't think it's fair to sort of 
narrow -- you can't -- you can't say that our handling was --
you know, that their handling was reviewed without reviewing 
the non-prosecution agreement. 
Q 
Do you have any reason to believe that the -- that 
either ODAG or the criminal division did -- well, that the 
ODAG, let's stick with that --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- did in fact review the NPA, other than to be 
EFTA00009154

Page 339 
aware it existed, whatever its status might have been? 
A 
So, again, it was clearly submitted. It was 
clearly referenced. 
Q 
ME-hmm. 
A 
And it was clearly part of the complaint. The 
complaint -- the heart of the complaint about our office was 
that we were using this agreement to impose civil liability. 
And so, I think it is fair to infer if the complaint 
implicates the agreement, that the agreement would have been 
reviewed. 
Q 
That -- but that's your inference. You don't have 
any -- you don't -- didn't have any specific communications 
with ODAG --
A 
I don't --
Q 
-- to that effect? 
A 
I don't recall a specific communication. 
Q 
All right. Okay. I would like to take a short 
break. We're getting there. 
A 
I hear you. 
Q 
There is --
A 
I'm good. 
Q 
-- one area that my colleague, 
will 
take on --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- which has to do with the CVRA 
EFTA00009155

Page 340 
A 
Right. 
-- and then we have some kind of wind up questions. 
A 
Okay. 
MR. IIIIIIII Can we -- before we take a break, 
can I just --
MS. IIIIIIII/ 
Yes. 
MR. IME 
I'll try to queue up what's going to 
be coming next --
THE WITNESS Mm-hmm. 
MR. 
-- and maybe that'll help us move 
through it, because --
THE WITNESS Right. 
MR. 
-- you've been through a very long 
day. 
THE WITNESS Yeah. 
MR. 
We appreciate your -- the time 
you've put into this. You've been here for quite a long 
time. 
THE WITNESS Well, yeah. 
BY MR. 
Q 
The area that I want to discuss after the break has 
to do with the ultimate notification to the victims about the 
resolution of the case, the state plea, and the result of the 
federal investigation, and there's going to be -- we have 
documents that are in your -- that are already marked there 
EFTA00009156

Page 341 
that might be helpful if you take a look at a couple of them 
so we don't have to go through -- maybe during the break so 
we don't have to go through them one by one, or I can just 
give you a very quick overview of sort of where we're going. 
/ want to find out basically how you were getting 
from there -- what would be the -- the state asking for the 
U.S. Attorney's Office to make the notification to the 
victims about the upcoming state plea that happens in 
November of 2007. 
That would be document 32b, to the defense then 
finding out that the government want to notify the victims by 
letter, and then demanding that they see the letter and have 
some kind of comment on it. That would be document 33, an e-
mail from Lefkowitz. 
Then we have an exchange of letters, but the one 
I'd like you to look at is document 37, which is a letter 
coming from 
to the defense -- not now, but you know, 
during the break. So, I want to find out how we get from 
that document, 36, where 
is writing --
MS. 
36. 
BY MR. 
Q 
-- as letter saying that -- citing the CVRA 
regulations saying that the government is obligated to notify 
the victims about the resolution of the case, and attaching a 
draft letter to the victims telling them the time and date of 
EFTA00009157

Page 342 
the state resolution and plea, inviting them to come. 
To ultimately a letter from you coming on the 19th 
of December 2007, which is No. 41b agreeing to not notify the 
victims of the state plea, and agreeing with the defense to 
have the state be responsible for putting out that 
notification. 
And then we end ultimately with a letter or draft 
letter that we have that goes out to the victims in the case 
on -- after the plea in July. Well, we have the draft I'm 
going to show you, which comes in June, showing that the 
letter was clearly meant to be sent after the plea as per the 
agreement, and that is document number 51. 
A 
Okay. That's --
Q 
So, it's a lot to --
A 
That's a --
Q 
-- unpack there. 
A 
That's a lot to unpack. We should probably take it 
a step at the time? 
Q 
Yes. I just wanted to --
A 
All right. 
Q 
-- give you an overview, because I think that some 
of what you had mentioned earlier -- and I know -- I know 
it's --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- been a long time, so --
EFTA00009158

Page 343 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- I'll try to orient you for the timelines. So, 
if you'd just have a -- I've highlighted the sections of 
those letters that we want to talk about, and if you have a 
S 
chance while we're taking a break to look through them, that 
may help orient you so that we're not --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- spinning our wheels on this. I don't want to 
waste any of your time. 
A 
Fair. 
MS. 
: All right. Off the record. 
(Off the record.) 
MS. 
: All right. Back on the record. 
MR. 
: Are we back on the record? 
MS. 
: Yes. 
BY MR. 
Q 
Okay, great. So, I know I gave you a lot to unpack 
over the short break we just had. One -- basically what 
we're trying to get to find out is how the -- your decision 
making process regarding the victim notification issue. So, 
maybe if you could just give us a -- anything with your 
December 19th decision, could you give us an explanation 
about how you got there? 
A 
So, I think we should probably take this in stages. 
Q 
Okay. 
EFTA00009159

Page 344 
A 
As a general matter, I recall that there was back 
and forth regarding -- after the agreement -- regarding how 
to notify the victims, and there was back and forth between 
and Jay Lefkowitz and 
around all that. 
Sorry, I'm losing my voice. 
I recall that there was an issue in particular that 
was raised that I tried to address in the letter, and I 
recall at the end of the day, it was my impression that once 
there was an agreement for him to plead, that there was an 
attempt by 
to provide notice to the victims, but it was 
a very -- it was I think on a Friday, and he was pleading on 
a Monday morning or something along those lines. 
And finally, I recall that the view of the office 
was that the CVRA did not apply, and so that this was a 
g 
Okay. 
A 
And look, let me -- let me add, I -- so, I think 
it's important -- so, I came in and out of the case at 
stages, and -- and I was involved in certain aspects more 
than others, and while we had a long discussion about the 
terms sheet and matters like that, while I was clearly 
discretionary balancing that included consideration of what 
impact notification of the 22.55s would have at trial -- the 
22.55 provision, if we had to go to trial. So, we can -- we 
can unpack that, but those are my -- my general 
recollections. 
EFTA00009160

Page 345 
involved in at least one dispute around the 22.55, the nuts 
and bolts of how victims were notified is not something that 
I have a recollection about. 
Q 
Okay. Fair. 
A 
But we can unpack it. 
Q 
Okay. Let's start with the Exhibit 33. So, there, 
we have an -- as you can see, it's an e-mail from Lefkowitz - 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- to you, and to ISM, 
objecting to the 
letter being sent to the victims, unless the defense gets to 
review it. And later on in some of your other 
correspondence, you discuss that you -- you extended to the 
defense the courtesy of allowing them to review these 
letters. Is this the genesis of that courtesy? 
A 
I can't -- I don't have a recollection as to what 
the genesis might be. I know that there was back and forth 
between our office and the defense about the -- that letter. 
Q 
Okay, but as you can see on 33 that you're not on 
the response from 
but 
instructs 
to 
send the proposed letter to Lefkowitz, and --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- I assume that 
wouldn't have done that had 
you objected to it. 
A 
Again, I don't -- I don't recall any specific 
EFTA00009161

Page 346 
conversation. As a general matter, this is not something I 
was getting into the weeds on unless I had to. There was a 
lot of back and forth. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
a 
is someone that I trusted. He was handling 
this matter. He's incredibly experienced. I know that there 
were concerns and issues around the impact that notification 
would have on the witnesses. I know there were -- there were 
issues around the language, and I trusted that folks were 
working those out. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. One of the -- the criticisms that's come 
post, you know, the CVRA --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- litigation that's been the government allowing 
the defense to have review of these letters, or potential 
victim notification letters coming out of the government, and 
that that's unusual. Have you ever -- have you had any other 
cases where you've let the defense review such documents? 
A 
I've had no other cases where I'm even aware of 
victims being notified, because I assume it all operates 
without it rising to management level. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
And so this is the first and only time that how 
individuals are notified, to my recollection, was even in the 
executive suite. 
EFTA00009162

Page 347 
Q 
Mm-hmm. Isn't that usually done -- accomplished by 
almost a computerized task? 
A 
I -- I would assume so, so yes. 
Q 
And it's a -- given that that's the usual way that 
notifications are made by a victim witness specialist, who is 
usually that person? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Do I have that right? And so, the FBI has their 
victim witness specialist? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And your office, the U.S. Attorney's Office has 
dedicated people who do that job as well? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
So, why in this case, not direct, the -- this --
this notification to that person to be done in the usual 
course, why elevate to something that the defense is going to 
be able to review? 
A 
So, so, I can't address the second half of that, 
but the first half of that question, why -- why was it 
elevated? You know, I think 
addressed some of that in 
her, was it 2017 affidavit, and -- and so, we had an 
agreement that had been signed, and we also had substantial 
questions as to whether that agreement -- whether ultimately 
Jeffrey Epstein would plead in court or not. 
And so, one of the questions is, how do you deal 
EFTA00009163

Page 348 
with notification of a possibility, where that possibility 
could be used to impeach potential future witnesses who are 
also the victims, and that is a matter that was being worked 
out by the AUSAs in the office. 
Q 
And the -- and the impeachment is what? 
A 
And so, the impeachment -- and I -- I would -- : 
believe
 went into it in some detail, is you stand 
you, Miss Victim, stand to gain quite a bit of money if 
there's a conviction, correct? 
Isn't -- weren't you aware of this agreement, if we 
have to go to trial? Weren't you aware of this agreement? 
And this isn't based on my recollection. This is based on 
the 
affidavit, where she says that she had concerns 
that the impeachment go along -- somewhere along the lines 
of, were you aware that if Mr. Epstein's convicted, you stand 
to receive substantial sums? Yes. Were you influenced by 
this? 
And there was some -- according to her affidavit, 
this isn't my independent recollection, this is according to 
her affidavit, there had already been dispositions of the 
victims -- of at least some of the victims that raised these 
issues. And so, I do think it was a valid concern by the 
AUSAs how these notifications took place. 
Q 
Okay, but isn't that the -- that type of line of 
cross examination the same for any case where there's a super 
EFTA00009164

Page 349 
wealthy defendant? 
A 
It may be. The 22.55 may make it a little 
different because it's automatic, but ultimately, these are 
the judgements that line attorneys make, and as U.S. 
Attorney, I think it's appropriate to back up their judgment 
unless there was some reason for me to believe it was 
incorrect. 
Q 
Was there any thought ever to just giving the 
victims notification that there will be a proceeding that 
will end the federal case, just separating that in a -- maybe 
a later notification about the 22.55? 
A 
I can't speak to what thought there was or was not. 
I can say around this time frame, it was far from clear that 
there would ever be -- that Epstein would ever go into court, 
and we were thinking we may have to just go to trial, because 
these collateral attacks keep going. 
Q 
Okay. Okay. Let's get back on track to the -- the 
question that I asked earlier about allowing the defense the 
courtesy to look at these letters. Is -- can you just remind 
us again, what was -- what was the reasoning that you're --
that they're allowed to look at the --
A 
So --
Q 
-- victim notification letters? 
A 
I can't speak to that. This is something that --
that 
and 
would have handled. I think that, you 
EFTA00009165

Page 350 
know, I'm responsible for the office. I'm not shirking, I'm 
just saying that this is -- that this was for the most part 
within their wheelhouse, and not something that -- that I was 
involved in. I can -- I can speculate. 
Q 
Sure. 
A 
The agreement was notifying them -- the letter was 
notifying them of certain rights in the agreement, and 
therefore, this is a time when we weren't sure what was 
happening with the agreement. And so, perhaps this was a way 
to -- to address some of the concerns around the 22.55. I 
don't know. I'm just speculating. 
Q 
Okay. Let's move onto Exhibit 36. This is a 
letter that goes out to Lefkowitz under 
signature. 
You are cc'd on the letter. 
A 
All right. 
Q 
And what he is doing is sending a draft victim 
notification letter, which is attached as the attachment 
there, dated December 6th, 2007. And I wanted to get your 
impressions of -- if you go to page three of the letter, 
please? And that -- the first little paragraph there, when 
it --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- refers to the Victims' Rights and Restitution 
Act, and then ultimate for the CVRA, if you could just read 
that paragraph to yourself, please? 
EFTA00009166

Page 351 
A 
Are you referring to paragraph 10? 
Q 
I'm sorry, I'm not on the -- I'm on the letter, 
not -- I'm sorry, I'm on the --
A 
Oh. 
Q 
-- left -- the letter to --
A 
Sorry. 
Lefkowitz, not the draft letter. This one right 
here. 
A 
The additionally? 
Q 
Yes, additionally, pursuant to the Victims' Rights 
and Restitution Act of 1990, our office is obligated, 
etcetera. 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
Do you agree with that language? That 
interpretation of the victims' rights, as far as the 
notification? 
A 
So, let's -- let's sort of take this -- this one 
sentence at a time. With respect to notification of other 
information that we were supposed to disclose, the statute 
requires that we provide victims with the earliest possible 
notice of -- I -- I will assume that that is a restatement of 
the statute. 
I don't have it in front of me, but let's assume 
that that's a restatement of the statute. Just as in 18, 
these sections are not limited to -- the victims, through 
EFTA00009167

Page 352 
this federal -- should be appropriately informed that a non-
pros does not require to forego its legal obligation. On a 
sentence by sentence basis, I mean, do I agree, sitting here? 
Sure, but I would want to sort of sit down before I gave a 
legal opinion and spent more time with it, but --
Q 
Okay, because coming out of your office, sort of 
this and that -- well, let's go to the next page, page four. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
There is a citation to the right to confer in the 
first paragraph there, citing the CVRA's reasonable right to 
confer with the attorneys of the government in this case. 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
So, we have -- you know, it looks like to me -- I 
mean, let's --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- well, it -- it appears that there is two 
references to the CVRA obligations that the government has 
that ultimately the government argues that it did not have. 
Can you explain why that is a correct interpretation? 
A 
So, what I can say is I recall -- so, it looks like 
at least some of the victims were notified. I recall a 
discussion and a view that the CVRA did not require it -- it 
was discretionary, because it wasn't -- the case had not 
indicted, so it did not attach on its terms. That doesn't 
mean that it's not something you aspire to. That just means 
EFTA00009168

Page 353 
it wasn't legally binding. 
Q 
So -- and in the same manner though, while the CVRA 
isn't legally binding, it also doesn't prevent you from 
notifying the victims, does it? 
S 
A 
It does not, no. 
Q 
And you have the discretion to notify, should you 
choose to. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
Okay. And so, if you look at the letter that's 
attached to this, this is a draft that goes out where on page 
one -- two -- page three of the letter, and the second to 
last paragraph, the letter is giving notice of Mr. Epstein's 
change of plea and sentencing that will occur on -- well, at 
this time, it was December 14th at 2007, and it gives the 
address, and it says underneath there you are entitled to be 
present and make a statement under oath. 
If you choose, you can submit a written statement 
under oath, etcetera, etcetera. So, this is a letter that's 
actively inviting victims to come to the state. Would you 
agree that that's inviting victims to come to the state plea? 
A 
That -- I think that's fair. 
Q 
And with the letter's reasoning that the government 
is sending -- would like to send this letter because it 
believes it's obligated to, because it resolves the federal 
case? 
EFTA00009169

Page 354 
A 
So, I -- I don't want to speak to the reasoning, 
but it's clearly a draft that the government is saying, it 
intends to send. 
Q 
Okay. Now, ultimately, just this is not a 
question, just --
A 
Got it. 
Q 
-- some information that will help to move us 
along. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
The -- obviously, this letter is never sent. Ms. 
drafts, we have them, and I'm not going to show 
them to you, 30 letters, copies of the letter 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- to different victims, addresses them, puts them 
in envelopes, and is then told not to send the letters. 
A 
All right. Well, the plea never -- it's scheduled 
for December 14th, so yeah. 
Q 
Yes, but one of the issues that's still percolating 
until the end of December is who is going to make this 
notification? Because as you can expect, the defense pushes 
back on this letter. 
And so now we go to the -- the -- number 39, 
please? And this is a December 11th, 2007 letter from Ken 
Starr to you, and if you look on page two, at the front -- at 
the top of the -- the top of the page there, he is -- this 
EFTA00009170

Page 355 
letter is complaining about an oral notification that Ms. 
gave to a -- one of the defense -- one of the 
victim's attorneys that a letter would be coming. 
And so, Mr. Starr is writing you to complain about 
it, and he mentions in -- later in that paragraph that we 
have thought that the notification process had been in 
abeyance until completion of our ongoing discussions with 
respect to that process. So, were you having discussions 
with Mr. Starr about the process at this time? 
A 
I don't recall discussions. I -- I think there was 
at least correspondence, or -- I'm sorry, where are you? I 
was reading the -- reading the letter. This -- I'm sorry, 
where are you? What paragraph? 
Q 
Let's take a look -- and it's been a long day. 
Let's slow down here. We're on the second page of the Starr 
letter. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And it would be this and that, the -- the language 
in there -- in the second sentence, which goes towards the 
bottom. 
A 
This notification, but quite apart from our 
substantive concerns, which -- we had thought the 
notification process had been in abeyance until the 
completion. That appears not to be so. This is 
respectfully -- so, where does it imply that I was having 
EFTA00009171

Page 356 
I don't recall communications with Mr. Starr, that's why I'm 
curious where -- at least verbal communications. I'm curious 
where you're reading that from. 
Q 
I thought he -- he's saying, we had thought that 
the notification process had been held in abeyance until 
completion of our ongoing discussions. Are you saying that 
that's -- he's --
A 
So, I don't know where that may have come from, and 
I don't recall. I recall at one point -- I think I sent a 
letter saying we'll hold off for a week. I don't recall the 
date of that letter, while you review some matters. Where 
the abeyance came from, I can't -- I can't speak to. 
Q 
Okay. Let's go to Exhibit 41b. This is your 
December 19th letter, and what I'd like to draw your 
attention to is page two, the second to last paragraph there. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So, could you tell us how your decision making 
around this paragraph, how you got to this decision? 
A 
So, so, you're asking me to recreate -- I -- at 
some point, the issue clearly moved from 
interacting 
with defense counsel to -- to my desk, and my recollection 12 
years after the fact is -- so, you're saying we shouldn't 
notify them about the state proceeding, and sure, the 
state -- this was negotiated between Epstein and the state 
attorney. 
EFTA00009172

Page 357 
We did not direct the state proceeding. So, 
whatever state process is appropriate for the state process 
will be given. But with respect to the federal resolution, 
we intend to provide victims with notice of the federal 
resolution as required by law, and your question is if we 
thought it was discretionary. 
I recall our believing it was discretionary, but 
you could also -- it doesn't hurt to in a letter say we're 
kind of required to do this, and I think it was the right 
thing to provide them notice of the federal resolution. 
And once that resolution was reached, and part of 
the key word is what the resolution is, my understanding is 
that 
made efforts to notify victims of that resolution 
and let them know that -- that there would be a hearing the 
following Monday, that they should attend, because these --
it would bring an end to the case. 
Q 
Well, let's just back up real quick. As far as --
so, do you -- as far as the state attorney notifying people 
of -- victims of the --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- state resolution, did you have any concerns with 
that particular part of it? 
A 
So, difficult to recreate the thought process 12 
years later, but ultimately you've got federal, and you've 
got state, and the state attorney will do what the state 
EFTA00009173

Page 358 
attorney thinks is appropriate. It's not for me to direct 
the state attorney. 
I'm inferring, based on this language, it's not for 
me to direct the state attorney, or for our office to direct 
the state attorney's office on its obligations with respect 
to the state outcome. 
Q 
Okay. I'm just asking because, you know, the whole 
case came to your office because of some issues with the 
state attorney's resolution of the case. So, now it's going 
back, and they're going to be in charge of the notification. 
Did that raise any flags with you, or did you have any 
concern about whether it would be done correctly, or done at 
all? 
A 
So, again, you've -- I -- this has come up in 
different contexts, and I think it's -- there was obviously a 
concern about how it was being charged, but that doesn't mean 
that they will not fulfill whatever obligations they have. 
Let's not assume that -- that the state attorney's office is 
full of bad actors. 
Q 
Okay. 
BY MS. 
Q 
But even if not assuming that they're full of bad 
actors --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- it's going to be difficult for them to notify 
EFTA00009174

Page 359 
the victims, wasn't it, that they didn't even necessarily 
know the same list as the federal victims, because you had 
found more victims. 
A 
So, we could certainly have shared that list with 
them. I mean, there are -- there are ways that this could 
have happened. I don't know how -- what the communication 
were, but as a conceptual matter, having the state notify 
them of the state hearing and having the federal government 
say, and this is the federal resolution, is consistent with 
the law. 
Q 
But since the federal resolution is tied to the 
state plea, is -- why not just combine the two of them in the 
notification? Here's the federal resolution. We're tying it 
to the state plea, and here's --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the date of the state plea? 
A 
I can't speak to the why not. I can -- you know, I 
can speak to my belief that this would be consistent with 
law. That could also be one approach. I can't speak to why 
A versus B. 
Q 
Did somebody instruct you that -- or did you have a 
conversation consulting with somebody about whether this was 
the better approach? 
A 
I -- I would have said -- you know, based on 
practice -- not recollection, but based on practice, I would 
EFTA00009175

Page 36C 
have sat down with 
, most likely, since he was handling 
this matter, and we would have talked about it. I 
would
not have sent this without running it by at least 
if 
not other individuals in the office. I don't know if based 
on your record there is -- there's e-mails with drafts, but 
you know, every document that I'm aware of was sort of shared 
within the management team, and this would have been one of 
those. 
Q 
With respect to that one specific decision about 
this should be at the discretion of the state's attorney, did 
you consult with anybody in D.C. about that issue? 
A 
I don't recall consulting with someone in D.C. 
about this issue. I recall a general perspective that the 
CVRA as a technical matter did not attach because ultimately 
this was not -- it hadn't -- this was not an indictment. 
BY MR. 
Q 
Oh, can we -- before we leave this letter --
A 
If I could, I -- I -- and I understand your 
questions, but I feel some obligation to raise the tension 
between, did you consult in D.C. versus should you allow D.C. 
review. 
And so, just, you know, we certainly were allowing 
review, but U.S. Attorney's Offices don't consult on every 
matter, especially offices that have the kind of 
experience --
EFTA00009176

Page 361 
MS. 
Mm-hmm. 
THE WITNESS -- that Miami does. 
MR. 
Back to me? 
MS. in 
Mm-hmm. 
MS. 
Mm-hmm. 
MS. 
: Back to you. 
BY MR.
Q 
Before we finish with this latter from the 19th, 
can we look at page three, please? There is -- if you could 
read the first paragraph on page three to yourself, please? 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
Could you -- in that section, you mention that 
prosecutors had asked you to declare a breach, and you 
resisted. Can you discuss that? 
A 
So -- sure. That's -- that's referencing -- I 
think increasing frustrations by the -- by the prosecutors, 
and I think that's reflected in contemporaneous e-mails 
saying, why don't we just rip this up? 
And I recall conversations with 
and that goes 
a little bit to what we talked about earlier, which is 
concern that a unilateral breach would overlay not just the 
initial issues that we had, and not just the fact that the 
victims are getting older and the case isn't getting better, 
but then we have, was the unilateral breach a valid breach, 
or was it not a valid breach? 
EFTA00009177

Page 362 
And is -- is the delay justified or not justified. 
And ultimately, that additional -- that additional 
liability -- not liability, that additional legal uncertainty 
was -- would have made the case even harder, because they 
S 
were very careful to always say there is no breach. 
MS. 
Mm-hmm. 
THE WITNESS Let me -- let me address, because I 
went on to read the next paragraph as well. And so let me 
circle back to an earlier issue --
MR. 
Great. 
THE WITNESS -- because I at least want to address 
it because the next paragraph then says, and it's clear that 
I'm increasingly frustrated. It's against that -- that my 
frustration with it appears to be an 11th hour appeal weeks 
before the now scheduled July 4th plea date. That said, the 
issues raised are important and must be fully vetted 
irrespective of timelines concerns. We hope to preserve the 
July 4th date. 
I understand defense counsel shares our -- with 
this in mind, and in the event the defense counsel may wish 
to seek review of our determination in Washington, I spoke 
this past Monday with Attorney Gen 
confirming if it's 
possible appearing to ask her to grant the potential request 
for review, and to in fact review this case in an expedited 
manner in an attempt to preserve the July 4th date. 
EFTA00009178

Page 363 
MR.IIIIF: January 4th. 
MS. 
: That address -- January. 
THE WITNESS I'm Sorry, the January 4th plea date. 
Sorry, it's --
BY MS. 
Q 
And that addresses the question I was asking. 
A 
And that goes to the question you're asking, and 
again, I'm recreating and I'm speculating. Having that 
following the -- another 11th hour appeal here, I would say 
I -- I wouldn't say, let's appeal this again. I think I'm 
saying pretty clearly, it's against my frustration with what 
appears to be an 11th hour appeal weeks before the now 
scheduled July -- January 4th plea date that this is not an 
invitation to do another appeal, because the appeal is 
5 
already in Washington. 
But my -- my saying, if -- if we're going to do 
this appeal, let's get it over and done with, then I'm sort 
of speculating based on the language, so that we can get this 
pled on January 4th, and let's not put it off until after the 
holidays. 
Q 
But you did say, "To ask her to grant the potential 
request," --
A 
Which is --
Q 
-- "for review." 
A 
Which is why I wanted to on my own raise it, 
EFTA00009179

Page 364 
because is that saying please appeal me, or is that saying --
this is an 11th hour appeal that you have now taken to 
Washington. 
It is December 19th. We're about to go into the 
holidays. There's a January 4th plea date. This should not 
be another way to put it off. And so, if you're going to do 
this, I'm going to try to expedite it so we can get this 
done. 
Q 
And in fact, it took until May --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- 15. 
A 
And it did, and apologies, I just realized my voice 
is --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- rising. So, I don't know if that's my 
frustration at reading this again, or it's getting late, but 
it -- but it was a frustrating matter. Apologies. 
BY MR. 
Q 
Let's just move to Exhibit 46. So, this is an e-
mail from Ms. 
to you and 
discussing how she 
has interviewed some victims that day. There's a mention 
that one of the victims said that she would rather not get 
any money and she'd have 
she would rather have Epstein 
spend a significant time in jail. Did that piece of 
information go into your character list at all about how the 
EFTA00009180

Page 36
case should be resolved? 
A 
So, again, not based on recollection, because this 
is maybe if not 12, 11 years ago. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
But at this point, there had been an agreement. 
The agreement was signed. It was being reviewed. Based on 
this e-mail, we're trying to get and expedite the criminal 
division, because I -- I see it says please reach to 
to 
make her decision. 
And I -- I think at this point, as I said, if --
we knew earlier -- if we knew that it was going to go this 
long and take all of this, I think we may have approached the 
case differently, but we were so far along on this, there was 
a signed agreement. 
The United States can't unwind an agreement just 
because it's frustrated, or just because some victim 
indicates that they don't like it. That's not -- you know, 
if the agreement is not legally valid, if there are some 
other concerns, but I don't think this in and of itself would 
have been grounds for unwinding an agreement. 
Q 
Do you think it's misleading for the government to 
have been interviewing these witnesses and preparing them for 
a trial when there's already a signed NPA that resolves the 
issue? 
A 
So, that was part of the judgement that there's a 
EFTA00009181

Page 366 
signed agreement, but based on the course of conduct, is that 
agreement really an agreement that will be honored? And so 
there was an ongoing investigation as well, because we didn't 
know if we'd go to trial, and I know that -- not I know. 
My recollection is that the judgement was until we 
know that this agreement is really going to be performed 
fully, that to inform victims of the possibility of civil 
recovery is problematic, and -- and I can't say that 
judgement's incorrect. That -- I think that's a valid 
judgement. 
Q 
Fair enough, and then the last question on this e-
mail is at the bottom, Ms. 
invites you to attend 
interviews with four of the girls who would be coming in the 
following day. 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
Did -- did you attend? 
A 
I -- I did not, and as U.S. Attorney, I don't think 
I attended -- that's not -- that wasn't typical for our 
office. 
Q 
Would -- was that ever -- had you ever had that 
type of request come from a line assistant? 
A 
Not to my recollection, but I also tended not to 
have communications come from line assistants in the first 
place. 
Q 
Were you at all curious, given the -- you discussed 
EFTA00009182

Page 367 
the issues with the witnesses in this case --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that, potential impeachment, and that -- you 
know, that caused you to -- that went into the negotiation 
phase. Did you have any interest in seeing these people --
even interacting with them personally so you could make your 
own assessment? 
A 
So, any interest is --
Q 
Would there be value in doing that? 
A 
So, we had very experienced prosecutors. It's not 
just interacting with the -- the -- the victims were in a 
really hard position. It's not -- how I would draw a 
distinction between a victim being interviewed by an agent, 
and how a victim holds up in court, in a public setting under 
cross examination, and in that, I don't think anyone in the 
office was questioning the pain or the suffering of the 
victims. I think that the issues were how would they hold up 
in court, which are uniquely trial issues. 
what 
Okay. Then let's move onto 
what 
what 
was your understanding that -- that the federal government 
was going to do as far as the notification about the 
resolution of the case? 
A 
So, my understanding was that once we believed that 
the case was going to be -- that the -- that the plea was 
going to go forward, that we would notify the victims of the 
EFTA00009183

Page 368 
resolution, and of the agreement, and how -- basically, how 
it played out. 
Q 
Now, are you saying now -- now, you had agreed to 
not notify -- well, did you -- I mean, you're -- one would 
read your December 12th -- 19th letter as an agreement that 
the federal government is not going to notify the victims of 
the state plea. That's -- and that will end that part of the 
case. Is that correct? 
A 
So, so, I would parse my letter differently, and 
this is 12 years after the fact, and so this isn't based on 
recollection, but on my reading and my understanding of the 
course of conduct in this case, sitting here now. 
Q 
Me-hmm. 
A 
My understanding was that our office was 
notified -- was it on a Friday afternoon? 
Q 
Yes. 
A 
That he would be pleading on Monday, and that at 
that time, 
made efforts to notify victims that he would 
be pleading, and that that would terminate the federal 
resolution of this matter, and that the victims should attend 
that hearing, which wasn't the state resolution of the case. 
It was the federal resolution. 
Q 
And so, you -- you're saying that the state plea 
was also the federal resolution of the case? 
Based on my understanding of what happened, that's 
EFTA00009184

Page 369 
how my recollection -- based on having reviewed the record, 
that's how I believe it proceeded, although I think 
attempted to do so, couldn't reach some attorneys, and 
exercised best efforts to let them know, but did not get 
ahold of all of the victims --
Q 
Let's --
A 
-- over the weekend. 
Q 
Before we get too deep into that, let's just take a 
quick look at Exhibit 51. So, this is an e-mail forwarded to 
you from 
from January -- June 25th, 2008. So, that is 
five days prior to the plea in this case. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Or, the state court plea, and the attachment there, 
you'll notice is a letter with a notification of identified 
victims, and the letter is written, would you disagree --
it's written with, on June 30th, Epstein pled guilty. Do you 
see that? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So, the inference -- it appears to be that this 
letter was to be sent after the plea. 
A 
I -- I see that. I also -- based on my review of 
the record, where I think I'm recalling the 
affidavit, where she said that she made an attempt to notify 
the victims as soon as she was made aware that he would be 
pleading -- that he would be pleading in state court. 
EFTA00009185

Page 370 
Q 
Well, the -- what 
says in affidavit --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- I believe is that she made notification, and the 
police department -- Chief 
police department made 
notifications. Is that -- is that correct? Does that ring a 
bell? 
A 
MR. TODD: Do you have a copy of the affidavit, so 
we can just look at it? 
MR. 
: Do you have 
affidavit e-
mail? 
MS. 
: It's right here. One copy. 
THE WITNESS I'll hand it back. 
MR. 
: Almost done. 
THE WITNESS So, relevant to this paragraph 34, and 
then another paragraph, these and other attacks and efforts 
to avoid the NPA's terms led the FBI investigative team, the 
office, and me to conclude that prosecution at trial remained 
a possibility, and we should prepare as such. 
This meant that the victim notification letters had 
to cease, because one, we no longer knew whether Epstein 
would perform under the NPA, and hence, we did not know 
whether providing information about the NPA would be 
accurate, until we believed that Epstein, through his 
counsel, would attempt to use victim notification concerning 
EFTA00009186

Page 371 
the NPA to suggest that victims had been encouraged by the 
FBI or the office to overstate the victimization for monetary 
compensation. And then fast forwarding because you can read 
it on your own. 
On Friday, June 27th at approximately 4:15, 
received a copy of Epstein's proposed state plea agreement, 
and learned that Epstein's state court change of plea was 
scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on Monday. 
The Palm Beach Police Department and I attempted to 
notify the victims about the hearing in the short time 
available to us. I specifically called to Attorney Edwards 
to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. 
I believe it was during this. I never told that 
the state charges involved other victims, and neither the 
state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer 
limited the procurement of prostitution charges to a specific 
cell. 
So, that was what I was referring to. Again, 
am -- I am basing this based on my review of the affidavit 
and not on recollection of how this may or may not have 
proceeded 12 years ago. 
Q 
Okay. You know, would it surprise you to learn 
that Ms. 
only communicated with Mr. Edwards that 
day? That's because she was under the direction from a 
manger to only contact Edwards regarding this -- the 
EFTA00009187

Page 372 
potential plea for that Monday? 
A 
The affidavit said she attempted to notify the 
victims, so I can't speak to that. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And I don't have an independent recollection of 
this going back 12 years. 
Q 
Were you aware that Ms. 
was directed to 
have no communication with the state's attorney's office, and 
probably during the later period of the case in 2008? 
A 
Not to my recollection. 
Q 
Okay, so did you have -- would you not recall 
hearing anyone directing her to not communicate with the 
state attorney's office? 
A 
I can't speak 12 years later, what role I may or 
may not have had. I question how, if we need -- if there is 
a -- an attempt to schedule a plea in all that, how can there 
not be communication? But I can't -- I can't say whether I 
did or did not. When I say I have no recollection, I mean 
that in the broadest sense of the word. 
Q 
Okay. In your December 19th letter, you -- you did 
agree that the state attorney's office would notify the 
state's victims, right? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And do you have any idea how that was to be 
accomplished? 
EFTA00009188

Page 373 
A 
I can't speak to that, no. 
Q 
And would you have any knowledge of who the state 
victims are? 
A 
I would infer that -- that our office would have 
had sufficient communication with the state attorney's office 
to communicate who the victims were in this case, because it 
was an ongoing -- it was an ongoing matter, and -- but I 
don't know. 
Q 
Do you want to go on? 
MS. 
Okay. Are you -- are you done with 
your -- that portion at least, for the moment? 
MR. =mg 
Yes. Thank you. 
BY MS. 
Q 
I'd just want to clarify something you said a 
moment --
A 
Sure. 
Q 
-- ago, Mr. Acosta. You said you referred to the 
agreement, the NPA, as having been -- it was signed and was 
being reviewed. Were you talking about Washington? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
The criminal division, but we established earlier, 
did we not, that the NPA was not the subject of the criminal 
division review. They expressly declined to review it. 
A 
I stand corrected. 
Q 
Okay. I just wanted to be clear on the record. 
EFTA00009189

Page 374 
Thank you. So, we -- we've had a lot of conversation about 
facts. We are fortunate in this case to have a plethora of 
documents upon which we can rely even 12 years or so after 
the fact, and we've tried to plum your -- the depths of your 
memory as to the events. 
Are there any facts -- any conversations, any 
incidents, anything based on the questions that you've heard 
here today that you recall, have recalled, that you want to 
tell us about, want us to know? 
A 
So, give me a minute to just sort of think this 
through. 
Q 
Of course. 
A 
I think we've covered most of the issues pretty 
clearly. I guess I would have two general comments. The 
first is, whether folks agree or disagree with the initial 
two years, you know, registration and restitution. 
The office's focus was on having Mr. Epstein go to 
jail at a time when, from our perspective, these -- these 
cases were, at least presented with these facts, federally at 
least unusual, and that most trafficking cases involved 
different -- a different sort of nexus. 
It involved bringing individuals into the country, 
or holding individuals against their will, or doing something 
like that, and -- and this will go to my second point which 
is, you know, sitting here, we now see several high profile 
EFTA00009190

Page 375 
individuals who abused power, and have now been prosecuted --
who were known at the time who abused drugs, like Bill Cosby 
and -- who were -- there were rumors at the time, and you 
know, and -- and so, looking back, maybe it was the right 
call. 
Maybe it wasn't the right call, but there is some 
degree of -- I'm not sure what the right adjective is. 
Frustration, that -- and certainly, some of this goes to me, 
but I think a lot of this goes to 
and the individuals 
involved, that the attempt to put someone in jail as opposed 
to decline the case and say this is just a state case, 
that -- that the -- that the federal issues are too tricky, 
that ultimately, this is sort of novel interpretations, that 
the attempt to come up with an outcome has rebounded in the 
way that it has, and I'm not -- I'm not saying, look, that 
that's life, and I understand that. 
But I do think it's important to look back on this, 
and try to be in the shoes of the thought process in 2006 and 
'07 when trafficking prosecutions were fairly new, when, you 
know, more so than today, some jurors may have looked at this 
as prostitution, and were -- perhaps more so than today --
judge's tolerance for victim shaming may have both caused 
more hesitation on the part of victims, but also created more 
issues at trial. And so, I think we've touched on that, but 
I think as we sort of wrap up --
EFTA00009191

Page 376 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
-- this portion of it, it's important to just 
restate that. 
Q 
And -- and to -- in addition, are there any facts 
that you -- conversations, or anything that you --
A 
Fair, you did ask this. 
Q 
-- that we have -- that we've not really elicited 
from you that you want us to know? And to be clear, you'll 
have an opportunity to --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- supplement this. 
A 
Not that I can think of 
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- sitting here. 
Q 
All right. How do you respond to public criticism 
that the defense attorneys -- the Epstein defense team, were 
gaining extraordinary access to an influence on prosecutors 
from the line level all the way up through the department? 
A 
So, I would point out early on in the case -- when 
I said early, you pushed back, but from my perspective, early 
on in the case. Not when it was first investigated, but when 
it first bubbled up for decision. 
Q 
And that would be mid-2007? 
A 
Mid-2007. June-ish, May to June 2007, May, June, 
July. We determined, here are -- here is what we'd need for 
EFTA00009192

Page 377 
resolution. And I -- I think I addressed some of this in the 
Daily Beast's letter. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
Because we were receiving criticism back then, and 
I think that letter has been misconstrued to some extent, 
because it was not, oh, here are influential people, we're 
backing off. 
It was, we, early on, set three criteria. Two 
years, registration, restitution. Despite all these 
attorneys, despite all these appeals, despite all these 
efforts, the office did not budge with the caveat of the 24 
!2 
to 18 months, which we've discussed, and from my perspective, 
despite all of that, I backed the office in sticking by that 
resolution in the various appeals to Washington. 
And so ultimately, it was a year-long process, but 
we ended up a year later exactly where we started with the 
caveat of the 24 to 18. And so, to the extent that there was 
influence, there was -- there was no change in position. 
Q 
Well, my question was access. That this team of 
defense attorneys --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- had extraordinary access, that they asked for 
meetings, they --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- pressed for -- with communications, and they had 
EFTA00009193

Page 378 
that access. Was -- did that seem extraordinary to you? 
A 
So, they asked for a meeting with me before the 
agreement was signed. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
I granted that. That's not the first and only time 
that I granted a meeting to -- to defense attorneys. I don't 
think it's atypical, particularly as a case is coming to --
to resolution 
for a U.S. Attorney to sit down and meet 
with opposing counsel, and I can think of several cases where 
that happened 
There was certainly a lot of access in 
Washington. I would speak to -- you know, I think that's a 
question to direct to this building. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
Because the process here was lengthy, and 
frustrating. But I think we successfully held firm in our 
positions, despite all the process in this building. 
Q 
And again, my focus is not on your response, but on 
the access. 
A 
And --
Q 
Based on the prominence and the -- the prominence 
of the defense attorneys. If these had been local attorneys, 
your sort of average criminal defense attorney from, you 
know, name where they hang out in --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- Miami coming to you and pressing for this, you, 
EFTA00009194

writ large, the department, do you believe they would have 
had the same or a comparable level of access? 
A 
So --
Q 
I don't know the answer. I'm asking. 
A 
Yeah. So, I guess I'd respond this way. If an 
attorney after meeting with my management staff asked for a 
meeting with me, I believe I did and would have granted it, 
and I can think of several matters on which those types of 
meetings were granted. And so, that was not unusual. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
With respect to the back and forth after the 
2 
agreement was signed? This was an unusual agreement, and to 
some extent, as a result, the back and forth quickly 
elevated, particularly because matters would elevate in 
particular when they were being addressed at main justice. 
That would be one natural way for matters to elevate within 
the office. And so, the fact that they were being addressed 
and reviewed, and letters were coming here, would naturally 
elevate the way the matter was treated in Miami. 
Q 
In particular, Jay Lefkowitz had ready access to --
of course, he was involved in the negotiations with 
directly in creating the NPA, but after that, it appears from 
the record that he was often contacting you, and running or 
going above the people who worked for you, and on numerous 
occasions, you -- again, my characterization -- reprimanded 
EFTA00009195

Page 380 
him, or instructed him not to do that, and to direct his 
communications to the line attorney or her supervisors. Is 
that -- is that --
A 
Q 
-- a fair characterization? 
A 
Yes, on -- I think on several occasions, I said 
direct them, and again, that was after the agreement was 
signed, but yes. 
Q 
But there were many issues still pending, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay, and that was his ability to reach out to you 
as a function of your personal association. Is that fair? 
A 
So, I don't think that's a fair characterization. 
I think it -- you could also say that it was the ability 
of -- a function of his -- his insistence in not doing what 
we asked, and the fact that in a typical course, a Miami 
attorney would not have done this, because they would have to 
interact with the office on an ongoing basis. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
And so, the repeat litigator behaves very 
differently than the one time razed earth litigator. 
Q 
Mm-hem. Razed, R-a-z-e-d? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
Is it reasonable to -- for us to understand that 
you have followed the media coverage of what happened in the 
EFTA00009196

Epstein case over the years? 
Q 
In your view overall, and in whatever specific 
respect you wish to address, is -- has it been accurate or 
$ 
not so? 
A 
I think it has been inaccurate in several ways, and 
we can go through them, but --
Q 
If you could just tick those off? 
A 
So, I think it's inaccurate in that it has been 
characterized as our approving a state plea, and --
Q 
Mm-bean. 
A 
-- the complexity of this case was a state plea, 
and we were deferring to -- in favor of a state prosecution 
has been lost, and it's something that I have attempted to 
correct, but it's very difficult to sort of explain that in 
the media. 
You know, this is a bad analogy, and so I haven't 
used it in the media, but I've thought about it, and so I'll 
share it. So, after the Jessie Smollett plea in Chicago, 
there was some discussion of whether the federal government 
should bring charges, and I remember the media saying that, 
and I haven't used this analogy, because I don't want to 
compare, and I think it would be disrespectful to compare the 
facts of that case to what happened to these victims, and I 
still -- and I don't want the comparison to be drawn, but 
EFTA00009197

Page 382 
there is a legal comparison, right? 
The U.S. Attorney in Chicago could have stepped in 
and said, whether or not the state takes this plea, we may 
investigate this federally, and sort of stopped that plea 
from going forward, or at least put a wrench in those gears, 
or the U.S. Attorney could have pursued that under petite 
policy, and did not. 
And so, our stepping into this sort of reminded me 
of how many times cases that are viewed as a manifest 
injustice do occur, and yet the federal government does not 
step in? And the fact that we stepped in has been construed 
as, this became a federal prosecution, and sort of going --
going to -- is it 
or --
A 
sort of question earlier, the 
distinction between -- it was not a manifest injustice versus 
this was the right outcome, is something that I think has 
been lost in the coverage of this matter. 
I think a second issue that has been lost in the 
coverage of this matter is, there are references to Prince 
Andrew, and Alex Dershowitz and Governor Richardson and Bill 
Clinton, and thing happening in London, and the so called 
Lolita Express where things may have happened on airplanes. 
And so, this is viewed from the public as this international 
matter, where the victims were local, the actions, to my 
EFTA00009198

Page 383 
recollection, was local. 
And so, the distinction between this Palm Beach 
incident and what the media likes to cover, which is, you 
know, was, you know, did Mr. Epstein force a minor to have 
sexual relations with Prince Andrew, is a very different fact 
pattern both in terms of the public perception of forcing a 
minor to have sex with a third party, that they have -- you 
know, that is outside the solicitation context. 
It's sort of -- I'm travelling with these women, 
and forcing them to have sex, versus a more local matter 
that -- I don't want to say solicitation, because I think 
we've covered that, but that some may view as that. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
And I think those are two major elements --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- that have been lost in the coverage. 
Q 
The case has been criticized as having involved 
improper influences, or favors, or payments that affected 
decisions that were made within your office, and you're aware 
of all those --
Q 
-- allegations as well. In connection with this 
case. Were you yourself ever offered any -- any payments, or 
any favors, or any promises or job assistance or anything 
like that --
EFTA00009199

Page 384 
A 
No. 
Q 
-- in connection with this case? 
A 
No. 
Q 
And to your knowledge, was there any such offer to 
anyone associated with this case in your office? 
A 
Not to my knowledge. 
Q 
It's been asserted also that the -- the handling of 
the case in the office was affected by Epstein's wealth and 
influence in the Palm Beach community. Do you -- what is 
your -- what's your response to that criticism? 
A 
Again, my response would be, you know, sometime in 
May or June we came up with these three points, and we stuck 
to them, and -- and you know, I -- despite all of this, you 
know, when people make these assertions, somewhere along the 
way, the fact that we stuck to those points is lost and is 
not talked about. 
And so, we did stick to those points. You know, 
and -- and questioned whether the case would have come to us 
in the first place but for -- and so, you know, I think that 
could also go the other way. 
Q 
I don't understand that. 
A 
That it's highly unusual for a case to be brought 
to the state -- to the U.S. Attorney's Office after the state 
attorney declined 
not declines, but --
Q 
Fails to fully prosecute? 
EFTA00009200

Page 385 
A 
Right, and so, so one question that at -- that also 
doesn't get asked is, you know, to what extent was this case 
brought to us in the first place because of this, because of 
his profile? 
Q 
In other words, are you suggesting that his wealth 
and influence in the community affected the state 
authorities? 
A 
I'm not suggesting that. What I'm suggesting is 
the case came in, the case proceeded, and someone can make 
the argument that the only reason that Chief 
brought 
it to us was because it had such a high profile -- are there 
other matters that take place in Palm Beach that a state 
attorney declines in the first place that isn't brought to 
the state attorney because it doesn't rise to that 
Q 
You mean to the V.S. Attorney. 
A 
-- to the -- to the U.S. Attorney because it 
doesn't rise to that profile. 
Q 
All right. All right. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Well, in fairness, he might've done it because of 
the number of victims too, right? 
A 
He may have. I don't know. What I'm suggesting is 
we tried to treat it fairly, not looking at, hey, how wealthy 
is he, but also not saying we need to do this because he is 
so wealthy. 
EFTA00009201

Page 386 
Q 
What do you think about the media's treatment of 
the line assistant, 
=ME? 
A 
I think she -- I wish her name wouldn't be in the 
not why they take the pay cuts that they take to go into 
federal service, and you know, I think the media coverage of 
this case has been unfair, and has lost a lot of the 
complexities. 
It's not surprising, because I mean, here, we're 
talking about -- about a lot of those complexities, and it 
takes a fairly sophisticated discussion, but I think it's 
particularly unfair on 
Q 
In your attorney's written response, he used the 
term relentless for -- to characterize the team of lawyers --
the defense lawyers, and in that Daily Beast article that 
you --
F.• 
Q 
-- wrote, you referred to the yearlong assault on 
media. You know, to some extent, U.S. Attorneys, when they 
take the job, realize that part of their job is to take the 
slings and arrows. 
You know, there are instances when AUSAs were 
accused of misconduct, and -- and I always sort of felt that 
that was -- I don't want to say below the belt, but that's 
the prosecution and the prosecutors, you noted that the 
EFTA00009202

Page 387 
defense was, "More aggressive than any of which I or the 
prosecutors in my office had previously encountered." You 
noted that the defense investigated prosecutors and tried to 
disqualify two, and I believe that those two are 
and
. Is that -- 
A 
That is correct. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
And you also noted, or asserted that there were 
investigations into the family lives of individual 
prosecutors, accusations of bias and misconduct against 
individual prosecutors, and even the threat of a book on 
prosecutorial zeal. Do you still regard that 
characterization as accurate? 
A 
I do. You know, whether I would use those same 
words now, we can spend a lot of time talking about it, and 
I'd want --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- to think about, but I do think that's accurate. 
I think this really was a razed earth type of matter, and in 
the office's typical interactions, the prosecutors know they 
have to come back to the office. And so, they would not 
sorry, not the prosecutors. It's getting late, though. The 
defense counsel. 
And so, they would not -- it's not just the 
EFTA00009203

Page 388 
accusations against the attorneys, but the 
mischaracterization. I -- you know, I could go through the 
record, and there's several instances where my words, or 
other AUSAs words are being mischaracterized, or where 
going back to one of the Mlle -mails, people walk out of the 
meeting believing they have an agreement, and then that's 
unwound, and -- that that is not -- I don't know if that's 
typical in Washington, but that's certainly not typical in 
the Miami office. 
Q 
All right, in that Daily Beast article, I think you 
also used the term peccadillos. 
What did you mean by that in particular? 
A 
Could I see the -- could I see the --
Q 
Mm-hmm. I was afraid you'd ask that. I have it 
right in front of me, and I don't at the moment, but --
MS. 
Are you talking about the to whom it 
may concern letter? 
MR. 
: Yes. 
THE WITNESS Yes. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Yes. Thank you, and it's a reference on the second 
numbered page of this copy, to personal peccadillos, in the 
middle of the page. 
A 
Also, individual prosecutors and their families 
EFTA00009204

Page 389 
looking for personal peccadillos that provide a -- so, 
was, to my recollection, she wasn't investigated. 
I 
tri 
and I haven't encountered that in other cases. 
I recall it -- at one point, they also looked in 
, and 
family, and his background, and I thought that was 
little out of line.

F.

Q 
EFTA00009205

Ni
A 
tl
lilt the point I was trying to convey is, this is 
not a -- this is not typical behavior by defense counsel. 
Q 
Did --
A 
And despite all this, my point was, despite all 
this, we did not budge. 
Q 
And again, that's not the focus of --
Right. 
Q 
-- of this guestion.I 
A 
Q 
Q 
All right. Are there any other examples where 
defense counsel came to you that have not otherwise been 
addressed with --
Q 
-- allegations about someone --
A 
I'm hesitating --
EFTA00009206

Page 391 
Q 
-- else --
A 
-- just because I'm trying to think through, and 
not to my recollection, no. 
Q 
Did they ever raise or imply that there were 
that there was information regarding you of whatever respect, 
that was in the nature of a sort of a threat, or a veiled 
warning? 
A 
So, the book reference was that I might be 
personally embarrassed by pursuing this matter, because I 
would be the subject of a chapter in a book on prosecutorial 
overreach. 
Q 
And who was going to write that book? Do you know? 
A 
Professor Dershowitz. 
Q 
MM-hmm. Okay. Did you consider him a professional 
friend at all? 
A 
I had not, to my recollection, met him. I -- I 
understand in this letter I sort of grouped him in. 
Q 
ma-hmm. 
A 
But I would -- I'd say for the record that it's 
hard to know what my intent was in 2011, but that's for 
simplicity of grouping individuals, because I did go to 
Harvard. 
I may have run into him at Harvard, but he was not 
my professor, and I don't -- I didn't work for him as a 
teaching assistant. I had some interest in criminal law, so 
EFTA00009207

Page 392 
I may have chatted with him, but -- but that would have been 
it. 
Q 
And did you consult with him at all in connection 
with your efforts -- your interest in potentially teaching or 
being involved in the -- sort of the law school world, either 
at Harvard, or at Florida International, or anywhere else? 
A 
Not to my recollection. At some point when I 
applied for the deanship -- I wasn't aware of the deanship 
until -- so, let's -- let's take this -- let's take this in 
part. I thought about looking at Harvard for a teaching 
position. To my recollection, I never followed through on 
that. 
Q 
Mn-bmm. 
A 
I knew Elena Kagan, and may have had a conversation 
with her that would have been a preliminary, how does this 
process work? But I don't recall taking it -- if I took it 
that far, and I'm not saying that I did -- this was a long 
time ago -- I never sort of went through -- the way law 
schools hire is a very -- they call it the "meat market." 
Q 
Min-hmm. 
A 
Take that for what it's worth. It's something that 
happens at the hotels here, at the -- at the Marriott here 
in -- on Connecticut, and it's a very formalized process, and 
I never --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
EFTA00009208

Page 393 
A 
-- went through that. I don't recall any 
conversation with Professor Dershowitz about that. To the 
extent I was thinking about it, it'd be natural for me to 
talk to 
but I don't recall talking to him. With 
respect to Professor Dershowitz, with respect to FIU, the 
dean process is very decentralized. 
To the extent a faculty member spoke to him, I 
don't know. To my recollection, and again, this is a long 
time ago, I did not ask him for a reference or a letter or 
something to that regard, although I may have. It was a 
long, long time ago. I was also no longer active in this 
case at the time. 
Q 
All right, and what about with respect to that same 
process on your part, Ken Starr, who actually was a dean of a 
law school at the time? Did -- did he provide you with a 
reference, or --
A 
Not --
Q 
-- advice? 
A 
Not to my recollection. 
Q 
Ail right. 
A 
As -- as the letter from -- from Ken at the end, 
there was some -- by the time this was over, there was some 
degree of tension between us on my resolution of this matter. 
Q 
But it also appeared to be tension that both of you 
were eager to leave aside. 
EFTA00009209

Page 394 
A 
I'm a big believer, and I had good relationships 
with the defense bar. I think lawyers can disagree and not 
be disagreeable, and we would be a better profession if we 
all learned to do that. 
Q 
So would the world. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
There is an -- sort of investigative journalist 
author named 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Do you know that name? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Did you ever speak with her? 
A 
So, she was the recipient of the do -- to whom it 
may concern letter at the Daily Beast. 
Q 
Oh, really? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
All right. All right. Thank you. I didn't -- we 
didn't know that. Did she comment back to you on it? 
A 
It was a long time ago. I don't -- I don't recall. 
Q 
So, she wrote a book called trafficking. Have you 
read that --
A 
She did --
Q 
-- about this case? 
A 
She did. I haven't read it recently, but I read it 
a while ago. 
EFTA00009210

Pane 395 
Q 
And she says in that book that you told her a few 
years after the NPA was signed that as she writes, "He felt 
incapable of going up against those eight powerful attorneys. 
He felt his career was at stake." Did you say that to her? 
A 
Not to my recollection, and what I tried to do was, 
for the record, provide this letter to her, and the purpose 
of this letter was to say the exact opposite, which is -- and 
you know, we have this -- you know, and she and the New York 
Times, and I think the New York Times called it -- what --
what's the word? Like, apologia? Does anyone know what --
Q 
Apologia. 
A 
Apologia. 
Q 
It's a -- it's an --
A 
-- 
Q 
-- apology. It's a fancy way of saying --
Q 
-- you're --
A 
Ye4h. 
Q 
-- explaining yourself. 
A 
Yeah. I looked it up, and it's a little more 
derogatory than explaining yourself, because I felt a need 
Q 
Ma-ham. 
A 
-- to look it up, but the New York Times called 
this letter an apologia. 
Q 
Ma-ham. 
EFTA00009211

Page 396 
A 
And this was recently, and I say this, because when 
folks read this letter, they read it as, this is why, you 
know, we had these -- they -- I think sometimes they 
selectively read language. The prosecutors and agents in 
this case -- and what followed was a yearlong assault. I 
used the word assault as it was more aggressive than anything 
in which I or the prosecutors in my office had previously 
encountered. 
Excuse me. Mr. Epstein hired an army of legal 
superstars, Harvard Professor Dershowitz, former judge and 
then Pepperdine lodging Ken Starr, former deputy assistant to 
the president then Kirkland & Ellis law partner Jay 
Lefkowitz, and several others, including prosecutors that 
formerly worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office, the child 
exploitation section -- I'm not sure who that was -- of the 
Department of Defense, and they --
Q 
Department of Defense? 
A 
No, no, in the child exploitation and obscenity 
section of the Justice Department. Defense attorneys next 
requested a meeting with me. And they read that as saying 
these -- there were all these powerful lawyers in the case, 
but they don't then go on to talk about, despite this army of 
attorneys, the office held firm to the terms first presented 
to Mr. Black in the original meeting. 
Q 
So, is it your -- so, what I understand you saying 
EFTA00009212

Page 397 
is that the panoply, this pantheon of attorneys did not have 
the influence on you that's alleged? 
A 
And -- and the purpose of this letter was to say, 
despite all this 
O 
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- we held firm. So, how can you say that there's 
influence if we held firm? 
Q 
So, the --
A 
And I would -- I would also -- I'm sorry. 
Q 
No, no. 
A 
I would also note, and I think we talked about 
this, that those terms were developed before many of these 
individuals came on board. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
A 
So, it's not like these terms were developed 
because, oh, now these individuals are on board. 
Q 
All right. And we haven't, of course, talked about 
the whole work release issue, but --
R 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- I think that speaks -- the record --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- speaks for itself on that. 
A 
Yeah. 
BY MS. 
Q 
So, I'm not sure I'm clear. Did you have an 
EFTA00009213

interview, or give a -- have a conversation with Ms. 
aside -- or, just sent her this letter? 
A 
I spoke to her briefly saying, I'm not going to 
speak on the record. I'm not going to address even off the 
record details of this case, but I will provide a letter to 
you. I've had a lot of requests over the years to talk about 
this case. 
There were enough requests coming that I thought it 
important to provide a statement to defend the actions of the 
office. I didn't want it to be to one reporter in 
particular, because I did not want to play favorites. And 
so, I provided a to whom it may concern letter that was a 
public letter, but then I gave it to her. 
MS. 
: All right. Go on? 
BY MS. 
Q 
And just one thing on the work release issue. Did 
you tell the defense that -- that the U.S. Attorney's Office 
would not object if he got work release as long as he was 
treated like every -- like every other defendant? 
A 
So -- so, I don't recall what I may or may not have 
said specifically around work release. My recollection of 
our general position is, you're pleading in state court to 
incarceration of 18 -- it's now 18 months, it was 24. 
Whether it was 18 or 24, this would have been -- any 
conversation I would have had would have been after the 
EFTA00009214

Page 399 
agreement was signed. 
It's our expectation that he be treated just like 
everyone else, if -- if it was typical to provide that kind 
of work release in these cases, that would have been news to 
S 
me. I certainly would not have expected that, and I think 
based on our subsequent communications with the state 
attorney's office, that was not what our office envisioned. 
By the same token, I don't think our office envisioned that 
he be treated worth that the typical offender. 
Q 
Well, did you know that 
was in fact trying to 
make sure that he didn't get work release? 
A 
Yes. And so, I don't see any reason why I would 
have contradicted that, is -- is my point. 
Q 
All right. You've mentioned a number of times that 
the sexual offender registration was the -- one of the three 
important prongs for you and the office. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
What was it that you saw the sex offender 
registration as accomplishing? 
A 
So, to some extent it's putting the community on 
notice that, irrespective of whether he's in Florida or 
elsewhere, he's a registered sex offender. To some extent, I 
don't know if this is -- but I'll say it anyhow. This was a 
serious crime, and there is a public sanction associated with 
this, and I thought to the extent that he committed the types 
EFTA00009215

Page 400 
of acts that typically are associated with registration that 
that should go forward, but the primary motivation there was, 
put the public on notice that he is a registered sex 
offender. 
Q 
And did you see any conflict with that as being a 
goal with the provision in the NPA that was -- that the NPA 
was going to be kept confidential, and the communications in 
B 
which the -- in which the U.S. Attorney's Office was having 
with the defense about continuing to keep things 
confidential? Do you see any inconsistency between those 
two? 
A 
No, in that I -- I genuinely was of the opinion 
that this NPA would go public, and certainly his public 
his state court plea would be public, and his registration 
would be public. And so, it would -- what he did would be 
known. 
Q 
And given what you know about these office's back 
and forth on notifying the victims, do you think, looking at 
the entire course of conduct of the office, that the victims 
were treated fairly, and with dignity and respect? 
A 
So, I want to be careful, not because I'm fudging, 
but because it's a complex question. If, looking back in 
hindsight, we knew that there would be a -- what was it? Two 
eight months period, when -- do we have an agreement, do we 
not have agreement, is this concluded, is this not concluded? 
EFTA00009216

Page 401 
Is this an ongoing investigation? 
How do we deal with all these notification issues? 
If we had foreseen all of that, I think I've said before, 
that -- that something I certainly think should have been 
considered, and it's very possible we would have done 
something very different. 
But that was not foreseen. And so, it's then a 
very difficult judgement to be made, because there is an 
agreement. There is concern as to if we have to go to trial, 
how do you address this? 
There is, you know, going to the 
affidavit, at least one instance -- and I'm merging my 
recollection here, and -- and my knowledge after the fact, 
because your question sort of calls for an after the fact 
assessment. 
So, you've got the 
affidavit, which 
points out that defense counsel did all they could, but is 
using this to impeach and weaken witness credibility in a 
case where there's already questions around witness 
credibility. 
And so, it's a very imperfect situation with 
discretionary judgements to -- to do the best, to sort of 
balance all these factors. Is that the best outcome? 
Probably not, but that's where the -- that's where we were, 
and that's why I think this case would have been very 
EFTA00009217

Page 402 
differently if 
what was it, October 24 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
-- he would have gone in and plead and taken his 
time and served his time like so many other people have done 
as opposed to mount all these legal challenges that we then 
had to work through. 
Q 
And I'll preface my question with the -- with the 
fact that we're still investigating this. We've made no 
conclusions --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- with respect to this, but if OPR determines that 
your office should be criticized for its handling of this --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- matter, does that criticism fall on you, or does 
it fall on your senior managers? Because as a non-
prosecutor, you were relying on them to keep you informed, 
and for their judgement. 
A 
So, I was the U.S. Attorney. I certainly relied on 
my staff, but ultimately, I was the U.S. Attorney, and I 
don't think it's justifiable or fair to sort of say this was 
on them. I was sufficiently aware of matters that -- that --
it was my office, and -- and while I'll say that I was -- I 
might not recall this, or I was relying on A, B, or C for 
guidance, or to handle this matter, ultimately, I think those 
judgements always sort of bubble up. 
EFTA00009218

Page 403 
BY MS. 
Q 
In your press conference, you reference -- this is 
the -- I think July 10, 2019 press conference. You 
referenced victims, what they went through was 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- horrific, you said, and then you said, I've seen 
these videos. I've seen the interviews. I have seen the 
interviews on television of these victims, and their stories. 
Just to be clear, are you talking about interviews and 
television coverage and videos recently, or back in 2006 
and --
A 
Recently. 
Q 
-- 2007? Okay. I just wanted to be very clear 
about that. The U.S. Attorney's manual requires us all in 
the department to conduct the fair, even handed 
administration of the federal criminal laws. What's your 
view as to how the handling of this case comported with that 
principle? 
A 
So, I do think it was fair, and even handed. We --
you know, after the fact, may look back and say that two year 
may not have -- you know, it shouldn't have been a manifest 
injustice standard. It should have been, you know, a sort of 
a de novo, let's treat this as a new prosecution. 
That's a judgement you'll all make, but -- but 
those judgements were made with an eye toward fairness and 
EFTA00009219

Page 404 
impartiality, and once those judgements were made, despite 
all the attorneys involved, and despite all the litigation, 
and all the -- all the stuff, all the appeals to Washington 
and the -- you know, we stuck to that position. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
And I think that speaks to the way the office 
approached this matter. 
Q 
All right. We -- I -- we spoke sort of offline 
earlier about an issue that was raised in that press 
conference that was not clearly answered on your part in that 
context, and the question was -- and this is on page 15 of 
the internet transcript of --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that press conference. You were asked whether 
you were ever made aware that Mr. Epstein was "an 
intelligence asset of some sort." And you -- you in your 
response you said you couldn't answer it -- couldn't address 
it directly because of guidelines. Can you clarify -- first 
of all, were you ever made aware of that --
A 
If he was --
Q 
-- assertion? 
A 
-- I'm not aware of it. 
Q 
All right. Did defense counsel ever say to you 
that Epstein had that status? 
A 
Not to my recollection. 
EFTA00009220

Page 405 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And -- and to clarify, I also don't know where 
press reports from multiple sources -- not from multiple 
sources, but from multiple media outlets that I told someone 
that he was an intelligence asset. 
I do not know where that came from. If -- if I can 
just -- so, there are questions that I may be asked publicly, 
that I don't think it's right for me to comment as to what 
classified information I may or may not know, because that's 
not the kind of stuff you'd go into, but the answer is no, 
and no. 
• 
All right. Without reservation, without any --
A 
No, and no. 
• 
All right. Excellent. Thank you. A couple of 
▪ 
final questions. As you can tell --
A 
Can I -- can I --
Q 
Yes. 
A 
-- address as second issue that has come up at 
times? 
Q 
Yes. 
A 
There are also media reports that this was because 
of cooperation in some financial 
Q 
Me-hmm. 
A 
-- financial matters. I don't know where that may 
have -- I don't know where that may have come from. 
EFTA00009221

Page 406 
Q 
All right. Thank you, and we are familiar with 
that, what you're referring to. 
A 
Was -- was there cooperation related to financial 
matters? 
Q 
We didn't ask you about it. 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
As you can tell, OPR obtained many electronic 
records --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- mainly e-mails, but other electronic holdings 
from the department. The Department of Justice, however, has 
not been able to find/recover a portion of your e-mail 
account as U.S. Attorney that contained e-mails received by 
you between May 26th, 2007, and March 2008. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
A period of time rather relevant to this. We have 
obtained many records of course from senders and from other 
people copied. So, we have many of the records, but the fact 
is, that's a --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- gap in the holdings, and this is despite the 
fact that as you no doubt know, the law requires that U.S. 
Attorney records be maintained and archived --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- indefinitely. Can you give us any insight, any 
EFTA00009222

Page 407 
idea why that might be the case? 
A 
I can't, and my recollection was after -- after 
several issues that took place, the department had some sort 
of records retention software that automatically retained 
these e-mails. Is that not accurate? 
Q 
There was a -- there was a switchover from --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- a period in which that record retention 
responsibility resided with each U.S. Attorney's Office, and 
at the switchover, it became centralized. 
A 
Right. 
And this appears to have sort of gotten lost in 
the --
A 
Been caught in the switchover. I -- my 
recollection is that there was some automatic retention 
mechanism --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- and I can't address that, although there's 
certainly a fulsome -- a fulsome record. 
Q 
But just to ask the inevitable question --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- did you take any action to discard, destroy, or 
dispense with any official records --
F. 
Not --
Q 
-- related to this matter? 
EFTA00009223

Page 408 
A 
Not to my recollection. I think there's a fulsome 
record, and not to my recollection. 
Q 
All right, and is there any particular gap that 
you've discerned in the records that we've provided to you? 
A 
Not that I recall. Do you have the e-mails that I 
sent, out of curiosity? 
Q 
We do. 
A 
Okay. So, you have the sent, but not received. 
Q 
Yes. 
A 
Just checking. 
Q 
And lik 
, we retrieved from the federal records 
center --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- records that were boxed up and sent there, hard 
copy documents, after your term ended, and there is nothing 
that relates to the Epstein case. There were records that 
were maintained that were kept in the main office --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- after you left, because it was an ongoing 
matter, but it -- do you have any idea why there are not any 
in the records of yours --
A 
So --
Q 
-- that were sent? 
A 
So, I have a recollection that when I left, there 
were some binders that I passed along to 
, because it was 
EFTA00009224

Page 409 
an ongoing case, and we sort of had binders out that sort of 
had correspondence back and forth. 
Q 
All right, and you've already made 
we've 
we -- I asked you about facts, but you addressed a sort of a 
broader statement to us for the record about the case. Is 
there anything else you want to tell us at this point? 
A 
Give me a second to --
Q 
Sure. 
A 
-- sort of think this through. 
Q 
In fact, if you'd like to take a quick break and 
talk to your attorney, and that will be the last question. 
A 
Do we need a break? 
MR. 
: No. 
MS. 
: Your attorney says god no. 
THE WITNESS I will -- I will follow up on this. 
MS. 
All right. 
THE WITNESS Nothing that I -- if something comes 
up, my understanding is that we're receive the transcript, 
and have enough time given the length of this to review and 
comment. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Exactly, yes, and for the record --
A 
Right. 
Q 
when the transcript is prepared, which should be 
within a couple of weeks, we'll ship that off to your 
EFTA00009225

Pac,-
attorney. 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
We'll ask you to review it, to make not only any 
corrections, but also clarifications, and to add to it --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- if you feel having read something that it needs 
to be clarified or expanded upon, you're invited to do so. 
A 
And if I could ask one -- one other question. Is 
there -- and I'm not familiar enough with the way OPR 
operates, and this may be suigeneris, so you may not be 
prepared to answer, if there is a report as opposed to a 
letter, which is what I typically am familiar with, will that_ 
report be shared in advance for comment? 
Q 
I am going to --
A 
Or is that to be determined? 
MS. 
I am going to defer to Ms. 
for that. 
MS. 
: That's a question that doesn't need to 
be on the record. Do you have anything else that you'd want 
to put on the record before we close out? 
THE WITNESS: I do not. 
MS. 
All right. 
MS. 
: All right. Thank you. I want to 
extend our great appreciation for your willingness --
THE WITNESS No problem. 
EFTA00009226

MS. 
Page 411 
-- to come in and help us with this 
case. 
THE WITNESS So, so, let me -- now that we're off 
the record, let me say --
MS. 
: Are we off the record? 
THE REPORTER: Not yet. 
THE WITNESS Not yet? Oh. 
MS. 
No? 
THE REPORTER: You didn't say it. 
MS. 
: All right. That's it. We're off 
the record.

R. ALEXANDER ACOSTA 
was called as a witness and, having been first duly sworn, 
was examined and testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION 
BY MS. 
Q 
So, would you tell us your name, please? 
A 
Rene Alexander Acosta. 
Q 
And Mr. Acosta, you're accompanied by your 
attorney, Gordon Todd, is that correct? 
, 
• 
And Mr. Todd, would you identify the associate you 
have with you? 
MR. HERRON: Yes, T.J. Herron. 
MS. 
: H-e-r-r-o-n?

: 
Thank you. Mr. Acosta, I'm 
I am a counsel with the Office of Professional 
Responsibility here at the Department of Justice, and with me 
are my fellow OPR counsel, 
and IIII 
. We are in a conference room at the Department of 
Justice main building on today, October 18, 2019, and we're 
starting at about 9:30 in the morning. Before we start, I'd 
just want to put on the record that Mr. 
worked in 
EFTA00009231

Page 4 
the Civil Rights Division at the time that you were the AAG 
heading that division, and I believe had an occasion to 
briefly meet you in connection with a matter. 
THE WITNESS: Could I ask what section? 
MR. 
I was in the special litigation 
section. 
THE WITNESS: Oh, okay. 
MR. 
: And I provided Mr. Acosta some 
talking points for a press situation that we had in that 
case. 
THE WITNESS: 14141. 
MR. 
: Yes. 
THE WITNESS: Probably. 
BY MS. 
Q 
All right. Thank you. Mr. Acosta, OPR is 
investigating two things. As you know, one, whether one or 
more federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida 
U.S. Attorney's Office may have committed professional 
misconduct by entering into the non-prosecution agreement, or 
NPA, in 2007 with Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time was under 
investigation by that office, and the FBI, for engaging in 
widespread sexual misconduct involving underage females. 
The second thing we're investigating is Judge 
Marra's finding of February of this year, 2019, that the 
government may have violated -- or, actually, he found the 
EFTA00009232

Page 5 
government did violate the CVRA, or Crime Victims' Rights Act 
when it entered into the MPA without first providing the 
victims with notice and a reasonable right to confer with the 
government. 
You are a subject of the OPR investigation, that 
is, one of -- somebody whose conduct is being reviewed and 
evaluated by OPR, and specifically as U.S. Attorney at the 
time for the Southern District of Florida, you had the 
ultimate authority over the Epstein for a period of two and a 
half years, as we understand it, from the time the line AUSA 
first briefed you and then criminal chief 
in July of 2006, and until you were formally 
recused from the case on or about the 8th of December, 2008, 
after notifying the executive office of the U.S. Attorneys 
that you were seeking employment with Kirkland S Ellis, a 
firm of which two attorneys, Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz had 
been representing Jeffrey Epstein. Is that correct? 
A 
We may -- we may get into it a little bit later, 
but I think the characterization of my seeking employment is 
not accurate, we can talk about that a little bit later. 
Q 
All right. We have the documents that relate to 
that. So, that's what we're -- we're basing it on. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
And I believe the term that's used is seeking 
employment. 
EFTA00009233

Page 6 
A 
That -- that is the term used in the e-mail. I 
think I addressed that in my -- I believe Mr. Todd addressed 
that in the letter that was sent to --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- OPR. 
Q 
All right. Thank you. So, we recognize that 
you're not longer with the Department of Justice --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and that it is your choice to come and talk to 
us, and we very much appreciate your willingness to 
voluntarily do so and help us figure this case out. OPR 
provided you with a few thousand pages of records, e-mails, 
and correspondence and some other documents that reflect your 
involvement in the Epstein matter over that two and a half 
year period. 
Now that you've had a chance to review, I hope, 
those e-mails and other documents, we hope you can be 
specific in helping us understand what happened. Have you in 
fact been able to review those documents? 
A 
Yes, I have. 
Q 
Thank you. OPR asked you for a written response to 
certain questions, and we've received and reviewed a written 
response prepared and submitted not by you, but by your 
attorney, Mr. Todd, on your behalf. Have you reviewed his 
response to --
EFTA00009234

Page 7 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- you? 
A 
Yes, I have. 
Q 
And will you now under oath subscribe to that 
response as if you had submitted to it yourself? 
A 
So, Mr. Todd spoke to me and conveyed the 
investigation that I provide him. I believe he conveyed that 
information accurately, and the statements that he ascribes 
to me in that letter I believe are accurate. 
Q 
All right. Do you have any changes or corrections 
to that written response? 
A 
No, I do not. 
Q 
Is there anything in it that you do not agree with? 
A 
Again, I think that the statements that he ascribes 
to me are accurate, and I agree with them. 
Q 
All right. So, we are going to accept that 
statement as representing accurately your -- what you would 
have responded if you had responded to us directly. Is that 
correct? 
A 
I -- yes, the statements, he basically gives my 
positions, and I believe that he gave my positions 
accurately. 
Q 
Perfect. Thank you. So, as we ask questions and 
refer to documents, we would like you to correct any 
misstatements in our questions, or any misstatements or 
EFTA00009235

Page 8 
errors that are in the documents themselves, because we want 
to make sure the entire record --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- is correct. Also, there's been an enormous 
amount of publicity about the Epstein case, particularly this 
year, including about the events and decisions made back in 
2006 to 2010 that are the subject of our investigation. And 
so as best you can, we ask you to try to answer today from 
your knowledge, understanding, and recollections as of that 
period of time. However, to the extent you are asked or do 
speak retroactively, retrospectively, we'll just make it 
clear that you're doing so. 
A 
All right. 
Q 
Okay? 
A 
And if I could just say, one of the difficulties is 
with everything that -- all the publicity and all the 
documents that have made it to the press and in litigation 
distinguishing between recollection versus after the fact 
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- speculation, and I will try, but I would 
appreciate reminders along the way, because it's, it's an 
important distinction, but it's kind of hard sometimes. 
Q 
we recognize particularly the importance of it. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
That's -- that's precisely the heart of --
EFTA00009236

Page 9 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- our matter. So, Mr. Acosta, your professional 
background is a matter of public record. I have a couple of 
questions. By what state bar are you currently licensed? 
A 
So, I am inactive in 
I believe inactive in 
Pennsylvania and also in D.C. 
Q 
All right, and not in Florida? 
A 
Not in Florida. 
Q 
So, are -- is it -- do I understand that you are 
not currently an active member of any bar? 
A 
I would have to confirm with D.C. I said not 
inactive in Pennsylvania and in D.C. because I am not certain 
whether I'm currently active or inactive in D.C. I am not 
currently practicing, and so I would have renewed under 
either active or inactive. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And we can --
Q 
we --
A 
We can --
Q 
We --
A 
We can verify that and get that. 
Q 
We would appreciate it if Mr. Todd could let us 
know your current status. I also would like to know the 
status -- your bar status in the period of 2006 through 2008. 
Do you know what that was? 
EFTA00009237

Page 10 
A 
Most likely -- I can -- I can speculate. I don't 
know as a fact. Mostly likely active in D.C. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
And inactive in Pennsylvania. 
Q 
Okay, but likely active somewhere, correct? 
A 
Yes. Yes, I think that's a requirement. 
Q 
Yes, that is a --
A 
And so --
Q 
-- requirement. 
A 
So, it would be D.C., the distinction between 
active and inactive in D.C. is more minor, as I recall, than 
Pennsylvania where there's a large fee difference. 
Q 
All right, thank you, and we look forward to 
hearing confirmation of that from you, Mr. Todd. So, after 
serving nearly two years as the assistant attorney general in 
charge of the department's civil rights division, you were 
presidentially appointed the interim U.S. Attorney for the 
Southern District of Florida in June of 2005, and then as we 
understand it, you were formally nominated as U.S. Attorney 
in June of 2006, and after being confirmed by the United 
States Senate, you were sworn in by the U.S. Attorney -- as 
U.S. Attorney in late October 2006. 
A 
I think that may be inaccurate. I would have to 
confirm. When you say presidentially appointed, I believe it 
may have been appointed by the chief judge at the request of 
EFTA00009238

Page 11 
the Attorney General. The chief judge has appointing 
authority. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And you'd have to go back and confirm whether it 
was either an AG designation or the chief judge --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- which is different than presidential. 
Q 
And I understand, and again, I would appreciate if 
you could --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- follow up on that --
A 
I -- I'm --
Q 
-- Mr. Todd. 
A 
-- not certain how to confirm that. That's 
something that in all candor the department would know --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- much better than I. 
Q 
Then we will pursue it. My point is that there was 
a change in your status from interim to -- you -- the U.S. 
Attorney with the -- with the full --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- confirmation. How if at all did that change in 
status affect your view of and your exercise of your 
authority as U.S. Attorney? 
A 
So, it's difficult to recall. You're now asking 
EFTA00009239

Page 12 
that just ten years back, but even further back. I was 
interim for a sufficiently long period of time that -- that 
by the time the change in status took place, I would 
speculate that I was, in my mind, the, you know, acting as 
U.S. Attorney whether you have an adjunctive interim, or 
acting in front of your name or not. 
You know, I -- I had great people. I don't recall 
when -- when 
came on board as first assistant, but he 
was my crim chief, and I thought for the continuity of the 
office it was important to promote him to first assistant, 
and --
Q 
He was promoted actually effective October of 2006. 
You made a series -- according to e-mails -- the 
announcement -- the personnel announcement was made to be 
effective in October 2006 naming 
chief, and 
as first --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- assistant. 
A 
Right, and they -- they were both long serving 
professionals within the office, and basically, as my 
recollection, everyone just moved up one wrung. 
Q 
Okay. 
as criminal 
A 
You would know better than I, because you have 
those records. And so, sitting here today, I don't recall 
any specific way in which that shift would have impacted --
EFTA00009240

Page 13 
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- my thinking. 
Q 
You had not served as a -- as a prosecutor before, 
and had -- didn't have direct criminal experience is my 
understanding. 
A 
The -- that is correct. I had supervised -- civil 
rights, for example, had supervised criminal prosecutions, 
but I had not been a line prosecutor previously. 
Q 
So, as the U.S. Attorney supervising a couple of 
hundred --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- line prosecutors, most involved in criminal 
work, how -- what -- what -- what interested you most, or 
appealed to you most as you undertook your -- and carried out 
your duties as U.S. Attorney? 
A 
What interested me and appealed to me. So, the 
work of the office, I mean, the -- it's a broad question, but 
the work of --
Q 
)t-hmm. 
A 
-- that office and any U.S. Attorney's Office I 
think is incredibly impactful to any local community, and I 
very much enjoyed being a part of the effort to bring folks 
to justice, to move policy initiatives. You know, I recall 
early on, we identified healthcare fraud 
Q 
Ha-hmm. 
EFTA00009241

Page 14 
A 
-- as one big -- one big area, and we had one of 
the largest out of our -- the largest healthcare fraud 
initiative. You know, we focused quite a bit on gun 
violence, and we did a great job on that, and it's one of 
those jobs where people feel very good about what they do, 
and it's great to be part of it. I'm sure what --
Q 
No, that's --
A 
-- okay. 
Q 
That's helpful. It just gives us a 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- some perspective. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Was there any aspect of it that you particularly 
disliked? 
A 
To the extent you're dealing with personnel issues, 
I think personnel issues are -- are rarely the preferred part 
of any executive function. 
Q 
You mean the conflicts among attorneys, things like 
that, or performance issues? 
A 
Performance issues. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And you know, when you've got -- in any large 
office, you get personnel issues, disciplinary issues, and 
those are never --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
EFTA00009242

Page 15 
A 
-- those are never fun. 
Q 
MM-hmm. So, we talked about the personnel -- high 
level personnel changes you made sort of after your first 
year there. I= 
had, we understand, been functioning 
de facto as a first assistant while IS 
was not. 
He -- we understand 
had been first assistant, but 
he stepped away, and ME NM 
came in to essentially take 
over his brief until he was formerly appointed first 
assistant. Is that consistent with your memory? 
A 
So, you might have characterized that more strongly 
that I would have. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
Again, it's difficult to recreate from back then, 
but there was certainly a transition period from Mr. 
to Mr. 
, and if I could, because when you 
said high level changes, my intent -- it was a great office. 
Great professionals. My intent in elevating Mr. 
was 
just you go from criminal chief to first assistant, and I 
don't recall Mr. 
prior position, but I know that he 
was also elevated. I think he might have been major crimes, 
but --
Q 
That's correct. 
A 
-- I'd be -- I'd be speculating. 
Q 
We can --
A 
I could guess it. 
EFTA00009243

a e 
Q 
We can verify that. 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
Yes. What was your assessment of 
His 
capabilities, his judgement, and his working relationship 
with you on a day to day basis? 
A 
Outstanding. He had been in the office for 
decades. He was respected by everyone. He had a good tone 
to him. He was someone, you know, I wanted individuals 
around me that were respected within the office and that were 
trusted and that had been there for a long time, and then I 
think I was very lucky to -- to have that in my management 
team. 
Q 
As we understand it, your office as U.S. Attorney 
was sort of on one side of the reception area, and the first 
assistant's office is on the other side. Is that correct? 
_E 
A 
Thi,t Ls _erred. 
Q 
Or, at the time --
A 
Correm 
Q 
-- that was correct. So, did you and 
have a sort of easy back and forth --
A 
Walking --
Q 
-- open door? 
A 
-- into each other's offices multiple times a 
day --
All right. 
EFTA00009244

Page 17 
A 
-- kind of relationship. 
Q 
All right, and given that he had had experience 
throughout his career at the department in the criminal arena 
and you had not, to what extent would you rely on him, among 
others, for guidance, perspective, information, and so on? 
A 
I named him first assistant because I valued his 
guidance and his perspectives and I thought those were 
valuable. 
Q 
Okay. You also, as we pointed out, appointed 
to succeed 
as criminal chief effective 
October of 2006, and he served for about ten months before he 
left for private practice. He left at the beginning of 
August --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- 2007. What -- you -- you did -- you said you 
didn't recall, as we sit here today, what section he'd come 
from. 
A 
Right. I guessed it was major crimes. 
Q 
All right. Were you -- what was your assessment of 
A 
Outstanding as well, and if I could say, when I say 
I don't recall but I guess, when you're going back 12 years, 
sometimes you get an impression but you can't say it's a 
recollection, and that's going to come up multiple times 
today, just because it's a while ago. 
EFTA00009245

Page 18 
Q 
As long as we make that distinction --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- both are helpful. 
A 
Right, and so -- so, whether it's a recollection or 
a construction after the fact, I can't 
can't say, but 
you know, I -- I thought that one of the helpful factors with 
is he had spent a lot of time -- and major crimes is the 
most active -- active unit. I assume you all know the 
structures of the office --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- but major crimes is not major crimes, it's sort 
of the entry level crimes, and I valued the fact that he had 
trained and, you know, so many AUSAs, and really spent a lot 
of time reviewing -- the major crimes chief as opposed to the 
other chiefs spends a lot of time reviewing the work of 
AUSAs, and so, he would be someone who is very experienced 
and able to get in the weeds. 
Q 
And he in fact was around -- during that time 
period, had gone back in the courtroom, if you recall, to 
actually try a major case. Do you recall that? /t was a --
A 
I didn't until you --
Q 
-- major fraud case. 
A 
-- mentioned -- I didn't until you mentioned it, 
and now there's something in the back of my head that's 
saying that sounds right, but I can't give you more detail. 
EFTA00009246

Page 19 
Q 
All right. What was your assessment of 
sort of working style, and particularly working 
with you? 
A 
You know, again, positive. You know, we didn't --
I didn't see him as often as Mr. 
, but --
Q 
He -- was he located on the same floor? 
A 
He was located on the same floor, but not within 
the same suite. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
And -- and that -- that affects interaction, but a 
positive working relationship. 
Q 
All right, and how 
how -- to what extent would 
you, as criminal chief, was he relied on by you as 
distinguished from 
with regard to the criminal 
matters pending? 
A 
Also relied on. Depend -- that would depend almost 
on the matter for --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- as in a typical situation, he would bring things 
to 
who would them bring them to me along, and so he 
would bring things to 
, and then depending on their 
discussion, they might both walk into my office. But he 
would typically run things through 
before coming to me. 
Q 
Were there occasions when he would come to you 
directly? 
EFTA00009247

Page 20 
A 
Sure. That's why I said in a typical --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
It's difficult to sort of recreate the 
interactions, but he certainly could come to me directly, and 
in some cases, I would say probably would. 
Q 
Again, it being a large office with several 
physical locations, and we understand it, a very high 
volume --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- of cases --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and particularly in the criminal context, is it 
fair to say you didn't review every prosecution as it was 
brought? 
A 
It -- it is not just fair, but accurate. I recall 
a conversation with a U.S. Attorney from a small district 
early on at one U.S. Attorney's conference where we compared 
notes, and the interaction of an office with 30 prosecutors 
is very different than one with --
Q 
Hm-hmm. 
A 
-- a few hundred prosecutors. 
Q 
So, when you did engage on a -- on a criminal case, 
would you -- whether it was a planned prosecution or a case 
heading to trial, would you generally rely on written 
submissions, or would you -- this is really an --
EFTA00009248

Page 21 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- inquiry into --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- your style, or would you have everybody 
S 
together, and talk about it, or would you rely on your most 
immediate subordinates to be briefing you? How -- which one 
of those --
A 
So --
Q 
-- kinds of --
A 
So --
Q 
-- approaches --
A 
So --
Q 
-- did you take? 
A 
I would say that really depended, and probably 
varied based on -- on individual needs. For the most part, I 
would most likely just speak with my first assistant and/or 
criminal chief, and assess what else needed to be done. 
Q 
In other words, you would sort of do it on a --
sort of on a verbal, or based on oral --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- interaction and --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- presentation as opposed to going through stacks 
of papers? 
A 
For -- for the -- I would say that was typical. 
EFTA00009249

Page 22 
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
I don't want to say that was the case every single 
time, but that was -- was typical. 
Q 
All right, and to what extent did you go out and 
about to encounter the line attorneys, or example? Was that 
something that you were able to do and wanted to do? 
A 
Yes, and yes, and you know, I -- when I started, I 
made it a point of walking every floor and meeting everyone, 
and in -- toward the end of the day, I would also if I could 
make it a point -- particularly of major crimes of just 
walking down to the floor and seeing who was there and what 
they were doing and -- and sort of popping my head in and 
just saying hi because I think it's the right thing to do. 
Q 
Okay. Okay. Was that a way to support the troops, 
or was it more a way for you to find -- to become informed 
about what was going on? 
A 
Probably a little of both, of support the troops, 
but also get the temperature for the office, see how matters 
are progressing. 
Q 
You at the criminal -- or, rather, the civil rights 
division, had experience with human trafficking and child sex 
trafficking cases --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- under your supervision. We understand that you 
brought that concern, or your concern about those issues with 
EFTA00009250

Page 23 
you to the U.S. Attorney's Office, and that -- we know that 
under your tenure, the U.S. Attorney's Office had many 
successful prosecutions involving conduct ranging from 
internet child pornography --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- to international sex tourism --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- victimizing children in particular. In mid-
2007, you -- according to press reports, you set up a new 
special prosecutions unit --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- to focus on, among other things, sex crimes 
against children. Could you tell us what importance those 
kinds of cases held for you as U.S. Attorney? 
A 
Sure. If I could -- if I could just back up a 
little bit, because the -- the question goes -- the special 
prosecutions unit, and let me address that part of it. There 
are a few things embedded in that. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
There's -- there's -- the special prosecutions unit 
was set up because there were some issues that -- that I 
thought were important to pursue in particular, and one of 
those was -- was sort of the trafficking issues. Another one 
was the gun violence, and the intent of special prosecutions 
was to have a group of individuals that would sort of be 
EFTA00009251

Page 24 
dedicated and not part of the usual major crimes group. So, 
it wasn't exclusively -- I -- your question may have implied 
it was exclusively for sex crimes, and it --
Q 
Oh, no. 
A 
-- and it wasn't -- yeah. 
Q 
No, I understand it was not. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And so, I thought it was sufficiently important, 
and so, it was one of the -- one of the initiatives that we 
were certainly pursuing. 
Q 
And was that something that you can -- that -- to 
which you brought your experience as head of the civil rights 
division as well? 
A 
It was. I think -- not I think I know when I was 
head of civil rights that that's something that I'd put 
particular emphasis on, and I thought civil rights really 
stepped up and did a great job on that. 
Q 
Did you yourself ever -- I recognize you were never 
a prosecutor as such. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
But did you ever have experience being involved in 
a prosecution that -- sort of the nitty-gritty of the 
prosecution of that kind of case? Sort of seconding yourself 
to a trial team, for example, or an investigation? 
EFTA00009252

Page 25 
A 
So, if by nitty-gritty you mean seconding myself to 
a trial team the answer would be no. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
There are a number of cases that I recall being 
briefed on and talking about, but --
A 
program, 
A 
appointed 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- coordinator, and she was also of course the line 
attorney on the Epstein case. How well did you know 
, and can you -- can you give us your assessment of 
her capabilities, judgement, and her interaction with you? 
A 
So, a few things in there. How well did I know her 
prior to appointment? I don't recall. I'm not -- I don't 
think I knew her particularly well prior to appointment. She 
was clearly respected within the office, and / don't recall 
but I can speculate that she was appointed based on 
recommendations of management, and her interest and some 
combination -- and prior work and some combination thereof. 
You asked me to characterize 
--
But at that high level? 
Correct. 
All right. The department set up in 2006 a PSC 
a Project Safe Childhood program --
Correct. 
-- focused on internet child pornography, and you 
as your first PSC --
EFTA00009253

Page 26 
Q 
Her -- your view of 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- her capabilities, her judgement 
A 
Right. 
Q 
her acumen, her knowledge of the law. 
A 
I think she was a good, strong, professional AUSA. 
I mean --
Q 
Do you have any -- did you have any negative -- you 
know, anything less than fully positive in your assessment of 
her? 
A 
No. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
I think she was a good, strong, dedicated AUSA. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- was the managing AUSA at the West Palm Beach 
office. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
At least -- and would -- and 
worked 
there. How closely did you work with 
and again, 
that --
A 
24m-hmm. 
-- assessment question --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- what was your assessment of him? 
EFTA00009254

Page 27 
A 
So, less so, only because of geographic distance. 
Q 
Mt-hmm. 
A 
I would also say he was a respected professional. 
He had a good reputation. He went on to be chief of staff 
here at the -- at the criminal division, which I think speaks 
to how he was viewed within the department. 
Q 
min-hmm. 
A 
And so, I would say positive. 
Q 
Okay. So, now turning to the Epstein case. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Now that your recall has been refreshed by virtue 
of the documents we've provided, before we get into the 
actual sort of documents and some of the details of the 
events, would you please give us a general overview of what 
you currently remember, refreshed, about how the case came 
into the U.S. Attorney's Office, how it was assessed for 
prosecution, and how and why the decision was made to resolve 
it with a two-year state plea that ultimately became an 18 --
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- I mean, yeah, a two year state plea that 
ultimate became --
A 
All right. 
Q 
-- an 18 month state plea. 
A 
Okay, so --
MR. HERRON: Before you answer the question, let me 
EFTA00009255

Page 28 
just jump in on the notion of refresh your recollection, 
which is -- of course has a very specific legal meaning, and 
I think to assert that Mr. Acosta's recollection has been 
refreshed generally probably overstates it. It's really a 
document by document, issue by issue thing. So, I'd push 
back on that --
MS. 
: I --
MR. HERRON: -- a little bit, but the question is 
fair and accurate. 
MS. 
: If you're talking about handing him 
a document to refresh an exhausted recollection, that's not 
the process we're talking about. We're using it in a more 
lay term that, you know, if we asked you this before, giving 
you all these documents, you'd probably would have not been 
able to be as full in your responses. So, we're asking for 
your full response. Thank you. 
MR. HERRON: We appreciate the opportunity to 
review the documents, and Alex, in your answers, try to 
distinguish what you actually recall --
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
MR. HERRON: -- in your own head versus what you 
saw in the documents. 
MS. 
: Yeah. 
MR. HERRON: And that would make for --
MS. 
. Thank you. 
EFTA00009256

Page 29 
MR. HERRON: -- the cleanest record. 
THE WITNESS: Okay. So, three parts. How did it 
come into the office? How did -- I'm sorry --
BY MS. 
Q 
How was -- how did it come in? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
How was it assessed for prosecution --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and then how and -- how and why the decision was 
made --
A 
• 
-- to resolve it the way it was. 
A 
So, so, let's begin with how did it come into the 
office. Putting all the documents aside, I can't say with 
certainty how it came in. I can speculate how it came in, 
and the way it would have come into the office is 
can 
speculate that the chief -- the chief rider from Palm Beach 
County would have brought it to either the FBI or to the Palm 
Beach Office. I'm not certain that I would have asked who 
brought this case to the office as opposed to the case is now 
in the office, so let's --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- let's discuss it, right? The format, or the 
mode in which it came in I think is important, because my 
recollection is it arrived to us in the position that the 
EFTA00009257

Page 30 
state attorney had negotiated a plea, and that the reason 
that we looked at it was that that plea was going to be --
that there had been an initial charge that wasn't pursued, 
and that required jail time and registration, and that the 
S 
plea that was going to be taken was a charge that didn't 
require jail time, and didn't require registration, and based 
on the preliminary assessment of the facts, that seemed --
that seems wrong. So, that's how did it arrive. The next 
question was --
Q 
How was it assessed for federal prosecution? 
A 
So -- so, it was assessed for federal prosecution, 
my recollection, from -- from very early on, and I'm sure 
we'll talk about this some more, is you have a case that, 
while technically it wasn't final at the state level, but for 
federal involvement, would have been final, and -- and so 
from the earliest point, we were thinking federal versus 
state and petite, and the contemporaneous record sort of 
shows 
at least the material that I got, the earliest 
communication was Mr. 
telling me that 
is 
preparing a petite policy waiver -- that Ms. 
is 
preparing a petite policy waiver, and that's consistent with 
my recollection of how it was assessed, and -- and then 
brought in -- assessed, you know, does it make sense to go 
forward, yes, investigate, and circle back. And then -- and 
then the third part was the --
EFTA00009258

Page 31 
Q 
How and why the disposition. 
A 
So, my general recollection is the view was that if 
the state had followed through on an original charge -- I 
don't recall which -- that called for jail time and that 
called for registration, that the local police or whoever 
brought it would not have seen the need to refer it. 
And so, that was in terms of pre-indictment 
resolution, a -- a logical and reasonable place given all the 
other sort of factors, both the petite concerns, the witness 
concerns, and the legal concerns. 
And to that, I would add a fourth concern, which is 
it had already been reviewed by a grand jury at the state 
level, is my recollection. And so, to some extent, that's 
indicative of how some individuals may sort of view this 
matter. 
Q 
Okay. We're going to pick that apart. 
A 
I figured. 
Q 
But thank you for that. 
A 
You -- you asked for an overview, so I tried to 
just be very --
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
-- general. 
Q 
That doesn't -- that doesn't -- the second part of 
that last prong was -- was why a two year state plea. In 
other words, you talked about -- you talked about assessing 
EFTA00009259

PaGe 
the case and why resolve it, but why with a two year state 
plea? What's the --
A 
And so --
-- overview? 
A 
And so my general recollection is -- my 
understanding -- if I was asked, what is the best 
understanding that I have of why two years, is that is what 
would have been obtained in one of the original state 
charges. Again, this is --
Q 
How do you know that? 
A 
Q 
How did you know that? 
A 
I'm -- that's why I say general recollection. I'm 
reconstructing memories of that 12 years ago. I can 
speculate that at some point, the matter came up, and I or 
someone else said if, you know, what would the original --
what would the original plea have -- you know, what would the 
original charges have likely brought? And someone said this 
amount. 
Q 
How would have said that? 
A 
I -- I'm speculating at this point. I don't have a 
recollection, but -- but that's -- that's my general 
understanding. 
Q 
All right. All right. We'll now unpack --
A 
Yeah, I --
EFTA00009260

Page 33 
Q 
-- some of that. 
A 
-- I noticed. 
Q 
And by the way, my colleagues, we're all in this 
boat together. So, they're going to feel free to --
A 
I know. 
Q 
-- chime in --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
as they see fit. So, the first thing going --
going to the intake of the case, we know from the records 
that -- and by the way, we've obviously done a great deal of 
other investigation --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and spoken to many people. So, 
briefed you and 
pretty much when the case first 
came in --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- in mid-2006, after the FBI and indeed the 
office -- the U.S. Attorney's Office in West Palm had opened 
the case, but before Epstein was indicted. So, this first 
exhibit, Exhibit No. 1 that you have in your binder before 
you -- or, in your folder before you -- is that e-mail from 
to you that you just referred to dated July 24 --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- 2006, in which he's sort of passing on the 
information that Epstein has by now been arrested -- been 
EFTA00009261

Page 34 
indicted -- arrested and indicted by the state. Do you 
recall anything about that original briefing from 
A 
I -- I don't. 
Q 
All right. Did you know at the time that -- at the 
time she briefed you --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- which is prior to Exhibit 1, did you know who 
Epstein was? 
A 
I did not. 
Q 
Never heard of him, to your knowledge? 
A 
To my knowledge, I don't recall having heard of 
him. 
Q 
And what did you understand at that early point the 
case to be about? 
A 
So, I don't recall the briefing, and so I can't 
give an independent recollection. You know, based on this, I 
mean, the --
Q 
You're talking about Exhibit 1, and you're --
A 
Based on --
Q 
-- looking at --
A 
-- based on Exhibit 1, you know, I can -- I can 
infer that this would have been my general understanding of 
the case, and you know, and the key things that I point here 
is pre-trial diversion, which is code for no jail time, and 
EFTA00009262

Page 35 
petite policy. 
Q 
But this -- what -- Exhibit No. 1 --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- does not make it clear to you that this case 
involved allegations that Jeffrey Epstein had been enticing, 
coercing, whatever verb you want to use, young, underage 
females -- we will for the record call them girls here --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- as opposed to women, and these underage females 
were being paid to provide him essentially with sex, or 
sexual activity or conduct, of a pretty salacious nature. Do 
you recall that as being essentially what you were briefed on 
from the beginning? 
A 
Again, I don't recall the initial briefing. I take 
it based on your review that there was an initial briefing. 
I can't say the degree of detail. I can't say what it was 
about. As a -- as a typical matter, I wouldn't be briefed 
when a case comes into the office other than being made 
aware, this is a case, this is what we're looking at. 
Q 
So, then, if you --
A 
Sure. 
Q 
-- understanding you don't remember the briefing, 
is it fair to say that you did have some understanding of 
what the case that was that West Palm Beach was pursuing as 
of mid-2006? 
EFTA00009263

Page 36 
A 
I certainly had an understanding of the general 
facts of the case early on. I can't speak to whether it was 
mid-2006 versus late 2006 versus 2007, but --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- early on, I certainly had an understanding that 
it was a case that involved, you know, a billionaire who was 
doing sordid things with young women or girls who were 
minors. 
and the records indicate that her 
concern in bringing this all the way to you --
A 
Km-hmm. 
Q 
-- and her first at that time criminal chief --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- but sort of acting First Assistant 
was because she was afraid of political pressure that 
might be brought to bear against the U.S. Attorney's Office 
in this case. Do you have any recollection of that being a 
concern that was laid before you? 
A 
I don't -- again, I don't recall the early -- that 
briefing. I've reviewed this e-mail, and -- and I can -- you 
know, I take it 
it would have been natural for me to say, 
should we approach the state attorney, because we had lots of 
ongoing matters with the state attorney, and it seems that 
said no for fear it'll be leaked straight to Epstein, 
and I assumed I'd let it be at that point. 
EFTA00009264

Page 37 
Q 
And do you know -- oh, do you know what he meant by 
it being leaked to Epstein by the state -- by Barry -- Barry 
Krischer, the then State Attorney? 
A 
So -- so, based on the context --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- what I would assume is that if the state 
attorney is cutting this kind of deal, and it appears that 
things have already leaked, because you know, there's clearly 
and article here with leaked -- you know, so, something has 
already leaked. 
Q 
You're referring to Exhibit 1? 
A 
Exhibit 1. Other things would leak. 
Q 
Had you ever met Barry Krischer? 
A 
Sure. 
Q 
What was your relationship with him? 
A 
So, there were multiple state attorneys within the 
district. He was -- it was a professional relationship. We, 
you know --
Q 
It was an elected position, correct? 
A 
It was an elected position. 
Q 
And what was your assessment of his aggressiveness 
as a prosecutor, and his capabilities? 
A 
On the public -- my -- most of my assessment with 
him was on the public corruption front, where we had brought 
several cases, and I was a little disappointed that these 
EFTA00009265

Page 38 
were cases he could have brought that he chose not to bring. 
Q 
Right. So, is it -- can I -- am I accurate in 
inferring from that that you didn't regard him as a 
particularly hard charging prosecutor? 
A 
So, I -- with any state attorney, I hesitate to 
sort of paint broad brush strokes. I don't think that's 
always fair, but my experience had been in the public 
corruption space. 
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
And in that space, I did not think -- whether it 
was him, or whether it was his office, I can't speak, but I 
did not think they had done as much as they could have done. 
Q 
Is there any area in which you thought he and his 
office did pursue aggressively? 
A 
So, as I recall, we had had -- we had emphasized 
gun crimes quite a bit, and really had had a lot of success 
moving -- moving the ball in the gun crimes space in Palm 
Beach. 
Q 
What --
A 
But let me -- let me just say, it's also very 
difficult to reconstruct time frames. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
And so, I hesitate, because I don't know if that 
was 2006 or 2007, or -- but you asked in another area, and --
Q 
In this Exhibit 1, you ask whether it's 
EFTA00009266

Page 39 
appropriate -- appropriate to approach Barry Krischer and 
give him a heads up as to where the U.S. Attorney's Office 
might go, presumably --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- with this case? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
Why would you want to extend that difference to 
him? Why would it matter? 
A 
A colleague in law enforcement. I thought it was 
important for the office to work with -- with state attorneys 
as a general matter, and I found that the office worked best 
when it had good working relationships with state attorneys 
and with -- you know, with -- for that matter, the agency 
SACs and others, and --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- but again, you know, rather than my asserting, 
I'm asking 
, and 
was saying no, and I don't know 
what the ultimate outcome was, but I would guess that we'd 
just defer and let it be. 
Q 
Turning to Exhibit 2, this is an e-mail that was 
forwarded to you by 
mail is from 
, the original forwarded e-
copying 
, and it 
essentially relates to a dust up between 
and 
over chain of command, and her workload, but 
in the first paragraph, she specifies that, "When I first 
EFTA00009267

Page 40 
heard about the Epstein investigation, I spoke with 
about it. 
was not here." 
said that she would back me up on the case, 
but I knew what has happened to the state prosecution can 
happen to the federal prosecution if the U.S. Attorney's 
Office isn't on board. So, I spoke with 
about the case, 
and he spoke with Alex, and they gave the green light." 
So, that -- that actually appears to be an initial 
contact with 
that she's talking about prior to the 
briefing of you, so, way early when the case first came in in 
May of 2006. Do you recall being contacted or having a 
conversation with --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
- 
- 
about that case so early? 
A 
Again, the early recollection, whenever -- whenever 
it might have taken place, was I was made aware of the 
matter. It seemed a reasonable matter to pursue, and that's 
the level of detail that I recall. 
Q 
So, if 
said back in the day that she got from 
you all the green light, what did you understand her to be 
being authorized to do -- authorize may be too strong a word, 
but --
A 
So, to pursue -- to investigate -- to pursue --
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
-- to someone, you know, I -- I'm speculating here, 
EFTA00009268

Page 41 
but there's a case, and they want to know, should we spend 
our time on this? And the answer is it seems reasonable. 
Sure. 
Q 
Okay, and do you -- do you recall making that 
explicit to her? 
A 
I -- I don't, and -- and it wouldn't have been my 
practice to -- to sort of make it explicit to -- yeah, go 
spend your time, as opposed to, thank you for letting me 
know, that sounds reasonable. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And whatever, you know, details it looks like based 
on Exhibit 1, there was subsequent follow up between her and 
, or with her and the management team, and they said, you 
know, go back, work on A, B, and C. 
Q 
Do you know what 
was talking about 
when she referred to something happening to a federal 
prosecution if the U.S. Attorney is not on board? Had there 
been a case in which you were not supportive of a particular 
prosecution that was being proposed? 
A 
None -- none that I recall, and -- and I knew that 
what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a 
federal prosecution if the U.S. Attorney's not on board. I 
don't recall any federal prosecution that I wasn't supportive 
of, at least in -- in this context. 
Q 
What do you mean by this context? 
 ,1
1•111•1 
EFTA00009269

Page 42 
A 
It was my way of narrowing an answer so I didn't 
spend the time to go through every office and every division. 
For the most part, as I sit here, I'm sort of running through 
each office. I don't recall any, and -- and if I could, 
based on this -- on Exhibit 2, I'm not sure that she's 
referring to a specific case as opposed to concerns that the 
state prosecution started at point -- you know, with charges 
that required jail time and ended up somewhere else, and it 
may have been because management --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- wasn't. 
Q 
But that's -- that's a current -- a reading of --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- this, rather --
A 
That -- that's my --
Q 
-- than a recollection? 
A 
-- that's my reading, not --
Q 
All right. Based on the early description you got 
of the case --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- did you have any idea how many victims were 
involved? 
A 
I did not. 
Q 
Did you know what the name of the case was? What 
the investigation's name was? You know, cases get names. 
EFTA00009270

Page 43 
A 
So, I know that based on review of the 
correspondence, I may have known that then. I did not 
independently recall that. 
Q 
That being Operation Leap Year? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
All right, and do you know where that comes from? 
A 
I have -- well, I mean, other than February 20 --
yeah, I don't know. 
Q 
Well, the original allegations that came in 
involved 28 victims, and then subsequently 
she was uncovering more victims, so there were --
A 
Yeah. 
advised that 
Q 
-- over 30 victims. 
A 
Q 
Well over 30. 
A 
I did not know that. 
Q 
All right. You did not -- you -- as you sit here 
today, you didn't know it? 
A 
I don't recall knowing that. 
Q 
But is it -- is it reasonable that the number of 
victims would be one of the factors that you would have been 
informed of at the time? 
A 
I -- I don't know. I -- it all depends how 
detailed that briefing was. Again, as a typical matter early 
on, this is what is being done. I would trust my AUSAs and 
EFTA00009271

Page 44 
my management staff --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- to pursue it. It wouldn't be a, here are all 
the facts associated with this case, just heads up. There is 
a high profile case involving a very wealthy man abusing 
young women, a state attorney is prosecuting, but you know, 
there's dissatisfaction. I wanted to give you a heads up, 
both to inform me, but also so that I'm aware in my 
interactions with -- with other Palm Beach officials. 
Q 
Okay. Based on whatever information you got at the 
time, did you think that there was a federal interest to be 
served by pursuing a federal prosecution potentially? 
glossary convention --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that we are using is -- and we can use in this 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And what was that? 
A 
So, the exploitation of young women. 
Q 
Girls. 
A 
Girls. 
Q 
I want to be -- I want to be --
A 
Minors. Minor females. 
Q 
All right. I -- you know, for a -- for a sort of a 
interview, is girls --
A 
Right. 
EFTA00009272

Page 45 
Q 
-- for the victims who at the time of the conduct 
were minors, and women, for those who were not, even though 
the girls at a later time became age of --
A 
Fair. 
Q 
-- majority. 
A 
Fair. 
Q 
Okay. So, here, we're really talking about the 
girls --
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- who were victims. 
A 
Yeah, yeah. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
Girls, minor females. I just don't 
sometimes 
that term is viewed differently. And so --
Q 
Right. 
A 
Yeah, so the exploitation of girls or minor 
females, and that certainly is an important federal interest. 
Q 
Well, and is the number and the breadth of the 
scheme -- the scope of the activity also a factor there? In 
other words, it wasn't one or two on one or two occasions. 
A 
So, there's several factors that probably go into 
what's the federal interest. The acts, the sordidness of the 
acts, the -- the number, the likelihood or the importance of 
registration was important to my mind because that -- that 
goes to future prevention to putting the community on notice. 
EFTA00009273

Page 46 
Q 
And were you aware that the individual in this 
case, Epstein, also had homes in other districts, and that 
there were -- it was an interstate activity on his part, the 
interstate travel and so on? 
A 
MR. HERRON: I'm sorry, let me just -- we're still 
in the original intake time frame --
MS. 
: Yes. 
MR. HERRON: -- here? 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. Again, for the intake time, I 
can't 
I can't speak to the details, because I don't 
remember what the extent of that -- that intake briefing. 
BY MS. 
Q 
But as i -- as I -- as i --
A 
Could I -- could I ask --
Q 
Yes. 
A 
-- a question? Was there -- was there a clear 
briefing as opposed to a heads up based on the record? 
Q 
Yes. That 
came to Miami to conduct 
a briefing of you and --
A 
Okay. 
Q 
in order to tell you about this 
case, and get from you 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- a green light --
EFTA00009274

Page 47 
A 
Q 
-- to proceed with it. 
A 
I ask, because I recall an e-mail, and I don't know 
what the time would have been, where she's coming to Miami, 
and 
says, why don't you stop by my office first? 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And -- and -- and I keep -- I would -- I would 
speculate that, why don't you stop by my office first is, why 
don't you give me a bunch of details, and then we will walk 
across to the U.S. Attorney --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- and fill him in, and so that would have been 
almost a two-tiered discussion. 
Q 
And is that --
A 
And I don't know if that -- if that -- the timeline 
on that e-mail is when you say briefing. 
Q 
Well, we are -- we are asking --
A 
Q 
What it -- what it would --
A 
Yeah. 
A 
I'm speaking just based on review of the record, 
not based on recollection here. 
Q 
All right. So, you have -- to be clear, you have 
no recollection of any specific briefing in 2006? 
EFTA00009275

Page 48 
A 
I accept that I was made aware of the matter. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
I can't say how or in what context or to what 
degree of detail. 
Q 
Or by whom? 
A 
Or by whom. I knew the matter -- it's easier to 
recollect at least for me what I knew as opposed to who told 
me what. 
Q 
All right. All right. At this point, would you 
have had -- did you have -- if you -- at any point, did you 
have any reservation about investigating and potentially 
prosecuting Jeffrey Epstein, a reservation stemming from his 
wealth, and reported standing in the community at all, and 
influence? 
A 
No, and we had prosecuted lots of influential folks 
in the office. So, while he had wealth, it's not unusual --
UBS was in the office at the time. I mentioned several high 
profile Palm Beach public corruption cases. 
Q 
So, there was no concern about possible negative 
blowback in the press or the community or even at Main 
Justice if you went after someone like Jeffrey Epstein? 
A 
There was no concern stemming from his wealth or 
his status. 
Q 
What would it have stemmed from? 
A 
At some point, I think there was concerns regarding 
EFTA00009276

Page 49 
the -- the law, and we'll probably get into that. I alluded 
to that earlier in the overview. I don't know if that would 
have been developed this early on, but -- but that's not a 
function of his wealth. That's a function of the fact 
pattern. 
Q 
Right. Right. Okay. So, as you mentioned petite 
policy concerns, petite policy, petite policy, could you tell 
us what your position was on the -- on the policy as it 
applied in this case as you understood it from -- in the 
beginning? 
A 
So -- so, the policy, you know, on its face, 
doesn't specifically apply. Based on Exhibit 1, I'm now 
inferring, not recalling, it looks like either 
on her 
own, or 
asked for a -- or, Mr. 
, asked for a 
petite policy waiver memo to be prepared, in part on the 
assumption that the state prosecution may or may not have 
gone for it. 
I don't know, but I know -- I do recall that early 
on, this was unusual, because it had been -- he had been 
arrested or arraigned. It was going forward on the part of 
the state, and so here is the big bad federal government 
stepping on a sovereign, you know, state, saying you're not 
doing enough, and to my mind, when, you know, the whole idea 
of the petite policy is to recognize that that estate has --
you know, is an independent entity, and that we should 
EFTA00009277

Page 50 
presume that what they're doing is correct, even if we don't 
like the outcome, except in the most unusual of 
circumstances. 
Q 
And what kinds of -- well, so, the petite policy 
exists because there's a recognition that there are cases 
that are appropriately pursued. I mean, you were the head of 
the civil rights division, after all. 
A 
Correct, which is why I say except in the most 
appropriate of circumstances. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
But let me add that based on this, I was 
comfortable, you know, saying, let's go forward, because the 
lack of jail time, you know, to use -- to use petite policy 
language, a plea that did not include jail time or 
registration would seem like a manifest injustice. 
Q 
All right. So, did you have any doubt that you'd 
get a waiver if you applied for one? 
A 
I'm not -- so -- so, I'm now speculating. I don't 
recall, but I'm not sure I would have said, is there a doubt 
that I'd get a waiver as opposed to, is this something I feel 
comfortable doing, or not? And --
Q 
And this being the prosecution, or this being 
the -- applying for a waiver? 
A 
Applying for a waiver. And so, you know, either 
main justice gives it or doesn't give it. That doesn't mean 
EFTA00009278

Page 51 
you don't apply for it if you think it's the right thing to 
do. 
So, for example, in the UBS case, which was one of 
our big tax, you know, prosecutions, we asked for a Bank of 
Nova Scotia --
Q 
ME-hum. 
A 
-- authorization to the Bank of Nova Scotia 
subpoena, and I didn't think Main Justice would -- you know, 
I pushed really hard, and I got into the weeds in that case 
for that purpose, but I still thought, let's go for it, and 
we did, and Main Justice didn't give in to it, and that's 
okay. That's how it works. 
Q 
Okay. So, they denied that request? 
A 
They denied that request, and I say that as an 
example of -- as a typical matter, I don't think what's main 
justice going to say, as opposed to how do we 
how should 
we approach this matter? 
Q 
I don't understand about what you mean by, how 
should we approach this matter. 
A 
So, honestly, how do I -- how do I explain this? 
So, I think there's a difference in saying, let me predict 
how main justice will come out, and follow that prediction, 
versus, folks, what do you all think? Okay. If we're 
comfortable with this, let's write it up, and let's see what 
Main Justice does. 
EFTA00009279

Page 52 
One is trying to predict what folks in this 
building are going to think. Another one is trying to 
predict -- another one is saying, what do we in Miami think, 
and then let main justice figure it out. 
Q 
And which is the approach you typically took? 
A 
And my point is the approach that I typically took 
is, what do we think, and let main justice give it a thumbs 
up or a thumbs down. 
Q 
All right, and in this case, did you do that with 
regard to the petite policy? 
A 
So, in this case, we didn't get that far in that we 
didn't have to submit to DOJ. 
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
But -- but we were approaching it not based on what 
main justice was going to think, but what do we feel is the 
right outcome in this office. 
Q 
So, as I understand, the bottom line is that you 
didn't 
as I hear you, I believe you're saying that you 
didn't stand down, or in any way cease or limit pursuing this 
case on petite policy grounds. You pursued it as you -- as 
you would --
A 
So, we went forward with the matter, although there 
were petite policy concerns in the background. So -- so 
you're setting this up as a binary -- as a -- did -- was it a 
fact -- as a binary, you did not limit yourself on petite 
EFTA00009280

Page 53 
policy grounds, and I'm pushing back a little bit, because I 
don't think it's, it's part or it's not, as opposed to when 
you look at a case, there are all sorts of factors, and it is 
a factor in how you think of a matter going forward. 
BY MS. 
Q 
If you had those petite policy concerns -- you or 
members of your staff? 
A 
I would say a combination of me and my management 
staff. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Who? Who? 
A 
I can't -- I can't recreate --
Q 
But who are you dealing with on this case? 
A 
Primarily, it would be my first assistant and 
criminal chief as I typically -- so, there is, you know, to 
sort of put it in main justice terms, you know, a line 
attorney has a deputy section chief and a section chief and a 
DAG and an AAG, and the AAG usually deals with the section 
chief, or the DAG. And so, I was dealing with my first 
assistant and my crim chief. 
Q 
Right, and they were there in Miami. 
A 
And they were there in Miami. 
Q 
And by the way, 
first line 
supervisor was 
A 
rect. 
EFTA00009281

Page 54 
Q 
Do you know why she was not actively participating 
in this chain of command? 
A 
I noticed that in the correspondence, and I 
couldn't speak to that. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
But the -- but it goes to the point that if you 
look at the -- she reported to 
, who reported to 
who reported to 
who reported to 
. And so, as a 
typical matter, I tried to empower my first assistant and my 
criminal chief and my office heads and work through them, not 
bypass them. 
Q 
In this particular case with regard either to the 
petite policy --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- or any other aspect, was there anyone other than 
that group of five, if you will, in that chain --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- from you down to 
through 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and 
that you were dealing with? 
A 
I can't recall. I -- I can -- I can say as a 
general matter, it would not be unusual for me to walk 
down -- walk down the hall and talk to someone that I trust 
and say, hey, I've got this fact pattern. What do you think? 
EFTA00009282

Page 55 
Q 
Do you recall ever doing that in connection with 
this case? 
A 
I -- I don't recall the specific briefings or who I 
talked to. I'm just saying as a general matter that there 
are folks on my -- on the eighth floor that were in 
management that I would often just walk down the hall, and --
Q 
But do you recall doing that --
A 
I don't --
Q 
-- in this case? 
A 
I don't recall. 
Q 
Okay. So, we shared with you in Exhibit 3 a pretty 
lively exchange between 
and 
You didn't -- we have no reason to believe you saw this 
before, but it makes some representations about you, and 
that's why we brought it to your attention. 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
Do you recall this e-mail exchange? 
A 
I don't recall the e-mail exchange. 
Q 
I mean, you --
A 
But I --
Q 
-- didn't see it then. Do you recall having read 
it before today? 
A 
I recall reviewing it, yes. 
Q 
All right. Okay. So, starting from the end, 
using 
Blackberry, which is a little 
EFTA00009283

Page 56 
confusing to begin with -- notifies .= 
that -- of a -- of 
a particular conversation he had with one of the defense 
attorneys. At this point, what I want to do is draw your 
attention to the -- the comment, and his response, and we're 
looking at page --
A 
Page --
Q 
-- three. 
A 
-- page three. 
Q 
So, in the third paragraph --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- "it was made clear to you by the U.S. Attorney 
and the first assistant from the time when you were first 
authorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had 
concerns about taking the case because of petite policy and a 
number of legal issues." And then later he says that, "You 
were never given authorization by anyone to seek an 
indictment in this case." 
And -- close quote -- and then on the first page, 
presents her version of that original contact 
with you, meeting with you, at the bottom of the page. 
Halfway through the last paragraph, she says, "My 
recollection of the original meeting with Alex and 
is 
quite different than your summary. In that meeting, I 
summarized the case and the state attorney's office handling 
of it." 
EFTA00009284

Page 57 
acknowledged that we needed to do work to 
collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and I 
noted the time and month," -- that -- I'm sorry, "I noted the 
time and money that would be required for an investigation. 
I said I was willing to invest time and the FBI was willing 
to invest the money, but I didn't want to get to the end of 
it," -- "to the end, and then have the office be intimidated 
by the high powered lawyers. I was assured that would not 
happen." Can you tell us which version of that initial --
which version --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- is correct? 
A 
So, again, I don't remember that initial briefing, 
so I can't tell you which version is correct. I would also 
say that it's possible neither version is correct and that 
there's a little bit of truth -- now I'm just speculating --
Q 
All right. 
A 
that there's a little bit of truth in either 
one, because it's certainly possible to say, I hear you, 
righteous case, go forward and investigate, work on the 
federal nexus, which is what Exhibit 3 is saying, go work on 
the federal nexus and find evidence for the federal nexus. 
But we have concerns about petite policy and legal matters, 
so there's a lot of work to be done. 
Q 
So, what kind of a direction does that amount to 
EFTA00009285

Page 58 
for the line AUSA? What's her job then? 
A 
So, the job would then be to go back and 
investigate, and develop facts and report back. 
Q 
And if she developed enough facts, and supportive 
law to present proposed prosecution? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And so -- so, a lot of times in this he said, she 
said, there's a little bit of truth to both sides of the 
discussion. I'm just -- I'm just saying as a general matter, 
I wouldn't -- your questions are sometimes either or, and 
sometimes --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- it can be a combination of both. 
Q 
All right, and -- but in fact you don't recall? 
A 
But I'm speculating. 
Q 
All right. Is there anything in either of those 
that two accounts -- two versions that you say didn't happen, 
couldn't happen? 
A 
I can't, because I don't recall it. I can't --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- speak to that. I would speculate that there's 
probably a little bit of truth on both sides that -- and if 
you read it closely, you'll see that 
acknowledges the 
need to work on a federal nexus. So, that goes to, you know, 
EFTA00009286

Page 59 
where 
or, Mr. la 
I'm sorry, I'm calling -- I'm 
using first names. 
Q 
Its' all right. 
A 
So, I'm going to just start --
This is an informal interview. 
A 
I'm going to just start using first names. I don't 
mean that disrespectfully -- where, you know, Illlisays, you 
know, because of petite policy and legal issues, and 
is 
acknowledging the legal issues, because she's saying needed 
work to do to collect evidence establishing the federal 
nexus. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
So --
Q 
Yeah. 
A 
So, they're not as inconsistent as presented 
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- arguably. 
Q 
Sack in 2006, in this Exhibit No. 1, 
tells you in his e-mail that the indictment target date is 
August 25, 2006. 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
In other words, very shortly --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- thereafter, within a month or so. Do you know 
why the line AUSA, 
, was keen on getting the 
EFTA00009287

federal case against Epstein brought on a fairly -- on a 
quick basis? 
A 
So, I can't speak to that, and -- and can I 
I ask, based on your record, was that that the -- was that 
the state indictment target date, or was that --
Q 
He already --
A 
-- a federal --
B 
Q 
-- Epstein had already been indicted and arraigned 
on the --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- indictment, so that's the federal. 
A 
So -- so, that's --
1: 
Q 
That's talking about a federal indictment. 
A 
All right. 
Q 
The point --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- is that early on --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the investigative team, the FBI --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and 
were hot to trot to get 
this --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- case moving from a federal standpoint. That may 
well have been quite unrealistic given --
EFTA00009288

Page 61 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- all of the issues that we've been discussing, 
but the question is, do you know why there was some urgency? 
A 
I haven't the slightest idea. When was it -- when 
was it initially brought to the office? 
Q 
It was brought to the office in May of --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- 2006. 
A 
That -- that would be a really, really fast 
timeline. 
Q 
Right. So, the question is, aspirational though it 
may have been, there was a hope --
A 
Q 
-- to get it done quickly. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
So, the question is, can you think of factors that 
would have led a prosecutor to want to pursue --
A 
I --
Q 
-- this quickly? 
A 
I don't recall. I can speculate that 
was 
very hard charging and wanted to do a lot, and --
Q 
Was that your experience of her? 
A 
So, based on this, I see, you know, so, Exhibit 2 
is, you know 
Q 
Excuse me, would -- but just from your memory, is 
EFTA00009289

Page 62 
that your recollection of hove 
operated? Hard charging? 
A 
Yeah. I'd say -- so, a lot of really good 
prosecutors are hard charging. That's --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- that's part of the job description. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And so, yes. 
Q 
Okay. Did -- so, in the child sex offender 
context, are you familiar with a -- the belief on the part of 
people who do that kind of case, as did 
and 
others in your office -- that those offenders typically don't 
stop offending, even after somebody's onto them? So that 
there was a concern that he -- that in this case, Jeffrey 
Epstein might be continuing to offend, and therefore getting 
him off the streets was --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- a priority? 
A 
I have heard that discussed recently in the media. 
I don't recollect that back in -- part of a discussion back 
in 2006. 
Q 
All right. Okay. Do you recall that 
-- and this is just a, do you recall --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- that she periodically would give you in that 
early period of 2006, updates -- written updates? 
EFTA00009290

Page 63 
A 
I don't. 
Q 
Did you think that it was appropriate for a line 
AUSA to be shooting e-mails updating on a case that was under 
investigation directly to you and your first assistant? 
A 
It was unusual, and -- and so, so, did I think of 
a -- look, I can't reconstruct what I would have thought, but 
you know, you're asking not just what did I know, but what 
would I have thought 12 years ago. 
But I can say that based on general practice, it 
would have been unusual, and my best guess as to how I would 
have reacted would have been, hey, 
, this is unusual, is 
the chain being fully informed? Are feathers being --
Q 
Right. 
A 
ruffled? Figure it out, because, you know, you 
asked me early on to characterize 
qualities. I think 
one of the things that I said was he was very good at 
smoothing things --
Q 
MW-hmm. 
A 
-- over. And sort of the interaction, because he 
was respected, and so I might say, that's kind of unusual. 
Go figure it out. 
Q 
But you wouldn't necessarily jump that chain 
yourself, and be --
A 
Q 
-- in direct communication? 
EFTA00009291

Page 64 
A 
I tended not to --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- do that. 
BY 
Q 
Would she have sent this to you -- something 
unusual, if she thought that this was a case that you wanted 
to be involved in? 
A 
Even in -- even in those, I tried to be, as a 
general matter, fairly sensitive to the chain, because I had 
found that if you start jumping the chain too much, even if 
you become informed, managers feel, you know, out of -- out 
of the loop, and that's not -- that's not conducive to sort 
of allowing them to do their job of supervising. It's a big 
enough office, you have to empower your folks to do their 
jobs. 
Q 
So the concern on your part would not be that she 
was communicating directly to you, but that as long as all of 
the chain was informed as well? 
A 
Yeah. I mean, if you're -- if you're 
or you know, if you're 
, or you know, don't you want to 
talk to the line attorney before the line attorney talks to 
your boss? 
And so, it's not just informed, but it's respecting 
your supervisor. And it's a difficult balance, because often 
really good AUSAs are also the ones that, you know, just want 
EFTA00009292

Page 65 
to get things done. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Did you have any reason to believe during this 
investigative phase that ME 
was not pursuing 
this case -- this investigation adequately, appropriately, 
and fully? 
A 
No, I did not. 
Q 
Did you --
A 
Not to my recollection. 
Q 
Did you feel that she did not have appropriate 
oversight? 
A 
Not to my recollection. 
Q 
Okay. Do you -- did you feel that she had any 
resource problem? That is, did she have, as far as you knew, 
sufficient resources available to pursue her investigation? 
A 
To my recollection, yes, I noted her early -- you 
know, I noted more recently the e-mail where -- you know, 
that was shared with me by 
about resource concerns, and 
I would just note that I would allow the management chain to 
figure that out. 
Q 
All right. Were you -- did you at any point 
consider, based on what you then knew, expanding the scope of 
the investigation? Did you ever suggest or propose that 
instead of simply looking at Epstein's conduct in West Palm 
Beach vis a vis these girls, that the federal authorities 
EFTA00009293

Page 66 
could use their resources to look at other aspects of 
Epstein's activities? 
A 
So, I -- so, I think it's important to take a step 
back, and I was aware of any number of cases going on in the 
office, and based on what that stage of case was at, I would 
get more involved for a time. 
It wasn't my practice to direct AUSAs in how they 
should investigate, or what the scope of a case investigation 
should be. They -- the Miami office, before I got there, and 
after I left, had a reputation for knowing their stuff. It's 
a large office. It's got good people. I would assume that 
AUSAs and their management would follow their natural leads. 
Q 
All right. Were you aware that during this 
period -- and by this period, I'm talking about the 
investigative period from the time that the case came in in 
mid-2006 --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- up until May 1 when 
put forth 
her pros memo --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and proposed indictment. During that sort of 
ten month period, or almost a year, were you aware that 
defense counsel for Epstein were reaching out to 
and to 
to pitch their view of how the 
case --
EFTA00009294

Page 67 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- should proceed? 
A 
So, I don't have a specific recollection of who 
reached out at what time. I would assume as a general matter 
that defense counsel -- defense counsel were clearly involved 
before the case came to the office. and so, I would assume 
that defense counsel would remain involved while the office 
was investigating. I say that not based on independent 
recollection, but --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- why would they stop being involved? 
Q 
And is it in your experience as a U.S. Attorney, 
was it common or uncommon for defense counsel to approach the 
line prosecutor and supervisor to make whatever pitch they 
want with respect to a prosecution? 
A 
Fairly common. 
Q 
All right, and was it also common for those 
approaches to be entertained? In other words, for the line 
AUSA and supervisor --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- to meet with defense counsel? 
A 
As a -- as a general matter, yeah. 
Q 
And did you view that as appropriate? 
A 
As a general matter, it was typical. It happened 
before I got there, and is probably happening now. 
EFTA00009295

Page 68 
Q 
And you view it as an appropriate part of the 
process? Do you? 
A 
I think AUSAs need to have discretion to meet with 
defense counsel, and defense counsel certainly should be able 
to present perspectives. 
Q 
There is an outlook -- this is Exhibit 4, and this 
is something --
Okay. 
Q 
-- it's really sort of a point of information here. 
This is an outlook that shows you and 
and 
had 
a scheduled meeting with Roy Black. 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
Roy Black, a prominent --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- local criminal defense attorney at the time in 
the Miami area. This was a meeting scheduled in your office 
for the 23rd of February of 2007. Do you have any -- he was 
a -- he at the time --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was one of Epstein's attorneys. Do you have any 
idea whether this meeting related to Epstein or some other 
case? 
A 
I don't. I noticed that and I don't know whether 
it was this or another matter. 
Q 
But you have not particular recollection of meeting 
EFTA00009296

Page 69 
with him on the Epstein matter --
A 
I don't. 
Q 
-- at this time? Okay. So, I want to --
A 
And let me note, I think most of the correspondence 
was from other attorneys and not him. And so, yeah. 
Q 
All right. Are you -- are you okay? Do you want 
to take a short break, or --
broken at 11:00. Mr. Acosta, we're going to move to that 
time frame I mentioned a moment ago, May of 2007 when 
submitted her prosecution memo of more than 80 
pages, and her proposed indictment -- her initial proposed 
indictment, which was more than 50 pages. 
She submitted that by transmittal memo to her 
entire chain, 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Do you --
A 
Let's -- what time is it? Oh, 11:00. 
Q 
Five minutes? 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Five minutes? 
A 
Yeah. Let's take a five minute break. 
Q 
Off the record. 
(Off the record.) 
BY MS. 
Q 
All right, back on the record at 11:12, having 
EFTA00009297

Page 70 
, and you. Was that a typical way for an indictment 
and proposed prosecution? The memo to come? 
A 
To my recollection, it was not, and I don't recall 
that happening in other cases. I'm trying -- I'm hesitating, 
just because I'm trying to think through if there's -- I 
don't have any recollection of it happening in another case. 
Q 
Why do you think it happened in this case? And who 
caused it to happen? 
A 
I don't know, and I don't know. 
Q 
All right. All right. So, you 
when you 
before you saw it -- I don't know if you even knew about 
it -- you -- by reference to Exhibit 6, you learned 
essentially from 
that the FBI was planning to do 
a press conference two weeks after that, and 
told 
this office has not approved the indictment, 
therefore, "please do not commit us to anything at this 
time." Were you -- and eventually that e-mail chain --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- gets to you, apparently by blind carbon, because 
there's no indication you actually get it. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
But you advise Alicia Valle, who I think was your 
press person --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- that, ' 
hasn't even finished her 
EFTA00009298

Page 71 
recommendation 
i.e., we are a long way off." So, 
did you have any idea why the FBI was planning a press 
conference on Epstein? 
A 
I don't -- I don't know if I did. I don't recall 
if I did. 
Q 
Was it -- how typical was it for the FBI to plan a 
press conference on an indicted -- on a case that was being 
indicted at the time of an indictment or arrest without 
coordinating that with you and your office? 
A 
Under 
highly atypical. 
Q 
He was the SAC at the time? 
A 
He was the SAC -- he was the SAC -- I know he was 
the SAC at the time as of September, and I'm almost certain 
he was the SAC at the time. 
Q 
All right. And when you said that we are a long 
way off, and 
hasn't even finished her recommendation to 
, can -- do you know whether you had any idea that she 
had actually submitted her pros memo, and that she had made a 
recommendation to 
A 
I can't -- I can't recollect --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- but I'll take my words as reflective of, if I 
say she hasn't finished her recommendation, then I assume she 
hasn't finished her recommendation, but I don't recall --
Q 
Does that mean --
EFTA00009299

Page 72 
A 
-- that level of detail. 
Q 
-- as you -- as you look at your own words, does 
that suggest to you that you were unaware as of that moment 
that she'd actually submitted her pros memo? 
A 
That suggests that I would not have been aware that 
she submitted it. If -- you know, because it sounds like I'm 
saying she hasn't even submitted her memo to 
So --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- we're a long way off. 
Q 
All right, so, is --
A 
But again, this is based on practice, not 
recollection. 
Q 
All right, and when you said we are a long way off, 
did that reflect, if you recall, an assessment of the length 
of time to get to a pros --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- memo, a recommendation, and an assessment of 
that, or your expectation that even when you saw a pros memo
and an indictment, it would be a long process before it was 
approved? 
A 
So, I would assume -- and again, this is just based 
on speculating from the way that I write, that I'm thinking 
she hasn't submitted her recommendation to 
needs 
to review it. 
He may -- you know, he'd probably want to talk to 
EFTA00009300

Page 73 
. It needs to be scrubbed. You know, this could be --
this ain't happening next week. 
Q 
All right, but in your -- do you have any reason to 
believe that whatever that process is that you were 
describing would be any -- any different in any particular 
measure in this case from the ordinary complex case? 
A 
So, from my language, I would take that it's the 
same process, but that there is a process, and the process 
hasn't yet been followed. 
Q 
All right. Okay. 
A 
So, it would be the typical process in a typical 
complex case. 
Q 
All right, and is it fair to characterize this as a 
relatively complex case, given the legal issues? 
A 
I think it is, yes. 
Q 
Okay. In Exhibit 8, you actually got the 
in 
Exhibit 7, you see that in the bottom part of that that you 
received a copy of the pros memo on the second page of that 
exhibit at the top. 
A 
Right. 
is forwarding to you the pros memo. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
In Exhibit 8, you see that 
is 
forwarding or sending to that chain, excluding 
, that is, 
and you, additional 
EFTA00009301

Page 74 
items in Operation Leap Year, and that's a summary of the 
indictment, and evidence regarding the individual victims. 
Okay? So, as of May 11, you had before you the pros memo, 
the proposed indictment, and this substantial amount of 
additional --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- information. Did you read the pros memo? 
A 
Right. So, I don't recall -- and I know you're 
going to say, why don't I, but this was a long time ago. I 
don't recall if I read it, or if I went back to the office 
and sat down with 
and 
and went over it. I can't 
recall from this far. I can say that it looks based on this 
that I was at the U.S. Attorney's conference. 
Q 
Mm-hmm, 
A 
The idea of printing this out on a hotel printer, I 
wouldn't -- I can't believe I would have printed this out on 
a hotel printer. 
Q 
Let alone read it on an airplane, correct? 
A 
Let alone read it on an airplane. That just 
wouldn't --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- have been my practice. 
Q 
But going back -- arriving back --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- to your office, was it your practice to take 
EFTA00009302

Page 75 
voluminous documents like this and go through them yourself, 
or did you rely on your senior staff? 
A 
I would typically rely on senior staff. They --
they're the experienced ones that have seen these matters 
before. They would go through it. We'd sit down. We'd talk 
about the issues. We might have it in front of us, almost 
like you've got all those 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- binders there, but you know, you're calling my 
attention to particular issues, and we'd sort of talk it 
through. 
Q 
And do you recall doing that in this case? 
A 
I recall having discussions with senior staff about 
this case. 
Q 
Who? 
A 
Certainly 
and 
at various points, and 
I can't say that I did that in May versus April versus June. 
I can't give you 
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- timelines. 
Q 
Well, we're talking now about May. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Because you've got the actual --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- process. 
EFTA00009303

Page 76 
A 
It would have been my practice based on this to go 
back and discuss it, and so based on my practiced, I would 
have gone back and likely discussed it. I doubt I would have 
printed this out at whatever hotel I was at. 
Q 
But even when you got back to the office, would you 
have had somebody print it out so you would've had it 
available? 
A 
I may have had someone print it out so it's 
available. I may have focused on particular parts of it. 
Q 
What kinds of issues would you have focused on? In 
other words -- in other words, some might go straight to the 
facts. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Some might be interested in the legal theories. 
What was -- what was your approach? 
A 
So, I think that depended on the case. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
Here, you had legal questions, and you also had --
had witness issues, and I would think those would have been 
the two primary areas. 
Q 
Would you have gone through the indictment and the 
pros memo and all of those other materials, or just relied on 
your experience seeing your people, 
and 
A 
As a general practice, probably some combination. 
As a general -- a general recollection, the concerns in this 
EFTA00009304

Page 77 
case weren't about the sordid details of what happened, 
because we believed he did what he did. The concerns were 
about some of the legal issues around it, and some of the 
issues in terms of testimony. 
Q 
Of the victims? 
A 
Of the victims. 
Q 
All right. On page --
A 
And I say that because that would have been what I 
would naturally focus on as opposed to reading the sordid 
details, because I think everyone believed the victims. 
Q 
All right. Exhibit 9 is an e-mail that you are not 
on, but that -- notes that 
is advising 
that 
you, 
, "Has your memo and Lefcourt's letter." Gerald 
Lefcourt was --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- a New York attorney who was one of the members 
of the Epstein defense team. Did you know him? 
A 
I did not. 
Q 
Did you ever encounter him as far as you recall? 
A 
I did not. 
Q 
All right. He had, according to the documents we 
have, made two substantial submissions to 
and 
in --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- February of that year in an effort to dissuade 
EFTA00009305

Page 78 
them from pursuing a prosecution, and we have every reason to 
believe and no reason not to believe that that's what is 
being referred to. Do you recall reviewing substantial 
submissions from defense counsel at this time attacking in 
very granular detail --
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- the credibility of the witnesses, and so on? 
A 
I don't recall reviewing those. Again, I recall 
discussions with my senior team about issues that included 
the credibility, and I'm not sure if it's -- credibility is 
the right word, but how the victims would do on the stands. 
Q 
Okay, and who do you recall talking to you about 
that? 
A 
So, some combination of 
and 
would have 
bene the likely -- I recall the discussion. I don't recall 
whether it was 
, or whether it was 
or 
but the 
logical inference would have been it would have been some 
combination of 
and 
Q 
has told us that during this period, he 
was not actively involved in this case --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- but that 
was. Would that be 
consistent with your memory, or would --
A 
That -- sure, it -- I mean, they were a team. They 
became more or less involved based on needs. 
EFTA00009306

Page 79 
Q 
And was there any particular -- if We EMI 
was 
working with you directly on reporting 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- on his assessment of this case, was there any 
reason for Mi 
to be involved? 
A 
I might bounce ideas off him. I mean, he was 
he 
was right across, so we worked closely, but you know, 
was the criminal chief, and if he was in the weeds, 
, I 
would speculate would sort of, much like me, defer to his 
judgement, because they've known each other, and they've 
worked together, and they had a good working relationship. 
Q 
And is it -- do we understand correctly that as 
first  
tant, 
had a brief that really encompassed 
the entire office? 
A 
He did. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
He -- so, he supervised the civil, the criminal, 
the appellate, and the forfeiture. 
Q 
All right. There is here in this e-mail that you 
did not see back in the day, Exhibit 9, a pushback from 
regarding the rush that 
is in to 
pursue the case, and he says, "This is obviously a Very 
significant case, and Alex wants to take his time making sure 
he is comfortable before proceeding." Do you -- can you tell 
us what the basis would be for, or was, for that assertion by 
EFTA00009307

Page ".7.;. 
A 
So, I can't -- well, I can't tell you from 
recollection what the basis is. I can -- I can speculate 
that the materials being transmitted Friday morning -- oh, I 
guess it was -- yeah, so --
Q 
The 11th. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Friday. 
A 
So, Friday morning, it hasn't been reviewed by 
anyone in the management chain, much less approved and 
edited, and 
that Monday is saying why don't I have a 
decision? 
And -- and so, absent truly extenuating 
circumstances, typically, you'd have -- give -- you know, 
it'd go through the management chain up to the U.S. Attorney. 
And so, he's pushing back, saying, hey, it's been a day, or 
it's been a weekend. I'm --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- I'm just reading between the lines here. 
Q 
Who had authority to sign off on the Epstein 
prosecution? To, say, indict? 
A 
So, as a delegated matter, 
had 
signature authority. 
Q 
Me 
-hmm. 
A 
As did -- as did 
, as did 
EFTA00009308

Page 81 
obviously I did. As a practice matter, this is something 
that would have gone through the chain, and that we would 
have then discussed. 
Q 
But why up at your level? Is it because it is, as 
says, "Obviously a very significant case?" 
A 
So, at my level, not only because of the facts, 
because it's not about the facts, but I do think that there 
are legal issues that -- that implicated policy, that -- that 
we were thinking through. 
Q 
And what were -- what were the legal issues, and 
what were the policy issues? 
A 
So -- so, the legal issues, and also factual issues 
in terms of the witnesses. So, the legal issues 
so, and 
there's an e-mail from 
based on the -- you know, the 
contemporaneous record that alludes to some of this. In my 
experience at the civil rights division, trafficking cases 
involved -- you know, I can -- I can describe some -- some 
8 
horrific cases of girls being held against their will, you 
know. 
You had child pornography matters with young women, 
sometimes incredibly young, that the office prosecuted. As 
the trafficking laws were being developed, there was a lot o 
discussion about, what's the difference between trafficking 
and solicitation, and that discussion took place as the 
trafficking laws were being developed. And so, this 
EFTA00009309

Page 82 
implicated that, and it implicated the -- what is local and 
what is federal. 
Q 
All right. So, in the first, you're talking -- in 
the first category, you're talking about the individual 
charges that had been -- that were being proposed, which 
included both trafficking and coercion and enticement -- or, 
enticement. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
All right. And in the latter, you felt that -- did 
you 
to what extent did the witness -- victim witness kind 
of credibility issues implicate policy? 
A 
So -- so, I think I said policy and victim in that. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
In that there was certainly discussion between me 
and my management about concerns as to how these victims 
would sort of stand up in court. 
Q 
So, what would have -- what would make you 
comfortable before -- before proceeding? What would make 
you -- what at that point would have made you comfortable 
about proceeding? 
A 
So, I think that at this point, I don't think it's 
what would or would not have made me comfortable, and I'm 
speculating here. I think it's, it came in on Friday, let's 
talk this through. 
Q 
But there -- but you've just identified for us 
EFTA00009310

Page 83 
issues that --
A 
Issues that --
-- in your mind 
A 
-- we would have --
Q 
-- had to be resolved. 
A 
-- wanted to talk through. 
Q 
All right. Okay. At that point, did you -- to 
your recollection, have any doubt that some form of 
indictment or charging instrument against Epstein was likely 
to be -- become viable? 
A 
So, I don't -- it was a case that I thought it very 
important that we do something. How that something played 
out, I think had all along been a matter of discussion. 
Q 
As something other than what the U.S. Attorney's 
Office does, which is prosecute? 
A 
Well -- well, no, I mean, what the U.S. Attorney's 
Office does is ensure that justice is served. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And whether -- and in partnership with state 
attorneys, and sometimes that means state attorneys take the 
lead. Sometimes that means the U.S. Attorney's Office takes 
the lead, and it -- and a lot of times, we actually had, you 
know, we -- we would share staff, because sometimes it made 
sense for -- you know, for one part of the other to take the 
lead. 
EFTA00009311

Page 84 
So, writ large, I thought throughout it was very 
important that something happen. There were these concerns 
all along. I can speculate that this is just a reflection of 
those continuing concerns. 
Q 
As expressed by you to 
in the ordinary 
course? 
A 
As developed as a group throughout this -- I can 
so, if we go back to -- what was the Exhibit? 
Q 
June of -- June of 2006. 
A 
So, Exhibit 3, 
says, "In that meeting, I 
summarized the case and the state attorney's office handling 
it. I acknowledged that we needed to do work to collect 
evidence establishing a federal nexus, and I noted the time 
and money that would be required for an investigation." And 
so, as far back as that initial meeting, there is the 
discussion about the federal nexus, and is this a state or a 
federal --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- case? 
Q 
All right. Exhibit 7 is an early e-mail from= 
to you. Early, meaning it proceeds the one --
A 
Correct-. 
Q 
-- we just looked at, and early in that it's right 
as you're 
A 
EFTA00009312

Page 85 
Q 
-- receiving the pros memo, and you ask him, have 
you read the memo? And curious why you 
rather than 
ask MI 
A 
I don't recall. I can -- I can speculate, and I 
have two thoughts that I'll speculate. One is, ME 
her 
direct supervisor. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
And I might be thinking --
Q 
Second line supervisor. 
A 
Her second line supervisor, so why is 
sending 
me this? 
, have you read this? I.e., did you jump the 
chain? Secondly, I think it 
I may have wanted to have 
multiple opinions on this. 
Q 
Ms-hmm. 
A 
It's most likely that I had talked to 
already, because 
and I talked more often, and I'm asking 
another person in the management chain, hey, what do you 
think? Let's have multiple opinions on the table here. 
Q 
Well, this is the first time other than 
that 
we see you getting a recommendation. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
When 
says, he thinks that you should 
charge him -- you, the office, should charge Epstein. He has 
issues with the charging strategy proposed by 
but 
one, he says, "We all need to get on the same page as to 
EFTA00009313

Page 86 
whether the statute's covered the conduct, and whether the 
conduct is the type we should charge. I think the answer to 
both is yes, although there is some risk on some of the 
statutes." He proposes that the office start with a 
complaint, which is not unusual, is it? 
A 
It -- it happens, yes. 
Q 
All right, which allows the defendant to be 
arrested, and ideally detained, and then the defendant is 
then highly motivated or incentivized --
what 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- to work a pre-indictment resolution. That's 
is proposing. He also notes that it's 
important to -- in his view, to "cap him with conspiracy 
counts to make a plea attractive," and the court could give 
us a hard time with that if we had to dismiss indicted 
counts. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Okay. The proposed indictment included one 
conspiracy -- a conspiracy that has a five year 
A 
Five year cap. 
Q 
-- statutory maximum, and this notion is that 
Epstein be charged with a five-year conspiracy count, and 
take it from there. Do you know what he was referring to 
when he noted that a court could give you a hard time in 
dismissing indicted counts in this case? 
EFTA00009314

Page 87 
A 
So -- so, as a typical matter, once there's an 
indictment, the -- a pre-indictment -- well, by definition, a 
pre-indictment resolution comes off the table, but in cases 
of this nature, the resolutions tend to happen before 
indictment, because once the indictment is done, at least in 
South Florida, dismissal of charges -- for example, if -- you 
know, if 
is saying, let's think about a 371 with a five 
year cap a rule 11 --
Q 
Mm-hem. 
A 
-- that's something that South Florida judges, they 
tend not to -- you know, dismissing a number of counts, and 
then doing a rule 11 is not something that judges tend to do. 
Q 
All right. Two -- two pieces to that. One is --
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- the issue of dismissing substantive --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- counts -- substantive counts. Is that -- was 
that a particular concern in this case because of the nature 
of the conduct represented in the --
A 
So --
Q 
-- substantive counts? 
A 
-- so, so, your question -- you asked a general 
question, and then now you're moving to a 
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- specific. As a general matter, not just in this 
EFTA00009315

Page 88 
case, but in other cases, it is -- it was rare that the 
office after an -- in cases like this, after a full charge 
was done, that that substantive counts were dismissed. So, 
for example, in the public corruption cases that I referenced 
earlier out of Palm Beach, those were all negotiated pre-
indictment, and agreed to, and then by the time the -- the 
case was indicted, it was all -- it was all sort of set on 
auto-pilot. 
Q 
So, typically, in my experience, the -- a 
disposition like that is -- results in a criminal 
information, not an indictment. 
A 
Correct, and --
Q 
Are you saying that you would go ahead and indict 
then? 
A 
No, no, no, what I'm saying is that they were -- it 
was all negotiated in advance, and then there was an 
information --
Q 
Oh, okay. 
A 
-- and the information would go forward, not an 
indictment. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And so, that is how a number of high profile cases 
typically proceeded, as opposed to indict and dismiss. 
Q 
And that is the experience of the Southern District 
of Florida in general? 
EFTA00009316

Page 89 
A 
It -- it was in particularly the Palm Beach office 
with other high profile cases that were there at the time. 
Q 
Do you recall any case in which a judge in an 
indicted case refused to dismiss counts when the 
government --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- in an indictment under those circumstances? 
A 
I don't recall specific cases, but I can -- I can 
say that typically in the higher profile cases you'd 
negotiated with opposing counsel, presenting information. 
The information would have agreed to an agreed to guideline, 
and it would proceed in that way. 
Q 
Understood, but in this case, I'm focusing on the 
assertion by 
that the court could give us a hard 
time, and that's a little different from, you know, 
exercising discretion to negotiate and proceed by 
information. So, is there any judge that -- that was 
particularly concerning with regard to an unwillingness to --
A 
Q 
-- dismiss? 
A 
I don't -- so, first, this is 12 years ago, and I 
don't recall any specific judge, but I can -- I can sort of 
that say that was not the practice of the office. The 
practice of the office was to proceed by information rather 
than indictment with dismissal, because there is more --
EFTA00009317

Page 9C 
there is -- there -- you can -- you can -- you can lay out 
more what you've negotiated. I think later there's a letter 
from.. that sort of presents the same perspective. 
Q 
All right. In --
MS. 
One moment? 
MS. 
: Go ahead. 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
BY MS. a: 
Q 
You said in cases of this nature, the resolution 
happens before indicting. What is the -- this cases of this 
nature? 
A 
Higher profile. Higher profile cases. 
Q 
So, not necessarily sex offense cases? 
A 
Not necessarily sex offense, no, no, no, higher --
higher profile cases where --
Q 
And this made -- this was a higher profile case 
because --
A 
This was a -- just, a -- so, I would say it's a 
combination of all of the above, and to my mind, one of 
the -- one of the parts of this case is the legal theories 
were, if not novel, they were novel within the Southern 
District of Florida. At least, some of the legal theories, 
and I -- we'll probably get into that. 
Q 
Did his wealth make it a high profile case? 
A 
Well, it was clearly in the paper. And so, that 
EFTA00009318

Page 91 
made it a high profile case. I don't think it -- I don't 
think it was his wealth. I think it was all of the above. 
This was a matter that the state attorney had been ready to 
charge that the federal government is now jumping into and 
S 
saying, by its presence, that the state did not do enough. 
That in and of itself makes it a very high profile 
case. I can't remember any other instance, certainly during 
my time, when we jumped in and said, you know, the state 
dropped charges, and so we are going to do more. 
BY MS. 
Q 
As opposed to, or as distinguished from what you'd 
described a few moments ago, a situation in which the federal 
authorities and the state authorities kind of worked together 
to sort out what would be charged, where, and do it 
cooperatively? 
A 
And that was more cooperative, and I --
Q 
Right. 
A 
i would -- you know, I do recollect that -- and 
I think the record bears this out, that this was not a 
particularly cooperative relationship between us and the 
state attorney. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. Yes, we will get to that. Were you --
A 
If I could -- if I could return, I think your 
question -- the way you posed your question, you said a 
recommendation from 
, and let me -- let me push back a 
EFTA00009319

Page 92 
little bit on that. 
Saying what are your thoughts? Have you read it, 
what are your thoughts? And he says, yes, we can talk next 
week, my current thoughts are 
is very different than, 
we've sat down, we've discussed this, this is my now informed 
position. 
Q 
Understood, and I -- I should have been clearer. I 
was referring to his recommendation that if you were going to 
proceed, you should start with a --
I 4 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- complaint. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Just to be clear. 
A 
And I'm just saying --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- initial thoughts are -- yeah. 
Q 
All right. So, were you aware that 
bootlegged a copy of the pros memo to 
at 
CEOS? 
Q 
Q 
He did at that time. 
A 
0k:Fcf. 
And did you -- did you know 
A 
A little bit. I certainly knew of him. 
Q 
Had you encountered him when -- he was the chief of 
EFTA00009320

Page 93 
the child exploitation and obscenities section 
A 
Right. 
Q 
in the criminal division here, correct? Had you 
encountered him while you were in this building also? 
A 
Most likely. I knew of him enough that the 
correspondence shows -- and I recall asking to involve him 
pretty early on. 
Q 
So, it does read as if you were acquainted with 
him. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
All right. And did you have any -- did his 
opinion, his views as chief of CEOS and as 
who had been an AUSA --
A 
Right. 
Q 
A 
In Miami. 
Q 
-- Miami, did his views have influence on your 
thinking about this case? 
A 
I don't think at this time I was aware that 
had been consulted. 
Q 
All right, and in July, just so you know, and I --
and this is not something you saw -- he provided a fairly 
strong statement to -- by e-mail to 
and 
in which he advises that he reviewed the pros memo 
closely. 
EFTA00009321

Page 94 
It's terrific. He says 
did a terrific job, 
and he says, "we agree with her legal analysis. Her charging 
decisions are legally sound," and then 
goes 
through the different statutes, and concludes that they are 
all properly charged, and that although there are some 
issues, legally, that in his view we should, "We should 
prevail." "Our position should prevail." 
And that he also reviewed the arguments contained 
in the letters from defense counsel, and he found none of 
their arguments persuasive. So, at least as of July 18, 
your --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- three levels of supervisors down were on notice 
that CEOS was on board and wanted to --
A 
Right. 
Q 
see the case move forward, but is it -- am I 
correct in understanding that at that time, you were unaware 
of that? 
A 
I do not recall being aware of that. 
Q 
All right. Okay. If you had been aware of it, if 
they had sent this --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- pretty -- I don't want to overstate it, but it 
is a pretty strong endorsement of the proposed prosecution, 
would you have been influenced by that? 
EFTA00009322

Page 95 
A 
Sure, I would have. I mean, I -- I respected MI, 
and clearly wanted him to be part of the team, and later 
invited him down, and so, yes. 
Q 
Okay. All right. Do you know why they wouldn't 
have shared -- your people wouldn't have shared this with 
you? 
A 
I can't -- I don't know. 
Q 
All right. So, when -- as far -- based on the 
briefings that you got at -- in this time period when there 
was an effort to try to figure out --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- what you were going to do, were there any issues 
of concern of fact or evidence or the charges that were left 
unaddressed? In other words, if there were issues about 
victim credibility, were steps being taken to address those? 
A 
Unaddressed is a -- again, it -- it's a very 
binary, and it's not about addressed versus unaddressed. And 
so, let me -- let me sort of come at it, if I can try to 
get -- there were concerns around some legal issues. There 
were concerns about how the victims would do when put on the 
stand. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
As a general matter, we thought there was enough if 
we had to go forward, we could, as an ethical matter, go 
forward. That doesn't mean that there was not value in a 
EFTA00009323

Page 96 
pre-indictment resolution. 
And so, here, you havellIII, based on this Exhibit 
7, saying, we need to get on the same page as to what to 
charge, pre-indictment resolution, cap him with conspiracy 
count to make up the attractive. 
So, a five year cap, something less than five 
years, you have
 in her affidavit that was submitted to 
the court saying she favored a pre-indictment resolution. 
And so, it's not a, have you addressed everything, yes or no, 
as opposed to putting all of this, how do we --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- how do we move forward? 
Q 
Right, but there is a binary point here, and that 
is, you either indict or you don't indict. You either 
present an indictment to the grand jury, or you don't, right? 
That's a decision. Right? 
A 
So, I would -- I would actually push back in that 
in many cases, it's not quite that binary. In many cases, 
you sit down with opposing counsel and say, look, we can go 
to a grand jury, and we can present this indictment and 
indict, or we can resolve this now. If we resolve this now, 
this is the path that can go forward. Alternatively, we can 
go here. And so, it's not an A versus B. 
Q 
I understand that nuance, but the decision to 
indict does -- I mean, you either indict or you don't. If 
EFTA00009324

Page 97 
you don't indict, it's for any number of reasons. If under 
these circumstances, the choices that are available are you 
have a case that's been brought in -- taken in from --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the state. You can -- you can decline it. Send 
it back to the state, make it go away, whatever. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
We're not interested. You can indict. You can 
indict and go to trial. These are the subcategories. Or you 
can indict and have the defendant plead to the indictment, or 
you can indict and work a post-indictment plea deal, which 
raises the issues you talked about, or you can negotiate 
an -- or you can charge -- proceed by complaint, and do as 
was suggesting --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- work a pre-indictment but post charge 
disposition, or you can work a pre-charge disposition, right? 
I mean, that's really --
A 
So, so --
Q 
That's the parade of possibles. 
A 
Sure, but that's more than indictment or don't 
indict. That's six or seven options. 
Q 
I understand that. That's how it will play out, 
but the decision as to whether to indict is binary. You're 
either indicting or you're not indicting. The -- the act of 
EFTA00009325

Page 98 
indicting is a -- is something that either happens or doesn't 
happen. That's all I'm saying. 
A 
Sure. 
Q 
Okay? So, what I'm getting at is, with respect to 
the indictment -- so, as you're looking at this case, 
you're -- it sounds as if you're doing sort of one analytical 
track, which is, what do we do with this case? The other 
piece of that, and a track that could have been followed 
exclusively is, what do we need to do to get an indictment 
that is legally sound and evidentiary -- evidentiarily solid? 
I'd like to focus on that track --
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- because they're not unrelated. 
A 
Sure. 
Q 
If you never get down the, do we have a viable 
indictment road, then you're not going to be able to do 
anything in the other 
A 
Sure. 
Q 
-- road. So, at this point, you had identified, 
and you collectively -- you and your people had identified 
some witness -- victim witness issues, and some legal issues. 
My question is, were steps being taken to -- i used -- I used 
the term address --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- let me -- let me clarify, with respect to the 
EFTA00009326

e , 
witnesses, was the FBI and the line attorney with the 
assistance perhaps of the grand jury, taking steps to 
corroborate --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- shore up victim witness testimony, find new 
victims, find additional evidence, and so on? 
A 
So -- so, taking that in part is helpful. So, with 
respect to the witness issues, I recall, and 
goes into 
much more detail in her affidavit, but I recall concerns that 
were communicated to me about, in essence, to sort of 
summarize my impression or recollection, these girls are 
young. 
They're impressionable. They are scared. Will 
they stand up in court? There are any number of -- there's 
any number of things that could be used against them. Some 
of them are -- and this is uncomfortable, but some of them 
thought he actually cared for them, and that's not atypical 
in these cases where they -- they sort of develop thoughts 
that are wrong, but -- but they are what they are, and were 
actually saying he did nothing wrong, and because many of 
them knew one another, how would that all play out? 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And so, it would be my assumption, particularly 
given, you know, how much work 
was doing on this 
case -- Ms. 
was doing on this case -- that she, in 
EFTA00009327

Page 100 
combination with the FBI, would be pursuing those matters, 
and looking to develop the evidence and corroborate, and 
throughout this process, it would have been my assumption and 
hope that she was continuing to develop the facts, because 
that can only help. 
Q 
And so as U.S. Attorney, would it indeed have been 
your expectation? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And the expectation that her -- that all those 
interim supervisors would have been supporting her and 
encouraging her and guiding her? 
A 
It would have been, and that -- that's what happens 
in typical cases. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
Just because we're having a legal discussion 
doesn't mean you stop pursuing leads. 
Q 
All right. Let me stick with the evidence piece of 
that. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
I'm going to keep these --
A 
Helpful. 
Q 
-- strains going. You got a very detailed 
accounting in -- reflected in Exhibit 8 from 
of the 
different Jane Does, and there were a lot of them, and there 
were -- there were many counts in the indictment, and many

carefully -- the -- each -- each victim was tied to a 
particular set of criminal activity. In other words, these 
victims were not lumped in an aggregate sort of formless 
petri dish. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
They were individuals. 
had met -- was 
meeting with them, *indeed was finding new victims along with 
the FBI, and they were conducting individualized assessments 
of the viability of each victim witness, and indeed 
submitted a follow on pros memo, a pros memo addendum in 
July, and another one in September, and tailored -- continued 
to tailor her indictment -- proposed indictment to these 
individualized acts. 
The question -- when I -- when I hear the victims 
referred to in the aggregate, I wonder what effort there was 
to sit down and address each individual victim, because there 
were so many, and a credibility issue that could be very 
troubling with one victim, if -- or, two victims, or four 
victims --
A 
Fair. 
Q 
-- could well be overcome by other victims who had, 
not those credibility issues, perhaps others, and if I may 
finish, that in the aggregate, when presented individually in 
total, a kind of a persuasive case could be made that would 
be impossible with one or two or three? Does that -- is that 
EFTA00009329

Page 102 
a fair --
A 
So, that is fair, and I think -- and your point 
that we shouldn't sort of talk about the victims in aggregate 
is a fair point. I would -- I would respond, and Ms. 
goes into this in her affidavit a little bit, and 
I've got it -- and I have a recollection of some discussion 
of this between myself, and you're going to ask me who, so 
another victim that said horrendous things happened, to what 
extent does defense cast this as, they are trying to recover, 
they're trying to do -- and so one of the concerns was when 
you have victims that know one another, that brought one 
another in, even if you've got similar patterns, if some of 
them cast doubt, how would that be taken by -- by the jury? 
Q 
Is that assessment or analysis your own, or is it 
one that you developed with the people you talked to about 
this case? 
A 
So, that -- that assessment would have been, in my 
general recollection, but also based on my practice, that 
kind of witness assessment is the kind of thing that I would 
have relied more on the AUSA -- on my management team for, 
let me just say I don't know who. 
But the concern is when you have victims that know 
one another, to what extent would defense -- if you've got 
two victims that say A happened, even if it's similar sets of 
facts, and another victim that said he did nothing wrong, and 
EFTA00009330

Page 103 
because that was more within their -- their area of 
expertise. 
Q 
Right, and 
in particular was known as 
a trial attorney. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Correct? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Do you recall having discussions with 
about 
that? 
A 
He would have been the logical --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- person. I know that we had those discussions, 
and we talked about what happened, how will they -- how will 
they play out at trial, and -- and the takeaway was, it could 
play out well, it could not play out well. 
Q 
So, as of the time that all --
A 
And again, I say they as a collective. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
Understanding that some would say exonerating 
things. Some would have contradictory statements. Some may 
not want to testify, and -- and so, that conversation was 
had. 
Q 
So, was had, it -- you and 
talked about it? 
A 
I can't say -- 
and I can say, I recall the 
discussion, you know, I don't know -- 12 years ago, you might 
EFTA00009331

Page 104 
recall a discussion from 12 years ago. What -- what you 
presented to me, for the record, I'm pointing to 
, or I'm 
indicating 
the -- the issue about civil rights, do you 
recall who else was in the room or wasn't in the room at the 
time? 
substance without remembering who was in the room at the 
time. 
Q 
And understanding --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that this was one case of thousands that were 
under your --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- authority, although a particularly sensitive and 
high profile one, but the -- a -- the question to you is, do 
you know what individualized assessment 
did of 
the victim witnesses? 
A 
I -- I can't speak to that. 
A 
Yeah, I --
Q 
It's a rhetorical question. 
A 
It's a rhetorical question. 
Q 
We'll take it, I guess. 
A 
But --
Q
A 
-- you know, it's very -- it -- one can remember 
EFTA00009332

Page 105 
Q 
Do you know whether he actually met with any of the 
victim witnesses? 
A 
I can't speak to that. 
Q 
Do you know whether 
went to West Palm 
and sat down and actually went through the evidence as to 
each one of the potential --
A 
I --
Q 
-- witnesses? 
A 
I can't speak to that. 
Q 
Do you know any of that information as to 
SNP 
A 
Again, I can't -- I can't speak to that. I 
would -- I would say that -- that 
was first assistant, 
and to the extent he relied on the criminal chief, that would 
be -- he used to be criminal chief, and so --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- he would naturally view the role of criminal 
chief as being important, and someone that would naturally 
review matters before they went to the first assistant. 
Q 
Okay. So, when you talk -- when you were -- as you 
recall, having these conversations about the -- the victim 
issues, as -- as matters of evidence, it -- it -- you cannot 
tell us what the basis for 
analysis was? 
A 
I can't. I mean, as a general matter, I don't 
recall the specific. As a general matter, when I talk to 
EFTA00009333

Page 106 
individuals about a case, I would assume that they had 
informed themselves, and had done the diligence necessary to 
have that discussion with me. 
Q 
Do you remember him parsing out for you, or --
Q 
-- you know --
A 
-- I don't recall that --
-- the individual --
A 
-- that level of granularity. 
Q 
All right. The -- to finish my sentence, to the 
individual witnesses, and you're saying you don't. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
And by witness, I mean victim witness. Did you 
ever sit down with 
and have her present to 
you each witness -- each victim as a potential witness, and 
her individualized credibility issues, and how as a -- as a 
prosecutor and an experienced trial attorney, 
was going to overcome those issues? 
A 
I don't recall doing that, and as a matter of 
general practice, particularly when it came to what I'll call 
trial issues --
Q 
mm-bms. 
A 
-- we had really experienced individuals in the 
office, and that's not something that I would typically do on 
this or other high profile cases, because they're the trial 
EFTA00009334

Page 107 
lawyers. They -- this is what they do. I would tend to 
focus more on the legal issues. 
Q 
All right. I want to stay with the -- the witness 
issues, and the evidence of that for the moment. 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
In Exhibit 3, this lively exchange between 
and 
, she asks to make a presentation to you in the last 
major paragraph of her e-mail on page four. She says, "I 
would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Attorney, 
and you, with our side of the investigation and a 
revised indictment. The presentation will address the points 
raised by Epstein's counsel, and will convince you of the 
strength of the case." Bearing in mind that by this time, 
and 
had in front of them --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- her pros memo, her proposed indictment, this 
analysis she did as evidenced in Exhibit 8, but also the 
submissions from Jerry Lefcourt, and that -- that 
had 
not had a chance to actually make a presentation to them. 
response is on page three, his last paragraph. 
He chides 
and tells her that, "You may 
not dictate the dates and people you will meet with about 
this or any other case. If the U.S. Attorney or the first 
assistant desired to meet with you, they will let you know." 
She, in her final response on page one points out that she's 
EFTA00009335

Page 108 
not trying to dictate anything. She's just asking. Are you 
aware that -- bear in mind, you didn't see --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
-- Exhibit 3, were you aware that 
very much wanted to make a presentation to you and to 
and 
about her case, and her evidence? 
A 
So, I don't recall this. 
Q 
By this, you mean --
A 
I don't -- I don't recall being aware of this 
request. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
As a -- as a general matter, it seemed that there 
was communications going back and forth. And so, she 
certainly felt comfortable e-mailing me when she wanted to, I 
guess is my point, rightly or wrongly. And so, I wasn't 
aware of that request, and --
Q 
So, are you suggesting that she could easily have 
e-mailed you and said, Alex, I really want to make a 
presentation to you? 
A 
I'm not suggesting -- let me -- what I'm suggesting 
is from my perspective, there was a lot of communication in 
this case, more than is typical. I wasn't aware of -- I 
don't recall the request, but there was communication in this 
case. 
Q 
What do you -- what do you mean by communication? 
al 
• 
EFTA00009336

Page 109 
I mean, there are a lot of e-mails, but --
A 
There is. There are a lot of e-mails, right. 
Q 
But a lot of them are because there are draft --
later on, we have drafts and so on, but --
A 
Q 
-- we don't --
A 
So, what I mean by that is, I do not recall an 
impression that she wasn't being -- that she didn't have 
access, or wasn't being heard. 
Q 
To you? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
You've already seen two e-mails here where she was 
scolded pretty seriously, and in one case for approaching --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
and you without 
being 
involved back when --
A 
Correct. 
Q 
was crim chief, and then here, she --
the -- what 
says to her is quite strong, isn't 
it? Would you have ever used that language to a subordinate? 
A 
You've seen my e-mails and my style. 
Q 
I think not. 
A 
I -- so, what I -- what I am saying is, from my 
perspective at the time to the best of my recollection, this 
was not a case where she was not -- where she was frozen out. 
EFTA00009337

Page 110 
This was a case where there was ample communication --
MR. 
: Well --
BY MS. 
Q 
Did 
ever tell you, hey boss, this line 
assistant, she's being a pain. You know, she's asked for to 
make a presentation to you. Do you want to do it? 
A 
I -- I don't -- look, this was 12 years ago. I 
don't recall it. Whether he did or not, I can't say, but I 
don't recall it. 
Q 
If he or 
or even 
had 
directly asked you for that opportunity, would you have 
entertained it? Would you have agreed to a presentation from 
the line attorney? 
A 
As a general matter, if someone makes a direct --
saying, this is a case that I have worked, I need to sit down 
and talk to you, I would have said, yes. 
Q 
Do you recall any occasion when a line assistant on 
his or her own initiative came to you and made such a request 
and you granted it? 
A 
I don't, because it rarely got to that level. 
from my impression and my recollection, we had pretty good 
communications in the office. 
Q 
All right, I'm sorry, I --
MR. 
: That's okay. 
MS. 
: -- cut you off. 
EFTA00009338

Page 111 
BY MR. 
Q 
You've talked about needing to respect the chain of 
command. 
A 
Right. 
Would there have been any repercussions for a line 
assistant actually trying to approach you about this 
presentation? 
A 
I would hope not. I mean, it's -- I think it's 
important for line assistants to be respectful and to, you 
know, let their supervisor know, and issues -- you know, and 
to do it with -- with respect, and not go around supervisors, 
but I would hope -- I mean --
Q 
Well --
A 
-- not --
Q 
If she had raised it with a supervisor first, and 
that supervisor said, no, that's not your place, would you 
have expected her to have followed what the supervisor had 
told her on that regard? 
A 
Fair. Look, fair point. I'm not aware of this e-
mail. I can't speak to that. AS a general matter, I 
would 
-- you know, going back to where I started, you know, I would 
at 6:00 o'clock walk around the office and say, how are 
things going? What case are you working on? In part, 
because I thought it was important to. 
BY MS. 
EFTA00009339

Page 112 
Q 
Did you wander up down -- up to West Palm and do 
that too? 
A 
Less often, but yes. 
BY MR. 
Q 
You talked a little bit about the experience of 
your senior staff. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
What do you know about the experience 
had in handling these types of cases? 
A 
You -- when you say these types, you mean --
Q 
Sex crimes --
A 
4 
had 
A 
I can't. 
Q 
-- cases involving children --
A 
I can't --
Q 
-- or child victims? 
A 
I can't speak to that. I don't know. 
Q 
What about 
A 
I can't speak to that. 
Q 
or 
A 
I can't speak to that. 
BY MS. 
Q 
But you do know that 
substantial experience with child sex crimes? 
EFTA00009340

Page 113 
A 
Q 
You named her PSA coordinator. 
A 
I know that she had experience with prior cases. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Okay. We're going to go for half an hour more, 
then we'll take our break, and then we'll --
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- come back. I -- and we will get back to that 
other piece of the evidence and the legal issues --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and then -- and then we'll spend a lot of time 
on the alternatives. Haven't forgotten that. In June of 
2007, there was a meeting that defense counsel requested of 
the sort of next level up from 
. In other words, 
they had already made a --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- presentation to the line assistant, and her 
supervisor. They wanted to come to Miami and talk to, in 
this case, 
and 
--
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- and they did meet with them. Were you aware --
do you have a recollection of whether you were aware that 
they -- there was such a meeting? 
A 
It -- so, / don't have a recollection, but it rings 
EFTA00009341

Page 114 
a bell. I don't know if that distinction is a fair one. 
Q 
Well, I can -- I may help amplify the bell a little 
bit. One of the defense attorneys who was present there in 
addition to Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Lillian Sanchez 
was Alan Dershowitz. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Does that ring a bell? 
A 
So, it does. There's --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
I -- I can't say it's a recollection, but it sounds 
like there -- it sounds right, and in my usual course, once 
was meeting with someone, he would typically have let me 
know. 
Q 
All right. All right, and where would such a 
meeting take place? Would it be in 
office? Was it 
big enough? Or would you use the executive conference room? 
A 
Based on the number of people, almost definitely 
the executive conference room. 
Q 
And is that -- do people have to go by your office 
to get there? 
A 
They do not. 
Q 
Okay, and would you in a case like this make a --
as you said a moment ago, pop your head in --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- and say hello? 
EFTA00009342

Page 115 
A 
Right. As a typical matter, I probably would not, 
because then it very rapidly turns into a meeting with me as 
opposed to a --
Q 
Mn-hmm. 
A 
-- meeting with --
Q 
14M-hmm. Okay. 
A 
If that makes sense. 
Q 
There was some written submissions also submitted. 
Pretty substantial ones. These addressing more of the legal 
issues --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- both before and after this. Did someone -- and 
if so, who -- brief you about what happened at the meeting, 
and what was contained in the written submissions? 
A 
So, I do not recall a briefing. I would assume 
that, again, based on practice, there's a senior level 
meeting in the office. Based on practice, 
would have 
told me, and then afterwards, he would have said this is what 
happened. 
Q 
All right, but you have no actual recollection of 
what happened in this case? 
A 
I have no actual recollection of -- other than the 
meeting sounding familiar, I have no recollection. 
Q 
So, Exhibit 50 in this packet, it's almost at the 
end. It's the next to last, really, is a letter that 
EFTA00009343

Page 116 
IMP 
offered to the DAG -- the then DAG --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- in June of 2008, a whole year later. The DAG, 
Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip, and this is -- you 
certainly recall that there was an appeal, if you will, a 
small appeal to the DAG's office --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- by defense counsel, and 
submitted a 
fairly substantial accounting of what had gone before in the 
case, and he also submitted a number of other documents 
relevant to that. 
He says on page three that at this June 26th, 2007 
meeting, which he characterizes arguments, legal and factual, 
were presented against a federal indictment, and 
writes that, "The arguments and written materials provided by 
the defense were examined by the SDFL and rejected." Do 
you -- is that consistent with any understanding you have of 
what happened at this meeting? 
A 
So, I don't recall, so I'm going to speculate, and 
the speculation is that by the time this happened, we were 
fairly far along in how we were viewing this matter. 
Q 
This being 2008, or --
A 
No, June. 
Q 
June 26th, 2007. Okay. 
A 
You know, and as I reviewed the documents, I tried 
EFTA00009344

Page 117 
to establish a timeline, but clearly, by July 31st, we had --
you know, we had sort of concluded how we were approaching 
it. 
And so, I'm going to speculate that when he said 
the arguments and written materials provided to defense 
counsel were examined by the SDFL and rejected, it was they 
asked us to drop the matter, and we said we're not dropping 
the matter. 
Q 
Okay. Okay, and by the way, is -- just to clean 
this up, this letter was -- to the DAG, was signed by 
under your type name, as is --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- standard but you're not cc'd on it. Do you 
do you recall why you didn't sign this letter? why it was 
sent by 
A 
A 
I do not recall. 
Q 
I just -- that's a -- that's a point of interest. 
and so, I'll draw your attention to 
A 
All right. 
Q 
-- Exhibit 49, which is actually dated the day 
prior, that is, June 2, 2008, and this is 
an e-mail to 
you from 
A 
Yes. 
III, who is -- was and is the ethics --
EFTA00009345

Page 118 
Q 
-- officer for the U.S. Attorney's Office, correct? 
Reporting back to you an assessment by the executive office 
of U.S. Attorneys general counsel's office that they did not 
see you as having an either actual or apparent conflict of 
interest that would necessitate your recusal from the Epstein 
matter by virtue of the fact that you apparent, according to 
this, intended to seek employment with Harvard Law School. 
A 
Right, or was considering seeking. 
Q 
Was considering. All right. Right. Should you 
seek employment, it says. So, is it -- is it reasonable for 
us to infer that this potential recusal --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was pending at the time the letter to Mark Filip 
was being drafted, and that's why it went out over 
signature, and without you as a CC? 
A 
So, I would not infer that. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
In part because it was potential -- and in part 
because 
had the facts at his disposal, and was 
the natural -- this was a very detailed letter. I did not 
feel that -- I'm speculating here -- as a general matter, 
things don't have to go out under my name, and some letters 
went out under his name, and some letters went out under my 
name, and the ones that went out under my name tended to be 
ones that I had more authorship in, and the ones that went 
EFTA00009346

Page 119 
out under his name in this case were the ones that he had 
more authorship in. And so, I would just say that this was 
the continuing course of that. 
Q 
Okay. Thank you. Minor technical issue. 
BY MS. line: 
Q 
Would you have read the letter before it went out? 
A 
Probably. I would say in my usual course, he would 
have shown it to me, but not always. 
Q 
Not always letters that would have been sent to the 
Deputy Attorney General's Office, or just letters in general? 
A 
Well, he would have 
I think he would have shown 
this to me because it's going to the deputy's office. The 
flip side is, I trust 
. I think he's a professional. 
Something that I -- so, an important distinction tc 
draw, I remember talking to an AUSA that had spent time at 
main justice, and contrasting the experience of an AUSA with 
the experience of a trial lawyer here, and sort of the line 
was you can't send a letter from main justice without three 
letters of approval, whereas an AUSA in their case typically 
doesn't even get approval from their line supervisor. And 
so, as a usual matter, particularly in this case, 
would 
run letters by me. 
That doesn't mean that every letter had to be run 
by me, and you know, I was certainly aware that the letter 
was being transmitted. I was aware of the appeal to D.C. 
EFTA00009347

Page 120 
had comfort in what we had done, and so I thought the appeal 
would be fine, and if I was out of the office, or if there 
was some reason that I wasn't going to be consulted, 
was 
quite capable of doing it without my review. 
Q 
But if you were in the office, it would have been 
typical for him to run it by you first? 
A 
It would have been. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Did you read the letter in preparation for --
A 
I did. 
Q 
-- this, and is there anything in it that is --
that in your view is not accurate? 
A 
I think it's accurate. I think the letter, as it 
should be, is an advocacy piece for what the office has done 
as opposed to a, on the one hand, on the other hand, analysis 
piece. But at this point, we're defending the actions of the 
office, and I think it appropriately should be an advocacy 
piece. 
Q 
All right. Do you disagree with any of the points 
of advocacy, or the points made in advocacy? 
A 
We -- we'd have to go through it --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- paragraph by paragraph. 
Q 
Okay. Okay. 
A 
But --
EFTA00009348

Page 121 
Q 
But nothing struck you so much that you --
A 
I think --
Q 
-- recall? 
A 
-- I think he fairly presented the totality of 
everything to the DAG for the DAG to review her for whoever 
the DAG designated, and I think that was -- that was an 
appropriate presentation. 
Q 
All right. Thank you. So, now I'd like to launch 
into -- and before we break for lunch, sort of the core 
question. 
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
Which we addressed a little bit earlier, and that 
is who at the U.S. Attorney's Office made the decision to 
resolve this case with an offer of a two year state plea, and 
why? 
A 
Right. So, how we got to the two years, I can't 
tell you, because I can give you my general impression. 
Ultimately, all the cases in the U.S. Attorney's Office were 
under me. 
Ultimately, I saw what we'll call that, you know, 
three pronged resolution, two years -- you know, registration 
and restitution, and ultimately that was approved on my 
authority. 
Q 
So, who came -- did you -- did you come up with it? 
Was it your idea --
EFTA00009349

Page 122 
A 
Q 
-- of an issue? 
A 
I don't -- I don't know. The -- this is 
reconstructing conversations -- I'm going to speculate now. 
This was not, let's all get in a room and figure out the 
resolution in the next half hour. 
Q 
Mh-hmm. 
A 
But this was a course as things are discussed and 
there's a back and forth over the course of some days or a 
week or two, and then people get together and discuss, and a 
view develops, and then the office proceeds with that. But 
ultimately -- let me -- let me just sort of push back. Look, 
ultimately, I approved it, and so, I --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- accept that. I'm not -- I'm not pushing away 
responsibility for it. I'm just saying I can't recall how we 
got to, for example, two years. I can speculate as to 
particular parts of it, but I can't -- you know, but 
ultimately I'm not pushing away responsibility. 
Q 
I understand, and we're going to delve into that 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- that two years -- shortly, but I want to turn 
back to Exhibit No. 3, in which sort of the statement that 
launches this -- what I keep calling a lively exchange, is on 
page four, the -- the statement from 
, and this 
EFTA00009350

Page 123 
is in response to an inquiry from
 to her management, 
not including you, about what conversations any of them has 
had with defense counsel --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- about any resolution, because her plan was to 
talk to Lilly Ann Sanchez about working a plea to federal 
time concurrent to the state -- whatever the state time was, 
and in response, 
tells her, "I told Lilly that a state 
plea with jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the 
USA," meaning the U.S. Attorney --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- I believe. So, that's a -- that's a closed 
quote after USA. Had he discussed that with you? How did he 
know that that might satisfy you? 
A 
So, I don't recall. I can 
I can speculate based 
on Mr. 
course of conduct, I don't think he would 
have raised that possibility in a case of this profile 
without having discussed it with me. 
Q 
But you have no specific --
A 
I have no --
Q 
-- recollection? 
A 
-- specific recollection, but I don't think he 
would have done that without having come by and said. 
Q 
All right. At this point, bearing in mind that you 
don't have any specific recollection, at this point, do you 
EFTA00009351

Page 124 
believe you had any understanding of what amount of jail time 
was in play at this point when 
tells Lilly Ann 
Sanchez --
A 
I can't pinpoint that timeline --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- to that degree. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
Of accuracy. 
Q 
He also says later in this e-mail that he told this 
to Lilly Ann Sanchez a couple of weeks prior before the June 
26th meeting. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
All right. Were you aware that 
had 
been communicating directly with Sanchez about the case, and 
specifically that he represented that you might go for a 
state disposition if it included jail time and sex offender 
registration? 
A 
I -- I don't recall whether I was aware or not. I 
recall at some point adopting the concept of jail time plus 
registration, and then plus restitution. And so, I don't 
know when that would have happened. Let me also speculate 
that the U.S. Attorney might go 
could also refer to, this 
is being talked about, no final decision has been made. 
Q 
Right. If 
had made that informal 
discussion comment to Lilly Ann Sanchez without having told 
EFTA00009352

Page 125 
I 
you, without having gotten your clearance ahead of time to 
tell her that, would that -- would that surprise you, or 
would you have expected him to consult with you about whether 
it was okay to go ahead and raise this? 
A 
So, as a general matter, yes, but -- and let me 
let me explain that. AUSAs on occasion, and because this is 
a high profile -- higher profile case -- a criminal chief may 
run an idea across opposing counsel and say, look, I don't 
have authorization. 
I don't know how the office will react, but it's 
certainly possible that X, Y, or Z may work out. And that's 
a very different conversation than, you know, the office will 
accept. 
And so, a lot of that really depends on how that 
conversation goes, and you know, certainly if he's 
representing my view, I would expect him to check on what my 
view is, if he's, as criminal chief, saying, this is 
something that I could support. I don't know how the office 
will react, that may -- you know, but I can run it up the 
flagpole, that might be a different type of conversation. 
Q 
Okay, and did you know Lilly Ann Sanchez? 
A 
I did. She was an AUSA in the office. 
Q 
And she left about a month after you came on board? 
A 
Was it that -- was it that quick? 
Q 
That's our information, yes. 
EFTA00009353

Page 126 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
Although she apparently remained a periodic 
present. 
A 
Hence, the wasn't that quick. 
Q 
Did you know that she'd been 
at major crimes? 
A 
I don't remember that. 
deputy 
Q 
All right. Did you -- what did -- what did you 
remember about her? And had you had any dealings with her 
after she left the office up to this point? 
A 
So, I remember that she was in the office, that she 
was a senior attorney. Whether within the management 
structure or not, I -- I didn't recollect until you just 
raised it, and that I can't swear to it, but it rings a bell 
that she was in major crimes, and she was someone that you 
would see at bar functions that would --
Q 
Ma-hmm. 
A 
-- she -- she was active in the local bar, and I 
would see her on occasion at a bar function and say hello. 
Q 
All right. Did you encounter her in connection 
with a case, to your recollection, in the period before 
Epstein? 
A 
I'm hesitating not to avoid, but I'm running 
through my --
Q 
Ma-hmm. 
EFTA00009354

Page 127 
A 
Not that I recall. 
Q 
What's your impression of her as a 
as a 
practitioner? 
A 
She did -- she did quite well after she left the 
office. She set up -- I think she set up her own practice. 
Q 
At the time -- at this time, she was with something 
called Fowler White Burnett. 
A 
Okay, so --
Q 
She --
A 
-- she went to Fowler White. 
Q 
-- subsequently --
A 
She subsequently set up her own practice, and I 
thought she's done well for herself. 
Q 
Okay. Were you aware that 
had a close 
personal relationship with Lilly Ann Sanchez, both because 
they had worked together as chief and deputy chief --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- in major crimes, but also because they'd had a 
dating relationship sometime prior? 
A 
I don't recall them having dated, but I don't 
Q 
Do you recall knowing that they had dated in the 
past? 
A 
I don't recall knowing that, and in all candor, 
that's not the kind of thing I ask about. 
Q 
But in this case with her representation of 
EFTA00009355

Page 128 
somebody in a matter being ultimately supervised by... 
would you have expected= to disclose to you that 
he'd had a prior romantic relationship with Lilly Ann 
Sanchez, a member of Epstein's defense team, if only to 
address a potential appearance of impropriety or conflict of 
interest? 
A 
I think some of that might have depended on how 
recently. Was it ten years ago? Was it two years ago? If 
they were in the supervisory chain that this happened, that 
could raise other -- other issues. So, if to the extent --
so, for example, 
disclosed to me a potential conflict --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- to the extent that these arise, if there is a 
potential conflict, I'd like to know. I was aware of 
conflict. I said, keep going. 
Q 
And in fact, 
, you're talking about the 
Herman --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- connection, the prior --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- short lived law firm connection. Are you aware 
that 
in fact vetted that through 
your 
ethics person? 
A 
I am -- I don't recall that independently, but I 
recall knowing about it. He may have told me he vetted it 
EFTA00009356

Page 129 
through 
IIIIII is highly respected in the office, 
and --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- that would be the appropriate --
Q 
So, are you also aware that 
raised, 
again with 
III, the potential, again, appearance of a 
conflict of interest, or appearance of impropriety, because 
of his supervision of the Epstein case, and his concurrent 
close friendship with Mike Tein, who was an attorney who was 
representing Epstein, as well as Guy Lewis, former U.S. 
Attorney? 
A 
So, I was not aware of that. 
Q 
You were not aware of it, but -- but I guess what 
I'm -- what I'm noting is that both 
and 
perceived appearance issues, and went through the process 
that's provided for them to get the blessing to go ahead and 
proceed with the case by the -- the blessing by the ethics 
expert --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- but 
apparently did not in this case 
vis a vis Lilly Ann Sanchez. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Does that surprise you, or disappoint you, or 
perplex you, or do you care? 
A 
I would want to know more. 
EFTA00009357

Page 130 
Q 
Right. 
A 
But certainly it would provide -- I would want to 
know more before saying I'm disappointed, but again, was it 
ten years ago? Was it two years ago? What's the 
continuing -- there are a lot of facts, but certainly it --
that's the kind of -- it's the kind of discussion one would 
typically have with 
Q 
And in this case, what we're talking about is an 
informal conversation, or informal discussion, to use 
own term, with Sanchez as opposed to any of the 
other attorneys in Epstein's team about a particular 
resolution that we're going to spend all afternoon talking 
about, because it has some problematic aspects. Okay? So, 
you see why we're --
A 
I get it. No, I get it. 
Q 
Okay. 
BY MR. 
Q 
So, before we break, I'm -- should he have talked 
about this potential resolution with the line assistant 
before actually making it? 
A 
In a typical case, yes. So, in a typical case, I 
fostered communication. I would -- I would come -- I'd get 
involved in cases, but we'd want to know what the line 
assistant thinks, and they can agree or disagree, but we'd 
want -- we'd want input. 
EFTA00009358

BY MS. 
Q 
What do you make of this really acid tone between 
and IIIII? Between 
and 
in this Exhibit 3 
exchange? I mean, 
is really -- as I read it, it's 
pretty strong. 
A 
I -- I can't -- I -- I'm not sure what to make of 
it. 
Q 
All right. All right. There are a couple of --
let's -- could we go off the record for a split second? 
Off the record.) 
BY MS. 
Q 
Okay, back on the record. Going back to Exhibit 
No. 3, there are a few things here that we think are 
important to raise with you, albeit you not having seen this 
at the time. 
says that the -- she complains 
about this soft -- that's my term -- plea offer that 
extended to Epstein through Lilly Ann Sanchez. She says that 
such an offer is completely unacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the 
victims, and me, meaning 
. Did you have an 
understanding of what the FBI's position about prosecuting 
this case was? 
A 
My recollection of interaction with the FBI is with 
who was the SAC, and as I recall, he supported 
the eventual direction of this case. 
EFTA00009359

Page 132 
Q 
Is he the individual who you identify I believe in 
actually your -- your attorney's written response as the SAC 
who called you to congratulate you about the --
A 
He is. 
Q 
-- the case? About the result? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And was SAC 
-- in that same written 
response from your attorney, there's a mention that he was 
present at many meetings on this case? 
A 
He was present at, at least some, and in part that 
was at my request, because this was a high enough profile 
case that I wanted to bring him into this. 
Q 
So, the -- we know he was present at the December 
14, 2007 meeting, right? 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
With Ken Starr and company. He is not present 
at -- to -- according to our investigation, at any other case 
with defense counsel. Others are. His ASAC, 
is 
present. 
A 
So, recollections aren't nearly as good as 
documents. I don't recall the December meeting. I would 
have said that he was present at the September meeting, but 
it may be that I am, because this was so long ago, mixing the 
two. 
Q 
Okay. 
EFTA00009360

Page 133 
A 
Because I thought he would have come to the 
September meeting. 
Q 
No, according to all the information we have, just 
so you know --
A 
Right. 
Q 
was there as ASAC, but not --
actually, I'm not sure she was at the -- at any rate, she 
was -- she was --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- he was present, 
was present at the 
December meeting only. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
So, just so --
A 
Fair. 
Q 
Okay. Would he have been present at meetings other 
than with defense counsel meetings about this case? 
A 
Typically no. Typically, he and I would have 
talked on the phone or had discussion, and I know that he was 
aware of the matter. 
Q 
so --
A 
I recall his being aware of the matter, and 
generally positive as to the direction that we were going. 
Q 
By the direction or the eventual outcome? 
A 
The eventual outcome. 
Q 
All right. So, what about the prosecution? Do you 
EFTA00009361

Page 134 
know what the FBI's view was about the prosecution? 
A 
I can't speak to the timeline. I would have -- and 
I'm contradicting the documents here, but I would have -- if 
you had asked me, said that he was present at the September 
meeting, and was aware of the terms that were presented at 
the September meeting. Clearly, I'm --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- my recollection is incorrect, and I take that 
for what it is. 
Q 
Just to finish on -- with this point though, my 
question was an understanding of the FBI's position of the 
case, not the ultimate disposition. In other words, as of --
as of the date of Exhibit 3, there was no deal on the table. 
So, the question is, what was the FBI's view about the case? 
A 
So -- so, I -- I'm not trying to be difficult. At 
some point, when you say view, the FBI, to my recollection, 
thought that what Mr. Epstein did was sordid and disgusting 
and that we should proceed. How we proceeded, I don't recall 
having -- hearing specific views as to the how as opposed to 
the, we should. 
Q 
All right. Let's -- thank you. Let's take a 
break, 45 minutes. Thank you. 
(Off the record.) 
BY MS. 
Q 
All right. We're going to go back on the record. 
EFTA00009362

Page 135 
We're beginning after the break at 1:30 in the afternoon. 
Thank you. 
A 
Before get started --
Q 
Yes. 
A 
-- you referenced an e-mail from 
that wasn't 
part of the packet. 
Q 
Correct. 
A 
Is that something that I could see and review, or 
is there discomfort on that? 
Q 
Yes. No, I am not -- as long as we make it on the 
record. Do you -- do you need to do it now, or can we do it 
during the next break? 
A 
It depends how long -- how long is it? It would 
just take --
Q 
One page. 
A 
-- a minute, if you don't mind. 
Q 
Do you want to go off the record while Mr. 
Acosta --
(Off the record.) 
BY MS. 
Q 
All right. On the record again. For the record, 
Mr. Acosta has just reviewed and e-mail from-
to 
, and 
dated July 18, 2007 at 2:07 p.m. It's one that I described 
to Mr. Acosta a moment -- this morning. Do you have any 
EFTA00009363

Page 136 
comments? 
A 
I don't. 
Q 
All right. Before we broke, we were -- I mentioned 
your statement about SAC
 having attended many 
meetings. That to be clear was a representation you made in 
your March 2007 letter to the Daily Beast, not the written 
response. 
Looking briefly at -- back at Exhibit 3 and 
-- you don't have to read it yourself. 
representation that in her view the plea offer 
was completely unacceptable to the victims. Do you -- do you 
believe that she was correct in her view that the victims' 
views should have been solicited before a plea offer was 
made? 
A 
So, I would have to think that was one through. 
There were concerns -- and I don't know about the timeline 
about communications with the victims. They're sort of laid 
out in the 
affidavit. So, whether or not victims' 
views were elicited is something I think was the focus of the 
trial team and not something that I was focused on at least 
at this time. 
Q 
But do you believe as a matter of sort of principle 
that the views of victims should be elicited before a plea 
offer --
A 
Right. 
EFTA00009364

Q 
-- is made? 
A 
So, as a general matter, yes. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
I think that the -- the reason I'm pushing back is 
because you're saying plea offer, and the CVRA does talk to 
plea offers as opposed to a situation where deferring 
prosecution in favor of a state is a very different thing 
than a plea offer, and at the time, that was not a, it must. 
That was a depending on the facts and circumstances, that's a 
judgment call. At least that's how the department, to my 
understanding, viewed it. 
And was it also your view that it would have, as a 
general matter, it's a better practice or better approach to 
talk to the victims before? 
A 
As a general practice, yes. 
Q 
All right. Do you think that would have been 
particularly important in this case where the proposal 
involved sending the case back to the state, which the 
victims were aware had already mishandled the case to begin 
with? 
A 
So, a few -- there are -- there are a few things in 
that question that I think are packed. Whether the victims 
were aware and were of the view, from my perspective and my 
recollection, were of the view that the state had mishandled 
the case, I can't speak to. 
EFTA00009365

Page 138 
Some of the victims were, to my recollection, 
exonerating him. There was concern that some of the victims 
were more on his side than on the prosecution's side. And 
so, that judgement call of which victims are notified and how 
much I think is something that really is a judgement call 
that needs to be done almost on a case by case basis by 
individuals that are aware of sort of the facts and 
circumstances surrounding each victim. 
In the general 
in a general case, you want to 
have fulsome communication. I can understand in cases where 
victims might be giving exonerating information, where -- or, 
there is restitution at stake, that could be different. 
Q 
And by the people involved, are you talking at 
the -- at the trial team level? 
A 
At the trial team level with whatever appropriate 
supervisors 
Q 
MM-hram. 
A 
-- are engaged in the victim notification issues. 
Q 
And in this case, that would not include you, is 
that correct? 
A 
That -- I don't recall cases where I got -- where I 
became part of the victim notification judgements. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Did you ever issue an instruction to the trial team 
that they should not consult with the victims before the NPA 
EFTA00009366

Page 139 
was signed? 
A 
So, not that I recall. I know that there's some 
instances where after the NPA was signed, I said, you know, 
I'm directing that we withhold notification for five days, or 
X period of time to work this out. 
But before the NPA was signed, I don't recall -- in 
all candor, I don't recall discussions about victim 
notification until after the NPA was signed. I don't know if 
there's e-mail traffic before the NPA was signed, but I don't 
recall victim notification issues until after the NPA was 
signed. 
Q 
Okay. 
BY MR. 
Q 
And I just -- one more question on this topic is 
that prior to -- we interviewed other people, obviously, in 
this --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
Q 
-- case, and we interviewed Ms. 
, and one 
of the things that she told us, she has a recall of a -- of a 
meeting with you present, Mr. 
, and Mr. 
, where 
this issue of victim notification was discussed in the 
timeframe of prior to the FBI, and at that meeting, she was 
specifically instructed that we are not going to talk about 
it with the victims. Do you recall that meeting? 
A 
I don't -- I don't recall. If that's her 
EFTA00009367

Page 140 
recollection, that's her recollection. I don't -- I don't 
recall that. I -- I recall knowing that there were issues 
around victim notification. I recall, particularly after the 
NPA was signed, I recall efforts, I believe, to notify as it 
was being signed -- to notify the victims of the upcoming 
state plea. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
And I recall discussions -- if not discussions --
let me not say discussions -- a general concern about the 
victim notification, what does that do? Because the victim 
is also a witness, and a --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- potential witness, and in some cases and adverse 
witness. And so, how does all that balance out? 
Q 
Okay. Well, we're going to drill down into 
those --
A 
Right. 
post-NPA issues later on. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Just now, focusing on --
A 
Right. 
pre-NPA, before it's signed, when the 
negotiations are going back and forth. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
You have memory of this topic coming up? 
EFTA00009368

Page 141 
A 
I don't recall discussing the victim notification 
issues. 
Q 
Okay, and what would your response be though to --
are you -- are you aware of the CVRA litigation that went on? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
From Judge Marra? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So, one of the issues that comes up in Judge 
Marra's decision is, he made a finding that the government 
violated the CVRA because they didn't inform -- consult with 
the victims --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- prior to signing the NPA, and there is a 
perception, or he -- from his opinion that the government did 
this -- failed to communicate that in order to eventually 
keep the victims in the dark and protect the resolution. Why 
is that an incorrect assumption? 
A 
And so -- so, I would say that 
sets out her 
reasoning in her affidavit. She talks about --
BY MS. 
Q 
Are you referring to the -- her 2017 affidavit? 
A 
Her 2017 affidavit. She talks about -- I believe 
she notified at least some victims, and it became an issue, 
and there's concern -- you know, you have this NPA. 
Whether -- whether or not that NPA will ultimately remain is 
EFTA00009369

Page 142 
I 
a very open question, because from our office's expectations, 
we expected him to plead shortly after that, and he did not. 
And so, are we going to trial or are we not is a 
very open question, and I think there is -- has to be 
discretion, where there is no legal requirement. There has 
to be discretion to judge how much you can tell the victims 
and when. 
BY MR. 
• 
Q 
Okay, just -- just one other point, and this is 
that -- we've reviewed --
-- Ms. 
declaration, and the 
notifications that she's referring to there, those 
discussions take place after the signing of the NPA. So, 
we're just talking about here still --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- just the pre-NPA --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- pre-signing of that. So, does that change your 
answer at all? 
A 
Again, I don't -- I don't recall the victim 
notification being issued before the NPA. I recall a lot of 
discussions afterwards. I don't recall. That doesn't mean 
they didn't happen. That just means I don't recall them. 
Q 
Was there any concern with you or among any of the 
EFTA00009370

Page 143 
other people involved in this negotiation phase that if the 
victims were to find out that we are negotiating this NPA 
that it will blow up the NPA, that it will cause us trouble 
in some way? 
A 
Our -- my focus before the NPA was signed was, here 
are -- here are these terms. You know, and then for the 
team, go negotiate this. And so, from my perspective, it was 
much more of a, what are the terms, than the victim 
notification issues around that. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Right, but just to follow up 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- did you hear any discussion amongst the people 
that you were dealing with --
A 
Q 
-- that they were afraid that the victims might 
raise such objections, or go to the press that this whole 
thing would be -- you know, come to a -- come to a halt? 
A 
So, I tried to think -- I don't recall -- I believe 
we notified the victims in advance of the state hearing so 
that they would be aware. We didn't notify them before we 
signed the NPA to my recollection, but we certainly notified 
them of the state hearing. And so, I was aware generally of 
what was being done, but the NPA and what we -- you know, the 
NPA was the focus, not the victim notification --
EFTA00009371

MS. 
THE WITNESS: 
MS. 
Page 144 
: When --
-- part of that. 
: -- when you talk about -- go ahead. 
MR. 
: 
We -- we're going to get into the 
plea --
THE WITNESS: Right. 
MR. 
: -- and what we're --
MS. 
: All right. 
THE WITNESS: Right. 
MR. 
: -- a little bit later on. 
THE WITNESS: Right. 
BY MR. 
Q 
Just one -- can I just direct you to --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- document number 15? 
MS. 
: Exhibit 15? 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
BY MR. 
Q 
Okay. So, do you -- that was an e-mail that is 
from Ms. 
to 
, then forwarded to you? 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Do you see the reference in there where she 
mentions that she spoke to 
, or 
reminded her -- where is it? 
MS. 
: It's in the second paragraph --
EFTA00009372

Page 145 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, no, I --
MS. S 
: 
in the middle. 
THE WITNESS: I see it. 
MR. 
: The middle --
THE WITNESS: It's highlighted. 
BY MR. 
Q 
Could you just read that? The agents and I have 
not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which 
as i 
politely reminded me, is required under the law. Do 
you -- do you -- do you recall that e-mail? 
A 
I -- again, I don't recall this specific e-mail. 
and 
how you interact with -- with victims who are also potential 
witnesses, and I was aware -- I support what the office did. 
I'm not backing away from it. 
I'm just saying I can't, 12 years later, 
reconstruct what the thought process was other than there was 
no legal obligation. It was a discretionary issue, and this 
is how the discretion was exercised. 
Q 
But did -- do you remember -- so, there's two 
things. Any -- do you remember any discussions coming up 
My recollection is a view that there is no requirement to 
notify, because it's not a plea, it's deferring in favor of a 
state prosecution. 
And therefore, it becomes a discretionary issue, 
what notification is appropriate is really a function of 
EFTA00009373

Page 146 
about the topic of what we have to do as far as notification 
in the pre-NPA negotiations? 
A 
I -- again, I really don't. I know there was a lot 
of discussion after the NPA. I don't recall pre-NPA 
discussions on this. 
Q 
Last question on this. 
A 
Sure. 
MS. 
: By him. 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
BY MR. 
Q 
You're getting at least forwarded to you an e-mail 
from the trial attorney in the case showing that she is 
concerned about the notification issue, and she's raising at 
least the -- referencing the head of --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- CEOS about this issue. Did this ring any bells 
to you? Raise any --
A 
So, from this, I would infer that a discussion was 
had as to what the obligations had -- were, and whether we 
had to or not, because -- so, I think it's fair to infer she 
is, you know, e-mailing my first assistant. 
I don't know what the attachment here -- oh, the 
attachment here is the term sheet, so to speak, and my first 
assistant is forwarding it to me in large part so that I get 
the attachment, and I think from here, it's fair to infer 
EFTA00009374

Page 147 
that -- that some conversation or discussion was had. I 
don't remember the conversation or discussion. 
My focus was on the terms. I'm willing to accept 
that the conversation was had. My recollection of the 
obligations under the CVRA is that they did not attach, 
because this was not an indictment, it was not a plea, and 
that it was entirely discretionary how we proceeded, and 
therefore how you proceed is a function of, should you notify 
victims? 
Yes, but there are concerns because they're also 
witnesses. There are concerns because we are going out of 
our way to provide for restitution, and all of that played 
into a complex calculus. 
Q 
That was it. 
BY MS. 
Q 
So, you said that there was a view that there's no 
requirement to notify the victims. Who was that view coming 
from? 
A 
I can't -- I can't speak to person A, B, or C. 
can say that if -- if the office thought there was a legal 
obligation, there are too many professionals involved in this 
that if they thought there was a legal obligation to notify, 
they would have done so. 
At some point in this process, whether it was pre 
or post, I know that there was some explicit consideration of 
EFTA00009375

Page 148 
what are the obligations, and some discussion of, this is not 
the obligations don't attach until indictment, and therefore, 
this is a discretionary matter. 
Whether that happened in September or in August or 
October, I can't speak to. But I know that that was -- that 
was talked about, and I think later on in the record, there's 
an e-mail from our appellate chief in a different case that 
highlights, well, there is this Texas case that just ruled 
the other way. So, clearly, it's an issue that had been 
talked about, and I recall it being talked about. I just 
can't tell you the when, or the with who. 
Q 
And would there have been any -- you've spoken on 
one concern --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- concerning impeachment of the victims regarding 
their --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- financial aspect of the NPA. Would there have 
been any downside to consulting with the victims concerning, 
hey, the U.S. Attorney's Office is considering a resolution 
short of a plea that involves charges in state court. How do 
you feel about that, victims? 
A 
So, there may not have been a downside. It's 
difficult to recreate. My understanding, going back 12 
years, was that the victims would be aware of what was 
EFTA00009376

Page 149 
happening in the state court and have an opportunity to speak 
up at the state court hearing. 
Q 
And where does that -- where does this come from? 
A 
So, my understanding is that when he was going to 
go into state court that they would have been notified that 
that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court 
sentence would also mean that the federal government was not 
proceeding. 
Q 
But again, in terms of --
A 
Before -- your point is before it was signed. 
Q 
Correct, so that they could have input --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- into trying, perhaps, if they wanted to, to 
persuade you that that --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was not a good idea. 
A 
It may have -- it may have been a -- look, looking 
back on it, it may have been a very good idea. I can't speak 
to what the thought process was then, other than it was 
discretionary and it was not legally required. 
Q 
But at least as we sit here today, you cannot 
recall a particular problem that somebody brought up to you 
and said, we should not consult because of this problem? 
A 
I don't recall that, and clearly, given the way 
it's played out, it may have been much better if we had. 
EFTA00009377

Page 150 
BY MS. 
Q 
In the last 15 or --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- 20 minutes, you've several times referred to 
discussions and we. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
I want to make it clear that so far, the people who 
were involved in this case, the Epstein case in your shop 
were you, 
, and 
If -- is 
there anyone else who was involved in those discussions other 
than those five? 
A 
Not to my recollection at this phase. 
Q 
Okay. Okay. I just want to make sure --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- we understand who you --
lE 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- who is encompassed --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- in that general discussion --
2C 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- of -- of the matter. Okay. So, on July 26, so, 
we're now a month after that -- that presentation by the 
defense counsel to the team, including 
and 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
There was a meeting in Miami, and it was, again, 
EFTA00009378

Page 151 
among 
by telephone, 
, as well as the two case agents --
A 
Mm-hmm. 
and 
. Did you 
know them, by the way? 
A 
I did not, not to my recollection. 
Q 
Okay, and also their supervisor, 
? Did 
you know 
A 
Somewhat. 
Q 
All right, and they were all in West Palm, of 
course. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
And then ASAC 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Do you recall her? 
A 
Somewhat. 
Q 
All right. They arrived -- or, at least, the trial 
team -- the investigative team arrived ostensibly to discuss 
the case. It turned out to be a very brief meeting 
essentially consisting of 
coming in, announcing 
that you had decided on a two year state resolution, and then 
essentially leaving without 
that is, 
left the 
meeting without discussion. 
This was -- this has been described to us as 
stunning to the investigative team. They had no idea this 
EFTA00009379

Page 152 
was coming. This was -- they were completely blindsided. 
The question is, were you aware that 
was going 
to announce that you had decided on this resolution? 
A 
So, I don't recall that, but I had decided and 
S 
endorsed this resolution at some point. And so, the fact 
that I don't recall doesn't mean that -- I wasn't at the 
meeting, I don't recall. But I clearly had endorsed this 
resolution, and so --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- his announcement would have been consistent with 
my decision. 
Q 
And again, that decision was reached without 
consultation and discussion with -- and input from the line 
AUSA. Does that trouble you? 
A 
Sitting here today, I wouldn't have said that there 
was no input from the AUSA. So, to the extent that she felt 
there was no consultation or input, that would. From my 
perspective, trying to recreate things from 12 years ago, 
there had been discussions and consultations, and she had 
spoken with 
and 
and -- and it would have been my 
guess that views were known and articulated, and there was 
good communication back and forth. 
Q 
But again, that's your expectation of your people, 
is that correct? 
A 
Correct. 
EFTA00009380

Page 153 
Q 
Okay. So -- and also, from our interviews, it --
there's -- our -- it's our understanding that you popped your 
head into that meeting and said hello to the folks --
A 
Okay. 
Q 
-- gathered. Do you have any --
A 
Again, I --
Q 
-- recollection of that? 
A 
-- I don't remember the meeting. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
I may have -- I may have done that. 
Q 
And it's not --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- completely uncharacteristic of you? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
It's not. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
No, because that was an internal meeting. That 
wasn't --
Q 
Right, or -- correct, as opposed to the --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- scenario we were discussing this morning. Ail 
right, this deal, and we're not talking about 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the term sheet yet, two major prongs me want to 
EFTA00009381

Page 154 
talk about. One -- the first one is forgoing federal 
prosecution, right? Going for a state only disposition, and 
I talked to you this morning about the five -- sort of the 
five ways a case could proceed when it comes from the state. 
You can either decline it and give it back to the state. You 
can go ahead and indict, but the guy -- let the defendant or 
defendants go to trial, or plead to the indictment. You can 
indict, negotiate a deal, although you talked about some of 
the issues there, and you can also file a complaint and 
negotiate pre-indictment, or negotiate something. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
So, why was it that all of those other options were 
rejected, and the state only deal was settled on? 
A 
So, let me -- let me back up a minute, because I 
think it was a little more -- a little more fluid. The way 
the matter came to the office was, the state wasn't doing 
enough. 
Alternatively, we could look at a pre-indictment 
resolution, and at various points, the office went back and 
forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a 
It didn't provide for prison time. It didn't 
provide for registration, and then you had the restitution 
issue. There were legal issues, which I'm sure we'll talk 
about. There were witness issues. And -- and we could go to 
trial, potentially, and we may or may not prevail. 
EFTA00009382

Page 155 
state pre-indictment resolution. I think you showed me an 
exhibit where
 said a 371 with the rule 11. There was 
some discussion of other statutes at some point. I don't 
recall the timeline. 
And so ultimately, the focus was as an initial 
matter, what -- how do we get this to resolution with some 
flexibility for state versus federal? I think -- not I 
think. I -- you know, there was a preference for deferring 
to the state. 
Q 
Where does that come from? What --
A 
In part because the legal issues are to some exter. 
also present in a federal resolution, because that then 
becomes a precedent for other similarly situated cases. 
Q 
Did you want to avoid a precedent? 
A 
So, should we talk about the legal issues? Because 
we 
we say we keep coming back to the legal issues, but --
Q 
All right. Talk about the legal issues. 
A 
So -- so, when I was at civil rights, one of the 
areas of responsibility that I had was trafficking. I was 
very supportive. We set up some of the first human 
trafficking task forces. I thought civil rights really 
became aggressive. I think III 
was one of the point 
people. 
We brought in 
to be a point person on 
human trafficking. One of the background issues that -- that 
EFTA00009383

Page 156 
informed the time and all those prosecutions and also the 
development of the trafficking law was, what is the 
distinction between trafficking and solicitation, and how --
and what is the distinction between a truly federal case and 
a local case? 
Because there was a lot of concern at the time 
about federalizing something that is traditionally local. 
Now, that was 12 years ago, and I think that those concerns 
are no longer in play today nearly -- and certainly not to 
the extent that they were 12 years ago. 
Q 
This was the state of play at the time you were the 
AAG for --
A 
At the AAG and afterwards as I was U.S. Attorney to 
some extent, there was a lot of discussions about 
federalizing state issues generally, and certainly in the 
legislative issues that went back and forth, that was -- that 
was a consideration. 
Q 
Wasn't that trend very swift as of -- was it '06 
when the Adam Walsh Act was enacted? 
A 
So -- so, sure. I think we're trending in a 
certain direction. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And I think that trend has continued and 
accelerated, but these were very -- these were valid, in my 
opinion, considerations at the time, and one question to be 
EFTA00009384

Page 157 
considered is, how would a court look at this -- because 
different judges may look at these statutes differently. And 
how would a court consider federal nexus issues? 
And so, that was, to my mind, an important 
consideration, because this was at the time to some extent 
uncharted territory, and while we might prevail, and probably 
would prevail, we may not have, and how is that weighed 
against a certain plea with registration that would make sure 
that the public knew that this person was a sex offender? 
Q 
Okay, a couple of things. One, did you engage in 
that -- that discussion, based on your experience, with 
? Did -- did you -- did you engage in that kind of 
conversation? 
A 
I don't recall who I may have talked to, but this 
was -- when -- when -- you will see in the record reference 
to legal issues. This -- these were the legal issues, at 
least to my mind, that that's referring to. 
Q 
But did you sit -- I mean, not to be silly about 
it, but --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- did you sit in your office and ponder them, or 
did you in the context of --
A 
We would have -- we would have discussed them. 
Q 
All right, we, being you, and --
A 
I and -- whether it's 
or 
or 
EFTA00009385

Page 158 
wouldn't have sat and pondered them on my own, but we would 
have had some level of discussion about these. 
So, conversely, is it your understanding that --
that those three guys understood from you at least your 
perspective on these legal issues? 
A 
I -- let me -- let me push back. Those -- those 
three professionals, because they are --
Q 
Oh --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
I'm sorry. 
A 
Well, in this context, it's --
Q 
Colleagues, yes. 
A 
Yeah. Yeah. So, there were two large buckets of 
issues. One was the witness issues, and on those, I would 
have deferred more to folks that are experienced trial 
prosecutors. The other one are these legal issues. 
Q 
Mis-hmm, 
A 
And you see it with the fed -- with the reference 
at the very beginning to the federal nexus --
Q 
Mit-hmm. 
A 
-- and you see it throughout where -- these were 
discussions that we had, and from the very beginning, what is 
the federal nexus, and how do we make it clear that we are 
not stepping on something that is a purely local matter, 
because we don't want bad precedent for the sake of the 
EFTA00009386

Page 159 
larger human trafficking issue. 
Q 
Did you have those conversations with your three 
subordinate colleagues in this case? 
A 
I would have had those conversations with those 
colleagues. Whether it was with all three, or with two, I 
can't recall, but I would have had those conversations. 
Q 
And do you recall whether anyone -- anyone among 
them pushed back as, for example, 
indicated 
his view of some of those issues? 
A 
So -- so, I don't recall specific pushback. I 
can 
I can say where we concluded, which is there 
we are 
comfortable enough with the law to believe that we are 
that if we need to go to court, we can do so ethically, and 
we have a good chance of winning. Because if we could not go 
forward --
Q 
Of course. 
A 
Then -- then we just can't go forward, right? No 
matter what outcome you want. Was it a slam dunk? Was there 
some legal risk? Yes, there was some legal risk. 
Q 
Mr. Acosta, you use the term a roll of the dice in 
your press conference. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
In -- there's a different -- I mean, at one end, 
you have a slam dunk. I would submit that no criminal 
prosecution --
EFTA00009387

Page 160 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- is a slam dunk. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
Likewise, I would ask you to comment on whether any 
prosecution is really a roll of the dice, given that a 
prosecuting authority, in this case, the U.S. Attorney's 
Office, will have always done investigation, persuaded at 
least a majority of grand jurors to -- that they -- that 
there is sufficient proof to bring an indictment --
A 
Right. 
Q 
and so on. Do you -- do you -- would you still 
hang your hat on a roll of the dice hook? 
A 
So, I don't know if I would use that exact phrase. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
But let me -- let me just say, because you --
prodding grand jurors. From our perspective, sitting in the 
office in 2006 and 2007, this is a case that someone comes to 
you and says, this has been presented, we have no reason to 
believe the state attorney acted -- we're not happy with what 
they did, but we have no reason to believe that there was 
funny business. 
Q 
Misconduct? 
A 
Misconduct. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
And let's assume that there is no misconduct, 
EFTA00009388

Page 161 
because you don't want to assume that again still. So, the 
state attorney took this, reviewed it, presented it to a 
grand jury, and the grand jury came out with this kind of 
recommendation. That at least is indicative of some -- some 
other authority looking at this and making a judgement as to 
what it looks like. 
Q 
Are you aware that at least at the investigative 
and line assistant level, there was -- they had understanding 
and reason to believe that the state prosecutors had put in 
witnesses into their grand jury and set about impeaching 
them? I'm not --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- suggesting that this is misconduct, but it's a 
way of approaching evidence before a grand jury, and if they 
did that, it would be perhaps charitably for the purpose of 
making it abundantly clear to the grand jurors how the 
witness would fair --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- or not fair under aggressive cross-examination 
at a trial and so on. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
So, were you aware of that at the time? 
A 
I was not. 
Q 
You were not. 
A 
Right. 
EFTA00009389

Page 162 
Q 
You were not aware that that was an actual concern 
and understanding --
A 
That -- that there was --
Q 
-- by your team? 
A 
That there was a concern that they basically --
Tanked the case. 
A 
Tanked. 
Q 
Yes. 
A 
So, there was -- I --
Q 
You -- I just --
A 
Q 
You didn't know that? 
A 
I was aware of a concern about how the state 
attorney -- how aggressive they were. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
There's a -- there's a distance between how 
aggressive they were versus tanking a case. 
Q 
Right, but I am telling you the concern by your 
people at the ground level 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- was the latter. 
A 
Understood. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
Aware of lack of aggression, tanking the case, very 
specifically, I mean, there might have been, hey, you know, 
EFTA00009390

Page 16 -:
is there -- this looks really odd, but you've given a level 
of granularity as to highly unusual conduct. So, my point, 
there is at least a perspective coming out of the state. 
There are legal concerns. 
We believed -- at the end of the day, I thought we 
would prevail, but they're valid, and then you overlay that 
with witness concerns, and concerns as to how juries, which 
were different in 2006 on these issues. 
Q 
What do you base that on, by the way? 
A 
It's --
Q 
Because you're not a trial attorney anymore. 
A 
So, experience with how juries in South Florida 
looked at these matters, and with how South Florida looked a-. 
the project Safe Neighborhood -- I'm sorry, --
It's childhood. 
A 
Project Safe Childhood run initiative generally, 
and so there had been -- there had been prior instances where 
we had talked about this, and we had gotten some pushback. 
Q 
From --
A 
From within the office, from within the FBI. 
Q 
On what? 
A 
On -- on sort of sex cases more generally. 
Q 
And pushback in what regard? 
A 
Where should we put our resources? And so, there 
was -- there was just a general -- just general pushback. 
EFTA00009391

Page 164 
Q 
Okay, but there are a couple things there. One is, 
the juries -- the juries -- the petite juries, and 
which --
A 
Right. 
-- you -- I'd still like the answer on. 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
And then the other is the FBI being loath to muck 
around with these cases that they were not --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- yet --
A 
So --
Q 
-- engaged with. 
A 
So, let's -- let's take them one at a time, you 
know, and -- and in all candor, I think we're looking at this 
through a 2019 lens. You know, at the time, and I've said 
this in different forms, but you know, Weinstein was known 
and about, and actions weren't taken, and Bill Cosby was 
known about. And they're each -- go with me. They're each 
different --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- but I do think the public looked at these cases 
differently in 2006, and there are at least some 
individuals -- I'm not saying it was the right view -- but 
there are at least some individuals who would have looked and 
said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking case. 
EFTA00009392

Page 165 
Q 
All right. Who in your office 
who in the U.S. 
Attorney's Office ever said that? 
A 
So, this was -- this came up in the context of, how 
would the victims do in court? And it wasn't just, you know, 
how will they be impeached, but how will jurors look at the 
fact patterns around this generally? 
Q 
And who was -- who was talking --
A 
I can't --
Q 
about that? 
A 
I can't say. I know that it was discussed. I 
can't say A, B, C, or D. I 
Q 
Well, it wouldn't have been D, because it would --
D would be 
, and I think you would agree with 
me that she would not --
A 
I would agree --
Q 
-- concede that. 
A 
I would agree with you. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
With that, but my point is that when we're 
talking -- so, when you're looking at victims in court today, 
I think it's fair to say that the way we approach -- there's 
been -- you know, there's been a lot of changes in victim 
shaming, and the degree to which all of that is permitted. 
The degree to which I think the public understands 
that -- that girls, minor females, may be scared and may 
EFTA00009393

Page 166 
testify differently. And I'm suggesting that it's important 
to sort of think back to 2006 and understand that these 
issues may have been viewed differently. 
Q 
You -- you're -- you have not -- since leaving the 
U.S. Attorney's Office -- been engaged in the investigation 
and prosecution or handling in any respect of child sex 
crimes, is that correct? 
A 
That is correct. 
Q 
So, on what do you base this -- is it -- is it a --
your cultural observation? Your perspective on the evolution 
of popular culture, not in a derogatory way, that leads you 
to that assessment? 
A 
So, on a few -- certainly the law has changed, and 
the law has become much more aggressive. So, for example, I 
believe the law on proof of age has changed where proof of 
age is no longer required. 
Q 
The law has, but the case law even at this time was 
already --
A 
What was --
Q 
-- reasonably clear on that. 
A 
Was reasonably clear, and certainly moving in that 
direction. 
Q 
Correct. Wouldn't you have wanted to be at the 
forefront of this? 
A 
So, I believe I was at the forefront of trafficking 
EFTA00009394

Page 167 
issues, and I think if you were to look at my civil rights 
record, I really was at the forefront of trafficking issues. 
Q 
Even the U.S. Attorney's Office had a very robust, 
as we discern it now, a very robust initiative. It maybe 
wasn't a formal initiative, but commitment to prosecute these 
cases. 
A 
Correct, and -- and I fully supported that. All 
the more reason why, if there is an issue, and there is a 
potential for some judge, rightly or wrongly, whether I agree 
or not -- because you can't always predict -- even though you 
think you'll prevail, you can't always predict where holdings 
go. To --
Q 
Are you talking about on appeal? 
A 
On appeal or in trial to 
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- to issue a negative precedent on travel for 
purpose of, or on federal nexus, and if you think back at the 
time, on appear, there were -- there's a lot of case law on 
commerce clause and federal nexus. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And so, I think that that is an important and valid 
factor that goes into the decision making that assesses the 
risk of trial, not just from the -- this -- you know, how the 
victims will testify in this particular case, but also what 
this means to the greater -- to the greater effort. 
EFTA00009395

Page 168 
Q 
I understand that completely. What I -- what I am 
not hearing is where a voice other than you and your team in 
this case was being heard, like 
Did --
did you --
A 
And --
Q 
-- talk to him about these issues? Because --
A 
Not --
Q 
-- CEOS --
A 
Not to --
Q 
-- was at the forefront of --
A 
Not to my recollection. 
Q 
All right. Wouldn't --
MR. TODD: Let 
finish her questions. 
THE WITNESS: Okay. Sorry. Sorry. 
MS. 
: We're all --
THE WITNESS: I apologize. 
MS. 
: We're on a mutual role here. 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
BY MS. 
Q 
But wouldn't -- if you'd had those concerns, 
perfectly well founded, why not reach out and engage with 
CEOS and see what their assessment was about the 
vulnerability that this case might expose your office to? 
A 
So, I can't reconstruct that 12 years later. You 
know, one interesting question is would CEOS have come to 
EFTA00009396

Page 169 
mind versus civil rights crim, because coming from civil 
rights crim, I -- you know, my primary trafficking contacts 
would have been --
Q 
Did you pick up the phone and --
A 
Not --
Q 
-- call them? 
A 
Not to my recollection. 
Q 
So, I guess what I'm -- what I'm getting at is you, 
based on substantial experience and a commitment to these 
cases in your office -- the U.S. Attorney's Office -- had 
formed your own analytical analysis -- your own analysis 
legally. 
You've told us you've discussed this or made those 
issues and concerns known to the people who were below you, 
at least immediately below you, and that it -- that's where 
it sort of rested. There was not an effort to go out and 
enhance or add to your understanding of the case, and legal 
issues. 
A 
So, to my recollection, I don't recall, and it's --
we'll get into perhaps -- you know, I -- from my impression, 
I actually thought I was being more aggressive than main 
justice would feel comfortable with, and --
Q 
More aggressive in what respect? 
A 
In my interpretation and how comfortable I was 
going forward than main justice, and we can get into that, 
EFTA00009397

Page 170 
but I thought I was being more aggressive, not less, and so I 
had these concerns. I did not vet them at main justice. 
Q 
Okay. When you said more -- more aggressive, are 
you talking about the fact that you crafted this state 
disposition, or that you were more forward leaning on the 
potential of prosecuting Epstein federally? 
A 
More forward leaning. 
Q 
And yet you didn't. You didn't -- you didn't lean 
sufficiently far forward to actually pull the trigger and 
have an indictment returned. 
A 
So, I would push back on that, and that from my 
perspective, we were leaning forward, because we did 
prosecute him by deferring to the state, and ensuring that at 
the state --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- he had a sentence that he -- where he went to 
jail. 
Q 
All right. Okay. I want to sort of move on. I 
want to ask you a question about 11C1C, please, that you 
mentioned earlier. 
A 
Okay. 
Q 
And sort of alluded to here, when we --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- talked about judges, and we talked about 
dismissing charges from an indictment. Was your -- what was 
EFTA00009398

Page 171 
your position as U.S. Attorney with regard to the binding 
pleas in an 11C1C plea agreement? 
A 
We used them very rarely. 
Q 
But why? 
A 
As a typical matter, judges did not like them. 
Q 
And -- and was that something that as U.S. 
Attorney, you engaged with the judges on, or was that simply 
a matter of seeing what they did with them? 
A 
It -- it happened before I got there. I suspect it 
continued to happen after I left. 
Q 
All right. Okay. That said, were there some 
occasions in which the office, if you recall at all, did do 
11C1C --
A 
There --
Q 
-- plea agreements? 
A 
-- may have been. I don't recall. 
Q 
Okay. All right. 
MR. 
: And 
, before we move onto --
MS. 
: Yes. 
MR. 
-- another issue, can I --
MS. 
: Yeah. I'm --
MR. 
: -- go back a second --
MS. 
-- still with federal -- I'm still 
on the federal prosecution, but go ahead. 
BY MR. 
EFTA00009399

=,=3e,
Q 
We had talked about the -- you talked about the 
state grand jury, and how their decision informed your 
decision, and you said, well, what state grand jury did with 
this. What was your understanding of what this was? Like, 
what exactly the state grand jury looked at? 
A 
So, so, let me back up. I said it was a factor 
that informed, not just --
Q 
I understand. 
A 
-- determined. So, my understanding is that at 
least some core amount of facts were presented, and I 
understand that since it was at the state, the FBI may have 
found additional witnesses, but when it was presented, the 
very reason the office took it in the first place was because 
it was presented to the state, and it went to a grand jury, 
and the recommendation from the grand jury was for a -- you 
know, a statute that would not require jail time, and that 
seemed wrong. 
But the very fact that it was presented to a grand 
jury certainly was one of several factors that we considered, 
because it at least indicated some level of how individual 
jurors may view this. 
Q 
Do you have any recollection that the state grand 
jury presented a single witness, who, as 
talked about 
earlier, that they impeached? 
2i 
have -- I have read that it was a single witness. 
EFTA00009400

Page 173 
Since then, I don't have an independent recollection of that. 
Q 
Okay. 
BY MS. 
Q 
And were you -- how familiar were you with Florida 
state criminal procedure? 
Florida bar. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
Correct. So, really any knowledge you had would 
have sort of been picked up? 
A 
I should -- I should point out that a number of 
AUSAs in Florida are not a member of the Florida bar, so 
that's not unusual. 
Q 
Oh, okay. No -- I'm not -- I'm not --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- suggesting --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- otherwise. 
A 
And in federal employment, you can move from 
A 
It depends what -- what area. 
Q 
Well, you never practiced there, right? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
I forget what law school you went to. 
A 
Not Florida. 
Q 
Not in Florida, and you were not a member of the 
Q 
Right. 
EFTA00009401

Page 174 
A 
Yeah. So, I had been U.S. Attorney for quite a 
while, and then I -- you know, I think we would have been 
interacting with the state system sufficiently, and if there 
was something that I had questions on, I could certainly ask. 
Q 
Were you aware that in the Florida system, grand 
juries ware not required to be used to bring federal criminal 
charges except in capital cases? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay, so even bringing a case to a grand jury was 
an -- in a non-capital context, was somewhat unusual? 
A 
An indication that there were some concerns or 
something, so the state attorney, presenting it in the best 
possible light, is looking to test the case. 
Q 
All right, and without getting into any substance, 
did you at any point become aware of the kind of reaction 
that the line AUSA, 
, was getting from the 
federal grand jurors to whom she was presenting? 
A 
I did not. 
Q 
All right. Another aspect of concern that I think 
you mentioned in your press conference was the concern about 
labelling or putting the girls -- the girls -- the victims in 
a position where they would be labelled as prostitutes, 
right? Do you recall --
A 
I'm not sure --
Q 
-- mentioning that? 
EFTA00009402

Page 175 
A 
-- I phrased it that way, but I -- I take -- I take 
your --
Q 
We'll defer to the record. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
But -- but you did -- you did express concern, and 
our understanding is there was some expression of concern in 
the U.S. Attorney's Office among the folks about the victims 
having to self-identify, or --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- admit that they were sort of prostitutes. The 
disposition that was reached in the state -- and that -- and 
that -- avoiding that was something to be desired --
A 
Yes. 
Q 
-- right? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
The charge to which Epstein was ultimately require 
to plead guilty did just that. It was a solicitation to 
prostitution of minors. Was that -- did that factor in at 
all as a -- as a -- as an issue of -- that -- that was not 
being addressed at all --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- by the state disposition? 
A 
So, I -- I was aware of and signed off on this 
three point 
Q 
The term sheet? 
EFTA00009403

Page 176 
A 
-- it's in here somewhere -- term sheet. In terms 
of the negotiation over which state statute was used, and 
which victims, that is something that -- that -- to my 
understanding, was being handled by Ms. 
, and from 
my perspective, she would certainly have had sensitivity to 
that. 
Q 
And do you have any idea how that three -- those 
three counts or charges were reduced to simply one? 
A 
I do not. That would be a function of the course 
of the negotiations. 
Q 
Why was -- why wasn't any reasoning for this 
disposition -- deferring to the state -- set forth in 
writing? Why didn't anyone do a memo explaining what your 
reasoning was, or what the office's reasoning was? 
A 
I can't speak to that directly, but I can say that 
it would have been unusual. I don't recall other cases where 
there was a, this is the reason for our disposition type 
memo. At least not memos that came to me. 
Q 
Okay. I'm showing you two, and the caption is --
is all that's relevant here, but there are two memos that are 
both dated February 2006, and March 2006. One of them is in 
fact addressed to you from 
, and it attaches a 
memo, which is a require for pretrial diversion to resolve 
case against an individual named Ronald Sasse, S-a-s-s-e. 
And it is a child pornography possession case in 
EFTA00009404

Page 177 
which the conclusion was that the defendant merely possessed 
it, and that it was a case that should be resolved by 
pretrial diversion, and I'm just only bringing that to your 
attention --
Right. 
Q 
-- as well as this second one that I'll show you, 
to show you that there are cases involving, you know, child 
sex crimes, where it's -- the office did see fit to set forth 
its analysis and reasoning for the proposed result. 
The second document, dated February 15, 2006, is a 
memo, not to you, but to 
in his capacity as chief 
of the criminal division, and it requests authorization to 
enter into a plea agreement with a five year cap, and it --
it is a C1C plea, and the handwritten notes indicate that the 
supervisors concurred in it. Again, I'm simply suggesting 
that there -- that there are at least some examples where the 
office, you know, in these kinds of cases --
A 
Right. 
A 
So --
Q 
-- put it to paper. 
A 
So, I can only speculate. 
Q 
mm-hmm. 
A 
And questions I would have is, to what extent was 
this put on paper, because it was a case that 
or others 
EFTA00009405

Page 17E 
were not involved with. So, this was the way that in this 
case, the chief of the -- you know, the economic crimes, or 
in this case, you know, at 
is chief of the criminal 
division, we're communicating information rather than walking 
in and having a discussion. 
We're just communicating it on paper as a way to 
obviate a discussion. In this particular case, there were --
there was discussion, there was communication, and so a memo 
to sort of establish -- in other words, is this a required 
approval memo, or is this a memo that says, in lieu of 
getting together, where are the facts, let me know what you 
think. 
Q 
All right, and was there not a practice, or even a 
4 
requirement in the office that plea dispositions should be 
memorialized in writing in -- in -- with the rationale? 
A 
So, to the extent that a line attorney might be 
seeking permission from a supervisor --
Q 
Mm-hmm. 
A 
-- on a plea disposition, I would think that they 
would communicate that in writing as the cleanest, most 
typical way when you've got 20 or 30 line attorneys and one 
supervisor. That is not necessarily the only way, and 
certainly as U.S. Attorney, I don't recall a -- you know, a 
practice of memorializing to me what plea dispositions would 
be. 
EFTA00009406

Page 179 
Q 
Okay, and in this case, you were involved in the 
case, right? 
A 
And in this case, I was involved, and so to be 
clear, I'm not -- I -- I'm not saying that I disagreed with 
this, and I'm not walking away with it. And so, to the 
extent that I may have in a meeting said this looks good, 
that may have obviated a need to --
Q 
All right. 
A 
-- write that up. 
Q 
Okay. Thank you. Another aspect of the state 
resolution that raises concern -- and it -- and let me make 
clear that -- that many of our questions are framed in this 
way, but we are also reflecting a concern that's been 
expressed in the press, and in the public, and by others. 
A 
I understand. Understood. 
Q 
So --
A 
Understood. 
Q 
-- we're sort of coming through that lens. So, 
another aspect of the state resolution that raises concern 
is, doesn't it appear that the -- that by going -- sending 
this matter back to the state, there's more federal 
interference, more federal involvement in the state process 
than there would have been if you had just kept the case? 
A 
So in hindsight, one of the issues I think in this 
case is after the agreement, and you know, we keep calling it 
EFTA00009407

Page 180 
a non-prosecution agreement, and I kept saying call it an 
agreement to defer in favor of state prosecution. 
Q 
A DPA instead of an NPA? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Why wasn't it called a DPA, by the way? 
A 
I don't know. There's one e-mail where I suggested 
putting in reference to petite policy. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
And 
said, looks strange, take it out. 
There's another e-mail in the record where I keep saying --
everyone keeps calling it an NPA, call it a deferred to 
state. So, I can't -- you know, I can't say why not, but 
it's an important distinction. 
Q 
But if you had said -- it -- I don't want to go --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
to far afield, but if you had said, uh-uh, call 
it, no, call it a deferred prosecution 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- agreement, they would have changed it, right? 
A 
They would have, and I -- I actually asked that we 
have a clause based -- I don't have the independent 
recollection of this, but based on the record that we include 
a clause saying that we were doing this in light of the 
petite policy to defer, and 
pushes back and says, 
I haven't seen that, and he's the local expert, so I deferred 
EFTA00009408

Page 181 
to him. I take responsibility, but it's an important 
distinction. And so -- I'm sorry, I just lost track of your 
question. 
Q 
We were talking about, doesn't this involve more 
federal interference? 
A 
Could I -- could I grab a Red Bull from you that I 
bought? 
break? 
MR. HERRON: Yeah. 
THE WITNESS: Sorry, just a --
MS. 
: Do you want to take a five minute 
THE WITNESS: Would you mind? 
MS. 
: Not at all. 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
MS. 
: Call it, please, at any time. 
THE WITNESS: Let me grab the Red Bull. 
MS. 
: Off the record. 
(Off the record.) 
BY MS. 
All right. Thank you. All right. Back on the 
record. So, Mr. Acosta, I was asking you about -- didn't 
this -- didn't this resolution end up injecting the feds into 
the state business in a pretty aggressive way? 
A 
And -- and so what I was saying is in hindsight, 
one of the -- one of the issues here is I think this would 
EFTA00009409

Page 182 
have gone very differently if after the agreement to defer in 
favor of state prosecution, all the victims knew about this, 
they had gone into state court, he had pled October --
whatever the date was -- had been sentenced, had served his 
sentence, and case over. 
And so, one -- you know, to the extent there are 
lessons learned, an attempt to provide a -- an attempt to 
backstop the state here, rebounded, because in the process, 
it got convoluted, and complex, and ended up being arguably 
more intrusive than it would have had this just been, here is 
what we'll do, go back to the -- if you go back to the state 
and work this out, but --
Q 
Would that have required or depended on cooperation 
from the state authorities? 
A 
So, I think I was clear, and my recollection is 
this was an issue where I said it is up to you, and one of 
the -- I edited a few parts of this. I got involved 
selectively. 
Q 
Exhibit 21b is --
A 
Oh. 
Q 
-- your edits. 
A 
Okay. So, let's -- before I say I think, let's go 
2.3 
to --
Q 
But --
A 
-- 21. 
EFTA00009410

Page 183 
Q 
But before me talk about 21b, as a general matter, 
you talked earlier about the more -- the sort of more 
typical, usual way in which the U.S. Attorney's Office and 
local authorities 
prosecutive authorities would work, and 
that is cooperatively, and would decide who gets what, and --
Right. 
Q 
-- who has what responsibilities. Here, there was 
not such cooperation, apparently. 
A 
There wasn't, and I was going to say, to my 
recollection, we can look at whether it's in 21b or not, one 
of my edits was make it clear that it's up to him to figure 
this out with the state attorney, because we as federal 
prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state 
attorney. 
Q 
But in affect, you did. 
A 
Q 
By -- you did -- you did it through Epstein. 
A 
I understand. And so, in an attempt to -- in 
an attempt to reach a resolution, particularly as convoluted 
as this got, I do think a lesson learned is that it ended up 
perhaps being worse that if we would not have in the first 
place. 
Something -- I -- we, my team, we very much thought 
that it was important that he go to jail. That it was 
important that he register. How we got to that ending is 
EFTA00009411

Page 184 
unusual, and as an attempt to factor in, here are all the 
issues around the federal statutes, the concerns about 
trafficking law, here are the victim issues as to trial, and 
how -- you know, here is -- here are all these things. And 
so, on the one hand, deferring to state 
to the state, 
appears -- appears logical. 
On the other hand, the way it played out was a lot 
more confrontational with the state than I would have hoped, 
particularly because rather than go back to the state and 
work it out, in the collateral -- subsequent collateral 
attacks, they almost tried to state to circumvent and to --
you know, to get the state to circumvent and undermine our 
agreement. 
And that was -- when you say they, you mean the 
defense team? 
So, you could have -- you could have obviated that 
whole thing if you had just offered the same result, which 
would be a plea to a criminal charge with, for sake of 
2C 
argument, a two-year cap, which would have required a C1C 
plea. 
A 
Right. 
Q 
And you'd get your restitution, because federal law 
requires it. They would have been able to proceed under 18 
USC 22.55 anyway, and he would have gone to jail and been 
EFTA00009412

Page 165 
registered as a sex offender. All just within the normal 
course of doing business as the U.S. Attorney's Office. Why 
not pursue that? Who was -- who was calling the shots that 
said, yeah, we'll do it, but it's got to be with the state? 
Was that the defense? 
A 
So, something that -- that wasn't the defense. 
Something that I think is important to sort of lay out here, 
is the -- the -- sort of the terms sheet was developed really 
early in the case. 
Q 
Excuse me, it's dated, it's presented to the team 
by 
on the 31st of July. Do you consider that 
early? 
A 
So, from -- let me -- let me clarify from my 
perspective. It was developed and approved by me before I 
became involved with interactions with the defense team. 
Q 
In the sense that you only met with the defense 
team for the first time in the person of Ken Starr and Jay 
Lefkowitz and company on the 7th of September. 
A 
And it wasn't the 7th of -- yeah, the 7th of --
Q 
The 7th of September. 
A 
-- September. 
Q 
2007. 
A 
And that is important, because it goes to -- there 
is a lot of buzz in the media, did they influence this 
outcome? To my recollection, they may not even have been 
EFTA00009413

Page 186 
attorneys of record in this case, and I don't know when they 
came onto the case. 
Q 
Well, there's an e-mail in the package that 
indicates that you got a call from K and E 
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- on -- on or about the 6th of August. 
A 
After the terms sheet was --
Q 
Correct. 
A 
-- presented, and so I say that because we can --
we can -- and probably will talk about whether those terms 
were the best judgement or not, but once those terms were 
agreed and approved, with the exception of the 24 to 18 as a 
material, and then we can talk about how that happened, we 
stuck, and I backed the office, and I backed 
in her 
negotiations on those. And so, I just -- I think that's 
important to note. 
Q 
I understand. I -- that's not, for the moment, the 
focus. 
A 
Fair. 
Q 
It's the terms themselves, and in this case, the 
state court disposition, everything that you wanted to get 
with the state court disposition, you could have gotten with 
a federal plea --
A 
We --
Q 
-- much more easily. 
EFTA00009414

Page 18-
A 
We could have, and there was certainly some 
consideration of a 371, and that may be -- you know, in 
retrospect, it would have obviated a lot of issues. 
Q 
So, who said no, that's not --
A 
So --
Q 
-- acceptable? 
A 
So, there is e-mails that at the time 
spoke to 
me about it. I don't recall, but I'll take responsibility 
for -- for favoring -- or, not for favoring, but if that's --
if that's what happened, I will take responsibility. From my 
perspective, and my recollection, there are two -- two 
factors here. 
Well, I don't know if it's two factors, but at 
least two factors. One, concerns about how this interacts 
with federal law, and what precedents this might mean for 
other trafficking cases. Two, a southern district's general 
dislike for rule 11, and -- and then third, there were other 
federal statutes that were considered at various points, and 
I remember looking at those and saying, yeah, I don't -- it 
doesn't quite -- it doesn't quite fit. 
Q 
To -- just to be clear, that process of looking for 
the square peg that --
A 
Q 
-- would fit into the round hole of -- of the two 
years that had been committed to was a process that came 
EFTA00009415

Page 188 
before the NPA was actually negotiated, at a time when 
was working with defense counsel to see if there 
was a federal charges that could be within the two year --
Correct. 
Q 
-- scope that would allow Jeffery Epstein to serve 
his time in a federal facility, rather than in a state 
facility. Is that --
A 
That --
Q 
-- is that correct? 
A 
-- iS correct. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And I recall -- I recall at least one of those 
ideas, and I recall that my general reaction to it was, we're 
pushing the law that just looks odd, and we don't want to go 
there. 
Q 
Are you talking the assault on an airplane, or the 
obstruction of a witness, or --
A 
I actually -- my recollection is not about the 
assault on the airplane --
Q 
Okay. 
A 
-- but about his home being a special maritime 
jurisdiction. 
Q 
Oh. 
A 
Which is -- no. 
Q 
Definitely square peg in round hole. 
EFTA00009416

Page 189 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Correct? But there were -- so, I guess it -- is 
it -- is it -- is it accurate that from your standpoint, an 
11C1C federal disposition was not going to be acceptable? 
That that's not something that you would approve? 
A 
It would have been unusual, I don't recall with 
specificity, but I can -- based on circumstances, infer that 
it would have been unusual, and -- and I would have looked at 
it and said this isn't -- this isn't typical. I'm not 
comfortable. 
Q 
So, why not -- why not offer the five year hit, and 
say that's it? 
A 
I wish I could speculate. I mean, I could sit here 
and speculate after the fact. I can speak to what I recall. 
I can speak to what I approved. I can speak to the 
considerations that went into it. There are all sorts of 
things that in hindsight we may or may not have done, which 
may have worked out well or not. I -- I can't answer that. 
Q 
So, I guess -- I guess the -- sort of the big 
unanswered as yet question is, why was there a fixation on 
the two years when that's not something that comported with 
anything that was possible in the federal scheme? 
A 
So, speaking to the two years, I don't remember 
with specificity. I -- let me give you my general 
recollection --
EFTA00009417

Met-hum. 
A 
-- and then let me speculate. 
Q 
Mel-hmm. 
A 
My general recollection is that there were earlier 
charges, you all may know those in more detail than I do, but 
there were earlier state charges that were brought. 
Q 
That were brought? 
A 
That -- I'm sorry, not that were brought, that were 
contemplated. 
Q 
Of which there is no public record? 
A 
There is -- I don't know if there's public record 
or not. I can just say my recollection is that there were 
earlier state charges that were contemplated. The state 
attorney chose to not pursue those earlier state charges and 
take it to a grand jury. 
From public information, my understanding is that 
that's why Chief 
became upset. My general 
recollection is that the two years represented what he would 
have received if the original recommendation, or the original 
view of the state attorney's office had gone through, and it 
hadn't been brought to the grand jury, and I would -- I would 
sort of point to -- you know, in this Exhibit 3 -- I thought 
it was in Exhibit 3. 
Somewhere, there's a reference to -- as you can see 
it -- Exhibit 3, page three, as you and the agents conceded, 
EFTA00009418

Page 191 
had Epstein been convicted of a felony that resulted in a 
jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI nor 
our office would have interceded. 
Q 
But that is completely silent as to what those 
original charges may have been, or --
A 
Q 
-- how they related to --
A 
I understand. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
And so, so, to just close the loop, my 
understanding is that those two years reflected what that 
would have been such that the case would not have come to 
federal authorities in the first place. 
Q 
Okay. Where did that information come from? Who 
said, oh, those charges would have resulted in a two year 
sentence? Was that something that was analyzed by your 
office, or did it come from defense counsel, or --
A 
Q 
-- from who? 
A 
I can't -- I can't speculate. It had to come from 
someone. 
Q 
It did not come from you, is that correct? 
A 
So, I would not have the knowledge to know what 
that charge would have resulted. As an initial matter, a 
penalty that says up to blank years is rarely that number of 
EFTA00009419

Page 192 
years, right? 
Q 
Right. 
A 
By the time you apply guidelines and all that, and 
so I would not have the knowledge to know how to calculate 
that state sentence. 
Q 
And in fact were you aware that Florida did have 
its own state guidelines -- sentencing guidelines? 
A 
Generally, I -- I know that --
Q 
Right. 
A 
-- there is a process. 
Q 
Right. 
A 
Might I at some point have said, you know, Mr. or 
Ms. AUSA, or management team member, if this had been done 
the right way in the state, what would he have gotten, and 
someone comes back to me, possibly, maybe someone at some 
point had said, look, this would never have come to us if it 
was done the right way in the state, and this was the term 
that he would've gotten. 
At some point in this process, my general 
understanding is we got to that two years based on not 
random, but based on, this was the calculation that he would 
have received. 
Q 
Right, and to make sure we understand, is that your 
actual recollection, or is it your belief based on what you 
2. 
know happened that that's the way it --
EFTA00009420

Page 193 
A 
So --
Q 
-- happened? 
A 
So, it is my recollection of my understanding, 
which is convoluted, so let me --
Q 
yeah. 
A 
/t is how I recall viewing the term sheet when I 
approved it. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
How it got into -- and so, if we got to the term 
0 
sheet --
Q 
It's 21 -- no, it's not. 
A 
It's -- it's one of these exhibits. 
MR. 
15. 
BY MS. 
Q 
Thank you, 15. 
A 
15. So, if we go to the terms sheet, Epstein 
pleads guilty -- contender to an information follow 
charging him with -- these particular statutes are -- I am 
not familiar with, but I would have assumed that either 
or someone else would have selected them appropriately. It 
makes a binding recommendation to serve at least two years in 
prison. 
Q 
Let me back up if I could. Those three statutes, 
did you understand those three statutes to be the three 
statutes that -- or, to be the statutes that the state 
EFTA00009421

Page 194 
originally was going to bring? 
A 
I can't speak to that. 
Q 
You don't know. 
A 
I don't know. 
Q 
So, you don't know what the statutes were? 
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
Okay. 
A 
Yeah. You know, it makes a joint binding 
recommendation at least two years in prison 
My -- my 
understanding, my recollection of my understanding, when I 
reviewed these terms, is that that reflected what he would 
have received if he had -- if the state had gone through with 
an initial -- with an initial charge, and from our 
perspective at the time, that would have obviated the need in 
the first place to have engaged federal authorities. Agree 
or disagree with the logic, I'm trying to explain the logic. 
Q 
Mm-hmm. No, I understand. Thank you for that 
clarification. Is it -- you posited a couple of 
possibilities that you might have said, you know, gee, what 
would --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- he be looking at if --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the state had done what it originally set out to 
do or was supposed to do. Is it -- how also likely is it 
EFTA00009422

Page 195 
that someone came to you, one of your people, and said, hey, 
I suggest we go with two years, because the same reason. 
A 
It's --
Q 
In other words, it came from --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- somebody else to you, and you agreed. 
A 
So, it's very difficult to reconstruct this in 
retrospect, in part because I don't want to leave the 
impression that there was one meeting where this was 
discussed --
Q 
MM-hmm. 
A 
-- as opposed to, you've got -- you're sitting 
across the hall from someone, you're sitting down the hall 
from someone. There are ongoing discussions, how do we 
resolve a matter that has some thorny legal questions, some 
difficult victim witness questions, and this is the kind of 
back and forth where I might have indicated a concern, 
someone was trying to address that concern, or I might have 
asked the question. It -- it's --
Q 
Well, you've already told us that you did express 
concern --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- about the case, and somebody -- and you were 
having conversations with 
correct? 
, possibly 
EFTA00009423

Page 196 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
And is it possible 
does it -- is it reasonable 
that one of them might have come up with a solution for you 
to your problems? 
A 
And that's the point that I'm --
Okay. 
A 
-- trying to make. It's certainly possible, and 
it's difficult to reconstruct that 12 years after the fact. 
Q 
All right. All right. I want to go back to wind 
up this -- this concern about engagement with the federal --
I mean, engaging the federal system into the state process. 
21b is the exhibit that is your comments really on the very 
final version of --
A 
Right. 
Q 
-- the NPA on September 24, and the -- the language 
is quite striking to us in this regard, looking at the -- at 
the first e-mail there, you've talked about deleting the 
petite policy portion upon 
recommendation, and 
inserting global resolution language which you've proposed. 
And then you then say, "I'm not comfortable with 
requiring the state attorney to enter into a joining 
recommendation," and then you propose essentially taking out 
a mention of the state attorney's office regarding the -- the 
sentence recommendation, and then you also note, "I'm not 
comfortable with requiring a state court to stick with our 
EFTA00009424

Page 197 
timeline," and you ask that the reference be softened -- your 
term is to soften. 
You also use soften below when you talk about 
your -- making it -- a concern about making Epstein an agent 
of the U.S. regarding negotiations. So, you're really -- and 
then at the very top, in the -- in the later follow up e-
mail, you express concern about, "Do we really need to set a 
date for his reporting? I'm very nervous about that. If I 
were a judge, / would be upset by the federal government 
telling a state court how to manage their calendar. Can we 
delete?" 
A 
Right. 
Q 
So, clearly you're very mindful, right, of the 
importance of not injecting the federal sovereign into the 
state sovereign. 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
Fair? All right, but yet, this whole set up, the 
whole NPA did require certain actions to occur, however they 
came about, in the state, because of the federal requirement. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And why was that a good idea? 
A 
In hindsight, the complexity that this took on 
clearly is something that -- that if I was advising a fellow 
U.S. Attorney today, I would say, think it through. I do 
think it would have played differently if he had actually not 
EFTA00009425

Page 198 
done all the collateral deals and stuck to what was --
Q 
But that came later. 
A 
It --
Q 
This is before it's signed. 
A 
It came 
it came later, but let me -- let me at 
least say that, and stuck to October 26th, but look, I 
understand your point, and -- and the response that I can 
give was, you have -- we had these concerns, but we also 
thought it was very important that he serve some real 
punishment, and that he register. And whether -- whether we 
balance that or not, a lot of people are going to be 
questioning for a long, long time, but that's how we balanced 
it. 
Q 
Because the state disposition was not a 
precondition to achieving those two objectives. You could 
have done it with a federal plea, serving time --
A 
Arguably --
Q 
-- and the offender registration. 
A 
Arguably, we could have done it with a federal plea 
if judges would have gone -- if judges would have gone for 
rule lls, which in the Southern District they tend not to, 
but arguably. 
Q 
Okay. Okay. I just wanted to --
A 
And you know, again, this is -- this is a hindsight 
thing, but yes. 
EFTA00009426

Page 199 
Q 
It is, but what we're focusing on is not so much 
the hindsight as the -- at the time, did this make sense? 
And it seems that you all were putting in so much effort, and 
it was so hard to make this come together and work, that 
it -- it's striking that it didn't collapse of its own -- of 
its -- of its own weight. 
A 
And to that point, let me say, you know, it's also, 
if I had to speculate, one question that I'd -- that I'd ask 
is, everyone's putting in all this effort. You know, 
put in a lot of work on the negotiations with the defense 
counsel that were somewhere between zealous and difficult. 
Q 
Meaning defense counsel were --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- between zealous and --
A 
Yeah. 
Q 
-- difficult? 
A 
Yeah. Whether there's zealous advocates or cross 
line to rude, we can have conversations about, and at what 
point, you know, would it have proceeded differently if folks 
said, let's take a big step back, and let's seriously 
reconsider? But everyone was very, let's get the job done, 
let's put him in jail. And I -- look, I'm speculating in 
hindsight. 
Q 
But could you not have pulled the plug at any time 
before it was signed? I mean, clearly by the morning of that

I'm employed by the FBI. 
Q 
What is your position with the FBI? 
A 
I'm a special agent, and have been so for four 
years. 
Q 
Are you one of the agents assigned to the 
investigation known as Operation Leap Year? 
A 
Yes, I am. 
Q

A 
Additional subpoenas that have been issued 
include OLY-28 to Colonial Bank, along with OLY-29, which 
was issued to Palm Beach National Bank & Trust Company. 
That was served on march 5, 2007. It should be known that 
Palm Beach National Bank & Trust Company is now operated 
by Colonial Bank, which we learned in the issuance 
process. We did receive documents back from Colonial 
Bank, which covered both subpoenas, on April 25, 2007. 
Q 
And those sought information relating to bank 
accounts belonging to Mr. Epstein? 
A 
That is correct. 
Q 
What else?

Also served OLY-30 to Western Union Financial 
Services seeking documents and records related to Jeffrey 
Epstein. It was served on February 26, 2007, and we

returned information which we received on May 3, 2007. 
Q 
The same type of information? 
A 
Yes, the same type of information, seeking wire 
transfer information from Jeffrey Epstein to victims. 
We also served 0LY-32 to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank. 
After serving that one on February 26, 2007, they informed 
us by letter that they are known as Chase, not J.P. Morgan 
Chase. So we had to reissue another subpoena, which was 
taken care of on March 22, '07. 
We also issued 0LY-40 on Chase Bank as well on 
April 4, 2007. We received records on April 13, 2007 and 
April 19, 2007 to cover all three subpoenas that were 
served. 
Q 
And those sought information related to bank 
accounts and credit cards related to the defendants? 
A 
Yes. Additionally, we served OLY-33 on Dr.

We were seeking records related to Jeffrey Epstein as a 
patient. The subpoena was served on March 6, 2007, and 
Thomas Rofranno provided materials on March 16. 2007. 
Also we have OLY-36, which was served on the 
Palm Beach County Health Department. it was served on 
March 5, 2007, seeking birth certificates of our victims 
that we were researching. We received the records from

We also served two subpoenas on the Adult Video 
Warehouse. The first one was OLY-41, which was served --
both of these were served on April 24, 2007, and they were 
seeking any transactions that had occurred on behalf of 
Mr. Epstein or those individuals that were working for him 
or with him. We received items back on the OLY-41 
subpoena on April 30, 2007. 
The second subpoena served on Adult Video 
Warehouse was OLY-34. Again, it was served on April 24, 
2007, and the Adult Video Warehouse complied and provided 
us materials on April 30, 2007. 
That concludes all of the items that we have 
received to date for the outstanding subpoenas that were 
issued. 
Q 
Are the documents that you refer to in that box 
that's on the desk? 
A 
Yes, they are. 
: Does anyone want to review those 
documents? At this time, no one is requesting that 
they want to review the documents today. 
Would you please swear in the witness to

It'S 
Q 
Can you remind the grand jury who you are 
employed by? 
A 
The FBI. 
Q 
I know that you testified here a few weeks ago. 
Was there anything from that testimony that you wanted to 
correct? 
A 
I did. I was asked by one of you Mr. Epstein's 
age, and I confused him with another individual in another 
one of my cases. His birthdate is January 20, 1953. We 
are looking at the time period of 2004 and 2005. So 
Mr. Epstein would have been about 51 or 52-years-old, and 
I believe I told you he was 45. So at the time we're 
looking during this investigation, he is 51 or 52.

A 
Yes. She was interviewed -- they talked to her 
again. She placed some controlled calls for them later 
that month, we will talk about that later. As well as 
she was interviewed about a year later in July of 2006. 
Not interviewed, but she testified before the grand jury 
for the State of Florida. So she was interviewed by 
detective 
in March of 2005, and then about a year or 
three or four months later, in July of 2006, she testified 
before a grand jury with the State of Florida. 
Q 
In preparation for your appearance today, did

Back in March of 2005, you mentioned that

occasion? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
If you could give us sort of an overview of what 
reported during these interviews, and then if there 
are specific discrepancies or differences, we will return 
to those later. 
A 
All right. On February 5, 2005, it was a 
Saturday, and 
I. was at 
house, 
I. She 
was there with her boyfriend, 
I. And because these 
are minors, we'll refer to them without using their last 
names, so I'll use those initials. 
They were at 
residence, and 
I. is 
boyfriend, which is also 
cousin. So they 
were all at 
house, and 
was on the phone with 
an individual that 
refers to as the assistant.

A 
decides to go. 
Q 
Because she wanted to make the $200 or $300? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So tell us then what happened after that 
meeting? 
A 
The next day, February 6 -- they discussed that 
evening about going the next day. We do have on 
phone records two calls that were placed. One was placed 
to 
cell phone, and the other was placed to 
Jeffrey Epstein's residence the night of February 5. 
The next day 
is contacted a couple of times 
before 
arrives. Each time prior to 
being 
contacted by 
a call is placed by 
to

, I should tell you, is 
Jeffrey's assistant. 
So on Sunday a call was placed to 
and then shortly after that a call was made to

same series occurs again, but this time 
places a 
call to Mr. Epstein's residence, and then 
is called 
again. 
Eventually,

EFTA00009455

arrive at 
residence, and they continue over to 
Mr. Epstein's house. 
Q 
is driving with 
and 
. Do you 
know how they were sitting? 
A 
You know, I'm not sure how they were sitting, 
but I know that it was a pickup truck that 
drove, 
and 
was the driver. I'm not sure exactly the 
placement of the other two girls, but they were in the 
truck. 
Q 
And 
was able to describe how they travelled 
to the island of Palm Beach? 
A 
Yes. She gave directions -- you know, the best 
that she could on how she was able to come to 
Mr. Epstein's residence. 
Q 
Once they arrived at the residence, what 
happened? 
A 
I should have mentioned that either the night 
before or the day of, there were some things that 
tells 
. One, she tells 
that she is to tell, if 
asked, that she is 18-years-of-age, that she attends high 
school, that she's in the 12th grade, and I believe it was 
that she was to say that she went 
to. 
Talking to
■ last night, 
told us that 
Celt-) (l b 13

Page 10 
once she arrived at the residence 
tells her that she 
may possibly be asked to take her clothes off. She also 
tells her that she can stay in her bra, but she may be 
asked to take her clothes off. And 
told us last 
night that that's when she knew for the first time that 
she might have to possibly remove her clothes. 
At this point they proceed to enter the 
residence. 
describes him as a security person. He 
approached and asked what they were doing there, and 
said they were there to see Mr. Epstein, or see Jeffrey. 
He allowed them entry into the kitchen area by the pool, 
and 
describes that area. So now 
and 
are all sitting in the kitchen. A short time goes 
by and Mr. Epstein, as well as the assistant, enter the 
kitchen. 
Q 
And I know that you mentioned that 
did not 
know the name of the lady who was there in the kitchen, 
correct? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
She just described her as a blonde, tall lady? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Was 
also interviewed about what happened 
that day? 
A 
She was interviewed by the Palm Beach police 
department. 
EFTA00009457

Page 11 
Q 
Did IM 
identify the person who was on the 
phone with her as IIIII 
A 
Yes, she did. 
So even though IIII doesn't know her name, IIIII 
knew 
name? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So you mentioned that the three girls are in the 
kitchen, along with Jeffrey and the person 
calls the 
blonde lady? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
What happened then? 
A 
follows the blonde lady upstairs to 
Mr. Epstein's bedroom. The blonde lady proceeds to take 
la 
out a massage table and set it up, prepare it. She also 
takes out some lotions to be used during the massage. 
told me last night that the blonde lady asked her to 
remove her clothing, and then left the room and said that 
Mr. Epstein would be in shortly. 
Q 
What happened after she left the room? 
A 
Shortly after that, Mr. Epstein does come into 
the room and shakes 
hand. 
told us last night 
that Mr. Epstein told her to remove her clothing. He 
leaves the room and comes back in just a towel, and he 
tells her again to -- she is at that point -- when he 
walked in the first time she had on her bra and her pants. 
ct 3 
EFTA00009458

Page 12 
When he comes back in, he tells her that she needs to take 
her pants off. So she took her pants off. So now she's 
Q 
At some point did 
tell any of the people 
who interviewed her what was running through her mind? 
A 
She stated at one point that she was upstairs 
with him, with the man, and that 
was downstairs. I 
guess she says, "What could 
do? She's downstairs, 
laying on the table, he has a towel covering his bottom, 
and she is straddling him with her bottom touching the 
towel and some skin touching his lower back. She was kind 
in her bra and underwear. 
I'm upstairs." So she did what she was asked to do. 
Q 
So now you mention that Mr. Epstein is here 
wearing just a towel, and 
has removed both her shirt 
and her pants, is that correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Tell us what happens then? 
A 
Mr. Epstein gets on the massage table lying on 
his stomach and instructs 
how to do the massage. He 
tells her to put some lotion on her hand and instructs her 
on how to actually perform the massage. At one point 
during the massage he tells 
that she would be more 
comfortable to get on top of him, so 
gets on top of 
him and straddles Mr. Epstein's back. 
The way 
describes it is Mr. Epstein is

of sitting -- it sounds like sitting on his rear end, but 
with part of her skin touching him -- the front of him, 
but he had a towel across his bottom. 
Q 
What happens as she is providing the massage to 
his back? 
A 
The massage goes on. She said the entire 
massage lasted anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes. At one 
point Mr. Epstein excuses himself for a few minutes, one 
or two minutes briefly.

Mr. Epstein

Then he returns. At this point he gets back on 
the table lying on his back and asks her to start 
massaging his chest. So she begins to massage his chest. 
Q 
Does he keep the towel on? 
A 
No, at this point the towel is removed. when he 
comes back and he gets back on the table, the towel is 
removed and she is massaging his chest. 
Q 
What does he do as she is massaging his chest? 
A 
He

some point during this time, if she would like to make an

gotten from other victims, yes. 
Q 
And a search was performed on Mr. Epstein's 
house? 
A 
Yes. The Palm Beach police department did 
perform a search, and several of the items that were 
described were found in the house. 
Q 
After Mr. Epstein 
what 
happened? 
A 
He told 
that she was getting the extra 
hundred dollars because he was allowed

concluded, the sexual activity had been concluded. He 
gets up and leaves for a brief moment of time and comes 
back with $300 and pays 
the $300. I believe he told 
that she could see herself out.

She noted seeing several naked pictures of girls 
in the room, a mural or pictures of naked girls either 
exposing their breasts or completely naked.

While the massage was going on, did Mr. Epstein 
talk to

Yes, he did.

And did he talk about sexual conquests with

Yes, he did.

got the $200 for? 
A 
told the Palm Beach police department in 
her interview that she received her $200 for bringing 
to the house. 
Q 
You mentioned that there were these three 
different time periods that 
was interviewed: Shortly 
after the events, at the time of the state grand jury 
proceedings, and when you met with her, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And there were some discrepancies between the 
different interviews. Can you explain some of those to 
the grand jury. 
A 
Before we go and get to that, I want to make 
sure that -- when we discussed what 
was told in the 
e.er-72-t, (rat -3

car byllill, that we learned from ME 
interview with 
the Palm Beach police department. So I don't know if I 
said that, but I want to make sure you know that we first 
learned that= 
by listening to the 
interview that was conducted between the Palm Beach police 
department andillill, not fromilill. When I talk later, I 
just want to make sure you realize that that had not 
initially come out in 
interview, but through the 
interview with 
So going back. I'm sorry, discrepancies? 
Q 
Yes. 
A 
I met with 
last night to discuss some of 
the discrepancies when looking at what she had talked to 
detective 
about in March of 2005 and what she had 
testified to in the grand jury in July of 2006. Reading 
the testimony and listening to the tapes, or reading the. 
transcript, there were a few discrepancies. 
One of the first ones we talked about was what 
had told her about going to Mr. Epstein's house. 
She tells detective 
that she was told about the 
massage, told about getting $200, but that she was not 
told that she would have to take her clothes off. She 
didn't know she would have to perform the massage naked. 
when I asked her last night that question, she 
told me that when she got to the house prior to going into 
alaNCI2WINCII 
EFTA00009465

Page 19 
Mr. Epstein's residence, that I= 
did tell her that she 
may be asked to take off her clothes. She also did state 
that 
told her she could stay in her bra. 
So I wanted you to know that there was a 
discrepancy in what she originally had told detective 
MI and what she told me last night. That would be one. 
The second discrepancy i wanted to touch on with 
her was going upstairs and taking off her clothing. When 
she is in that room, she states to detective 
that 
asked her to remove her clothing, and she took off 
her shirt. Then Mr. Epstein came in the room, shook her 
hand and told her to take off her clothes. He leaves, he 
comes back in a towel. He tells her again. 
tells 
detective 
in a stern voice, 'Mr. Epstein told me to 
take off my pants." Because she hadn't taken off her 
pants from the first time that she met him. 
In her testimony with the grand jury with the 
state, she tells the grand jury that it was 
who 
asked her to remove her clothing. So last night we went 
over with her who told her to remove what. She had a very 
hard time recalling exactly. She knew she had gotten down 
to her bra and underwear. And then at some point, when 
we're going through the sexual activity, she actually 
tells me that her underwear was off when he was 
&API") N't O 
EFTA00009466

1. 
Page 20 
Later in the interview, we tell her about what 
we have in her testimony to the grand jury and her 
statements made to detective 
And she really is 
having a difficult time trying to remember who told her to 
take off her clothes and her pants. As we are walking 
through the sexual activity, she does recall and states. 
that it was Mr. Epstein who told. her to take off her 
pants. 
I guess I'll go to the third discrepancy. Is 
there anything I left off with that? 
Q 
Well, does she report that when the assistant 
leads -- or the blonde lady leads her upstairs, that the 
blonde lady also said, "Get undressed," but that 
didn't get fully undressed? 
A 
That's what she said in her statement to the 
detective, when she gives her first statement. She tells 
us again last night that that's what she recalled. 
Q 
That the lady said first, "Get undressed," but 
she doesn't get fully undressed. And when Jeffrey comes 
back, he said, "Take your pants off."? 
A 
Yes. And again, like I said, when we started 
interviewing her and asking her about this, she did have a 
hard time. But when we were walking through the sexual 
activity, that's when she recalls who told her to take off 
her pants. 
EFTA00009467

Page 21 
And I'll tell you, when we talked about the 
sexual activity, and it comes out that she wasn't wearing 
her underwear when 
, she does not recall how they came off. 
She cannot remember removing her underwear. She doesn't 
remember if Mr. Epstein removed her underwear. She knows 
her underwear was off, but she cannot tell you exactly at 
what point her underwear was removed. 
Q 
Let's talk about the third discrepancy. 
A 
The third is the sexual activity, when she was 
originally interviewed by detective 
about the 
When detective 
comes and sees her again a few weeks later, she does 
tell her at that time that

EFTA00009468

Page 22 
she did not know that 
had told anybody, she thought 
it was only her and 
that knew. She was embarrassed 
and didn't want anybody to know that. 
Q 
Did she become visually upset? 
A 
Yes, she began crying when we asked her about 
. when she realized that we 
knew about that, she became very upset and concerned about 
her father. She mentioned that her father has read a lot 
of the reports in the State of Florida, and has followed 
the state's case. She was concerned about even telling 
us, afraid that he would be able to read in our reports 
about this. 
We explained to her that the FBI's reporting is 
a little bit different than the way the state -- those are 
public records, and ours is part of our case file. 
Q 
In addition to the fact that she had these 
concerns about her father and she was embarrassed, in your 
experience of interviewing victims of sexual abuse, is it 
typical for them to not disclose all of the sexual 
activity? 
A 
Yes, it's very typical. And young girls, they 
don't want to talk about it. This is just another case of 
her not wanting to tell exactly what took place. 
Q 
After that first visit to Mr. Epstein's house, 
and the interviews with detective 
, did detective

From the Palm Beach police department, they were 
able to take voice mail messages left by Mon 
phone stating that 
could come and work on Saturday 
around 11:00. 
Q 
I think you mentioned this 'last time, but in 
case you didn't, did the Palm Beach police department do 
trash pulls at Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
Yes, they did. 
Q 
Was there anything of value related to this 
series of calls that were recovered? 
A 
Yes. There was a trash pull done in the 
beginning of April, and in the trash there was a piece of 
paper that on it had

Was she asked who the youngest-looking girl was?

What did she say? 
A 
She discussed 
looking young in her 
interview with the Palm Beach police department.

for you now. If you could please step outside, I'll 
see if the grand jurors have any.

Agent 
, we have just a few questions. 
One relates to the conversation between Mr. Epstein and 
about his exploits with other girls. Did Mr. Epstein 
say anything about the age of those girls? 
A 
He said that -- in particular on one case he 
talked about a young girl that he was in the back seat

ask MI to make what are called controlled calls? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Can you explain to the grand jury what a 
controlled call is? 
A 
A controlled call is where we actually have a 
listening device, where we have an individual place a call 
to somebody and we are able to record the other person's 
voice and the conversation that takes place between the 
person that we're having make the call and the person that 
they are calling. 
Q 
Who did detective 
ask 
to call? 
A 
was asked to call 
on the phone. 
Q 
And did she do so? 
A 
Yes, she did. 
Q 
Can you tell the grand jury when the calls were?

I believe the first call was made towards the 
end of March, I believe it was March 30.

told her that they did not know about 
Mr. Epstein. Later in the conversation 
tells her 
that Mr. Epstein would like her to come back and work for 
him, and that maybe she could work for him tomorrow. So

Page 24 
they agreed that there would be a call between 
and 
tomorrow, that 
will call 
tomorrow. 
Q 
were there calls also made on March 31 of 2006? 
A 
There were two calls made on March 31. The 
first one she doesn't connect to 
. The second call 
that was made a short time later, 
answers the phone. 
Again, there is a discussion about 
coming to work for

is telling 
that she'll have to ask Mr. Epstein that, that she is 
going to see Mr. Epstein tomorrow and that she'll talk to 
Mr. Epstein. There is conversation about 
and her 
twin sister possibly coming to Mr. Epstein's house. There 
is some discussion about her coming to work for 
Mr. Epstein. 
Q 
Just so it's clear, because there were a lot of 
shes, 
is telling 
that 
is going to see 
Epstein the following day? 
A 
Yes.

And that 
is going to set up a schedule

that they were having sex in the back seat 
were 
doing sexual things in the back seat while he was carrying 
on a conversation with the parents in the front seat. I 
guess they were on their way home from a business party. 
This was one of the stories that he had talked about. 
Q 
But at no time did he provide any specific ages 
about any of those girls? 
A 
No. 
Q 
what was 
age at the time she took 
to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
She was 18. 
Q 
Did Mr. Epstein ask 
anything about her age? 
A 
He did. He asked her how old she was, she said 
she was 18. He asked her what grade she was in, she said 
she was in the 12th grade. He asked her where she went to 
school, and she said she went to 
Q 
I know we will be doing a lot more discussion 
about 
later. But could you tell us briefly how 
was recruited to go to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
was at the beach, and two individuals 
approached her about making money and giving a massage to 
Mr. Epstein.

BY 
Q 
The question was, was there any particular 
evidence to suggest that Mr. Epstein knew that 
was 
under the age of 18? 
A 
I would say through the interviews of the 
multiple girls that went to Mr. Epstein's house -- the way 
that having seen 
last night, and now she's 16 -- this 
was two years ago -- that 
age and behavior -- and 
again, is that more circumstantial evidence? As far as 
concrete evidence, no. But just by her appearance and her 
16. 
mannerisms and how I observed her last night at age 16. 
Q 
And that's consistent with what 
said 
during her statement; correct? 
A 
Yes, it is. 
MS. 
: Any other questions? 
JUROR: 
Did she look 18? 
THE WITNESS: Does 
look 18? Not in my 
opinion, sir.

This is a photograph of

Q 
Now you mentioned that in March of 2004 
and April of 2004, there are these records of 
phone calls and did 
say how old she was 
when she first went to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
I'm sorry. Did 
say how old she 
was? 
Q 
Did she tell you or the police officers 
how old she was? 
A 
Yes. 
I'm sorry. 
I thought your 
question was did she tell Mr. Epstein. 
She told me that she was 16 when she 
went to Mr. Epstein's house. 
Q 
Okay. That is consistent with those 
phones calls? 
A 
Yes, it is.

Okay. Now during her first visit with 
Mr. Epstein, what happened?

She went to Mr. Epstein's house.

her she got her driver's license when she was 17. 
So 
drove her to Mr. Epstein's 
house. She provided Mr. Epstein with a few 
massages. She remained clothed both times that 
she gave him a massage. 
At this time, she kept 
her clothes on. 
I think one time she was wearing shorts 
and a T-shirt, maybe the second time she was 
wearing jeans and a T-shirt. That he constantly 
grabbed and pulled at her during the massage 
trying to draw her closer to him, but at that 
time, you know, there was no sexual activity other 
than the grabbing and pulling. 
There was no sexual activity that took 
place on those first couple of massages, and she 
remained clothed at that time. 
Q 
Now after those first few massages, was 
there a break in time before 
returns to 
the Epstein house?

told us that she and 
had 
had some kind of a

so there was a time 
period where she did not go back to Mr. Epstein's 
house.

And when -- did there then come a time

when she returned to the Epstein house? 
A 
Yes. 
We have phone activity between 
and 
II. beginning in December 
of '04. 
Q 
And how old was 
I. in December 
of '04? 
A 
She had turned 17 at that time. 
In 
fact, through the course of the phone records 
beginning in December of '04 to October of 2005, 
we have over 150 phone calls between 
Z. 
and 
, Mr. Epstein's assistant. 
Q 
What did 
Z. tell you about the 
activity that occurred when she started returning 
in late '04? 
A 
When she started giving Mr. Epstein 
massages after that break, the massages became 
much more sexual in nature. Mr. Epstein continued 
to push and there were many times when 
would perform massages completely nude. 
Several times, she would stay in her 
underwear with no bra on, but stated to me that 
many occasions she performed the massages to Mr. 
Epstein in the nude. 
Q 
In addition to being unclothed, was 
there other sexual activity?

Yes, there was.

discussing the sexual activity that took place at 
that time. 
She stated that Mr. Epstein had

Okay. Now in addition to using that

was 
there other sexual activity? 
A 
Yes. Several times during the massages, 
Mr. Epstein would have

he laid on his stomach and then he would reach

that was what was described to us by

Now when was 
first interviewed 
by the Palm Beach Police? 
A 
She was interviewed October 6th of 2005. 
Q 
And at that time, did she say when her 
last visit was to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
Yes, she said October 1st, 2005, was the 
last massage that she had given Mr. Epstein. 
Q 
Is there any other evidence that was 
recovered from Mr. Epstein's or his household 
items that would confirm that statement? 
A 
We have a message pad. During the 
search warrant, several of the message pads -- I 
don't know if we referred to them at this stage. 
We may not have. 
We recovered -- well, I shouldn't say 
we, the Palm Beach Police Department recovered 
several message pads. They were carbon copy 
message pads. 
So we have several of those books from 
their search warrant and in there, there is a 
message on October 1st confirming 
appointment for the massage as well as another

EFTA00009489

girl, 
Q 
And is there also evidence that 
and 
actually spoke on October 1st 
before that message? 
A 
We have cell phone calls between 
and 
as well as the message which 
was from 
to Jeffrey regarding -- confirming 
the appointment for 
, but we have a cell 
phone call I believe it was a little bit earlier 
from 
to 
or maybe it was 
to 
, but it is definitely between the two of 
them on that same day. 
Q 
All right. 
When 
was interviewed 
by the Palm Beach Police Department, did she 
describe all of the sexual activity? 
A 
No, she did not. She did not tell them 
about the 
or the 
- she didn't tell them 
about the 
Q 
And, again, you said that when you 
brought up -- did you sort of confront her with 
the idea that more had occurred? 
A 
I did, and she was very embarrassed 
about the 
I asked her at one point if 
Mr. Epstein had given her any gifts and she got 
very red in the face and began to tear up and you

could see that she was very embarrassed. 
So we took a little bit of a break, but 
then she was able to say that Mr. Epstein had 
provided her as a birthday present a 
. 
So 
not only was there a 
used 
on her, but at this time 
and I think that's 
kind of what got 
talking about the sexual 
activity that she was able to tell me that, and 
she was very, very embarrassed, but that Mr. 
Epstein had given her for her eighteenth birthday 
a 
Q 
Now you mentioned that that happened on 
her eighteenth birthday? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And was she able to tell you whether Mr. 
Epstein knew it was her eighteenth birthday? 
A 
She stated that Mr. Epstein provided to 
her on her eighteenth birthday the 
and 
shortly -- well --
Q 
So before you had said that 
had 
instructed 
to tell everyone that she was 
18; do you remember that? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
But at some point, the people in the 
Epstein household learned that she hadn't turned 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE, LLC 
(954) 467-8204 
EFTA00009491

yet and her birthday was coming up? 
A 
Her birthday was coming up. 
Q 
And at some point, was a car provided 
for 
A 
Yes. 
In October of '05, 
was 
having 
asked Mr. Epstein is she could 
borrow one of his cars to go to Orlando and he 
stated that -- at first he said yes, and then he 
said he would get her a rental car. 
So 
contacted 
a few days 
later and said that a car had been rented for 
and that the house manager used the 
company credit card and 
picked up that 
car, and actually when the police interviewed her 
on October 6th, which was five or six days after 
the last massage, they were able to see that that 
Nissan Sentra that had been rented by Mr. Epstein, 
had that in her possession for at least 
through January 1st of 2006 and that car was 
rented by Mr. Epstein for at least that amount of 
time. 
Q 
Did 
describe how the massage 
appointments would be made? 
A 
Yes, she did. 
Q 
And how was that? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE, LLC 
(954) 467-8204 
c-&-en (4 (3 
EFTA00009492

A 
She stated that 
that 
, Jeffrey's assistant, would call her and set 
up appointments, and that sometimes she would call 
her on her cell phone from New York, from the 
Islands, and say that they were coming into town, 
was she available. 
She would also call 
while they 
were in town to see if she was available for 
massages, to give massages to Mr. Epstein, and 
stated that 
, who we have identified as 
-• 
called her a few times as well to set 
appointments up. 
Q 
And when those appointments were made 
how would 
reach 
A 
By phone. 
Q 
All right. 
And whether she was in town 
or out of town, she would call 
cell 
phone? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
All right. 
Now was there any -- during 
the interview with the police department, did the 
police department ask 
about what she 
discussed with Jeffrey Epstein during the 
massages? 
A 
I would have to check the police reports 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE, LLC 
(954) 467-8204 
EFTA00009493

1 
to give specifics on that. 
Q 
All right. 
A 
My answer to your question is yes. 
Q 
Okay. 
And what did she say were some of 
the topics of discussion? 
A 
Mr. Epstein asked her questions about 
herself, asked her if she was a 
or 
that -- Jeffrey knew that she was a 
and asked questions about her college, about where 
she was going to school. 
is currently going to 
, and she had advised Mr. Epstein that 
she would be attending college at 
Q 
So that was a 
- but that was her future 
plan? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So in other words, did Mr. Epstein know 
that she was in high school at the time? 
A 
Yes, he did. And the Palm Beach Police 
asked 
if Jeffrey knew her age and 
told the Palm Beach Police Department, he didn't 
care what my age was. 
Q 
Now did 
describe either to you 
or to the police department how she would be paid 
for these massages? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE, LLC 
(954) 467-8204 
Cetro 14 (3 
EFTA00009494

A 
She stated she was paid $200 and that 
she received anywhere from two to $300. 
Q 
With every visit? 
A 
With each visit. 
Q 
Okay. Did she say who would provide her 
with that money? 
A 
She said that Jeffrey paid her at the 
end of the massage. 
Q 
All right. 
You mentioned the gift of 
the vibrator. Were there other gifts that were 
given to 
A 
Yes. The time period is unclear, but 
the 
was given to her for her eighteenth 
birthday. There were three sets of bra and 
underwear, panties, Victoria Secret bra and 
underwear sets that were also given to 
as 
gifts from Mr. Epstein. 
Q 
Now I know that we talked earlier about 
the fact that 
is the person who brought 
to Mr. Epstein's house. Did 
ever 
bring anyone to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
brought a female by the name of 
and that was a friend of

Q 
How old was 
when 
took 
her to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
took her there in the spring of 
2005 and 
was 18 at that time. 
Q 
Now can you tell us now 
went
about bringing 
to the house? 
A 
told 
that she could make 
some money giving a massage to Mr. Epstein and 
and 
went to Mr. Epstein's house 
together. 
The first time that 
went there, 
she did not go upstairs and give him a massage. 
was working that day. 
But in talking to 
further, 
stated that she probably 
over the period of time between the spring of '05 
and October of '05, performed around five to ten 
massages for Mr. Epstein. 
The first few of those he did not do 
anything as far as no 
no sexual 
activity. She would just perform a massage. 
Q 
And did that change over time? 
A 
Yes, it did. 
She stated that she 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE, LLC 
(954) 467-8204 
cfret, tot 13 
EFTA00009496

performed two to three massages out of those five 
or ten and in her underwear and bra only, and 
that he would push her each time. 
He would just push her to do more and on 
the third -- I believe she stated the third or 
fourth massage, he told her that she could make 
more money if she removed her clothing, because 
she stayed clothed during the first few massages, 
and she was paid $200 for each of those massages. 
On the third or fourth massage, Mr. 
Epstein said that she could make more money if she 
removed her clothing. So around the fourth or 
fifth time, she did start taking off her clothing 
down to her underwear and bra only. 
Q 
And then what happened when she was at 
that point of being unclothed? 
A 
She would perform the massage. He 
attempted to touch her, but she always would say 
no. 
At one point, her bra does get undone by Mr. 
Epstein, but she does keep it up. 
Q 
Now that was the extent of his touching 
At some point, did he 
in front of her? 
A 
Yes, he did. 
Not in the very beginning, 
but throughout this he did. Now I should tell you 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE, LLC 
(954) 467-8204 
EFTA00009497

1 
that 
stated to us that because she was kind 
of reserved or held back as he made advances 
towards her, she was able to see Mr. Epstein's 
and that he 
but that he 
, that he 
. 
She did 
not feel that Mr. Epstein liked her very much. 
Q 
But just to sort of compare what 
said with what 
said, they both said that 
at the beginning they remained clothed? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And that Mr. Epstein progressively 
pushed and pushed and pushed for more sexual 
activity? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Now what was the period of time that 
went to Mr. Epstein's home? 
A 
March of 
I'm sorry, spring of '05 is 
when 
said that she went there and around, 
you know, the investigation is heating up with 
Palm Beach, so we know that in September of '05, 
there was a trash pull done, and in that trash 
pull there was a message and that was found and it 
stated -- it had 
phone number on it and 
it stated, for a good time call 
and

Q 
And whose stationery was that? 
A 
It was on Jeffrey Epstein's stationery. 
Q 
And had Jeffrey Epstein been in a Palm 
Beach resident close to those dates? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Now is there evidence of telephone calls 
between 
and 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And how many phone calls have you been 
able to identify? 
A 
At this time, there have been 14 phone 
calls.

All right. 
And just to compare that to 
the number of phone calls with 
A 
With 
, there was over 150 phone 
calls between 
and 
Q 
And that is sort of consistent with the 
number of massages that 
did versus the 
number of massages that 
did? 
A 
It is consistent with especially the 
activity that 
was providing Mr. Epstein 
compared to the activity that 
would 
provide.

Q 
Did you attempt to interview her? 
She's 
going to be coming in, and she is not a minor 
anymore, so what is her full name? 
A 
Her name is 
and I did 
attempt to interview 
, and 
was 
interviewed by Palm Beach Police Department and 
because of the statements she provided to the 
police department, she felt as if she needed a 
lawyer. So when I attempted to interview her, we 
ended up going through her lawyer. 
Q 
And just so the grand jury has a little 
bit of background, the interview with the Palm 
Beach Police Department was quite some time ago? 
A 
Yes, it was, in the fall of '05. 
Q 
And when Ms. 
started that 
conversation with the police, she was very 
forthcoming? 
A 
Yes, she was.

Fully cooperative? 
A 
Yes.

And what happened in the middle of that 
interview with the police? 
A 
The police just let 
know that she 
could be charged because

girls to Mr. Epstein and the police -- she was

very cooperative, but the police at that point had 
to let 
know that what she had done that she 
could be facing charges. 
Q 
And that was after they had told her 
earlier that she didn't need an attorney present, 
correct? 
A 
Exactly. 
Q 
Okay. So this happens to her with the 
Palm Beach Police Department and did the Palm 
Beach Police actually present or propose charging

Yes.

Now was a subpoena issued for Ms.

A 
Yes, it was.

And before Ms.

that, did she -- did her attorney request some 
sort of order?

And let me show you the order, that is a

Now 
the immunity that has been provided for Ms. 
keeps her statements that are made here from being 
used against her? 
A 
Yes, it does.

It doesn't -- if she commits perjury and 
she lies to the grand jury, can she still be

Yes, she can.

Q 
And are you here today on the continuing 
investigation known as Operation Leap Year? 
A 
Yes, I am. 
Q 
And you are one of the case agents on this 
investigation, correct? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009513

A 
Yes, I am. 
Q 
The last time you were here we were discussing 
the evidence supporting various overt acts and charges 
related to Jane Does number 1 and 2? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Today we are going to start with Jane Doe 
number 3. Can you tell the Grand Jury who that is and 
summarize briefly your previous testimony about her. 
A 
Jane Doe number 3 is 
I and she first 
started, we have first phone contact with 
starting in December of 2004, IIIIIII would have been 16 
or 17 at that time, let me do the math real quick, she 
would have been 16 -- sorry, I am sorry, she would have 
been at that time 17, let's get it right, so she started 
phone contact, 
started calling her in 
September of 2004. 
From testimony we know that 
went there 
earlier, much earlier. 
I, which was Jane Doe 
number 4 you will hear about next, they were good 
friends and they both went in the spring of '04, prior 
to 
17th birthday, so 
did start giving 
mr. Epstein massages when she was 16, she performed a 
few massages for Mr. Epstein and then took kind of a 
little bit of a break. 
The sexual activity that occurred with 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE

Mr. Epstein when 
was under the age of 18 
included 
she was given gifts by Mr. Epstein, she was 
given a 
, she was given Victoria Secret 
underwear, she was also given a car that Mr. Epstein 
rented for her for a number of months, she was paid $200 
by Mr. Epstein and 
was the one that primarily 
called 
to set up appointments and as you can see 
that began in December of '04. 
was also one of Mr. Epstein's 
favorites, according to several of the other girls. 
Q 
Just so the Grand Jury has an idea, how does 
that translate into the number of phone calls between 
and 
that you were able to calculate? 
A 
called her, I guess calls between 
the two of them ranged around 125 phone calls from 
December 6th, 2004 until October, 2005. 
Q 
And just briefly can you remind the Grand Jury 
did 
ever tell Mr. Epstein her age? 
A 
No, they did not ever discuss, she did not 
tell him how old she was, but she did tell him where she 
planned on going to school and that she was in 
she stated that when it came to her age that 
Mr. Epstein didn't care. As I mentioned earlier, 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009515

S 
and IIIIIII were very good friends and IIIII would talk 
about IIIIIII and Mr. Epstein would ask questions about 
when IIIII was providing massages and as we will 
talk about when we talk about Jane Doe number 4, which 
is 
, she told Mr. Epstein that she was a junior in 
high school and that 
and her were in the 
and that they were 
and 
told us that at one point IIIII had come to 
her because she had slipped about prom and she was 
worried because Epstein was supposed to think she was 18 
and she had talked about the prom and 
said she 
never heard anything else about it and they never 
brought it up. 
Q 
Because, according to 
, Mr. Epstein 
didn't care really how old the girls were? 
A 
Exactly. 
Q 
And she never mentioned he asked her for her 
age or asked for any form of identification to show 
whether she was or was not over 18? 
A 
No. 
Q 
Now, if you could turn to the proposed 
indictment and if I could ask you to look at overt act 
number 59. 
A 
we had a little knock at the door 
Do you 
want me to get it? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009516

Q 
Yes. 
(Thereupon, there was a brief pause.) 
A 
I will let you see a picture of Jane Doe 
number 4, 
, who we were talking about earlier, and 
this is 
. Is there anyplace you want to put it 
right down here in front? 
- 
Q 
And just so the record is clear, those are the 
photographs that we showed to the Grand Jury last week? 
A 
Yes, it is. 
Q 
So if you could turn to overt act number 59 
which appears on page 12, and if you could explain to 
the Grand Jury the evidence we have related to that 
phone call or phone calls on December 6th, 2004. 
A 
On December 6th, 2004 a review of the phone 
records indicate that there was telephonic phone contact

IIIIII and M= 
en December 14th, 2004. 
Q 
And just so that it is clear to the Grand 
Jury, when the overt acts says that defendant IIIIII 
made one or more telephone calls, that means that the 
call is originating from IIIII 
phone, is that 
correct? 
A 
Yes, it does. 
Q 
And if you could turn to overt act number 71. 
A 
On December 20th a review of the phone records 
indicate that there was telephonic contact between III'S

related to the phone calls which would be 94, 100, 102, 
104, 112, 118, 125, 129 and 132 is the evidence the

Q 
Now, if I could direct your attention to Count 
number 7 which appears on page 26 of the draft 
indictment, that is a charge of indictment of a minor 
during the period of December 6th, 2004 through June 2nd 
of 2005, could you summarize for the Grand Jury the

assistants as well and she made appointments for him for 
these massages.

we also have the sexual conduct between

count, Count 7. 
Q 
Now, if I could direct your attention to Count 
number 51 which appears on page 33, that is the sex 
trafficking of a minor involving Jane Doe number 3, and 
could you briefly summarize that, the evidence related 
to that. 
A 
As we discussed earlier in count 7, I told you 
guys about the sexual conduct between Epstein and

by 
Mr. Epstein, the phone activity we discussed between

and we also have phone calls beginning in January from

was 17 
years of age, and we also have statements from

regarding Mr. Epstein's knowledge of their

ages. 
Q 
And with respect to the affect on interstate 
commerce related to that count we have both the 
telephone calls, correct? 
S 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
As well as Mr. Epstein actually traveling in 
interstate commerce to engage in this activity, correct? 
A 
Yes, we do. 
Q 
Is there anything else that you would like to 
mention about Jane Doe number 3? 
A 
Not at this time, no. 
Q 
If I could direct you to Jane Doe number 4 and 
if you could summarize for the Grand Jury the 
information related to Jane Doe number 4's activities. 
A 
Jane Doe number 4 is IIIII I, I think you 
wanted their birth dates, her birth date is 
, she was 16 years old and attended 
we first have contact through phone calls from 
to 
on April 25th, 2004 which 
indicates and shows that 
was clearly 16 years of 
age when she started going to Mr. Epstein's and 
performing massages for Mr. Epstein. 
I, our Jane Doe number 1, was the one 
who recruited 
, she basically told 
that she

could make $200, she needed to dress cute, he might try 
to touch you, but if you feel uncomfortable just let him 
know and he will stop, and the first massage that 
did he repeatedly told 
, and I mentioned this to 
you in the last Grand Jury session, she was very shy and 
he would repeatedly tell her not to be so shy, that she 
didn't have to be so shy. 
Epstein asked her to remove her clothing and 
she told him no, and throughout the massage he would 
repeatedly grab at her, 
he did 
through this first massage and pulled her 
clothes, she would pull away and she was paid $200 for 
that. 
Upon leaving the first massage Mr. Epstein 
told 
that if 
was willing to do more she 
would get paid more. He also informed 
that if she 
would bring her pretty friends he would also pay her for 
bringing her pretty friends. He told 
that 
would get her phone number. 
says that she performed three to four 
massages for Mr. Epstein. we have with 
approximately a hundred phone calls between 
and 
when I interviewed 
she became very upset 
when we got to the sexual massages that she did for 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009529

Mr. Epstein. At this point, this is as much as we know 
at this point of what occurred with Mr. Epstein and 
she did three to four massages and those last 
massages they became more sexual in nature, he asked her 
again to remove her clothing, this time she took her 
shirt off, he asked her to take her bra off, she said 
no. 
He again would 
, he did continue 
this time 
she 
He continued to compliment 
her, tell her she had a nice body and that she was 
pretty. 
says that he was very nice and engaged 
her in conversation, asked her, you know, if she had a 
boyfriend. In the last massage she discusses with me, 
and this massage Mr. Epstein told her to stop being shy 
and asked her to take her clothes off and 
said 
that she had a boyfriend and she didn't feel comfortable 
taking her clothes off and he told her you should know 
what to expect by now when you come here, and he jerked 
on her pants as to like jerk them down, so she did on 
this last massage get down to her bra and underwear. 
She describes his tone at this time being 
frustrated and irritated, she stayed in her bra and

underwear, but during the massage he grabbed her bra and 
pulled it down and 
, he had 
instructed her to 
while she 
was massaging his chest, he tried to grab her all over, 
he knew that she was upset with this massage. 
At one point Mr. Epstein asked her if she had 
sex with her boyfriend, 
informs him that she is 
still a virgin and he responds what, you don't like sex? 
And that's pretty much the way that last massage went. 
Q 
Now, Special Agent 
, just to 
interrupt you, you mentioned that lane Doe number 4 
became very upset as you were asking her about the 
massages, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And when she was describing this incident with 
him grabbing at her breast and trying to pull her pants 
down and instructing her to remove her pants, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
You had talked last week about the expert that 
you had spoken with about interviewing victims of these 
types of offenses? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
And you had told us about how a victim may be 
reticent at first to tell the entire story until a 
rapport is built? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009531

A 
Right. 
Q 
Can you tell the Grand Jury your impressions 
of your interview with 
A 
She became so visibly upset, and a lot of the 
girls are embarrassed of what took place, but when she 
talked about the last massage and him grabbing her 
breasts and fondling her breasts she was in tears and we 
stopped the massage and we calmed her down, trying to go 
back there was just too difficult, I could not get her 
back to discussing anything further that had taken 
place. 
I have since then -- I have since talked to 
again and I feel there is more there, but I just 
don't think she is ready to disclose what took place. 
Q 
So based upon the more than 60 telephone calls 
as well as --
A 
Approximately a hundred. 
Q 
-- 100 telephone calls and your conversations 
with 
you think there is probably more than four 
massages that happened? 
A 
Yes, I do. 
Q 
was there anything else that you wanted to 
discuss with the Grand Jury? 
A 
Just, as I stated in the beginning of those 
massages, they engaged in conversation and throughout 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
Copy I of 13 
EFTA00009532

that conversation, you know, she did inform mr. Epstein 
that she was a junior in high school and again she is 
one of the girls that talks about 
being Mr. 
Epstein's favorite, so because Mr. Epstein knew they 
were friends they would engage in conversation about 
, and 
would mention they were in the 
and they would discuss the friendship 
they had between the two girls with Mr. Epstein and 
think that's it. 
Q 
All right. If we could turn to the 
post-indictment to overt act number 4 which appears on 
page number 5. 
Did you obtain telephone records for Jane Doe 
number 4? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And did you compare those with the phone 
records of 
and others? 
A 
Yes, I did. 
Q 
And can you tell us with respect to overt act 
number 4 what evidence you have related to that?

there was telephonic contact between the numbers

to that. 
A 
we discussed in Count 8 the sexual conduct 
that occurred between 
and Epstein during the 
massages that took place, we talked about the money that 
was paid to her by Mr. Epstein and the offer of more 
money if she would do more as well as if she would bring 
her friends. 
Through 
statements we have also that 
has paid her in the past for bringing a

Mr. Epstein that she was a junior in high school, that 
she was 
, and then 
statements that 
was concerned because she was 
discussing prom with Mr. Epstein, and both girls at that 
time of the phone calls were under the age of 18. 
Q 
Just again so it is clear for the Grand Jury, 
neither 
nor 
ever specifically said hey, 
Jeffrey, I am 17, but they provided information that 
should have caused him to try to figure out whether in

A 
Yes. 
Q 
Any questions about Jane Doe number 4 before

A GRAND JUROR: I have to say something here, 
if it is a stupid question forgive me if it is, 
from what I heard, maybe I heard wrong, there were 
three to four massages that Jane Doe,

I said that she had and you enumerated quite 
a few sexual contact. 
How do you know about this, do you have

four massages.

there is 20 phone calls. 
A GRAND JUROR: There is tons of them. 
THE WITNESS: Exactly, that is what we were 
discussing earlier when we discussed that there is 
more than what 
is willing to admit at this 
time.

only had three to four.

that you described that 
went through, that is what 
she said happened during those three to four massages, 
correct? 
A 
Right. 
Q 
Does that answer your question? 
A GRAND JUROR: Not really. How do we know 
like about all these 25, 30? 
A GRAND JUROR: There is more dates that match 
up with the amount of massages. 
A GRAND JUROR: There were a hundred phone 
calls. 
A GRAND JUROR: Are we supposed to assume a 
phone call was made each time they had sexual 
contact? 
THE WITNESS: No. There are lots of phone 
calls made arranging appointments between the 
girls, that doesn't mean that every phone call that

was made was a trip over to Mr. Epstein's house to 
perform a massage. 
: Yes, ma'am. 
A GRAND JUROR: Couldn't they put anything in 
this indictment about stalking her, are there any 
rules against stalking children? 
: I will address -- that is a 
legal question that I will address when the special 
Agent is outside of the Grand Jury. Any other 
factual questions related? 
A GRAND JUROR: I don't have a question 
relating to Jane Doe number 4, it was a question 
asked last week, what does Mr. Epstein do for work, 
how does he make his money? I asked that late, 
late in the game last week. 
: okay, I guess we can just 
address that now.

Yes, ma'am. 
A GRAND JUROR: Count 28 I thought I heard

Police Department as one of the girls who had frequented 
Mr. Epstein's house. 
Q 
How exactly did the Palm Beach Police Department 
determine that she was one of those girls? 
A 
When they did their search warrant at 
Mr. Epstein's residence, some message pads were obtained 
at his residence, and they had several calls from a girl 
named

track back those messages back to

Did the Palm Beach Police Department try to 
interview Miss

Did she agree to speak with them?

and that she would not say anything positive or negative 
about what occurred. 
Q 
After the FBI became involved in this 
investigation, did you try to interview Miss

We did, as well, with no such luck, as well. 
Q 
How long ago was it that you first made contact 
with Miss

It was back in November of '06.

Did you try to serve her with a subpoena issued 
on behalf of this grand jury? 
A 
Yes, we did.

But she was notified of when her appearance was expected

She refused service of the grand jury subpoena. 
here, and a subpoena was left with her. 
Q 
After that, did she obtain an attorney? 
A 
Yes, she did. 
Q 
Who was that? 
A 
Jim Eisenberg. He's a well-known defense 
attorney here in West Palm Beach. 
Q 
Who paid for that attorney? 
A 
Mr. Epstein is paying for 
attorney. 
Q 
Now once Miss 
secured the attorney, did 
she agree to be interviewed? 
A 
Yes, she did, after she was granted 6001 
immunity. She requested immunity. 
Q 
Did the justice department authorize that grant 
of immunity? 
A 
Yes, they did. 
Q 
After that, did she agree to be interviewed? 
A 
Yeah. It was only after she was given that 
immunity that she would talk with us. 
Q 
When did the interview take place? 
A 
It took place at the end of April of this year, 
so just a few weeks ago. 
Q 
Who was present at that interview?

Q 
what did Miss 
tell you about Jeffrey 
Epstein? 
A 
She stated that she had met an individual by the 
name of 
at a party who had asked her if she 
wanted to make a few bucks by giving a man a massage. She 
was told that Mr. Epstein preferred them to be topless, 
and she agreed to go to his house to give him a massage. 
Q 
How old did Miss 
tell you she was at that 
time? 
A 
She stated she was 16 when she first started 
giving Mr. Epstein massages. 
Q 
Based upon your review of the evidence, is that 
correct? 
A 
No. We have phone records where 
(phonetic), Mr. Epstein's assistant, is contacting 
on her cell phone, or using her cell phone to call 
cell phone starting in April of 2004, which makes 
15. 
Q 
So she said that she was 16, but your evidence 
shows that she was 15, and she said that she was told she 
could make a few bucks giving a topless massage? 
A 
Yes. 
EFTA00009555

Page 7 
Q 
What else did Miss MN 
tell you? 
A 
That she went to Mr. Epstein's residence, that 
took her there the first time, that when she went 
upstairs she was paid $200 when she first got there by 
Then she goes upstairs, and Mr. Epstein 
comes in, he disrobes, puts on a towel, lays down on the 
massage table and she begins to massage him. 
She tells Epstein that she heard he likes 
topless massages, and he told her that he did. And she 
said, 'who wouldn't?• And she ended up taking off her top 
during the first massage. But 
is clear that Mr. 
Epstein did not at any point touch her during the massage.

But does she admit that he

Yes. On the second massage, Mr. Epstein asked

How long of a period of time did Miss 
tell you that she performed massages? 
A 
She wasn't able to give us a number of massages, 
'Mk

but just said that it was a lot, and that she had been 
giving him massages for a year. 
Q 
You mentioned to the grand jury that Miss 
said that Mr. Epstein never touched her, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And she was very adamant about that? 
A 
Yes, she was. 
Q 
Were there other things that she was adamant 
about in her interview with you? 
A 
Well, she talked about what she would tell the 
girls that -- and that she told Mr. Epstein that she was 
18. I'm sorry, I take that back. She was told to say 
that she was 18, and she told us that she had a fake I.D. 
showing that she was 18. 
So she passed that information along to the 
other girls when she brought -- eventually she brought 
other girls to perform massages, and that was one of the 
things that she told -- she told us first that she brought 
18- to 20-year old girls. And then she stated that if the 
girls lied, and they were underage, she told them that 
they needed to tell Epstein that they were 18. 
Q 
Have you been able to identify some of the girls 
that Miss 
brought to Mr. Epstein's home? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Were any of those girls over 18?

A 
No, not that we found so far. 
what Mr. Epstein knew about their ages? 
A 
I'm sorry, say that again. 
Have any of the girls who came through 
been interviewed about what Mr. Epstein knew about 
their ages? 
not sure if he asked them. They were all told to say they 
were 18, but not on every occasion would Mr. Epstein

brought -- this girl told Mr. Epstein that she was in high 
school, and actually told him her true age, which was

So what 
told you about, that wasn't 
A 
No, that wasn't. Sorry. 
Q 
That's all right, I just wanted to make sure 
So Miss 
told you that she had been told 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009558

Page 10 
fake I.D.? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Did she ever say that Mr. Epstein either asked 
for her age or asked to see her I.D.? 
A 
No, the topic never came up. 
Q 
Did you also ask her about how appointments were 
made? 
A 
Yes. She was very clear in the fact that 
would call her to arrange the appointments, but 
that 
would call her once Jeffrey was in town. 
Q 
So she was adamant that the calls only happened 
when she was already here? 
A 
Yes. 
Q. 
Were you made aware that Epstein's counsel was 
informed that he was being investigated for traveling to 
engage in prostitution, which means that the appointments 
1/ 
would have been made before the traveling? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Was there anything else, besides the issue of 
age and the issue of when the appointments were made, that 
sounded coached or that she was especially adamant about? 
A 
No, I wouldn't say coached. I mean, we talked 
about the preferences that Jeffrey discussed, as far as 
which girls he would like 
to bring. 
Once 
started giving massages to Epstein, 
EFTA00009559

Page 11 
told us that he liked different faces, so he would 
ask her to bring other girls. We asked her if he ever 
gave any preferences of what he preferred, and her 
response was that Epstein liked girls like her, which is 
thin and blond and attractive. 
Q 
And how old was she at the time? 
A 
She was 15. 
Q 
So thin, blonde, attractive and --
A 
Young, girls like her. I guess we asked if she 
ever made a mistake, or ever brought somebody that Mr. 
Epstein didn't take to. She said that she had screwed up 
and that she had brought a black girl to Mr. Epstein, and 
that Epstein was not interested in black girls. But he 
did pay her, and said that he wasn't a racist. He paid 
her the $200 for her time, but did not want her to perform 
a massage for him. 
Q 
And he didn't allow that girl to perform a 
massage? 
A 
No. 
Was there anything else that Miss 
talked 
about in the interview that you want to share with the 
grand jury? 
A 
I did ask her at the end of the interview if she 
was in love with Mr. Epstein. She looked into the camera 
and said that she loved him like a friend. But then she 
Copyl of13 
EFTA00009560

Page 12 
kind of looked into the camera and gave a wink and a smile 
and said, "But with your money, I'd marry you any time, 
Jeffrey." 
Q 
Did she also say that she considered him to be 
an •awesome guy'? 
A 
Several times she referred to him as an "awesome 
guy° • 
She said that the girls begged her to come and that 
the girls didn't have a complaint, and the girls would 
share with her everything that happened after the massage, 
and that Jeffrey never touched any of the girls. But as I 
informed you, we did interview some of the girls that she 
took, and he has touched them. 
Q 
In preparation for your testimony today, did you 
also speak with someone who is considered to be an expert 
in these cases? 
A 
YeS. 
Q 
And what is that person's name? 
A 
Q 
Has Mr. 
been qualified to testify as an 
expert in federal and state courts in cases that involve 
what he calls "compliant victims"? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
what does he mean by the term "compliant 
victims"? 
A 
A compliant victim is when a victim is not 
EFTA00009561

Page 13 
necessarily forced into the conduct that the offender 
wants them to engage into, that they actually consent to 
that kind of activity. 
Q 
So that would include minors who are subjected 
to sexual activity but weren't necessarily kidnapped or 
forced at gunpoint, or something like that? 
A 
Exactly. 
Q 
Did he discuss with you the difficulties that 
exist when you interview those types of victims? 
A 
Yes. He stated that a compliant victim is often 
times embarrassed that they went along with the behavior. 
They are also likely to deny the behavior, especially when 
being interviewed by investigators, that they'll deny it 
or they'll minimize it. Sometimes it takes two, three or 
multiple interviews to get compliant victims to either 
trust their interviewer or realize that their interviewer 
is not going to be judgemental. 
Q 
In this case, have you found that to be the case 
with some of the interviews? 
A 
Yes, I have. 
Q 
In addition to being embarrassed, sometimes 
these victims feel guilty about the fact that they were 
involved in this type of activity? 
A 
Oh, yes. 
Q 
Does Mr. 
also have expertise in sexual 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009562

Page 14 
preference of offenders? 
A 
Yes, he does. 
Q 
Did he explain why an offender would select the 
types of victims that are involved in this case, girls 
between 14 and 17-years-old? 
A 
This type of offender, the sexual preference he 
has is for post-pubescent females that are physically 
developed but not necessarily mentally matured. The girls 
ranging in this age are sometimes inexperienced, they are 
possibly naive, not as worldly. 
An offender of this type could also maybe not 
feel sexually adequate or feel competent dealing with his 
own age group. So knowing that these girls are less 
experienced, may focus on them as well. 
Q 
In addition to their emotional immaturity, did 
Mr. 
talk about whether or not younger girls are 
easier to manipulate than grown women? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Did he talk to you about "grooming"? 
A 
Yeah. That's what an offender will use with a 
compliant victim. He told us that grooming is a technique 
where you gain the cooperation of those victims by 
focusing on their interests and playing up to those 
lled it. That 
interests. It's a type of seduction, he ca 
was his words for it. And we actually see this in this 
I 
EFTA00009563

Page 15 
case. 
Can you give us an example of some of the types 
of grooming that Mr. Epstein used? 
A 
With one of the girls we're going to talk about 
today, 
, it's very apparent interviewing her how 
Epstein groomed her. She only went to three or four 
massages at this time, that she's admitted to. We feel 
that due to her phone conversations, the multiple calls, 
that there may be more there. At this point she has 
stated to us that she has performed three or four massages 
for Mr. Epstein. 
what he did is when she first went there he 
played upon -- she was very shy, and he would play upon 
that shyness. He told her that she was pretty. He asked 
her to remove her clothing, and she would not. So he kind 
of kidded around with her shyness and complimented her, 
showed interest in her, talked about her boyfriend and 
different interests she had. 
At the end of that interview, because she did 
not take off her clothes, he tells her that if she's 
willing to do more, she will make more. He also tells her 
that he would pay her if she would bring other girls. As 
the massages increased, you can see that the next time she 
comes he plays again to that shyness, but he gets a little 
bit more -- I guess he sees that it's not working. This 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009564

Page 16 
time she does comply and takes off her -- he asked her to 
disrobe on the second massage. She takes off her blouse, 
but she refuses to take off the bra after Mr. Epstein 
asked her to. 
So you can see that he tries through showing 
interest. And then he actually -- when he sees that this 
isn't working, he takes a more authoritative role with her 
in the last massage. She said that throughout all of 
these massages he was very nice, and then at the end he 
was much more frustrated and irritated. She does get down 
to her bra and panties on that one, he's just much 
more authoritative. 
So he started with the grooming process, tried 
to get her interest, tried to use that to get her to 
comply with removing her clothes. But as often happens, 
at the end of this, he took over and was much more 
forceful with his requests. 
Q 
Have other girls described that same situation 
where every time they went back, he tried to push it one 
step further and one step further? 
A 
Yes. Several of the girls have said that he 
would always push for more and more. 
Q 
Did Mr. 
explain why it is that a 
compliant child victim cannot legally consent to the 
sexual conduct? 
EFTA00009565

Page 17 
A 
Yeah. He stated that -- you know, we talked 
about how the law protects children, and stated that we 
hold adults accountable. When it comes to adolescents, 
they go through normal tendencies that mature offenders 
may try to take advantage of. But the law is in place for 
that reason, to protect -- in the federal law, to protect 
those individuals under the age of 18. 
Q 
And that's because of the different maturity 
levels of the --
A 
The offender versus the victims, exactly. 
Q 
Did you put together the photographs of the 
defendants in this case? 
A 
Yes, I did. 
Q 
Are these photographs of the four human 
defendants who are named in the proposed indictment? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
With their names underneath them? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Agent, who is in the top left-hand corner? 
A 
That's Jeffrey Epstein. 
Q 
when was this photograph taken? 
A 
Recently. There was an article that just came 
out regarding Mr. Epstein and his connection, or his 
personal relationship with Prince Andrew, and that was a 
picture that was in that article. 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009566

Page 18 
Q 
Who is in the top right-hand corner? 
A 
That's 
Q 
Again, this is a relatively recent photograph? 
A 
Yes, that's his personal assistant. 
Q 
And the bottom left-hand corner? 
A 
Again, that is one of Mr. Epstein's personal 
assistants, that's 
(phonetic).
Q 
Has Miss 
since gotten married? 
A 
Yes, her name now is 
Q 
And the bottom right-hand corner? 
A 
That is 
. She is, again, a 
personal assistant to Mr. Epstein. There has been some 
talk that she is also romantically -- or I should say 
sexually involved with Mr. Epstein. 
Q 
How old are the defendants? 
A 
Jeffrey is in his mid-fifties, and the three 
girls are in their early twenties. 
Q 
Do you have a copy of the draft indictment in 
front of you? 
A 
Yes, I do. 
Q 
You mentioned when we were looking at the 
photographs that the three females work as personal 
assistants for Mr. Epstein, is that correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
So he is their employer? 
EFTA00009567

Page 19 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Are you familiar with the property located at 
3S8 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach? 
A 
That's Mr. Epstein residence. 
Q 
And he owns that residence? 
A 
Yes, he does. 
Q 
Are you familiar with Defendant J.E.G.E., Inc.? 
A 
Yes. J.E.G.E., Inc. is owned by Jeffrey 
Epstein. He is the president, the owner, the sole 
director. It's a business that is solely used for the 
activities of one of Mr. Epstein's airplanes, which is his 
Boeing 727. Its tail number is N908JE. 
And you mentioned that he is the president and 
the sole director. Is he also the sole shareholder? 
A 
Yes, he is. 
Are you familiar with Hyperion Air, Inc.? 
A 
Yes. Hyperion Air, Inc. is also a business 
owned by Mr. Epstein. He is also the president, the 
director and the sole shareholder of that company as well. 
That company solely does business with his other aircraft, 
which is a Gulf Stream G-1159B. It bears a tail number 
N909JE. 
Q 
Is that a smaller aircraft than the Boeing? 
A 
Yes. 
Just to briefly remind the grand jury about 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009568

Page 20 
where the evidence has been collected in this case, was 
the start of your investigation information that you 
received from the Palm Beach Police Department? 
A 
Yes, it was. 
Q 
And that included evidence seized during a 
search of Mr. Epstein's home at El Brillo Way? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Also controlled calls that the Palm Beach Police 
Department placed? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And interviews of girls and other people by the 
Palm Beach Police Department? 
A 
Yes, as well as trash pulls that the Palm Beach 
Police Department conducted on Mr. Epstein's residence. 
Q 
Then when the FBI became involved, the FBI did 
additional interviews of girls and of recruiters? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
They obtained phone records? 
A 
Yes, we have. 
Q 
And records of payments? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Did this grand jury also subpoena travel 
records? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Including the flight manifests of the planes

owned by Hyperion and J.E.G.E.? 
pattern of activity by the defendants? 
A 
Yes, we did. 
Q 
So you have a series of phone calls coming from 
these three assistants who were on the board, the two 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Did you also get corporate documents related to 
those two planes? 
A 
Yes, we have. 
Q 
Once you had obtained all of this information, 
did the FBI analyze the data, specifically the call 
information and the flight information to put together a 
girls who have been identified through this investigation? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
When you spoke with those girls, did any of them 
tell you that they had developed some sort of a personal 
relationship with the assistants so that they were just 
chatting over the telephone? 
A 
No, not at all. 
Q 
All of them said what about the phone calls? 
A 
Said that the phone calls were made to set up 
appointments for Mr. Epstein. 
Q 
And the girls referred to it as appointments to 
work, is that right? 
A 
Yes, they were appointments to work. There is 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009570

Page 22 
one exception, 
we're going to talk about her 
probably next week. She did say on one or two occasions 
that 
had called her when she had gone out 
to California on a trip, I believe. But that is the only 
time that that was ever mentioned. In fact, we asked, and 
those phone calls were made for the purpose of setting up 
appointments for Mr. Epstein. 
Q 
Is the investigation continuing? 
A 
Yes, it is. 
Q 
Are you still trying to locate and interview 
more girls? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Let's turn to the specific evidence reporting 
the overt acts and offenses relating to Jane Doe's 1 
through 5. I know that every member of the grand jury has 
a copy of the draft indictment before them, and also a 
chart. 
Do you have a copy of that chart as well? 
A 
I do. 
Q 
Do you have photographs of the five girls that 
we are going to talk about today? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And these are photographs of the people that we 
are calling Jane Doe's 1 through 5? 
A 
Yes. 
EFTA00009571

his planes, did he transport? 
THE WITNESS: To travel around. 
JUROR: So it wasn't like a business of 
transporting other people? 
THE WITNESS: He flew other guests, sometimes 
unaccompanied, sometimes accompanied. 
JUROR: 
and 
do you have 
any evidence that they started young, like the rest 
of the recruits? 
THE WITNESS: We have evidence that they are his 
personal assistants employed by him, not that it was 
anything like what we were discussing. 
JUROR: There was an allegation that was made

earlier, back in February, during one of these 
Can I ask about that? We were told back in February 
BY MS. 
Q 
So turning to Jane Doe Number 1, 
1. You 
testified about her earlier before this grand jury, 
correct? 
A 
Yes, I did. 
Q 
And she also testified before this grand jury, 
correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Can you remind us of her date of birth? 
A 
She was born on 
Q 
Could you briefly refresh the grand jury's 
recollection of how she was recruited? 
A 
She was approached on a beach by 
discussions, about a specific act that was performed. 
that one of the girls when interviewed had alleged 
rape, and I hadn't heard about that allegation 
recently. 
THE WITNESS: That's probably Jane Doe Number 6. 
We're going to talk about her, that he forcibly put 
her on the table and 
Yeah, she will 
be coming up. We're going to do her probably next 
week. She'll be the first one we'll talk about. 
and 
(phonetic). They approached her on a beach 
EFTA00009573

Page 25 
and asked her if she wanted to perform massages for 
Mr. Epstein and make some money. 
Q 
From the review of the phone records that you 
have received, were you able to identify a telephone 
number associated with 
A 
Yes. ' 
Q 
In fact, has 
been interviewed? 
A 
Yes, he has. 
Q 
And has he admitted to being a recruiter for Mr. 
Epstein? 
A 
Yes, recruiter and driver. 
Q 
If you could take a look at Overt Act Number 2, 
which appears on page five. That states, °On or about 
March 12, 2004, defendants Jeffrey Epstein and 
caused Jane Doe Number 1 to travel to 358 Brillo Way of 
Palm Beach, Florida.. 
Can you tell us what evidence you have regarding 
that? 
A 
We have reviewed phone records for 
and 
that indicate the calls took place, as well as phone 
records for 
and 
and calls that took 
place on or about those dates. We've also looked at a 
flight manifest, and were able to show that Mr. Epstein 
arrived the day before, on the 11th. We also have 
statement where she describes the sexual activity that 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009574

Page 26 
took place. 
Q 
On that date, March 12 of 2004, 
described 
going to Mr. Epstein's house and performing a sexual 
massage? 
A 
Yes, on or about that day. 
Q 
On or about that date, what did 
state 
about being paid? 
A 
She was paid $200. 
Q 
And that relates to Overt Act Number 3? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And she stated that Mr. Epstein is the person 
who gave her that? 
A 
She told us that in her statement. 
Q 
If you could take a look at Overt Act Number 95, 
which is on page 17. On or about February 6, 2005, 
Epstein had Jane Doe Number 1 to make one or more 
telephone calls to Jane Doe Number 2. 
First of all, who is Jane Doe Number 2? 
A 
That would be 
, our youngest victim. 
Q 
Can you tell us what evidence you have related 
to that overt act? 
A 
We have the girl's statements that calls were 
made. We also reviewed the phone records that indicated 
that there was telephonic contact between the numbers 
belonging to 
and 
EFTA00009575

Page 27 
Q 
And in the statement of both girls, did they 
describe that 
is the person who called 
looking for someone to come and work at Mr. Epstein's 
house? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Looking at Overt Act Number 96. On or about 
February 6, 2005, Epstein caused Jane Doe Number 1 to 
transport Jane Doe Number 2 to 358 El Brillo way. 
What is the evidence related to that? 
A 
Again, the statements of 
and 
support 
that as further evidence, and also reviewing the phone • 
2 
records they indicate that there was telephonic contact 
between 
and 
and 
and 
Q 
Overt Act Number 97, on or about February 6, 
2005, Epstein made a payment of $300 to Jane Doe Number 2 
and a payment of $200 to Jane Doe Number 1. 
what was the evidence of that? 
A 
Both 
and 
stated in their statements 
that 
was paid $300, and 
was paid $200 for 
bringing 
Q 
Did 
explain why she was paid $300? 
A 
Yes, she was paid $300 because she performed her 
massage. Mr. Epstein 
and 
a 
on 
Q 
After this date, after February 6, 2005, was 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009576

Page 28 
$300 found in 
purse when it was searched at her 
school? 
A 
Yes, it was, by a school administrator. 
Q 
If you could look at Overt Act Number 117, which 
is on page 19, and that states that on or about March 30, 
2005, 
caused one or more calls to be made to a 
telephone used by Jane Doe Number 1. 
what evidence do you have related to that? 
A 
We reviewed the phone records of 
and 
that indicate this. 
Q 
And Overt Act 120, on or about March 31, 
caused one or more calls to be made to a telephone used by 
Jane Doe Number 1. 
A 
Again, we reviewed the phone records that 
indicated there was telephonic contact between the numbers 
belonging to 
and 
Q 
Then we have Overt Act Number 122, which is also 
March 31, that Epstein and 
caused Jane Doe Number 1 
to make a call to a telephone used by Jane Doe Number 2. 
What evidence do you have related to that? 
A 
We have phone records that we have reviewed 
belonging to 
and 
. In this case, we also have a 
voice mail that was provided to us by the Palm Beach 
Police Department, a voice mail of 
mail message on 
phone. 
leaving a voice 
EFTA00009577

Page 29 
And Overt Act Number 123 refers to April 1st. 
what evidence do you have related to that? 
A 
we have reviewed the phone records of 
and 
that indicate telephonic contact was made on this 
day. We also again have another recorded voice mail by 
, left on 
phone. 
• 
These later calls, the March-April calls, are 
those the controlled calls that the Palm Beach Police 
Department was involved in? 
A 
There was controlled calls placed to 
cell phone and to 
place of work by 
under the 
supervision of the Palm Beach Police Department. 
Q 
And the voice mail message that you referred to 
of 
calling 
, what information was 
leaving 
in that voice mail message? 
A 
was asking for 
to get back in touch, 
that she had set up an appointment for 
at Epstein's 
house on the following day, on that Saturday at around 
10:30 or 11:00. 
Q 
In addition to the phone records, was there 
anything that the Palm Beach Police Department found that 
also confirmed that this appointment actually was made. 
A 
As I mentioned earlier, the Palm Beach Police 
Department was doing trash pulls on Mr. Epstein's 
residence. In there, there were two messages or notes in 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009578

Page 30 
there on Epstein's personalized stationary. On it it 
said, " 
with 
on Saturday at 10:30, and 
on 
Saturday with 
at 10:30." That's the exact message on 
the two notes that were found in his trash when they 
retrieved it on April 8. 
Q 
If I could direct your attention to Count Number 
Five, which appears on page 26. That is the charge of 
enticement of a minor, referring to Jane Doe Number 1, and 
Mr. Epstein and 
are charged. 
I know that you talked about the telephone 
traffic. The calls between 
and 
, did 
they fall within that March 7 through March 11 time 
period? 
A 
A review of their telephone records do indicate 
that there were phone calls made during that time. 
Q 
And Jane Doe Number 1 actually went to Mr. 
Epstein's home? 
A 
Yes, and performed a massage for him in the 
nude. 
Q 
And she was paid for that? 
A 
Yes, she was paid $200. 
Q 
And he 
, correct? 
A 
Yes, he did. I would like to include that 
took 
upstairs for that massage, and she also 
set up the massage table and arranged the oil and lotions 
EFTA00009579

Page 31 
for IIIII to do that massage. 
Q 
And also, just so it's clear, how old was 
at that time? 
A 
She was 17. 
: Are there any questions about 
either how that evidence was presented or about the 
charges related to Jane Doe Number 1? Seeing no 
questions, we'll turn to Jane Doe Number 2. 
BY. 
Q 
You previously mentioned that that was 
112
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Let's turn to Count Number Six, which is on page 
26, which is the enticement of 
■ 
If you could tell 
the grand jury about the evidence related to that. 
A 
date of birth is 
Q 
So during this period of February 5, 2005 to the 
6th, how old was she? 
A 
She was 14. 
Q 
Can you remind the grand jury about the evidence 
related to the enticement of 
A 
As we stated earlier, we talked about the 
telephone calls. We have shown that the facility of 
interstate commerce was used by the telephone calls made 
by their cell phones. We examined specifically 
and 
. Those calls were made to

set up and arrange appointments for Mr. Epstein to have 
his massages. 
Pertaining to 
, during the massage that 
occurred on those dates, February 6, in particular, I 
think I have discussed with you before what occurred on 
that, that he 
it -- and that he 
He did 
-- and that was his term for 
during that massage, and she 
. She was paid $300, and we know that she was 14 
at the time. 
Q 
If we could turn to Count Number 43, which 
appears on page 31. Count 43 is one of the travel counts. 
If you could tell the grand jury, did a trip occur on 
March 31, 2005? 
A 
Yes, we have flight records that indicate a 
flight occurred on that date. 
Q 
what type of plane was used? 
A 
I'm going to refer to the J.E.G.E., Incorporated 
aircraft as just the Boeing 727. If we talk about the 
Hyperion Air, Incorporated aircraft, which is the Gulf 
Stream, I will just say the Gulf Stream. So on that date 
he did travel on his Boeing 727, on 3-31. 
Q 
And Mr. Epstein was aboard the plane on that 
day? 
EFTA00009581

I.
Page 33 
A 
Yes, he was. 
Q 
With respect to the March 31st trip, was there 
evidence of him setting up the appointment with 
prior 
to that trip? 
A 
we do have telephonic contact between illilland 
EMI 
as well as 
and 
on the day before 
and the day of travel. 
Q 
And even though that appointment was never kept, 
that 
never went to that appointment, you have the 
notes that were retrieved from the garbage that showed 
that Mr. Epstein was expecting 
to show up for that 
appointment? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Anything else with respect to that particular 
count? 
A 
We also have the controlled calls and the voice 
mails. 
Q 
Turning to Count Number 60, which appears on 
page 34, that is the attempted enticement of 
during the period of March 30 to April 1. 
Again, at that point, 
■was how old? 
A 
She was 14. 
Q 
And we had talked about the telephone calls that 
were used. One Of the things that is relevant to this 
particular count was that in addition to the fact that 
Copy 1 of 13 
EFTA00009582

Page 34 
was 14, did you interview a girl who went with 
when she went to Mr. Epstein's house back in 
February? 
A 
Yes, we did, that would be 
Q 
And 
was interviewed? 
A 
Yes, she was interviewed by the Palm Beach 
Police Department. 
Q 
What did 
say about 
appearance? 
A 
That she was the youngest looking girl that 
came. 
Q 
When you talked with 
, did 
talk about 
girls that Mr. Epstein liked in particular? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And was 
one of those girls? 
A 
Yes, she was one of his preferences. 
also 
told us that Mr. Epstein said to her on one occasion, "The 
younger, the better." 
Q 
And there was never any attempt to get 
I.D. or to confirm her actual age? 
A 
NO. 
Q 
As we discussed before, 
never actually went 
to that point, right, so that is just an attempt? 
A 
Yes. 
■ 
: Are there any questions from the 
grand jury? Seeing no questions, we'll see you next

to Mr. Epstein. 
Q . 
Okay. And Let me just go back over that 
a little bit. You mentioned that you had two 
acquaintances, 
and 
, and you met them at 
a beach resort, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And you said that they made a 
proposition to you. What was that exactly? 
A

money and she was working for this guy, Epstein, 
in Palm Beach. So I told her I was interested and 
she further went into detail about massaging him, 
that you would have to take off articles of 
clothing and there would be touching and fondling 
involved.

previously worked for Epstein or was currently 
working for Epstein? 
A 
Yes, that's right. 
Q 
So they explained this proposal to you 
and you said that you would be interested? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
What happened next? 
A 
Within a couple of days to a week I 
picked them up and I went to his house to work for 
him and I was introduced to 
, who is his 
assistant. She took me upstairs to Epstein's 
bedroom and that's where the massage took place. 
I was naked and he tried fondling me and 
I wouldn't have it, so after the massage he gave 
me another proposition to bring girls to the house 
and for every girl that I brought I would make 
$200. 
Q 
All right. We'll go back over that a 
little more slowly. 
I know this is a lot of 
information. So let's go back to the proposition 
that 
and 
made to you. 
Did they say you would be paid for 
massaging Mr. Epstein? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And how much would you be paid?

S 
a 
A 
$200. 
Q 
Now you said that they had told you that 
you might have to take your clothing off? 
A 
They told me that I was expected to take 
my clothing off and that there would be fondling. 
Q 
Okay. And what -- did they explain 
what fondling meant? 
A 
Just that he'd be touching me. 
Q 
Okay. 
And so you agreed to do that and 
you went to Mr. Epstein's home?

Correct. 
Q 
And where was that located?

the doorbell and 
answered the door and we 
were standing in the kitchen and then 
brought me upstairs.

tell you anything about what you would do when you 
got upstairs? 
A 
No, she never discussed that with me. 
Q 
Did she say anything to you about taking 
your clothes off? 
A 
No, she never discussed that with me. 
Q 
Okay. 
When you arrived upstairs, you 
said that you went into a bedroom? 
A 
That is correct. 
• 
Q 
What was in the bedroom? 
A 
It was a bedroom that had a door that 
led to then I want to say a bigger more than just 
a bathroom. It was a bigger room with like a 
pretty large size walk-in closet, a shower, a 
steam shower, and then two sinks. on the right, and 
in the middle laid the massage table, and then to 
the left there was two couches. 
Q 
And so the massage table was already set 
up when you arrived? 
A 
That is correct. 
Q 
Okay. 
And after 
bedroom, what did she do? 
led you up to the 
A 
She had left and that's when Epstein 
came in.

what was he wearing? 
A 
He was wearing a towel. 
Q 
Okay. And nothing else? 
A 
Nothing else. 
Q 
And what did he do? 
A 
He laid on the table and that's when the 
massage began and later on he -- when he got in, I 
took off my clothes and I was just wearing my 
bottoms, and he later tried to touch me and he 
grabbed my butt, and that's when. I had a problem. 
I told him that I didn't feel comfortable. 
So later he took the towel off and he 
was laying on his back and he 
asking me to 
and then after that everything 
was done. 
Q 
Okay. So when Mr. Epstein 
then the massage or whatever was over? 
A 
Yes, it was. 
Q 
And once that happened, what did he do? 
A 
Just got up and dried himself off and 
then walked me downstairs. 
Q 
And you got dressed as well? 
A 
That's right.

happened? 
A 
I went back into the kitchen and he 
pulled 
and 
aside and then we just left. 
Of course, I got paid. 
Q 
Okay. And tell us where you got paid, 
who paid you, and how much you received? 
A 
Epstein paid me. 
I received 200, but I 
cannot recall if it was upstairs that he paid me 
or if he waited until I got back downstairs. 
Q 
Okay. And when he paid you the $200,
was it in small bills, large bills? 
A 
Big bills, 100s. 
Q 
Okay. So two 100 dollar bills. 
And you 
said that he pulled 
and 
aside. Do you 
know what that was about? 
A 
He would never pay them in front of me. 
He always was funny about that. So I'm sure it 
was just paying them for bringing me. 
Q 
Okay. 
And you mentioned that you told 
Mr. Epstein that you were uncomfortable with him 
touching you? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
And what bec.ame of that? 
A 
Later on before I left he had addressed 
me to not massage him anymore, but asked me if I

could bring girls over, and for every girl that I 
brought to the table he would pay me $200. 
•
Q 
Okay. So you weren't comfortable with 
him touching you, so you weren't going to do any 
more massages? 
A 
No. 
Q 
He wanted you to find other girls? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
And he wanted girls that would let him 
touch them? 
A 
Uh-huh. 
• 
Q 
After that first massage, did you 
perform any other massages at his house? 
A 
Absolutely not.. 
Q 
Did you bring girls? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
Tell us how you started to bring girls 
to Mr. Epstein's house. 
A 
Just girls that I met in high school, 
acquaintances, people that I just said hi and bye 
to. 
A lot of them actually heard about it through 
a couple of girls that I brought and they were 
interested. 
Some of the girls asked me about it. 
Just girls in school I'd talk to, just get on the

subject. They had no problem with it. 
Q 
Okay. So when you found a girl that you 
thought would be interested, what exactly would 
you tell her? 
A 
I asked them if they were interested in 
making extra money and that I knew an older 
wealthier man in Palm Beach who liked to have 
massages and they would get paid $200. 
The more they did, the more they make, 
and I would explain to them in detail what was 
expected of them when they showed up at the house 
and I also told them that if they are under age 
just lie about it and tell him that you are 18 
Q 
Let's talk first about what you said 
that you tell them what was expected of them. 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
First of all, why did you tell them 
that? 
A 
Because that's what I was told 
O 
By whom? 
A 
and 
Q 
Okay. And did Jeffrey Epstein ever 
address you about don't bring girls over here if 
they don't know what's going to happen? 
A 
Absolutely.

Q 
Okay. So all the girls were supposed to 
know that when they got there they would be 
undressing? 
A 
They would be undressing. There would 
be. touching. There would be fondling. He was 
very big on that. He told me never to bring a 
girl over unless they knew what was expected. 
Q 
Okay. And did you also tell them that 
he would 
A 
I didn't really talk to them about that. 
I didn't know if he did it with everybody or it 
was just with me that he did that. 
Q 
But you told them that they all would 
have to be partially naked or fully naked? 
A 
Partially to fully naked and there would 
be touching and fondling. 
Q 
Okay. How many girls do you think you 
took to Mr. Epstein's house? 
A 
Seven, between seven to ten. 
Q 
Okay. And were there any -- in addition 
to this rule about the girls had to know what was 
expected, did Mr. Epstein have any other rules in 
terms of what the girls looked like or what he 
liked? 
A 
No.

Q 
Okay. Were there girls that you brought 
that he didn't like? 
A 
There were a few girls he wasn't crazy 
about. He didn't really like. He didn't favor. 
for instance, 23, he thought she was kind 
of too old. 
Q 
Okay. So you brought a girl named 
who was 23 years old? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And you were told that she was too old? 
A 
Yes.
Q 
Did you ever bring her back? 
A 
No. 
Q 
What about any other girls that he 
didn't like? 
A 
This other girl T went to high school 
with, III, she was maybe a year younger, and him 
and her got 
. I told 
her in detail what was expected and she, to me, 
was all for it and then when she got there, 
decided she didn't want to perform what was 
necessary. So they got 
and after that I never really brought her 
Q 
Okay. 
And did either Jeffrey Epstein

1 
or 
say anything to you about what happened 
with III? 
A 
He had made a comment just about 
had asked -- he had asked me for someone to come 
over and work and when I suggested III, he kind of 
nodded, not really interested. He told me to find 
somebody else. So I assumed that meant he really 
didn't care for her. 
Q 
Okay. Now the -- you mentioned 
who was 23. What was the age range of the other 
girls that you brought to Mr. Epstein's home? 
A 
High school, 16 to 18. 
Q 
Were there any girls who were younger 
than that? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
A 
Q 
And how was she? 
A' 
She was 14. 
Who was that? 
Q 
Okay. Now you were interviewed by the 
Palm Beach Police Department? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
And during that interview, you told them 
that there were two ways to make money with 
Jeffrey Epstein. Can you explain to the grand

a 
1 
jury what those two ways are? 
A 
The more you did is the more you make. 
Basically, the more clothes that come off, the 
more you let him touch you, the more you just let 
him have his way with you is the more that you 
would make, otherwise, you would be demoted down 
to bringing girls over and just making money that 
way. 
Q 
And that's what you were doing? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
Was bringing girls? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
If you could explain to the grand jury 
how you would go about making an appointment for a 
girl to come and give a massage? 
A 
His assistant there would call me either 
before they got into town or while he was in town 
and either she would ask me for a particular girl, 
preferably one that he favored, or if I couldn't 
get a hold of that girl just bring somebody over 
to work. 
I would call the girl. She would okay 
it. 
I would call 
back, confirm it, set an 
appointment, and then the next couple of days we'd 
go.

would request a specific girl? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
Did she give you any reason why he 
really liked this girl or just is this girl 
available? What would happen on those calls? 
A 
If it was a specific girl, she would 
call me and just ask: Can this girl work? She 
would never give me a reason. She would never go 
into detail. It was just: Can she work, yes or 
no?

girl over to the house, what would you do? 
A 
Walk up the same way towards the back of

for 
to come in or Jeffrey. Most of the time

girl would come downstairs. I would get paid and 
then we would leave. 
Q 
Tell us how you would get paid when you 
were the person who brought the girls. 
A 
What do you mean how I would get paid? 
Q 
Who would pay you? 
A 
Jeffrey Epstein would pull me aside 
whether it be in his, I guess, living room slash 
office. He would just make sure that when he paid 
me, it was just me and him, nobody else was 
around. 
• 
And how much would you get paid for each 
girl? 
A 
$200-

Like I said, the more you do, the more you make. 
There were a couple of girls that got paid 300, 
400, and then there were a couple of girls that 
got paid 200 maybe even 100. 
Q 
Now you mentioned that usually 
would take the girl upstairs? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
Were there ever instances where you took 
the girl upstairs? 
A 
Very rarely. I think it happened once 
or twice where 
was doing something or she 
would need me to go upstairs and set up. 
I would 
just go upstairs. 
I would show her where the

I would set it up for them. 
I would 
show them where the towels were, put the towels on 
the massage table and then I would tell them 
Jeffrey would be in, in a minute and then I would 
walk back downstairs and wait in the kitchen. 
Q 
Okay. And when you were in these other 
instances where you led the girl upstairs, besides 
the massage table, did you ever see any other 
implements that were used during the massage? 
A 
I think there were maybe a few occasions 
where I would walk upstairs to show the girl or 
maybe it was even when I first massaged him, there 
was like a white

Q 
Okay. 
Now I'm going to run through the 
names of some girls that you brought just to 
confirm with the grand jury that you brought them.

A 
Yes. 
A 
Yes.

Q 
And then there is another girl, 
A 
never, ever, ever worked for 
Jeffrey. She accompanied me to his house I think 
once or twice and waited in the kitchen with me, 
but she never worked for him. 
Q 
Okay. But she was somebody that you 
brought along with you?

That is correct. 
Q 
On visits? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Okay. In addition to those girls 
that -- who I just named, you mentioned a woman, 
, who is 23? 
A 
Uh-huh. 
Q 
Were there any other girls that you 
recall bringing to Jeffrey Epstein's house? 
A 
I cannot recall bringing anybody else. 
Q 
Okay. Now one of those girls that we 
mentioned .was 
correct?

Yes. 
Q 
And you told the police that Jeffrey 
liked 
the best? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
How old was 
A 
She was around the same age as me, maybe 
a grade lower than me. 
Q 
Okay.  So she was under age? 
A 
Yes, correct. 
Q 
And all of those girls who names I read 
were under age when you brought them there?

About 5'5, 5'6.

specifically ask for her, correct.

the girls told you about the

only got paid $100 and she felt like she was being 
ripped off. 
Q 
Okay. What about

she tell you about what happened?

Yes.

What did she explain to you?

massager, but I wasn't really paying attention. 
Q 
Now when you first went and gave Mr. 
Epstein the massage, did he ask for your telephone 
number after you were finished? 
A 
No, 
did. 
did. And she took down your 
telephone number? 
A 
She took down my name and my telephone 
number. 
• 
After that, how was all contact made 
with you? 
A 
• 
Directly to you? 
A 
Directly toward me. 
Q 
Okay. So were there any more instances 
where she went either through 
or 
to 
reach you? 
A 
Absolutely not. 
Q 
Okay. Now when you brought girls over 
was it the same thing where they would ask for the 
girl's name and number? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And when that happened, would they 
continue to go through you to set up appointments? 
A 
Most of time they went through me.

Actually 99.9 percent of the time they went 
through me. On a few occasions, the girls that 
they liked the best, for instance, 
, after 
a while me and 
stopped contact with each 
other and Jeffrey just went strictly through her. 
Q 
Okay. And when an appointment was made 
directly with the girl, you wouldn't necessarily 
know about it? 
A 
I would not necessarily know about it. 
Q 
And when the appointment was made 
directly with the girl then you wouldn't get paid, 
correct? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
Did you hear or do you know whether some 
girls that you brought, brought more girls? 
A 
Yeah, I'm sure of it. 
Q 
Okay. When did you first meet 
Was it that day that you went to give the 
massage? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
And how did you first meet her? 
A 
Just walking in the kitchen and waiting 
for somebody whether it be Epstein or 
came and introduced herself as 
and I 
learned that she was Epstein's assistant.

Q 
And you said that she was the one who 
took you upstairs on the first day? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
And we were talking earlier about how 
appointments would be made for you to bring 
additional girls, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
How far in advance would 
call you 
to make appointments? 
A 
It depends. Sometimes she would call me 
a few days in advance. Jeffrey is going to be in 
town tomorrow or this weekend, have a couple of 
girls lined up or have a girl lined up. So it 
would be anywhere between a couple of days to a 
weekend. 
Q 
Okay. Did you ever talk with 
or 
did 
ever tell you anything about what 
Jeffrey liked to do with the girls? 
A 
Absolutely not. 
We never discussed 
that. 
Q 
Did you ever talk with her about a rumor 
that you had heard that a girl had intercourse 
with Jeffrey? 
A 
One day I was talking on the phone with 
and I addressed her with it, asking her

about a rumor I heard of a girl sleeping with 
Jeffrey, having intercourse, and making $1 ,000, 
and she denied it and said that he doesn't do that 
kind of thing, he just plays with them. 
Q 
Okay. So she said that he didn't have 
intercourse, he just liked to play with the girls?

That's correct.

And when you spoke with the police, you 
said that Jeffrey liked to

That's correct. 
Q 
What led you to believe that?

He just did it. I just learned that

it just started happening and more and more girls 
were making comments.

So did 
know that he was

Not that I know of. I didn't say 
anything and I don't think she had an idea. I 
think she knew there was playing going on. 
I 
don't think she knew of what sort.

Okay. So she knew that something sexual 
was going on., but not necessarily what that

entailed? 
A 
Correct. 
Q 
Okay. Did Jeffrey or 
or anyone 
else who worked for Mr. Epstein ever ask you for 
proof of someone's age? 
A 
Never. 
Q 
Did they ever specifically instruct you 
that you shouldn't bring girls who were under age 
to the house? 
A 
Never. 
Q 
And when you spoke with the police 
department you said that at some point Jeffrey 
said the younger the better? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
And even after that he never said to you 
but make sure that they are over 18? 
A 
We never discussed age. He never made a 
comment about age except for 
that one time 
about her being too old. He never told me to go 
find under aged girls, but at the same time never 
said make sure they are over 18. It was never 
discussed.

Hs. 
I have to remind you that 
you are still under oath. There were just two 
1'0 
follow-up questions. The first one is something 
that I think you spoke about earlier, but who 
first asked you to find other girls?

Who first asked me to first other girls?

Yes. 
A 
That would be Epstein.

Okay. So Jeffrey asked you himself, 
Jeffrey Epstein himself asked you?

Yes. 
Q 
Okay. And then the other question was: 
Are you currently in contact with anyone who works 
for Mr. Epstein or himself? 
A 
I don't talk to any of the females that 
I once brought over there. I haven't been in 
contact with Epstein for years. He tried 
contacting me a few times. 
I haven't contacted him back. I refuse

to talk to him. 
I refuse to talk to any of the 
girls that were involved. However, I did live 
with one of the girls in Orlando for a couple 
months to a year. 
I haven't spoken to her in over 
a year either. 
Q 
Okay. So after 
and just so the grand 
jury has a sense here, we are talking about the 
2004 to 2005 period is when you were bringing 
girls over? 
A 
That's correct. 
Q 
So since then

I don't -- to be honest with you, I 
think it was more 2003, 2004.

A 
My junior senior year. 
Q 
Okay. But anyhow it .was a couple of 
years ago? 
A 
Several years ago.

Okay. 
Is there any follow up 
on either of those points? Yes,

children, but have been an agent for the last 
approximately 10 years.

He also has a home in New York, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
How is it that you started investigating 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009634

Mr. Epstein? 
A 
The Palm Beach Police Department in March of 
2005 initiated an investigation on Mr. Epstein involving 
multiple underage females that had visited Mr. Epstein's 
residence and had performed sexual massages or massages 
for Mr. Epstein of a sexual nature. 
Mr. Epstein paid the underage females anywhere 
from 200 to 5400, that investigation was around an 8 to 
10-month investigation, and at that point we became 
involved in about July of 2006. 
Q 
And once the case was presented to you by the 
Palm Beach Police Department did the FBI open its own 
investigation? 
A 
Yes, yes, we initiated our investigation in 
July of 2006, we took a look at focusing in on the 
underage minors and in our investigation we interviewed 
many of the girls that were underage and we did an 
independent investigation issuing Grand Jury subpoenas 
as well as administrative subpoenas getting different 
documents of financial records, telephone analysis, 
flight manifests, looking to see if Mr. Epstein engaged 
in sexual activity with these females. 
Q 
All right. And just so the Grand Jury is 
clear, were some of the girls who went to Mr. Epstein's 
house 18 or older? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009635

A 
Yes. 
Q 
And then there were some that were under the 
age of 18, correct? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And as part of the federal investigation did 
you have to investigate what we call the interstate 
nexus aspect of the case? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And can you explain to the Grand Jury what 
that is? 
A 
we looked at -- Mr. Epstein, as I mentioned 
earlier, has two aircrafts, and we focused in on the 
year 2004, 2005, he took approximately 60 trips to his 
residence in Palm Beach, the majority of that time 
focusing in on his assistant's cell phone, which his 
assistant's name is 
, we took a look at her 
cell phone records and the majority of the times that 
Mr. Epstein would fly into Palm Beach mrs. -- Ms. 
would contact many of our underage victims either prior 
to coming into Palm Beach, the day of, the day before, 
even the day after, and certainly throughout the time 
that Mr. Epstein was at his residence in Palm Beach. 
Q 
And from the interviews of the girls that have 
been conducted, what was the subject of those telephone 
calls? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009636

A 
Can you restate the question? 
Q 
Sure. From the interviews of the girls that 
have been conducted, what was the subject matter of the 
telephone calls from 
A 
would schedule the underage girls 
to come and work, perform the massages for Mr. Epstein, 
so she was responsible, she as well as another 
assistant, 
, they were his personal 
assistants who would set up appointments for Mr. Epstein 
for the girls to come and perform their sexual massages. 
Q 
All right. Is 
also considered a 
target of this investigation? 
A 
ves, she is. 
Q 
And I will just -- I will spell 
for the Grand Jury. The first name is 
and the last name is spelled 
and does ms. 
have a new last 
name? 
A 
yes, she does, she is married and her name is 
Q 
Is Ms. 
at least a subject of 
this investigation, in other words, you are 
investigating her activity? 
A 
we are looking at that. 
Q 
In addition to those two assistants, from the 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
( 
EFTA00009637

interviews of the girls, is 
associated with Mr. Epstein 
involved in this activity? 
there anyone else who is 
who is thought to be 
been referred to as his 
A 
has 
companion, girl friend, personal assistant, she through 
the testimony of the girls has engaged in sexual 
activity with at least three of the underage minors. 
Q 
And 
is 
SO Ms. 
a subject of the 
is also at least 
investigation, correct? 
A 
Yes, she is. 
Q 
Now, as part of this investigation you 
mentioned that subpoenas were issued on behalf of either 
the old Grand Jury or this Grand Jury. 
can you run through what subpoenas have been 
issued and what documents have been received in response 
to that? 
A 
Sure. we issued a Grand Jury subpoena to 
Colonial Bank and we received financial records on 
credit card accounts and individuals. 
we subpoenaed washington mutual and they did a 
search and were unable to locate records at this time. 
we issued a Grand Jury subpoena for Capital One and 
served that and that is still unresolved at this time as 
far as them providing documents to us. 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009638

we have subpoenaed Chase Credit Card and we 
have received documents from Chase. We have subpoenaed 
two businesses that Mr. Epstein has at least partial 
ownership or associated to, Hyperion Air, Inc. and JEGE, 
Inc., they were issued subpoenas and they have provided 
documentation to us. 
we have subpoenaed Mr. 
, who is a 
pilot of Mr. Epstein's, and we have received 
documentation from Mr. 
. We have subpoenaed DTG 
operations, who is doing business as Dollar Rent-A-Car, 
and we have received car rental agreements and financial 
records from that business. 
We have subpoenaed Royal Palm Beach High 
school and have received documentation regarding the 
students' records. we have subpoenaed three or four of 
the victims, 
being the first, and we have 
received a bathing suit from 
we issued a Grand Jury subpoena to 
, we actually have issued 
three subpoenas, 
and we are still working on resolving her Grand Jury 
material as well as testimony. 
we have issued 
a subpoena, we 
have issued -- she also is one of our underage victims. 
We've issued Reimer Employment Agency a Grand Jury 
subpoena and we have received documentation, that is an 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009639

employment agency located on the island of Palm Beach. 
we have subpoenaed the Palm Beach Police 
Department for their evidence in this case and we have 
received that. By the way, that is the only thing that 
I did not bring with me today, I brought everything 
else, but it is rather a lot of evidence, so we will 
probably be bringing that to you another time. 
we have issued the Clerk of Courts of the 
State of Florida for Grand Jury transcripts in the state 
matter and we have received those. we have issued the 
Good Samaritan Hospital for billing records and we have 
received those. 
we have issued a Grand Jury subpoena to the 
Dalton School located in New York and at this time they 
do not have the records we have requested or could not 
locate those. 
we have issued a Grand Jury subpoena to Extra 
Touch Flowers located here in west Palm Beach and we 
have received documentation from them. we issued a 
Grand Jury subpoena to Bill Hammond, another pilot for 
Mr. Epstein, we have spoken with him. 
We have issued a Grand Jury subpoena to 
, another one of Mr. Epstein's pilots, and we 
have received documentation as well as spoken to him. 
we have issued a Grand Jury subpoena to 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009640

, who is the property manager currently for 
Mr. Epstein at his Palm Beach residence, and we have 
received documentation as well as spoken to him, and we 
have issued a Grand Jury subpoena to 
and have received some documentation and are still 
awaiting a response. 
Q 
Now, you mentioned that you didn't bring with 
you the evidence that you received from the Palm Beach 
Police Department, but did you bring with you all of the 
other evidence that was received in response to the 
subpoenas? 
A 
I have. 
Q 
And is that evidence in the two boxes that are 
here in the front? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
we will bring all of this back to you when we 
present the indictment, but would anyone like to look at 
any of the documentation today? 
A GRAND JUROR: what does the documentation 
constitute, basically, the subpoenas? 
THE WITNESS: It is primarily business 
records, flight manifests, stuff that came from him 
traveling to and from Palm Beach, credit card 
records, the businesses as far as the rental 
agreement which involves some of the underage girls 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
( 
EFTA00009641

with the rental cars, and flower shop, you know. 
A GRAND JUROR: will we have an opportunity 
later to go through these if we need to? 
MS. 
: Yes, we will bring them when 
S 
we present the indictment. Yes, ma'am. 
A GRAND JUROR: If I should hold this for 
later let me know, she mentioned the hospital 
records were subpoenaed, could more information 
about why they were subpoenaed be provided at this 
time? 
BY MS. 
Q 
You can answer that. 
A 
One of the girls that was an underage -- that 
was underage at the time that is involved with 
mr. Epstein has had a baby and we were interested and 
wondering if possibly he was the father of that baby, 
which at this time we do not believe he was. 
A GRAND JUROR: Thank you. 
MS. 
: A question? 
A GRAND JUROR: Did the flight manifest show 
passengers on the plane? 
THE WITNESS: Yes, they do. 
A GRAND JUROR: Were any of the passengers the 
underage girls that were a target of the 
investigation? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009642

THE WITNESS: At this time we have not 
associated any of these underage girls as being the 
passengers. The flight manifests, sometimes the 
pilot if they did not know who the passenger was 
would put one passenger or one female, one male, 
these were private planes and they, you know, may 
not have felt like they can go up and ask, but we 
don't have any evidence at this time to believe 
that they were any of our victims. 
MS. 
: Any follow-up? Any other 
questions from the Grand Jury? ves, ma'am. 
A GRAND JUROR: The records that you 
subpoenaed from the high school, what were they 
used for or why were they instrumental in the 
investigation? 
THE WITNESS: Those are the girls' school 
records and we are just looking at the girls' 
records. 
A GRAND JUROR: Absenteeism? 
THE WITNESS: Just looking at some of their 
grades and performances and how they did in school. 
MS. 
: Ladies and gentlemen, before 
we continue, the witness has mentioned a few names 
of the minors and that is confidential information, 
obviously everything that you hear within these 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009643

walls is confidential. 
BY MS. -: 
Q 
NOw, Special Agent 
, after -- in 
addition to issuing the subpoenas, you mentioned that 
one of the subpoenas was to the Palm Beach Police 
Department. Did you review any of the evidence that 
they collected? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
And can you, for example, did the Palm Beach 
Police Department interview any girls? 
A 
Yes, they did, they interviewed several of the 
girls, most of the girls, they took taped statements 
from the girls either in the form of a tape-recorder or 
through video. 
Q 
And you have reviewed some of those 
interviews, correct? 
A 
Yes, we have. 
Q 
And has the FBI performed any interviews? 
A 
Yes, we have, we have performed interviews of 
past and current employees of Mr. Epstein as well as 
focusing in on the girls, the girls that were underage 
at the time of the sexual activity, we wanted to 
determine with these girls, again, the sexual activity 
that took place with Mr. Epstein as well as how old they 
were at the time, if they traveled with Mr. Epstein, any 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009644

gifts that they may have gotten, so we did reach out to 
several of the underage minors and gathered more 
information from them. 
Q 
And through the FBI's investigation has the 
FBI identified additional victims that perhaps the state 
police officers did not know about? 
A 
Yes, we are still trying to identify, get 
first names of girls and going back and looking through 
school yearbooks and attempting to try to locate friends 
of friends, so we are still in the process, when you 
interview one of the girls and you ask if any of their 
friends went, they sometimes will give you other names, 
so we are in the process of still uncovering victims and 
reaching out and interviewing additional girls that we 
believe possibly were underage at the time of this 
sexual activity. 
Q 
If I could ask you to step outside. 
(The witness was excused from the Grand Jury 
room.) 
(Questions posed by the Grand Jury.) 
(The witness was recalled to testify before 
the Grand Jury.) 
BY MS. 
Q 
Special Agent 
, one of the Grand 
Jurors asked whether there was any evidence of force or 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009645

coercion. 
A 
when talking to the girls they were told that 
they may have to -- they were going there to perform a 
massage, possibly model lingerie, they went there 
sometimes on multiple occasions and they may start off 
wearing their clothing and then he would instruct them 
far as coercion, they were paid $200 to $400 to perform 
these massages. 
They are not trained in performing massages, 
they don't -- they are not masseuses, but yet if you ask 
if they were coerced, they were paid quite a bit of 
money for 30 to 45 minutes work. 
Some of the girls, being that they were minors 
going to his residence, got in over their heads and did 
not always return or come back, some of our victims did 
not come back after, you know, the did o down 
' 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009646

• 
Q 
And was there one instance where Mr. Epstein 
actually engaged in vaginal intercourse with a girl 
against her will? 
Q 
A Grand Juror asked how old Mr. Epstein is. 
A 
He was 45 at the time that we are looking at 
him at that time period. 
Q 
A Grand Juror asked if you know the proportion 
of girls who were underage versus 18 or older. 
A 
The majority of the girls that we are looking 
at are victims, well, all of our victims that we are 
looking at were under the age of 18. 
As far as all of the girls that have been 
interviewed, the majority definitely were under 18. To 
give you a number, i would have to go and count, but I 
would say in the state investigation there were over 25 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009647

girls identified and more than a majority would have 
been under the age of 18. 
Q 
A Grand Juror asked whether we have obtained 
Mr. Epstein's DNA and whether there was any DNA testing 
of the baby that you spoke of earlier. 
A 
No, we have not. 
Q 
A Grand Juror asked how Mr. Epstein would make 
contact with the girls, was this done via computer or in 
some other method? 
A 
I am sorry, 
, his personal 
assistant, would contact, or on some occasions 
would also contact the girls via their cell 
phone and we have message pads from the residents that 
also indicate the girls calling the home in response to 
some of those phone calls, so they would call, 
would call, the majority of the calls were made 
by 
to the girls arranging for these, you 
know, can you come at this time, can you come at that 
time. 
Q 
And is the cellular telephone a facility of 
interstate commerce? 
A 
yes, it is. 
Q 
And then one of the Grand Jurors asked whether 
the assistants knew that the girls were underage or 
committed sex acts. 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009648

Did anybody, have you interviewed anybody who 
affirmatively told you that they told 
fill. their 
age or what was going on behind closed doors? 
A 
No, no, not at this time, not at this time. 
Q 
And what leads you to believe that she, for 
example, 
knew or should have known what was 
going on? 
A 
There are so many girls that 
contacted to give Mr. Epstein massages that have no 
training in massages, and that 
was aware 
that girls were bringing other girls, you know, their 
friends to do these massages. 
was also making appointments for 
legitimate massages for Mr. Epstein from legitimate 
masseuses that would come and give him massages, so the 
number of girls, their appearances at the time would 
lead us to believe that 
had knowledge that 
these girls were underage. 
Q 
All right. Thank you very much. Those were 
all the questions from the Grand Jury. 
A GRAND JUROR: Actually, I have two more, 
but. 
MS. 
: Okay. 
A GRAND JUROR: what was the actual age range 
of these girls? 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009649

THE WITNESS: 14 to I mean. 
A GRAND JUROR: The other one was, how did Ms. 
actually originally get these girls, how 
were they brought in, I mean how were they, you 
know, because you said she called them when he was 
arriving, but how did these girls come into this in 
the first place? 
A GRAND JUROR: Could she speak louder? 
MS. 
: Special Agent 
, we 
just had a request that you speak louder 
A GRAND JUROR: 14 and what? 
THE WITNESS: Our victims were 14 to 17, but 
we have girls that are 18, we have girls that are 
20, we have girls that are in their early 20s, and 
your question was? 
A GRAND JUROR: How did she originally get 
them in in the first place? 
THE WITNESS: We are focusing in on 2004, 
2005, we have some evidence to show that this 
activity was taking place even earlier than that, 
certainly to include 2003 if you look at the 
message pads, but focusing in on 2004, 2005, the 
chain started with one of our minors and from that 
minor who goes to the house, Mr. Epstein tells 
her -- sees that she is maybe not comfortable with 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009650

doing the massage the way he would like it and 
tells her that she could bring other girls to do 
the massages and she in fact if she brought another 
girl she would be paid $200 for just bringing 
S 
another girl, so there starts the chain, and 
Mr. Epstein would ask the girls or 
would ask 
the girls for their phone numbers so each time, you 
know, if one of the girls brought a girl and he 
liked her he would ask for her phone number, ask 
her to leave the phone number, or 
would get the phone number and then that girl would 
maybe bring, because if you brought somebody you 
didn't have to do the massage, but you also got 
paid for bringing a new person, so not only if you 
did the massage would you get anywhere from 200 to 
400, but if you brought a new female you would 
receive 200 or $400. 
A GRAND JUROR: Do you know how she solicited 
that original minor? 
THE WITNESS: I don't. Well, I know that 
minor was approached by two individuals and we have 
interviewed one of those individuals who we can 
connect back to Mr. Epstein four years, possibly, 
prior to this, and stated that his job was actually 
to drive some of the girls to the residence and 
OFFICIAL REPORTING SERVICE 
EFTA00009651

that's pretty much where we start off. 
MS. 
Would the Grand Jury like 
Special Agent 
to maintain the records 
that we received in response to the subpoenas? 
A GRAND JUROR: Maintain versus what? 
A GRAND JUROR: What is our choice? 
MS. 
: I don't know that there is. I 
guess I could maintain them, but I don't believe we 
have secure storage in here. 
Would you like Special Agent 
to 
maintain custody? 
A GRAND JUROR: Yes. 
MS. 
: You should have something to 
swear her in as a custodian. 
(The witness was sworn in as the custodian of 
records.) 
MS. 
: 
Thank you, ladies and 
gentlemen, I am the last person for today, so you 
guys are free to go and we will see you probably in 
a couple of weeks, we will be seeing a lot of you. 
(The witness was excused from the Grand Jury 
room.)

before the Grand Jury.)
