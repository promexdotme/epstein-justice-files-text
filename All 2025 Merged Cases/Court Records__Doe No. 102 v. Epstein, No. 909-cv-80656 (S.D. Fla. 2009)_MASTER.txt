STATEMENT OF FACTS 
8. 
At all relevant times, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, was an adult male, spanning the 
ages of 45 and 55 years old. Epstein is known as a billionaire financier and money manager with 
a secret clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is a man of tremendous wealth, power, 
and influence. He owns a fleet of aircraft that includes a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a 
Boeing 727, as well as a fleet of motor vehicles. Until his incarceration, he maintained his 
principal place of residence in the largest home in Manhattan, a 51,000-square-foot eight-story 
mansion on the Upper East Side. Upon information and belief, he also owns a $6.8 million 
mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a $30 million 7,500-acre ranch in New Mexico he named 
"Zorro," a 70-acre private island known as Little St. James in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, a 
mansion in London's Westminster neighborhood, and a home in the Avenue Foch area of Paris. 
The allegations herein concern Defendant's conduct while at his lavish homes and/or numerous 
other locations both nationally and internationally. 
9. 
Upon information and belief, Defendant has a sexual preference for underage 
minor girls. He engaged in a plan, scheme, or enterprise in which he gained access to countless 
vulnerable and relatively economically disadvantaged minor girls, and sexually assaulted, 
molested, and/or exploited these girls, and then gave them money. 
10. 
Beginning in or around 1998 through in or around September 2007, Defendant 
used his resources and his influence over vulnerable minor girls to engage in a systematic pattern 
of sexually exploitative behavior.

11. 
Defendant's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. 
Defendant coerced and enticed impressionable, vulnerable, and relatively economically less 
fortunate minor girls to participate in various acts of sexual misconduct that he committed upon 
them. Defendant's scheme involved the use of underage girls, as well as other individuals, to 
recruit other underage girls. Upon information and belief, Defendant and/or an authorized agent 
would call and alert Defendant's assistants shortly before or after he arrived at his Palm Beach 
residence. His assistants would call economically disadvantaged and underage girls from West 
Palm Beach and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being offered and who 
Defendant and/or his assistants perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have 
credibility issues if allegations of improper conduct were made. The then minor Plaintiff and 
other minor girls, some as young as 12 years old, were transported to Defendant's Palm Beach 
mansion by Defendant's employees, agents, and/or assistants in order to provide Defendant with 
"massages." 
12. 
Many of the instances of illegal sexual conduct committed by Defendant were 
perpetrated with the assistance, support, and facilitation of at least three assistants who helped 
him orchestrate this child exploitation enterprise. These assistants would often arrange times for 
underage girls to come to Defendant's residence, transport or cause the transportation of 
underage girls to Defendant's residence, escort the underage girls to the massage room where 
Defendant would be waiting or would enter shortly thereafter, urge the underage girls to remove 
their clothes, deliver cash from Defendant to the underage girls and/or their procurers at the 
conclusion of each "massage appointment," and, upon information and belief, take nude 
photographs and/or videos of the underage girls for Defendant with and/or without their 
knowledge. Defendant would pay the procurer of each girl's "appointment" hundreds of dollars.

13. 
Epstein designed this scheme to secure a private place in Defendant's Palm Beach 
mansion where only persons employed and invited by Epstein would be present, so as to reduce 
the chance of detection of Defendant's sexual abuse and prostitution as well as to make it more 
difficult for the minor girls to flee the premises and/or to credibly report his actions to law 
enforcement or other authorities. The girls were usually transported by his employees, agents, 
and/or assistants or by a taxicab paid for by Defendant in order to make it difficult for the girls to 
flee his mansion. 
14. 
Upon arrival at Defendant's Palm Beach mansion, each underage victim would 
generally be introduced to one of Defendant's assistants, who would gather the girl's personal 
contact information. The minor girl would then be led up a flight of stairs to a room that 
contained a massage table and a large shower. The staircase leading to the room was plastered 
with nude photographs of young girls, including some photographs depicting two or more young 
girls engaged in lewd acts. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, had such 
photographs in each of his six homes and/or on his computers. 
15. 
At times, if it was the girl's first "massage" appointment, another female would 
be in the room to "lead the way" until Defendant would have her leave. Generally, Defendant 
would start his massage wearing only a small towel, which eventually would be removed. 
Defendant and/or the other female would direct the girl to massage him, giving the minor girl 
specific instructions as to where and how he wanted to be touched, and then direct her to remove 
her clothing. He would then perform one or more lewd, lascivious, and sexual acts, including 
masturbation, fondling the minor's breasts and/or sexual organs, touching the minor's vulva, 
vagina, and/or anus with a vibrator and/or back massager and/or his finger(s) and/or his penis, 
digitally penetrating her vagina, performing intercourse, oral sex, and/or anal sex, and/or 
coercing or attempting to coerce the girl to engage in lewd acts and/or prostitution and/or 
Podhurst Orseck, P.A. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 5 of 27
enticing the then mmor girl to engage in sexual acts with another female in Defendant's 
presence. The exact degree of molestation and frequency with which the sexual exploitations 
took place varied and is not yet completely known; however, Defendant committed such acts 
regularly on a daily basis and, in most instances, several times a day. In order to facilitate the 
daily exchanges of money for sexual assault and abuse, Defendant kept U.S. currency readily 
available. 
16. 
Defendant, Epstein, traveled to his mansion in Palm Beach for the purpose of 
luring minor girls to his mansion to sexually abuse and/or batter them. He used the telephone to 
contact these minor girls for the purpose of coercing them into acts of prostitution and to enable 
himself to commit sexual battery against them and/or acts of lewdness in their presence, and he 
conspired with others, including assistants and/or his driver(s) and/or pilot(s), and his socialite 
friend/partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, to further these acts and to avoid police detection. 
Defendant's systematic pattern of sexually exploitative behavior referred to in paragraph 10 and 
described in paragraphs 11 through the present paragraph occurred in all of Defendant's 
domestic and international residences and/or places of lodging and/or modes of transportation. 
17. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Defendant used his money, 
wealth, and power to unduly and improperly manipulate and influence the then minor Plaintiff. 
A vulnerable young girl, Plaintiff was working as a changing room assistant at The Mar-A-Lago 
Club in Palm Beach making approximately $9 an hour when she was first lured into Defendant's 
sexually exploitative world. In or about the summer of 1998, when Plaintiff was merely fifteen 
years old while attending to her duties at Mar-A-Lago, Plaintiff was recruited by Ghislaine 
Maxwell, who lived, traveled, socialized, and worked with Defendant. Ms. Maxwell asked 
Plaintiff if she was interested in learning massage therapy and earning a great deal of money 
while learning the profession. Plaintiffs father, who was a maintenance manager at The Mar-A-
Podhurst Orseck, P.A.

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 6 of 27
Lago Club, was not apprehensive because he felt comforted that an older woman had approached 
Plaintiff with this opportunity. As a result, Plaintiffs father dropped off Plaintiff at Defendant's 
mansion that same day. Ms. Maxwell met Plaintiff and her father outside of Defendant's Palm 
Beach mansion, where Ms. Maxwell assured the minor girl's father that Ms. Maxwell would 
provide transportation home for his teenaged daughter. Ghislaine Maxwell led Plaintiff up a 
flight of stairs to a spa room with a shower and a massage table. Defendant was lying naked on 
the massage table. Plaintiff was shocked, but, with no experience with massages, thought this 
could be massage therapy protocol. Ms. Maxwell then took off her own shirt and left on her 
underwear and started rubbing her breasts across Defendant's body, impliedly showing Plaintiff 
what she was expected to do. Ms. Maxwell then told Plaintiff to take off her clothes. The minor 
girl was apprehensive about doing this, but, in fear, proceeded to follow Ms. Maxwell by 
removing everything but her underwear. She was then ordered to remove her underwear and to 
straddle Defendant. 
The encounter escalated, with Defendant and Ms. Maxwell sexually 
assaulting, battering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff in various ways and in various locations, 
including the steam room and shower. At the end of this sexually exploitive abuse, Defendant 
and Ms. Maxwell giddily told Plaintiff to return the following day and told her she had "lots of 
potential." Defendant paid Plaintiff hundreds of dollars, told her it was for two hours of work, 
and directed one of his employees to drive her home. 
18. 
Defendant and/or his procurers thereafter lured the then minor Plaintiff to his 
Palm Beach mansion every day for the next two weeks in order to engage in a similar pattern of 
sexual exploitation. Defendant and/or his procurers arranged at the end of each incident the 
transportation and scheduling for the following day's appointment. Additionally, Defendant 
telephoned the minor Plaintiff himself and/or had Ms. Maxwell telephone Plaintiff to make 
arrangements. 
Plaintiff was often times driven to and from Epstein's mansion by Epstein 
Podhurst Orseck, P.A. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 7 of 27
himself or his driver. Alternatively, Defendant or Ms. Maxwell would arrange and pay for 
Plaintiffs transportation home by taxicab. 
19. 
During Plaintiffs second incident of being sexually exploited and assaulted by 
Defendant at Defendant's Palm Beach mansion, Defendant asked Plaintiff to quit her job at The 
Mar-A-Lago Club and travel with him to earn much more money while learning the massage 
profession. Thus, Plaintiff, an impressionable and vulnerable young girl of modest means, quit 
her job as a changing room assistant, was lured by Defendant, and continued to be victimized by 
Defendant, who immersed the minor Plaintiff into Defendant's lewd and abusive lifestyle. 
Under Defendant's dominion and control, Defendant continuously "groomed" the minor 
adolescent. 
Defendant's daily routine required the minor Plaintiff to perform sexually on 
Defendant multiple times per day and to provide Defendant massages multiple times per day. 
Plaintiff had absolutely no say as to when, how many times, or what was done during each 
sexual encounter. Often, Plaintiff was joined by Ms. Maxwell, Ms. Maxwell's assistant, and/or a 
countless array of young women who would be brought to one of Defendant's homes for the 
sexual trysts and then be sexually exploited by Defendant. 
20. 
The first time that Defendant transported Plaintiff to another state in order to 
engage in sexual acts with her occurred when she was merely fifteen years old and after only two 
weeks of daily sexually abusive encounters with Defendant. Defendant used his private jet to 
transport the minor Plaintiff to Manhattan, where he provided her with spending money and 
accommodations with him at his mansion. 
From the time that Plaintiff was 15 years old, 
Defendant abused her to serve his every sexual whim, obtaining and purchasing passports and 
whatever was needed for her to travel with him and/or for him. Defendant transported Plaintiff 
in his private jet to locations that included Palm Beach, New York City, Santa Fe, Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, St. Louis, and numerous other domestic destinations, as well as international

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 8 of 27
destinations, including Europe, the Caribbean, and Africa. He provided accommodations with 
him in order to have her available to him at all times wherever he went, including while 
transporting the minor Plaintiff on his private jet. Each time they would travel to one of these 
destinations, the same pattern of sexual abuse would occur, often with a vast array of aspiring 
models, actresses, celebrities, and/or other females, including minors, from all over the world. 
Upon information and belief, Defendant transported minor girls from Turkey, the Czech 
Republic, Asia, and numerous other countries, many of whom spoke no English. To Plaintiffs 
knowledge, the only females specifically excluded from Defendant's sexual escapades were 
African-Americans. 
21. 
In addition to being continually exploited to satisfy Defendant's every sexual 
whim, Plaintiff was also required to be sexually exploited by Defendant's adult male peers, 
including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal 
acquaintances. Whenever Defendant transported Plaintiff with him in his private jet to any 
destination, Defendant would pay Plaintiff a flat rate per day while he and/or his above-
mentioned associates would sexually exploit and abuse minor Plaintiff. 
22. 
Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when Defendant knew that 
Plaintiff was approximately 15, 16, and 17 years old, and, after years of daily sexual exploitation, 
continued into her adulthood. Despite Defendant's stating shortly before Plaintiffs sixteenth 
birthday that he soon would have to trade her in because she was getting too old, Defendant 
continued to sexually exploit Plaintiff until she fled at age 19. Defendant's predilection for 
young girls was well known to those who regularly procured them for him and to his circle of 
friends. On one of Defendant's birthdays, a friend of Defendant sent him three 12-year-old girls 
from France who spoke no English for Defendant to sexually exploit and abuse. After doing so, 
they were sent back to France the next day.

23. 
Any assertions by Defendant that he was unaware of the age of the then minor 
Plaintiff are belied by his own actions, and are rendered irrelevant by the provision of applicable 
federal statutes concerning the sexual exploitation and abuse of a minor child. Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, at all times material to this cause of action, knew and should have known of 
Plaintiffs age of minority. Defendant and Ms. Maxwell acknowledged and celebrated Plaintiffs 
16th birthday. Defendant's preference for underage girls was well-known to those who regularly 
procured them for him. 
24. 
As previously stated in paragraph 14, Defendant displayed nude photographs of 
underage girls throughout his homes in New York City, Palm Beach, Santa Fe, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102, saw photographs of naked young girls in each of 
Defendant's homes, including a photograph of herself naked at Defendant's home in Palm 
Beach. When she asked Defendant about it, he stated dismissively that he had naked photographs 
of her in all of his homes. 
25. 
Upon information and belief, some of the photographs in Defendant's possession 
were taken with hidden cameras set up in his home in Palm Beach. On the day of his arrest, 
police found two hidden cameras and photographs of underage girls on a computer in 
Defendant's home. Upon information and belief, Defendant may have taken lewd photographs 
of Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102, with his hidden cameras and may have transported lewd 
photographs of Plaintiff ( among many other victims) to his other residences and elsewhere using 
a facility or means of interstate and/or foreign commerce. In addition, while Plaintiff was a 
minor teenager and upon Ms. Maxwell's insistence after Ms. Maxwell rejected as inappropriate 
photographs that Plaintiff presented of herself fully clothed, Ms. Maxwell photographed Plaintiff 
naked in different sexually explicit positions. 
Ms. Maxwell then presented these nude 
photographs of Plaintiff to Defendant as a birthday present for Defendant from Ms. Maxwell.

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 10 of 27
Upon information and belief, one or more nude photographs of Plaintiff that were taken when 
she was a minor were confiscated by the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office during its execution of a 
search warrant of Defendant's Palm Beach mansion on October 20, 2005. Upon information 
and belief, those photographs are still in the custody of law enforcement. 
26. 
It is virtually impossible to calculate the exact number of times that Defendant 
sexually exploited and abused Plaintiff. From the age of 15, Plaintiff was sexually exploited and 
abused by Defendant on a daily basis and, most often, multiple times each day. While some of 
the precise dates these acts occurred are unknown to Plaintiff, these dates are known to 
Defendant, as he is reported to have kept a written log of each instance in which he engaged in 
these lewd acts with then minor Plaintiff and others. Upon information and belief, these logs are 
also in the custody of law enforcement. 
27. 
In or around September 2002, Defendant purchased a commercial round-trip 
airline ticket, and provided a passport, U.S. currency, and accommodations for Plaintiff to fly to 
Thailand. While thousands of miles away from Defendant on this extended trip alone for the 
first time in more than four years, Plaintiff met, fell in love, and married a young man. She 
escaped from Defendant's abuse with the help and insistence of her new husband and, instead of 
returning to Defendant, boarded a plane to Australia with one suitcase. 
28. 
Since November 2002, Plaintiff has lived a modest life in Australia, while 
maintaining lines of communication with her family and without contact with Defendant or any 
of the people in his entourage. However, suddenly, in 2008, Plaintiff received numerous phone 
calls from one of Defendant's agents. During these phone calls to Plaintiff, he repeatedly asked 
whether she knew anything about the civil cases against Defendant, whether she knew any of the 
females who were proceeding with the civil suits, whether she was planning on filing suit, 
whether she was communicating and/or cooperating with anyone against Defendant, and whether 
Podhurst Orseck, P.A. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 11 of 27
she would return to the United States to testify. Terrified by Defendant's demonstrated ability to 
track her down on her changed cell phone number halfway across the world, Plaintiff attempted 
to reassure Defendant's agent that she would remain quiet. During the course of one of these 
phone calls from Defendant's agents, Defendant himself spoke on the phone, continued to 
question her intentions, and, upon being reassured by Plaintiff, thanked her for not getting 
involved. 
29. 
Around January 2009, Plaintiff received a letter from the United States Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida, informing her of her potential civil claims against 
Defendant under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Plaintiff contacted undersigned counsel within days and 
diligently and repeatedly pursued a good faith viable settlement of her claims against Defendant. 
Unable to reach a settlement, this lawsuit followed. 
30. 
As a result of these encounters with Defendant, Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102, has in 
the past suffered, and will in the future continue to suffer, physical injury, pain and suffering, 
emotional distress, psychological and/or psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, 
confusion, embarrassment, loss of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, 
invasion of her privacy, separation from her family, and other damages associated with 
Defendant's controlling and manipulating her on a daily basis for years into a perverse and 
unhealthy way of life. 
31. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, committed the above-referenced acts upon Plaintiff in 
violation of federal statutes condemning the coercion and enticement of a minor to engage in 
prostitution or sexual activity, travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, sex 
trafficking of children, sexual exploitation of minor children, transport of visual depictions of a 
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, transport of child pornography, child exploitation 
enterprises, and other crimes, specifically including, but not limited to, those crimes designated

In June 2008, after investigations by the Palm Beach Police Department, the Palm 
Beach State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, entered pleas 
of "guilty" to various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and 
the procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in 
Palm Beach County, Florida. Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is in the same position as if he had 
been tried and convicted of the sexual offenses committed against Plaintiff and, as such, must 
admit liability unto Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102. Plaintiff hereby exclusively seeks civil remedies 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255.

As a direct and proximate result of the offenses enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2255 
being committed against the then minor Plaintiff by Defendant, Plaintiff has in the past suffered, 
and will in the future continue to suffer, physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, 
psychological and/or psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, 
loss of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy, 
separation from her family, and other damages associated with Defendant's manipulating and 
leading her into a perverse and unhealthy way of life. The then minor Plaintiff incurred medical 
and psychological expenses, and Plaintiff will in the future suffer additional medical and 
psychological expenses. Plaintiff has suffered a loss of income, a loss of the capacity to earn 
income in the future, and a loss of the capacity to enjoy life. These injuries are permanent in 
nature, and Plaintiff will continue to suffer these losses in the future. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 102, demands judgment against Defendant,

THE STYLE OF THIS CASE AND MOTION TO IDENTIFY JANE DOE #102 IN 
THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENAS FOR PURPOSES OF DISCOVERY. WITH 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein" or "Defendant"), by and 
through his undersigned attorneys, hereby files his Response In Opposition to 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe #102's Motion to Proceed Anonymously and files his Motion 
requesting that this Court enter an order identifying in the style of this case the 
complete legal name of the Plaintiff, JANE DOE #102 ("JANE DOE"), to 
substitute her complete legal name in this case in place of "JANE DOE" and, 
equally important, allowing Defendant to identify her in various subpoenas that 
Epstein must serve so Epstein can defend this case. In support, Mr. Epstein 
states as follows: 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 2 of 12
I. Response In Opposition With Incorporated Motion And Incorporated 
Memorandum Of Law 
a. 
Background 
1. 
On May 1, 2009, Plaintiff filed this action against Epstein. The 
Complaint (DE 1) alleges three causes of action against him: Count I - Coercion 
and Enticement of a Minor to Engage in Prostitution or Sexual Activity Pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2422(b); Count II - Cause of Action for Transportation 
With Intent to Engage in Illicit Sexual Conduct Pursuant to Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§§2255 and 2423(a); Count Ill - Cause of Action for Travel with Intent to Engage 
In Illicit Sexual Conduct Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2423(b); Count IV -
Coercion and Enticement of a Minor to Engage in Prostitution or Sexual Activity 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2422(a); Count V - Cause of Action for 
Transportation with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity Pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. §§2255 and 2421; Count VI - Cause of Action for Sexual Exploitation of 
Children Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2255; Count VII - Cause of Action 
for Transport of Visual Depiction of Minor Engaging in Sexually Explicit Conduct 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2252(a)(1)); Count VIII - Cause of Action for 
Transport of Child Pornography Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§2255 and 2252A(a)(1)); 
2. 
Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that she is entitled to money 
damages pursuant to 2255 (in the wherefore clause), as well as actual and 
compensatory. 
3. 
Obviously, Plaintiff alleges separate counts against Mr. Epstein, on 
which he must conduct discovery to defend this case. Therefore, for the reasons 
set forth herein, not only must JANE DOE'S Motion to Proceed Anonymously be 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 3 of 12
denied, but Epstein's Motion to Identify Jane Doe must be granted. 
Despite 
Plaintiff's allegations in the Motion to Proceed Anonymously, this Court has not 
"allowed" any Plaintiff to proceed anonymously. Quite simply, that is the way 
each Plaintiff chose to file each of their respective cases, all of which are 
currently being challenged in those other matters by Motion to Identify. 
4. 
Importantly, JANE DOE claims that she has and will suffer " . 
. physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, psychological and 
psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, loss 
of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her 
privacy, separation from her family 
. . . , and medical and psychological 
expenses ... , loss on income, loss of the capacity to earn income in the future, 
and loss of the capacity to enjoy life" 111128, Comp .. DE 1; see also 111136, 40, 44, 
48, 52, 56, 61, 65, and 69, Comp., DE 1. 
5. 
Epstein has a constitutional due process right to defend himself and 
to seek the production of information that will assist in his defense of the 
allegations in the Complaint. In this case, Plaintiff's counsel intends on serving 
subpoenas on Plaintiffs treating physicians and other third parties. Thus, this 
motion seeks not only a denial Plaintiff's Motion to Proceed Anonymously but to 
identify JANE DOE in the style of this case and to identify JANE DOE in various 
third-party subpoenas for discovery purposes. 
6. 
The undersigned's experience in "Jane Doe" lawsuits is that once a 
Plaintiff is identified, other individuals come forward in the discovery phase with 
information which often directly contradicts allegations as to the events and 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 4 of 12
damages. For instance, witnesses may testify that Plaintiff was paid by others 
for similar sexual acts she claims Mr. Epstein forced upon her or that she willingly 
participated in certain act(s) that would negate or lessen her damages. This goes 
directly to Plaintiff's damage claim. 
7. 
Likewise, subpoenas must be issued to third-party treaters and 
current and former employers, and those subpoenas will seek to obtain records 
related directly to Plaintiff's claims and her damages (i.e., her claim for severe 
and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological and emotional 
damages and loss of self-esteem as referenced above). 
Cherenfant v. 
Nationwide Credit. Inc., 2004 WL 5315889 (S.D. Fla. 2004)(order allowing 
discovery of medical records consistent with Plaintiff's allegations in complaint). 
This too goes directly to Plaintiff's damage claims. Medical providers, employers, 
co-employees, etc... have direct and relevant personal knowledge and 
observations regarding damages, i.e., emotional state, activities, self-esteem, 
etc .... 
8. 
Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 26 allows for broad discovery. 
Epstein is not 
required to rely solely on Plaintiff's discovery responses in defending this case, 
nor is Epstein required by any statute or law to rely only upon what Plaintiff may 
produce in discovery or may obtain from her own medical treaters through her 
counsel, and to then provide to Epstein only after Plaintiff has reviewed same. In 
certain related state court actions involving Epstein, the undersigned offered to 
serve certain subpoenas on the medical treaters and other third-parties with full 
name, date of birth and Plaintiff's social security number (last four digits), but 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 5 of 12
agreed that the subpoenas filed with the clerk would be redacted. 
Several 
attorneys agreed to this procedure in those cases. In Federal Court, subpoenas 
are not filed with the clerk. Thus, in this matter, the undersigned offered to serve 
the third-party subpoenas with plaintiff's full name, date of birth and social 
security number (last four digits) and would 
agree to redact any identifying 
information on any documents filed with this court if that ultimately became 
necessary. 
9. 
Moreover, when an order from the court is attached to the 
Subpoena, treaters and other third parties produce the records and show up to 
the depositions with the records requested because the deponent knows what to 
bring by virtue of knowing the identity of the Plaintiff. 
10. 
Epstein's counsel intends to serve and depose witnesses duces 
tecum. If Epstein is not permitted to identify JANE DOE (thus allowing her to 
proceed anonymously), how will any deponent know who the parties are and 
what to bring to the deposition pursuant to the duces tecum? Further, how will 
Epstein be able to defend the claims. Just like the Plaintiff, Epstein is entitled to 
due process. 
If the Court allows Jane Doe to proceed anonymously, Jane Doe 
will be permitted to present her case and Epstein will be limited in his defenses. 
11. 
While it is within the sound discretion of this court to allow a party to 
proceed anonymously, Plaintiff should not attempt to utilize that discretion as a 
shield from legitimate and necessary discovery. Epstein has a fundamental due 
process right to conduct discovery. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 6 of 12
b. Response In Opposition And Motion To Identify JANE DOE In Style 
Of This Case 
12. 
As discussed below, Epstein has fundamental due process right to 
defend himself in this civil litigation. 
While JANE DOE travels under a 
pseudonym, various newspaper articles identifying Epstein have been released 
discussing the alleged claims against him. Allowing JANE DOE to litigate this 
matter under a pseudonym is preventing Epstein from defending this suit 
including, but not limited to, preventing him from locating individuals that may 
have information about this lawsuit and information about JANE DOE that may 
discredit her allegations and/or lessen the monetary damages she seeks to 
recover. It is the undersigned's experience that once identified, witnesses begin 
to come forward. See supra. 
13. 
In Doe v. Lepley, 185 F.R.D. 605 (D. Ct. NV 1999), a sexual 
harassment case, the court reasoned that there is no express or implied right to 
bring an action anonymously. 
Id. at 606. 
Moreover, Fed. R. Civ. P 10(a) 
requires that the complaint include the names of the parties. )Q. When Plaintiffs 
are permitted to proceed anonymously, the court must employ a balancing test to 
decide if the plaintiff has a substantial privacy interest that outweighs the 
presumption of openness in judicial proceedings. Id., citing, Doe v. Frank, 951 
F.2d 320, 323 (11 th Cir. 1992)(requiring complaint to include the names of the 
parties serves more than administrative convenience, it protects the public's 
legitimate interests in knowing all the facts involved, including the identity of the 
parties - thus denying request to proceed anonymously). The factors include: 
a. 
whether the plaintiff is challenging governmental activity; 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 7 of 12
b. 
whether the party defending the suit would be prejudiced; 
c. 
whether the plaintiff is required to disclose information of 
utmost intimacy; 
d. 
whether the plaintiff is compelled to admit an intention to 
engage 
in 
illegal 
conduct, 
thereby 
risking 
criminal 
prosecution; 
e. 
whether the Plaintiff would risk suffering injury if identified; 
f. 
whether the interests of children are at stake; and 
g. 
whether there are less drastic means of protecting the 
legitimate interests of either party. 
Doe v. Frank, 951 F.2d at 323. 
Plaintiff does not fall under any of the factors. Moreover, even if she did 
meet one of the factors, "[t]he fact that [a] Doe [Plaintiff] may suffer some 
personal embarrassment, standing alone, does not require the granting of a 
request to proceed under a pseudonym." Id; see also Doe v. Rostker, 89 F.R.D. 
159 (N.D. Calif. 1981). 
Any substantial privacy interests JANE DOE has must 
outweigh the customary and constitutionally embedded presumption of openness 
to judicial proceedings. Doe v. Frank, 951 F.2d at 323; Doe v. Bergstron, 2009 
WL 528623 (C.A.9(Or.))(denying request to proceed anonymously in civil action 
by Plaintiff where Plaintiff's arrest, prosecution and acquittal were matters of 
public record). 
14. 
In Sweetland v. State, 535 So.2d 646 (Fla. 1st DCA 1988), the court 
reasoned that the purpose of discovery is to eliminate the likelihood of surprise 
and to insure a fair opportunity to prepare for trial. Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 
1.280(b)(1); see also Surf Drugs. Inc .. v. Vermette, 236 So.2d 108, 111 (Fla. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 8 of 12
1970)(stating that the rules of discovery should be afforded broad and liberal 
treatment to effectuate their purpose), citing, Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 
501, 507 (1947). 
15. 
Next, the right to go to court to resolve disputes is a fundamental right. 
D.R. Lakes, Inc. v. Brandsmart U.S.A. of West Palm Beach, 819 So.2d 971 (Fla. 4th 
DCA 2002). All litigants are afforded an equal opportunity. Lingle v. Dion, 776 
So.2d 1073 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). The Florida Constitution establishes the right 
commonly known as access to courts. 
Mitchell v. Moore, 786 So.2d 521 (Fla. 
2001 ). Courts shall be open to any person for the redress of any injury and justice 
shall be administered without sale, denial or delay. Art. I, §21, Fla. Const.; 10A Fla. 
Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law, §360. 
16. 
If Jane Doe's name is not disclosed and identified, Mr. Epstein will not 
be afforded his fundamental right to fairly litigate this dispute and prepare for trial. 
Accordingly, Epstein requests that JANE DOE be identified by her legal name in the 
pleadings. 
c. Response In Opposition And Motion To Identify JANE DOE In Third-
Party Subpoenas 
17. 
Epstein will be effectively denied his due process rights to conduct 
broad, open and liberal discovery in that by failing to identify Jane Doe in various 
third-party subpoenas to her medical providers and other third parties, Epstein 
will be prevented from defending this case. 
18. 
The undersigned must serve subpoenas on medical doctors to 
obtain medical information on JANE DOE's alleged psychological and physical 
damages as same goes to the heart of Epstein's defenses and Plaintiff's 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 9 of 12
damages. Plaintiff is claiming emotional/psychological damages. 
Therefore, 
Epstein is entitled to know her psychological condition(s) before and after the 
alleged incident(s) she references in the Complaint. In particular, JANE DOE 
alleges specific disorders as a result of Epstein's alleged conduct - suffer " .. 
. physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, psychological and 
psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, loss 
of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her 
privacy, separation from her family 
. . . , and medical and psychological 
expenses ... , loss on income, loss of the capacity to earn income in the future, 
and loss of the capacity to enjoy life." (Emphasis Added). See supra. Epstein is 
also entitled to know, among other things, whether she had any physical 
complaints or whether there was ever any evidence of physical battery on JANE 
DOE's body from the acts she complains of in the Complaint. The need to serve 
third-party subpoenas on medical doctors is a basic discovery need related to the 
claims alleged by JANE DOE for which Plaintiff's counsel refuses to compromise. 
Balas v. Ruzzo, 703 So.2d 1076 (Fla. 5th DCA 1997), rev. denied, 719 So.2d 286 
(Fla. 1998)(discoverability of Plaintiff's history of sexual activity is relevant to 
damages); United States v. Bear Stops, 997 F.2d 451 (8th Cir. 1993)(deals with 
"admissibility of other acts of sexual abuse by individuals other than the 
defendant to explain why a victim of abuse exhibited behavioral manifestations of 
a sexually abused child.") 
If Plaintiff saw a psychologist or other physician 
during or after the time periods she claims she was assaulted by Epstein but 
either did not discuss or did discuss the incidents (or lack thereof) would be 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 10 of 12
directly relevant to her damage claims. 
Plaintiff seeks physical and 
emotional/mental personal injury type damages, and the Epstein must conduct 
his own discovery thereon. 
See supra. 
No valid discovery objections or 
exemptions exist preventing necessary and reasonable discovery. 
To hold 
otherwise prevents Mr. Epstein from preparing and defending this matter. 
19. 
In defending this lawsuit, Mr. Epstein should be permitted broad 
discovery, whether admissible at trial or not. 
Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 26 provides, in 
pertinent part, that "parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not 
privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action." 
20. 
In addition, subpoenas must also be served upon various local and 
state institutions in order to determine what crimes, if any, JANE DOE has 
committed (i.e., crimes that involve dishonesty and/or false statement). 
Obviously, this goes directly to the heart of JANE DOE's damages she claims 
suffer suffer ". . .physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, 
psychological and psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, 
embarrassment, loss of educational opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of 
dignity, invasion of her privacy, separation from her family ... , and medical and 
psychological expenses ... , loss on income, loss of the capacity to earn income 
in the future, and loss of the capacity to enjoy life" - caused by Epstein or other 
events in her life) for which a jury is entitled to hear about at trial, and certified 
records must be obtained from the clerk should JANE DOE answer certain 
questions regarding her crimes incorrectly. 
21. 
Epstein is entitled to know whether Jane Doe committed and/or 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 5   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2009   Page 11 of 12
was charged with any crimes. If Jane Doe was charged with crimes, Epstein is 
entitled to obtain certified copies of those crimes Plaintiff may have committed for 
purposes of discovery and impeachment. Questions will be asked regarding 
those crimes (e.g., Have you been convicted of a crime of dishonesty or false 
statement? If so, how many times? Have you been convicted of a felony? If so, 
how many times?) To hold otherwise would not only prevent broad discovery but 
would ultimately result in reversible error at any trial. 
II. Conclusion and Prayer for Relief 
22. 
Epstein requests the following relief: 
a. 
That JANE DOE's Motion to Proceed Anonymously be denied; 
b. 
That this Court grant Epstein's Motion and that JANE DOE be 
identified by her legal name in the style of this case; and 
c. 
That Epstein be granted leave to identify JANE DOE by her 
legal name in Third-Party Subpoenas (but not file them in Court 
or, if required, in a redacted form). 
WHEREFORE, Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein, respectfully requests that this 
Court enter said order granting the relief requested above, and for such other 
and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.

KELLEN, 
Defendants, 
I 
--------------
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's Motion To Stay And Or Continue Action For Time Certain Based On 
Parallel Civil And Criminal Proceedings With Incorporated Memorandum Of Law 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter "EPSTEIN") by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, hereby moves this Court for the entry of an order staying or continuing 
this action for a time certain (i.e., until late 2010 when the NP A expires), pursuant to the 
application of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the fact that a parallel 
proceeding is ongoing and being investigated. In support of his motion, EPSTEIN states: 
I. 
Introduction 
At the outset, EPSTEIN notes this Court's prior Order, dated December 16, 2008, 
(Document 28), in which this Court denied a motion for stay brought by Defendant's prior 
counsel. In that instance, Defendant's counsel requested a mandatory stay under 18 U.S.C.A. 
§3509(k) which the court denied. In denying the request for the stay, this Court stated that a 
discretionary stay was not appropriate at the time the order was entered but also stated, in part, 
that "Any such issues shall be resolved as they arise in the course of litigation.". As discussed 
herein, "special circumstances" now exist which, in the "interests of justice," merit the entry of a 
stay of this civil action until the criminal matter in the 15th Judicial Circuit is "closed" in 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 11-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 2 of 24

Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2009

C.M.A. v. Epstein, et al. 
Page2 
accordance with the United States Attorney's Office ("USAO") Non-Prosecution Agreement 
("NP A") and until the NP A expires. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN was indicted by a grand jury in or around July 2006. See Exhibit 
"A". The Non-Prosecution Agreement is part of the record in connection with that indictment, 
which is signed by the State Attorney of the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, 
Florida ("SAO"). In fact, the NPA acknowledges the investigation performed by the SAO. 
Further, the USAO was present at the Plea hearing whereby the NPA was made part of the 
record. Thus, there is no question that a parallel criminal matter exists in that the SAO's case 
remains open and the NP A lives along side it, which places EPSTEIN under great scrutiny by the 
USAO. The NPA actually places an affirmative duty upon EPSTEIN to undertake discussions 
with the SAO to ensure compliance with the NP A. That check and balance, therefore, remains in 
the hands of the SAO, which has a parallel criminal proceeding. Here, the threat of prosecution 
is real, substantial, and present should the USAO determine that EPSTEIN somehow violated the 
NP A. As discussed below, because the NPA fails to define what constitutes a breach, the USAO 
has apparently taken it upon itself to determine whether a breach has occurred and whether to 
seek criminal prosecution. In fact, the USAO has already attempted to claim violations of the 
NPA due to, among other things, EPSTEIN defending the civil actions against him. Clearly, it is 
NOT simply EPSTEIN's choice as to whether he violates the NPA - that discretion apparently 
lies with the USAO. For this reason alone, a stay is required until the NP A expires. 
The difference between this Motion and the prior motion to stay is solely due to the 
ripeness of the issues discussed herein.

Page 3 
II. 
THENPA 
By its terms, the NPA took effect on June 30, 2008 and expires by those same terms in 
late 2010 so long as EPSTEIN complies with the terms and conditions - violations of which 
remain undefined. The NP A, which remains under seal, outlines various obligations on the part 
of EPSTEIN including, but not limited to, pleading guilty to the Indictment and Information 
before the 15th Judicial Circuit, recommendations for his sentencing before the 15th Judicial 
Circuit, waiver of challenges to the Information filed by the SAO, waiver of right to appeal his 
conviction, agreement not be afforded benefits for gain time, and the agreement to not prosecute 
others listed thereon so long as EPSTEIN does not breach and fulfills the requirements of the 
NPA. 
What the NP A does not outline or define is what constitutes a breach or what act or 
omission constitutes a breach thereof. Therefore, the USAO apparently believes it has the 
discretion to make that unwritten and undefined determination, which places an unreasonable 
burden upon EPSTEIN in defending the civil claims in that he has no idea what the USAO will 
define as a breach in the event he does not assert his 5th Amendment Rights. As an example, the 
.... 
, 
USAO has already claimed that EPSTEIN violated the NP A by: 
1. 
investigating the Plaintiffs (by and though his attorneys) whom brought civil suits 
against him for purposes of defending those civil actions; 
2. 
contesting damages in this action and in the other civil actions; 
3. 
making statements to the press about this Plaintiff or other Plaintiffs by and 
though his attorneys; and

using the word 'jail" instead of "imprisonment" in the plea agreement with SA's 
office. 
See Exhibit "B" Goldberger Affidavit - EPSTEIN's criminal counsel. 
These allegations are silly, unfounded and alleged violations which are not defined as 
violations under the NPA but arrived at by the USAO. Thus, EPSTEIN is left with "Morton's 
Fork" in his side - the undesirable choice of taking the 5th Amendment and having a judgment 
(summary or otherwise) entered against him in the civil action or the undesirable choice of 
subjecting himself to discovery in the civil action before the NP A expires and, thus, face the 
possibility of criminal prosecution by the USAO based upon some illusory breach deemed by the 
USAO by way of information obtained through civil discovery proceedings. This is inherently 
unfair, the danger is clear, and the playing field is not level in light of the NP A language or lack 
thereof. 
As a result, the threat of criminal prosecution against EPSTEIN by the USAO continues 
presently and through late 2010. 
III. 
Justice Requires The Entry of A Stay Because Defendant Is Being 
Forced To Choose Between Waiving His 5th Amendment Privilege Or Risk 
Losing This Civil Case And Forfeiting Other Constitutional Guarantees Of 
Due Process And Effective Assistance Of Counsel 
Once the NP A expires, EPSTEIN fully intends to testify to all relevant and non-
objectionable inquiries made to him in discovery be it a deposition, in interrogatories or in 
production requests. (Emphasis Added) However, the current circumstances are such that by 
testifying or responding to discovery, EPSTEIN will be required to waive his constitutional 
privileges, thereby subjecting himself to criminal prosecution and scrutiny by the USAO as a

C.M.A. v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 5 
result of matters alleged in this civil action ( and others before this Court and in the State of 
Florida 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach County). 
The special circumstances of this action are such that a stay or continuance for a time 
certain is NOT prejudicial and is required to be entered so that: 
(1) EPSTEIN is not required to waive his Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination under the United States Constitution resulting in severe prejudice to EPSTEIN in 
pending criminal matters; and 
(2) EPSTEIN is not forced to choose between waiving his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination or losing the civil case. 
Here, in asserting his Fifth Amendment Privilege, the Plaintiff is afforded an opportunity 
rarely given - that is, to put on only her evidence without any counterevidence from Defendant 
resulting in a judgment of liability against EPSTEIN. This is inherently unfair and precisely the 
special circumstances where "in the interests of justice" a stay is required. Ventura v. Brosky, 
2006 WL 3392207 (S.D. Fla. 2006), citing. United States v. Lot 5, Fox Grove, 23 F.3d 359 (11 th 
Cir. 1994). In Ventura, a stay was entered where a Defendant was confronted with issue of 
waiving his 5th Amendment Privilege or to loose a civil case by way of motion for summary 
judgment. Id. Here, EPSTEIN is not requesting a mandatory stay. EPSTEIN only asks that this 
court recognize that "special circumstances" exists in this matter and enter a stay in the "interests 
of justice" and only for a specified period of time (i.e., after the NPA expires). See also 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 755 F.Supp. 1018, 1019 (S.D. Fla. 1990)(Defendant was 
in precarious position while being subject to criminal investigation and reasoning that 
compelling Defendant to speak by ordering an accounting of alleged illicit funds would directly

impinge his right against self-incrimination). The court found it appropriate to grant the request 
for stay. (Emphasis Added). 
Citing to U.S. v. Lot 5, Fox Grove, supra, the Southern District Court, Florida, in 
Ventura v. Brosky. 2006 WL 3392207 (S.D. Fla. 2006), stated-
The Eleventh Circuit has also created a test for these circumstances, stating that 
where there exists a concurrent civil and criminal proceeding, a court must stay 
a civil proceeding pending resolution of a related criminal prosecution when 
"special circumstances" so require in the "interests of justice." 
(Bold emphasis added). See also United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, 12 & n. 27, 90 S.Ct. 763, 
769-70 & n.27 (1970). The Ventura Court went on to state that "situations where a defendant in 
both criminal and civil proceedings must choose whether to waive his privilege against self-
incrimination or to lose the civil case in summary or default judgment proceedings have met this 
test's burden and warrant a stay." Id. The Ventura court granted the stay. Here, the l 5th Judicial 
Circuit action lives along with the NP A. 
In making a decision to enter such a stay, the court may consider the following factors: 
(1) 
the interests of the Plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously with litigation, or any 
aspect of it, and the potential prejudice of Plaintiff to the delay; 
(2) 
the burden which any particular aspect of the proceedings may impose on the 
defendant; 
(3) 
the convenience of the court in the management of its cases, and the efficient use 
of judicial resources; 
( 4) 
the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation; and 
(5) 
the interest of the public in the pending civil and criminal litigation.

First, in applying the above factors, the Plaintiff in the instant matter will not be 
prejudiced simply by claiming a delay in time. 
Second, the burden is far greater on the 
EPSTEIN if he is forced to waive his 5th Amendment Privilege or remain silent and have a 
judgment entered against him or choose to testify and face criminal prosecution. Third, efficient 
use of judicial resources would be rendered upon a stay by way of preventing an appeal if such a 
stay is not entered. The Court has broad discretion to enter such a stay. Fourth, the interests of 
the individuals outlined in the NPA will be served because EPSTEIN's fulfillment of NPA 
alleged obligations is determinative upon whether the USAO prosecutes those individuals or 
whether the claims will be dropped upon the expiration of the NP A. Finally, the interest of the 
public in the pending civil and criminal cases will not be prejudiced as EPSTEIN is already 
serving his term whereby a plea was entered in the 15 Judicial Circuit action.

Application of the 5th Amendment 
Next, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination "permits a person not to 
answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or 
informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings." Edwin v. 
Price, 778 F.2d 668,669 (11 th Cir. 1985), citing Lefkowitz v. Turley. 414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.C. 
316,322 (1973). See also Ohio v. Reiner, 532 U.S. 17, 21, 121 S.Ct. 1252 (2001)(The Fifth 
Amendment privilege is also available to those who claim innocence. 
One of the Fifth 
Amendment's "basic functions ... is to protect innocent men ... 'who otherwise might be 
ensnared by ambiguous circumstances."); Malloy v. Hogan, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1495 (1964)(the 
Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause applies to the states through the Due Process

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment - "[i]t would be incongruous to have different standards 
determine the validity of a claim of privilege based on the same feared prosecution, depending 
on whether the claim was asserted in state or federal court."); Kastigar v. U.S., 406 U.S. 441, 
444-45, 92 S.Ct. 1653 (1972)(The Fifth Amendment privilege "can be asserted in any 
proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory; and it 
protects against any disclosures which the witness reasonably believes could be used in a 
criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used. This Court has been 
zealous to safeguard the values which underlie the privilege." (Emphasis added)). 
The United States Supreme Court made it clear that the scope of the Fifth Amendment 
Privilege includes the circumstances as here "the act of producing documents in response to a 
subpoena (or production request) has a compelled testimonial aspect." United States v. Hubbell, 
530 U.S. 27, 36, 120 S.Ct. 2037, 2043 (2000); see also Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 
(1976); McCormick on Evidence, Title 6, Chap. 13. The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 
§138 (6th Ed.). The privilege against self-incrimination may be asserted during discovery when a 
litigant has "reasonable grounds to believe that the response would furnish a link in the chain of 
evidence needed to prove a crime against a litigant." A witness, including a civil defendant, is 
entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege whenever there is a realistic possibility that the 
answer to a question could be used in anyway to convict the witness of a crime or could aid in 
the development of other incriminating evidence that can be used at trial. Id; Pillsbury Company 
v. Conboy, 495 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 608 (1983). 
Certainly, if the USAO decides to prosecute EPSTEIN for an alleged violation of the 
NP A, it would undoubtedly be able to use information obtained during discovery against him or 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 11-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 9 of 24

C.M.A. v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 9 
use that information to aid in the development of other evidence against him at a criminal trial. 
The USAO is already claiming violations of the NPA based upon EPSTEIN defending the civil 
actions and, at the same time, while EPSTEIN asserts the 5th Amendment. Imagine, because that 
is all we can do based on the lack of wording in the NP A, what violations the USAO will assert 
if EPSTEIN is forced to waive his 5th Amendment privilege to defend himself in this and the 
other civil actions. 
The Fifth Amendment provides, in relevant part, that "No person ... shall be compelled 
in any Criminal Case to be a witness against himself." Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 
486, 71 S.Ct. 814 (1951), citing Feldman v. United States, 1944, 322 U.S. 487, 489, 64 S.Ct. 
1082, 1083, 88 L.Ed. 1408." The Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination is 
"accorded liberal construction in favor of the right it was intended to secure." "The immediate 
and potential evils of compulsory self-disclosure transcend any difficulties that the exercise of 
the privilege may impose on society in the detection and prosecution of a crime." Id., at 490; 
and In re Keller Financial Svcs. of Fla., Inc., 259 B.R. 391, 399 (M.D. Fla. 2000). The privilege 
not only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a criminal 
statute but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed 
to prosecute the claimant for a crime. Id, citing Blau v. United States, 1950, 340 U.S. 159, 71 
S.Ct. 223. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination "permits a person not to 
answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or 
informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings." Edwin v. 
Price, 778 F.2d at 669, citing Lefkowitz v. Turley. 414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.C. 316,322 (1973). As 
EPSTEIN is here, "the claimant must be 'confronted by substantial and 'real,' and not merely

trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination."' See generally. United States v. Apfelbaum, 445 
U.S. 115, 128, 100 S.Ct. 948, 956, 63 L.Ed.2d 250 (1980)). See also, United States v. Neff. 615 
F.2d 1235, 1239 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 925, 100 S.Ct. 3018, 65 L.Ed.2d 1117 
(l 980)(1nformation is protected by the privilege not only if it would support a criminal 
conviction, but even if "the responses would merely 'provide a lead or clue' to evidence having a 
tendency to incriminate."). EPSTEIN falls under each of the above category of cases. 
The United States Supreme Court has made clear that the scope of the Fifth Amendment 
Privilege also encompasses the circumstance where "the act of producing documents in response 
to a subpoena (or production request) has a compelled testimonial aspect." United States v. 
Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 36, 120 S.Ct. 2037, 2043 (2000); see also Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 
391 (1976). In explaining the application of the privilege, the Supreme Court stated: 
We have held that "the act of production" itself may implicitly communicate 
"statements of fact." By "producing documents in compliance with a subpoena, 
the witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, 
and were authentic." Moreover, as was true in this case, when the custodian of 
documents responds to a subpoena, he may be compelled to take the witness stand 
and answer questions designed to determine whether he has produced everything 
demanded by the subpoena. The answers to those questions, as well as the act of 
production itself, may certainly communicate information about the existence, 
custody, and authenticity of the documents. Whether the constitutional privilege 
protects the answers to such questions, or protects the act of production itself, is a 
question that is distinct from the question whether the unprotected contents of the 
documents themselves are incriminating. 
"The issue presented in those cases was whether the act of producing subpoenaed 
documents, not itself the making of a statement, might nonetheless have some 
protected testimonial aspects. The Court concluded that the act of production could 
constitute protected testimonial communication because it might entail implicit 
statements of fact: by producing documents in compliance with a subpoena, the 
witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, and 
were authentic. United States v. Doe. 465 U.S .. at 613. and n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1237; 
Fisher, 425 U.S.. at 409-410. 96 S.Ct. 1569; id., at 428. 432. 96 S.Ct. 1569

(concurring opinions). See Braswell v. United States, [487 U.S.,] at 104, 108 S.Ct. 
2284; [ id.,] at 122, 108 S.Ct. 2284 (dissenting opinion). Thus, the Court made 
clear that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to acts 
that imply assertions of fact." ... An examination of the Court's application of these 
principles in other cases indicates the Court's recognition that, in order to be 
testimonial, an accused's communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate 
a factual assertion or disclose information. Only then is a person compelled to be a 
'witness' against himself." Doe v. United States, 487 U.S., at 209-210, 108 S.Ct. 
2341 (footnote omitted). 
Finally, the phrase "in any criminal case" in the text of the Fifth Amendment might 
have been read to limit its coverage to compelled testimony that is used against the 
defendant in the trial itself. It has, however, long been settled that its protection 
encompasses compelled statements that lead to the discovery of incriminating 
evidence even though the statements themselves are not incriminating and are not 
introduced into evidence. Thus, a half century ago we held that a trial judge had 
erroneously rejected a defendant's claim of privilege on the ground that his answer 
to the pending question would not itself constitute evidence of the charged offense. 
As we explained: 
"The privilege afforded not only extends to answers that would in themselves 
support a conviction under a federal criminal statute but likewise embraces those 
which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the 
claimant for a federal crime." Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 
S.Ct. 814, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). 
Compelled testimony that communicates information that may "lead to 
incriminating evidence" is privileged even if the information itself is not 
inculpatory. Doe v. United States, 487 U.S. 201, 208, n. 6, 108 S.Ct. 2341, 101 
L.Ed.2d 184 (1988). 
It's the Fifth Amendment's protection against the 
prosecutor's use of incriminating information derived directly or indirectly from 
the compelled testimony of the respondent that is of primary relevance in this case. 
The privilege against self-incrimination may be asserted during discovery when a litigant 
has "reasonable grounds to believe that the response would furnish a link in the chain of 
evidence needed to prove a crime against a litigant." A witness, including a civil defendant, is 
entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege whenever there is a realistic possibility that the 
answer to a question could be used in anyway to convict the witness of a crime or could aid in

the development of other incriminating evidence that can be used at trial. Id; Pillsbury Company 
v. Conboy, 495 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 608 (1983). 
See also, Hubbell, supra, as to what is 
encompassed by the phrase "in any criminal case" contained in the Fifth Amendment. 
As noted, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is broad. Hoffman; 
In re Keller Financial Svcs., supra. To deny a witness the right to invoke the privilege, the judge 
must be perfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the 
witness is mistaken, and that the answers cannot possibly have such tendency to incriminate. IQ, 
at 488, 399. Recognizing the breadth and magnitude of this constitutional privilege, the United 
States Supreme Court in discussing how a court is to analyze the application of the privilege 
stated-
... It is for the court to say whether his silence is justified, Rogers v. United States, 
1951, 340 U.S. 367, 71 S.Ct. 438, and to require him to answer if 'it clearly appears 
to the court that he is mistaken.' Temple v. Commonwealth, 1880, 75 Va. 892, 899. 
However, if the witness, upon interposing his claim, were required to prove the 
hazard in the sense in which a claim is usually required to be established in court, he 
would be compelled to surrender the very protection which the privilege is designed 
to guarantee. To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications 
of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the 
question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because 
injurious disclosure could result. The trial judge in appraising the claim 'must be 
governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the 
facts actually in evidence.' 
Hoffman, supra at 486-487. 
Hoffman and its progeny establish that "in view of the liberal construction of the 
provision [protecting against self-incrimination], after a witness has asserted the privilege, he 
should be compelled to provide the requested information only if it "clearly appears" to the court 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 11-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 13 of 24

Page 13 
that the witness was mistaken in his invocation of the privilege." (Emphasis added). In re Keller 
Financial Svcs., supra at 399, citing Hoffman, at 486. 
In the instant case, the privilege applies as Defendant EPSTEIN "has reasonable cause to 
apprehend danger from a direct answer." The risk of incrimination resulting from being subject 
to discovery or to testify in his own defense while the NPA exists is "substantial and real" and 
"not trifling or imaginary haphazards of communication." See generally, In re Keller Financial 
Svcs., supra at 400. Based on the nature of Plaintiffs claims, along with the ongoing scrutiny 
of the USAO in the criminal matters, EPSTEIN has "reasonable grounds to believe that his 
responses to the discovery would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prove a crime 
against him. Finally, in order to preserve the privilege, the privilege must be asserted or one 
risks the loss or waiver of this liberty ensuring protection. See generally. U.S. v. White, 846 
F.2d 678, 690 (11 th Cir. 1988)("First, it ignores the settled principle which requires a witness to 
assert his Fifth Amendment rights. A witness who testifies at any proceeding, instead of asserting 
his Fifth Amendment rights, loses the privilege .... A civil deponent cannot choose to answer 
questions with the expectation of later asserting the Fifth Amendment."). 
Also applicable in upholding the assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege is the 
guarantee of effective assistance of counsel by the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
See Yarborough v. Gentry, 124 S.Ct. 1, 540 U.S. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003)(Sixth Amendment 
guarantees criminal defendants effective assistance of counsel.), on remand 381 F.3d 1219. The 
United States Constitutional guarantees are applicable to the states through the Fourteenth 
Amendment. Obviously, EPSTEIN's assertion of his constitutional privileges and protections is 
on the advice of counsel. Again, EPSTEIN continues to face criminal prosecution by the USAO 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 11-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 14 of 24

C.M.A. v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 14 
until the expiration of the NP A; under the constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of 
counsel, he is entitled to follow the recommended advice of his criminal defense attorney. See 
Goldberger Affidavit attached hereto. 
EPSTEIN' s invocation of his constitutional protections of the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendments must be upheld for the reasons set forth herein; otherwise such constitutional 
protections would be rendered meaningless. Already and recently, Defendant EPSTEIN in his 
Response and Objections to discovery, attached hereto as Exhibit "C", has been required to 
assert, on advice of counsel, his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, along 
with his constitutional rights afforded under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United 
States Constitution. Thus, EPSTEIN' s entitlement to a stay is ripe for determination. 
Based upon the foregoing, a stay is warranted in this action as the Defendant is being 
forced to choose between the assertion of his Fifth Amendment right or losing this case by 
judgment (summary or otherwise) or waiver of his 5th Amendment right and face potential 
criminal prosecution.

BEFORE 
ME, 
the 
undersigned 
authority, 
personally 
appeared 
having personal knowledge and being duly sworn, deposes and says: 
1. 
I, Jack A. Goldberger, have personal knowledge of the matters set 
forth herein. I am an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Florida since 
1978. I am a partner with the law firm of Atterbury Goldberger & Weiss, P.A., 
located at One Clearlake Centre, Suite 1400, 250 Australian Avenue South, West 
Palm Beach, FL 33401. 
2. 
My practice includes and specializes in the defense of criminal 
matters. I am board certified in criminal law. I have been and currently am the 
criminal defense attorney for JEFFREY EPSTEIN. 
3. 
I represented Mr. EPSTEIN in the negotiation of and entering into a 
Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) for 
the Federal Southern District of Florida. The terms and conditions of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement also entailed the entering of a Plea Agreement with the 
State Attorney's Office, Palm Beach County, State of Florida. 
(The Non-
Prosecution Agreement shall hereinafter be referred to as the "NPA"). 
4. 
By its terms, the NPA took effect on June 30, 2008. Also, pursuant 
to the terms of the NPA, any criminal prosecution against EPSTEIN is deferred 
as long as the terms and conditions of the NPA are fulfilled by EPSTEIN.

5. 
The criminal matters against EPSTEIN remain ongoing until the 
NPA expires by its terms in late 2010, and as long as the USAO determines 
EPSTEIN has complied with those terms and conditions. The threat of criminal 
prosecution against EPSTEIN by USAO in the Southern District of Florida 
continues presently and through late 2010. 
6. 
Pursuant to the terms of the NPA, the USAO possesses the right to 
declare that the agreement has been breached, give EPSTEIN's counsel notice, 
and attempt to move forward with a prosecution. As of the date of this Affidavit, 
the USAO has taken the position on a number of occasions that it might consider 
the following actions by EPSTEIN to be a breach of the NPA. 
• 
Investigation by EPSTEIN (by and through his attorneys) of this Plaintiff 
and the other Plaintiffs in other pending civil cases for purposes of 
defending the civil actions; 
• 
EPSTEIN's contesting damages in this action and other civil actions. 
• 
EPSTEIN or his legal representatives making statements to the press 
about this Plaintiff or the other Plaintiffs. 
• 
Using the word "jail" instead of "imprisonment" in the plea agreement with 
the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office. 
7. 
EPSTEIN, through counsel, submitted a Freedom of Information 
Act request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for documents relating to 
this and the other cases; the FBI denied the request stating the materials are at 
this time exempt from disclosure because they are in an investigative file, i.e. the 
matter is still an ongoing criminal investigation.

--------------
DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S RESPONSE & OBJECTIONS 
TO PLAINTIFF'S FIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his undersigned attorneys, 
hereby responds to Plaintiff's First Request For Production To Defendant, served 
January 8, 2009 and states: 
Request No. 1: 
Any and all evidence required to be maintained by Epstein 
and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, specifically evidence 
requested by or directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that have been issued in 
connection with the investigation referenced in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, and 
including certain computer equipment. 
Response: 
Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the production 
request as well as his U.S. constitutional privileges. I intend to produce all relevant 
documents regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled me that at the 
present time I cannot select, authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this

lawsuit and I must accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to 
effective representation. Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under the 
Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United States 
Constitution. 
Drawing an adverse inference under these circumstances would 
unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my constitutional rights, would 
unreasonable, and would therefore violate the Constitution. In addition to and without 
waiving his constitutional privileges, the information sought is privileged and 
confidential, and inadmissible pursuant to the terms of the deferred prosecution 
agreement, Fed. Rule of Evidence 410 and 408, and §90.410, Fla. Stat. Further, the 
request may include information subject to work product or an attorney-client privilege. 
Request No. 2: 
Any and all documents reflecting or relating to the identity of, 
the scheduling of, and/or the payment of any female compensated by or on behalf of 
Epstein for providing any service to Epstein that required, contemplated, or included in 
the provisions of such service, any physical contact between Epstein and the female, 
any act or prostitution, any illicit sexual conduct, the exposure of breast, buttocks or 
genitalia, or any commercial sex act as defined in 18 U.S.C. §1591(c)(1). 
Response: Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the production 
request as well as his U.S. constitutional privileges. I intend to produce all relevant 
documents regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled me that at the 
present time I cannot select, authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this 
lawsuit and I must accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to 
effective representation. Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under the

unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my constitutional rights, would

waiving his constitutional privileges, the information sought is privileged and 
confidential, and inadmissible pursuant to the terms of the deferred prosecution 
agreement, Fed. Rule of Evidence 410 and 408, and §90.410, Fla. Stat. 
Further 
Defendants objects to the production as overly broad and seeking information that is 
neither relevant to the subject matter of the pending action nor does it appear to be 
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Plaintiff in 
this instance has alleged in her complaint that she was sexually abused by the 
Defendant on one occasion sometime in the year 2004. The documents requested 
herein have no time period provided, and therefore the information sought is grossly 
overbroad. 
Request No. 3: 
Any and all documents reflecting or relating to the identity of 
and/or the nature and extent of any other person's participation in the communication 
with and/or the scheduling of and/or the payment of any person who participated in any 
conduct described in Request #2. 
Response: Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the production 
request as well as his U.S. constitutional privileges. I intend to produce all relevant 
documents regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled me that at the

ORDER REQUESTING THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE ITS POSITION
REGARDING DEFENDANT EPSTEIN’S MOTION TO STAY/CONTINUE THE CIVIL
CASES PENDING AGAINST HIM
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon the motions filed in several cases by Defendant
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 3 of 4

Jeffrey Epstein to Stay and/or Continue the Action for Time Certain Based on Parallel Civil and
Criminal Proceedings.  See, e.g., docket entry 51 in C.M.A. v. Epstein and Kellen, case no. 08-
80811 (attached).  Epstein moves for a stay until the expiration of the Non-Prosecution
Agreement (“NPA”) with the United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) because, he claims, the
USAO has taken the position that he is violating the NPA by defending the civil actions filed
against him.  Therefore, he argues that he cannot defend the civil actions without subjecting
himself to criminal prosecution.  
While the Court recognizes that the United States is not a party to these actions and is not
obligated to comment on this matter, the position of the United States would greatly assist the
Court in resolving the merits of these motions to continue/stay the case. Accordingly, the Court
requests that the United States provide its position on the matter.  The Court would appreciate the
governments position within 15 days if possible.  If the United States is unwilling to state its
position, the Court would also appreciate being so advised.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 14  day of May, 2009

PLAINTIFF'S NOTICE OF FILING WITHDRAWAL OF PREVIOUSLY RAISED 
OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT, JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S, MOTION TO COMPEL 
AND/OR IDENTIFY C.M.A. IN THE STYLE OF THIS CASE AND MOTION TO 
IDENTIFY C.M.A. IN THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENAS FOR PURPOSES OF 
DISCOVERY, OR, ALTERNATIVELY, MOTION TO DISMISS SUA SPONTE, WITH 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, C.M.A., by and through her undersigned attorneys, hereby files notice of 
withdrawal of previously raised objections to Defendant, JEFRREY EPSTEIN'S, Motion 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/20/2009   Page 4 of 6
to Compel and/or Identify C. M.A. in the Style of This Case and Motion to Identify C. M.A. 
in Third-Party Subpoenas For Purposes of Discovery, or, Alternatively, Motion to 
Dismiss Sua Sponte, With Incorporated Memorandum of Law, and further states as 
follows: 
1. 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, filed a Motion to Compel and/or Identify 
C. M.A. in the Style of This Case and Motion to Identify C. M.A. in Third-Party Subpoenas 
For Purposes of Discovery, or, Alternatively, Motion to Dismiss Sua Sponte, With 
Incorporated Memorandum of Law (D.E. 67) on April 29, 2009. 
2. 
EPSTEIN's Motion seeks the following relief (taken verbatim from the 
conclusion of his Motion): 
a) "That C.M.A. be identified by her legal name in the style of this case; 
b) That Epstein be granted leave to identify C.M.A. by her legal name in 
Third-Party Subpoenas (but not file them in Court, or, if required, in a 
redacted form); and 
c) That on an alternative basis, this court dismiss this action Sua Sponte 
until such time as C.M.A. identifies herself in the style of this matter. 
Doe v. Rostker, 89 F.R.D at 163." 
3. 
Plaintiff withdraws her objection to a) and b) requested above. 
The 
request to have C.M.A.'s case dismissed is rendered moot given C.M.A.'s acquiescence 
to a) and b). To the extent that it is not, however, C.M.A. continues to object to c) 
above.

Of Counsel 
Re: 
Preservation of Evidence Relevant to Actions for Civil Remedies 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 
Gentlemen: 
As you know, we represent a number of the young women on the list of names provided 
to Messrs. Goldberger and Tein by the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding the Jeffrey Epstein Non-
Prosecution Agreement and Addendum. In order to be crystal clear as to whom we represent, we 
have attached a list of our present clients. By this letter, we want to ensure that discoverable 
information relating to each of their civil actions is being properly preserved, as is required under 
Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. You are required to take the necessary steps to 
preserve all paper documents, tangible objects (including, but not limited to, film, videos, DVDs, 
photographs, whether in hard copy, negatives or digital images), and electronically stored 
infotmation related to any threatened action by my clients, whether found inside or outside of the 
United States, including any information held by third parties. Although we may bring a motion 
for an order preserving documents and other data from destruction or alteration, your client's 
obligation to preserve documents and other data discovery in this case arises independently from 
any order on such motion. 
As you know, the Non-Prosecution Agreement also requires your client "to maintain [his] 
evidence, specifically evidence requested by 01· directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that 
have been issued, and inclnding certain computer equipment, inviolate until all of the teims of 
Podhur-st Orgeck, P.A. 25 West Flagler Street, Suite 800r Miami, FL 33130 
Miami 305.358.2800 Fax 305.358.2382 • Fort Lauderdale 954.463.4346 
,vww.podhurst.com 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 2 of 4
this agreement have been satisfied." We will seek information related to Mr. Epstein's sexual 
exploitation of our clients in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421, 2422, 2423, 2251, 2252, and/or 
2252A, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Your client reasonably should have known of 
potential criminal pmsecution and/or civil litigation since, at least, October 25, 2005. This duty 
to preserve evidence extends to evidence beyond that which was seized from Mr. Epstein's 
residence on October 25, 2005. It also extends to evidence that was seized on October 25, 2005 
and later returned to him if it may be relevant and discoverable in any of these civil actions. 
Because of the-nature of these violations, we consider electronically stored information to 
be a critical and itTeplaceable source of discovery and/or evidence in this matter. You should 
anticipate that much of the information subject to disclosure or responsive to discove1y in this 
cause is stored on your current and former computer systems and other media and devices 
(including handheld devices, personal digital assistants, voice-messaging systems, online 
repositories and cell phones). Electronically stored infmmation should be afforded the broadest 
possible meaning and includes (by way of example and not as an exclusive list) potentially 
relevant information electronically, magnetically, optically or otherwise stored as: 
I. 
Digital communication (e.g., e-mail, voice mail, instant messaging); 
2. 
E-mail Server Stores (e.g., Lotus Domino .NSF or Microsoft Exchange .EDB) 
3. 
Word-processed documents (e.g., Word or WordPerfect files and drafts); 
4. 
Spreadsheets and tables (e.g., Excel or Lotus 123 worksheets); 
5. 
Accounting Application Data (e.g., QuickBooks, Money, Peachtree data); 
6. 
Image and Facsimile Files (e.g., .PDF, .TIFF, .JPG, .GIF images); 
7. 
Sound Recordings (e.g., .WAY and .MP3 files); 
8. 
Video and Animation (e.g., .A VI aud .MOV files); 
9. 
Databases (e.g., Access, Oracle, SQL Server data, SAP); 
10. 
Contact and Relationship Management Data (e.g., Outlook, ACTI); 
11. 
Calendar and Diaiy Application Data (e.g., Outlook PST, blog entries); 
12. 
Online Access Data (e.g., Tempora1y Internet Files, History, Cookies); 
13. 
Presentations (e.g., PowerPoint, Corel Presentations); 
14. 
Network Access and Server Activity Logs; 
15. 
Project Management Application Data; 
16. 
Computer Aided Design/Drawing Files; and 
17. 
Backup ai1d archival files (e.g., Veritas, Zip, .GHO). 
Electronically stored information resides not only in areas of electronic, magnetic, and 
optical storage media reasonably accessible to you and your client, but also in areas you may 
deem not reasonably accessible. You are obliged to preserve potentially relevant evidence from 
both sources of electronically stored information, even if you do not anticipate producing such 
electronically stored information. Similarly, you and your client are obligated to preserve all 
potentially relevant evidence even if you do not intend to produce such evidence because you 
anticipate raising your client's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
The laws and rules prohibiting destrnction of evidence apply to electronically stored 
information in the same manner that they apply to other evidence. Because of its format, 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 3 of 4
electronically stored information is easily deleted, modified or corrupted. Accordingly, your . 
client must take every reasonable step to preserve this information until the final resolution of 
this matter. Adequate preservation of electronically stored information requires more than 
simply refraining from efforts to destroy or dispose of such evidence. You must intervene to 
prevent loss due to routine operations or malfeasance and you must employ proper techniques 
and protocols to preserve electronically stored information. Booting a drive, examining its 
contents, or running any application may irretrievably alter the evidence it contains and constitute 
unlawful spoliation of evidence. Preservation requires preemptive immediate intervention. 
With regard to electronically stored infonnation created subsequent to the date of delive1y 
of this letter, relevant evidence should not be destroyed, and your client is to take appropriate 
steps required to avoid destruction of such evidence. 
Please fo1ward a copy of this letter to all persons and entities with custodial responsibility 
for the evidence referred to in this letter. 
Failure to abide by this request could result in penalties and/or sanctions against your 
client and could fo1m the basis oflegal claims for spoliation. 
If this c011'espondence is in any way unclear, please contact us immediately. We look 
fo1ward to receiving written confinnation from you that you have taken the necessmy steps to 
fulfill these preservation obligations by Thursday, May 21, 2009 in order to alleviate the need for 
us to seek a court order. 
Sincerely, 
cc: 
Roy Black, Esq, 
Jay Lefkowitz, Esq.

reasonable efforts to identify and notify such nonparties. 
C. "Preservation" is to be interpreted broadly to accomplish the goal of maintaining the 
integrity of all documents, data, and tangible things reasonably anticipated to be 
subject to discovery in these actions under Rules 26, 45, and 56(e) of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. Preservation includes taking reasonable steps to prevent 
the partial or full destruction, alteration, testing, deletion, shredding, incineration, 
wiping, relocation, migration, theft, or mutation of such material, as well as negligent 
or intentional handling that would make material incomplete or inaccessible. 
D. Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and his employees, agents, and attorneys shall preserve 
any evidence from the October 25, 2005 execution of a search warrant at his mansion 
at 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach, Florida, that has already been returned to him by 
the Palm Beach Police Department. 
E. If an objection or privilege is raised, the parties may raise the issue with this Court 
and shall preserve the evidence in question pending resolution by the Court. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16-3   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 6 of 6
F. The parties, without leave of Court, may agree in writing that certain documents or 
categories of evidence need not be preserved as otherwise required by this Order. If 
such agreement is reached, such agreement is effective upon signing and without 
further order of this Court. 
G. This Order shall not be deemed to create any "safe harbors" for the destruction of 
evidence. If this Court determines that evidence has been destroyed or lost, whether 
knowingly or not, it will impose appropriate sanctions. 
H. Each party shall bear its own costs for complying with this Order. 
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida,

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NO. 101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102's 
MOTION FOR AN ORDER FOR THE PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE 
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 4 of 15
Plaintiffs, Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 (the "Plaintiffs"), pursuant to Rules 
26, 34, and 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby move this Court for an Order for 
the Preservation of Evidence directed to Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and, as grounds, state as 
follows: 
I. 
After investigations by the Palm Beach Police Department ("PBPD"), the Palm 
Beach State Attorney's Office ("PB SAO"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and the 
United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida ("USAO"), Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, in June 2008, entered pleas of "guilty" in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in Palm 
Beach County, Florida, to various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for 
prostitution and the procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution. 
2. 
As outlined in detail in the relevant complaints, beginning in or around 1998 
through in or around September 2007, Defendant used his resources and his influence over 
vulnerable minor children to engage in a systematic pattern of sexually exploitative behavior. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, sexually abused Plaintiffs while Plaintiffs were under the age of 18 
years old. 
3. 
As a result of Defendant's sexual abuse, Plaintiffs filed their actions, alleging 
multiple violations of federal statutes condemning the coercion and enticement of a minor to 
engage in prostitution or sexual activity, travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, sex 
trafficking of children, sexual exploitation of minor children, transport of visual depictions of a 
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, transport of child pornography, child exploitation 
enterprises, and other crimes, specifically including, but not limited to, those crimes designated 
in 18 U.S.C. § 2421, § 2422(a), § 2422(b), § 2423(a), § 2423(b), § 2423(e), § 2251, § 2252, § 
2252A(a)(l), and§ 2252A(g)(l). 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 5 of 15
4. 
On October 25, 2005, the PBPD executed a search warrant at Defendant's Palm 
Beach, Florida mansion at 358 El Brillo Way. Thus, Defendant reasonably should have known 
of potential criminal prosecution and/or civil litigation since at least that date. 
5. 
According to the PBPD Property Receipt, evidence seized during the October 25, 
2005 search included phone message books, photographs of nude underage females, VHS tapes, 
CDs, and school transcripts of underage girls. See PBPD Property Receipt (attached hereto as 
Exhibit A). While still incarcerated, Defendant filed a Motion for Return of Property with the 
Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County on July 23, 2008. 
On September 5, 2008, this Court entered an Order in Jane Doe v. Jeffrey Epstein, et al., Case 
No. 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON, directing Defendant to preserve the evidence listed in 
the PBPD Property Receipt and to provide duplicates to the plaintiff should this evidence be 
returned to Defendant by the State of Florida (DE# 20). 
6. 
According to the PBPD Property Receipt, at least some of the evidence has 
already been returned to Defendant, including zip CDs, 8mm videotapes, floppy disks, zip drive 
disks, CPUs from various areas throughout the mansion, and phone message books. Upon 
information and belief, one or more sexually explicit printed photographs of Plaintiffs and other 
minor girls taken by Defendant and/or his agents when Plaintiffs were minors were confiscated 
during the search and may have been returned to him. In addition, the zip CDs, 8mm videotapes, 
floppy disks, zip drive disks, and CPUs that were returned to Defendant may have contained, and 
may still contain, pornographic images of these and other minors. Plaintiffs respectfully request 
that this Court clarify that the Order of September 5, 2008 requires returned evidence to be 
preserved. 
7. 
In addition, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to take judicial notice that, in 
the event that such evidence includes child pornography, it is imperative for the PBPD, the FBI, 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 6 of 15
the USAO, and the PBSAO not to return any photographs that may be child pornography 
(including files, electronic or otherwise) to Defendant or his counsel. Pursuant to the Adam 
Walsh Protection and Safety Act, Pub. L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587 (2006), any property or 
material that constitutes child pornography shall remain in the care, custody, and control of either 
the government or the court. Defendant has no right to seek its return. See 18 U.S.C. § 3509(m) 
(2008). In addition, copying evidence that constitutes child pornography is not permissible as 
long as the Government makes the property or material reasonably available to the defendant. 
See 18 U.S.C. § 3509(m)(2)(A) (2008). 
8. 
In addition to evidence related to the October 25 search, Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, exercises sole custody and control over specific evidence relevant and material to this 
lawsuit relating to Defendant's sexual abuse of Plaintiffs, including, but not limited to, 
documents, data, and tangible things, including, but not limited to, writings; records; files; 
correspondence; digital or chemical process photographs (including negatives); reports; 
memoranda; calendars; diaries; minutes; electronic messages; voicemail; e-mail; telephone 
message records or logs; computer and network activity logs; hard drives; backup data; 
removable computer storage media, such as tapes, disks, and cards; printouts; document image 
files; web pages; databases; spreadsheets; software; books; ledgers; journals; orders; invoices; 
bills; vouchers; checks; statements; worksheets; summaries; compilations; computations; charts; 
diagrams; graphic presentations; drawings; films; charts; video, phonographic, tape, or digital 
recordings or transcripts thereof; drafts; jottings; and notes. Information that serves to identify, 
locate, or link such material, such as file inventories, file folders, indices, and metadata, is also 
included. Specifically, Plaintiffs consider the following evidence relevant: records of phone 
communications; records of domestic and international travel, including travel in Defendant's 
private airplanes; former and current employee records; tax returns; medical bills; bills regarding 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 7 of 15
any other expenses; all documents evidencing payment by Defendant of U.S. currency and/or 
merchandise to each victim; any evidence stored in Defendant's storage unit; photographs of 
Defendant's mansions; any diary, log, memo pad, calendar, or other writing reflecting date of 
each victim's visit(s) to Defendant's mansions; any diary or document wherein each victim 
wrote regarding a victim's visit to Defendant's mansions; all documents sent to or by the PBPD, 
the FBI, the USAO, or the PBSAO; and all computers used by Defendant and/or his agents 
and/or employees since 1998. 
9. 
Other relevant evidence includes, but is not limited to, electronically-stored 
information stored on Defendant's current and former computer systems and other media and 
devices (including handheld devices, personal digital assistants, voice-messaging systems, online 
repositories, and cellular telephones). Electronically-stored information should be afforded the 
broadest possible meaning and includes ( by way of example and not as an exclusive list) 
potentially relevant information electronically, magnetically, optically, or otherwise stored as: 
I. 
Digital communication (e.g., e-mail, voice mail, instant messaging); 
2. 
E-mail Server Stores (e.g., Lotus Domino .NSF and Microsoft Exchange .EDB) 
3. 
Word-processed documents (e.g., Word and WordPerfect files and drafts); 
4. 
Spreadsheets and tables (e.g., Excel or Lotus 123 worksheets); 
5. 
Accounting Application Data (e.g., QuickBooks, Money, Peachtree data); 
6. 
Image and Facsimile Files (e.g., .PDF, .TIFF, .JPG, .GIF images); 
7. 
Sound Recordings (e.g., .W AV and .MP3 files); 
8. 
Video and Animation (e.g., .AV! and .MOV files); 
9. 
Databases (e.g., Access, Oracle, SQL Server data, SAP); 
10. 
Contact and Relationship Management Data (e.g., Outlook, ACTI); 
11. 
Calendar and Diary Application Data (e.g., Outlook PST, blog entries); 
12. 
Online Access Data (e.g., Temporary Internet Files, History, Cookies); 
13. 
Presentations (e.g., PowerPoint, Corel Presentations); 
14. 
Network Access and Server Activity Logs; 
15. 
Project Management Application Data; 
16. 
Computer Aided Design/Drawing Files; and 
17. 
Backup and archival files (e.g., Veritas, Zip, .GHO). 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 8 of 15
10. 
Plaintiffs also respectfully request this Court to order Defendant to preserve all 
potentially relevant evidence, even if Defendant does not intend to produce such evidence 
because he anticipates raising his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
11. 
As more fully set forth in Plaintiff Jane Doe No. 102's Complaint (DE# 1 in Case 
No.: 09-CV-80656-MARRA/JOHNSON), Defendant is a designated sexual offender who 
sexually exploited minor girls all over the world, including in some or all of his six mansions. 
Thus, there is reason to believe that relevant evidence, including many photographs of other nude 
underage females, exists in some or all of Defendant's six mansions, with all but one of his 
mansions located outside the State of Florida. 
12. 
On May 15, 2009, Plaintiffs counsel sent a letter to Defendant's counsel detailing 
the numerous sources of relevant evidence in this matter (the "Preservation Letter," attached 
hereto as Exhibit B). Despite requests for a written response confirming Defendant's duty to 
take the necessary steps to preserve all relevant evidence, Defendant and his counsel have neither 
acknowledged this letter nor confirmed their duty to preserve all relevant evidence under the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
13. 
In the past, Defendant's counsel have asserted that a motion requesting to 
preserve evidence would be moot because of an order previously entered in Jane Doe v. Jeffrey 
Epstein, et al., Case No. 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON. Plaintiffs respectfully submit that 
an enforceable order is needed in their particular cases and that the binding order needs to cover 
evidence other than evidence related to the October 25, 2005 search of Defendant's Palm Beach 
mansion. The sole focus of the previous order is seized evidence identified in the PBPD 
Property Receipt. 
There is great need to preserve all evidence (physical and electronic), 
especially with respect to potential evidence related to Defendant's possession, production, 
and/or transportation of child pornography. In addition, there is reason to believe that relevant 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 9 of 15
evidence, including many photographs of other nude mmor girls, exist in some or all of 
Defendant's six mansions and/or on some or all of his computers. Given Defendant's efforts to 
gain control over evidence in the custody of the PBPD, as well as Defendant's unwillingness to 
acknowledge or respond to Plaintiffs Preservation Letter, a legitimate concern remains for the 
continuing existence and maintenance of the integrity of the evidence in question absent an order 
preserving the evidence. This evidence, some of which is in the sole custody, dominion, and 
control of Defendant, is critical and indispensable to Plaintiffs' cases. 
Memorandum of Law 
When there is a good faith belief that evidence may be lost, the Court has the authority to 
enter an order preserving such evidence. See AT & T Mobility LLC v. Dynamic Cellular Corp., 
No. 08-20537-Civ., 2008 WL 2139518, at *2 (S.D. Fla. May 7, 2008); see also Trac/one 
Wireless. Inc. v. King Trading, Inc., No. 3-08-CV-0398-B, 2008 WL 918243, at *1 (N.D. Tex. 
Mar. 13, 2008) (finding "a legitimate concern for the continuing existence and maintenance of 
the integrity of the evidence in question absent an order preserving the evidence"). This 
evidence, some of which is in the sole custody, dominion, and control of Defendant, is critical 
and indispensable to Plaintiffs' cases. The evidence that Plaintiffs seek to protect is relevant and 
critical to the prosecution not only of their actions, but for the prosecution of at least ten other 
filed actions against Defendant and twenty-two other as-yet-unfiled actions by Defendant's 
victims listed on the USAO List. Plaintiffs' concerns outweigh any harm to Defendant that may 
result from a preservation order. Given Defendant's vast wealth and demonstrated willingness to 
incur expenses, Defendant will not be unduly burdened by such an order. See Trac/one Wireless, 
Inc., 2008 WL 918243, at *I. 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is a designated sexual offender who was convicted of 
violating various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 10 of 15
procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution, and is currently serving his sentence 
based on the charges that form the foundation of Plaintiffs' claims. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
assume that both the evidence seized by the PBPD and other relevant evidence in Defendant's 
custody and control is extremely harmful to Defendant's position in his civil cases. Defendant's 
successful efforts to obtain the return of some of the seized property causes Plaintiffs grave 
concern regarding his willingness to comply with his duty to preserve all evidence relevant to 
Plaintiffs' actions. Without a protective order, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, may seek to destroy 
records and information to thwart this lawsuit and many other lawsuits and thus perpetuate the 
wrongs that the federal laws regarding the sexual exploitation of children intend to protect. 
Because of the nature of the relevant violations, which include allegations of production 
and transportation of child pornography, electronically-stored information is a valuable and 
irreplaceable source of discovery and/or evidence in these matters. Plaintiffs anticipate that 
much of the information subject to disclosure or responsive to discovery in this cause is stored on 
Defendant's former computer systems and other media and devices. In addition, as previously 
stated, Plaintiffs believe that crucial relevant evidence may be present in some or all of the 
computers in perhaps each of his six mansions (in Palm Beach, New York City, Santa Fe, 
London, Paris, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). 
Finally, in the other pending Jane Doe cases with active discovery, Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, has objected to the production of any evidence on Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth 
Amendment grounds. Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 challenge Defendant's 
objections to discovery and, more relevant to the matter at hand, request that this Court issue an 
order clearly stating that Defendant has a duty to preserve all relevant evidence, regardless of 
whether he intends to raise his privilege against self-incrimination. See Capricorn Power Co. v. 
Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp., 220 F.R.D. 429, 434 (W.D. Pa. 2004) (A motion for a 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 16   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2009   Page 11 of 15
preservation order can be granted with regard to all items of evidence that are discoverable in 
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, without the necessity of establishing that 
the evidence will necessarily be relevant and admissible at trial.) 
WHEREFORE, in light of the above-stated duty to preserve all relevant evidence, 
Plaintiffs, Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102, move this Court to enter an Order granting 
Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102's Motion for the Preservation of Evidence. 
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULE 7.1.A.3 
Undersigned counsel conferred with counsel for Defendant in a good faith effort to 
resolve the issues raised in this motion. Despite requests for a written response acknowledging 
Defendant's duty to take the necessary steps to preserve all relevant evidence to alleviate the 
need for this motion, Defendant's counsel have failed to respond or acknowledge in any way 
Defendant's duty to preserve all relevant evidence under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO COURT’S ORDER
REQUESTING POSITION ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STAY [DE 99]
Comes now the United States, by and through the undersigned Assistant United States
Attorney, and files this response to the Court’s Order requesting the position of the United
States on Defendant Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion to Stay Proceedings [DE 99].  For the reasons
set forth below, it is the United States’ position that a stay of the proceedings is not necessary
and was not contemplated by the Non-Prosecution Agreement between the United States and
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein.  
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 3 of 17

ISSUE PRESENTED
The United States is not a party to these lawsuits and, accordingly, is not fully aware
of the scope of the proceedings, the range of arguments presented by counsel, and any
correspondence or oral communications between the parties in these civil suits.  Based on
the information presented by the Court and a review of Defendant Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion
to Stay and/or Continue Action for Time Certain Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal
Proceedings with Incorporated Memorandum of Law (Court File No. 08-CV-80811-
MARRA/JOHNSON DE 51-1), and responses thereto filed by various plaintiffs in their suits,
the undersigned understands that the Court has requested the position of the United States
on the following issue: 
Are there “special circumstances” that require the imposition of a stay of the
civil proceedings in the “interests of justice” until the “expiration” of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement [“NPA”] between the United States and Epstein?
By filing this response, the United States does not make itself a party to this litigation
and takes no position with respect to the outcome of any of the civil suits; nor does the
United States take any position regarding Defendant Epstein’s performance of his obligations
pursuant to the NPA.  The United States also declines to comment on Defendant Epstein’s
representations regarding past allegations of violations of the NPA by Epstein.  The United
States files this response solely as amicus curiae at the Court’s request and does not waive
any procedural or statutory bars to suit.

I. 
STANDARD FOR IMPOSING A DISCRETIONARY STAY
A. 
The Defendant Must Show that the Assertion of His Fifth
Amendment Privilege Against Self-Incrimination Would
Automatically Result in the Entry of Summary Judgment Against
Him.
“The decision whether or not to stay civil litigation in deference to parallel criminal
proceedings is discretionary. . . . A movant must carry a heavy burden to succeed in such an
endeavor.”  Microfinancial, Inc. v. Premier Holidays Internat’l, Inc., 385 F.3d 72, 77 (1st
Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).  When a defendant facing possible criminal liability invokes
his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination in connection with civil
litigation, a court can stay discovery or the entire civil case.  Diaz v. Jenne, 2007 WL 624286
*1 (S.D. Fl. Feb. 23, 2007) (Cooke, J.).  “However, ‘the Constitution does not require a stay
of civil proceedings pending the outcome of related criminal proceedings.  Forcing an
individual to risk non-criminal disadvantage by remaining silent for fear of self incrimination
in a parallel criminal proceeding does not rise to the level of an unconstitutional
infringement.’”  Id. (quoting Shell Oil Co. v. Altina Assocs., Inc., 866 F. Supp. 536, 540
(M.D. Fl. 1994)).  
As this Court has previously explained:
The law regarding stays of civil actions is well-settled in the Eleventh Circuit.
In United States v. Lot 5, Fox Grove, Alachua County, Fla, 23 F.3d 359, 363-
(11th Cir. 1994) (“Lot 5"), the Court articulated the following principles of
law with respect to a stay of a civil action pending resolution of a related
criminal action:
[A] blanket assertion of the privilege is an inadequate basis for
the issuance of a stay.  Rather, a court must stay a civil
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 5 of 17

1It appears from a brief review of some of Epstein’s discovery responses that Epstein has
made a blanket assertion of the privilege.  For example, Epstein has asserted his Fifth Amendment
privilege in response to a plaintiff’s request to produce the NPA and the United States’ list of
identified victims although these documents were provided to Epstein by the United States.
-6-
proceeding pending resolution of a related criminal prosecution
only when “special circumstances” so require in the “interests
of justice.”  The court may deny a stay so long as the privilege’s
invocation does not compel an adverse judgment against the
claimant.
. . .
[T]he standard set by the Eleventh Circuit as to when a stay should be granted
to prevent unconstitutional infringement is more narrow.  The law in the
Eleventh Circuit requires consideration of whether, as a result of invoking the
privilege, the defendant faces certain loss of the civil proceeding on summary
judgment if the civil proceeding were to continue.  Lot 5, 23 F.3d at 364;
Pervis v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 901 F.2d 944 (11th Cir. 1990).
Under this standard, Movants must show that invocation of the privilege in the
instant matter will result in certain loss by automatic summary judgment.
United States v. Two Parcels of Real Property, 92 F.3d 1123, 1129 (11th Cir.
1996); Pervis, 901 F.2d at 946-47.  This must be an actual adverse judgment,
and not “merely the loss of the defendant’s most ‘effective defense.’”
Securities & Exchange Comm. v. Incendy, 936 F. Supp. at 955 (S.D. Fl. 1996);
Shell Oil Co., 866 F. Supp. at 540-41.
Court-Appointed Receiver of Lancer Mgt. Group LLC v. Lauer, 2009 WL 800144 (S.D. Fl.
Mar. 25, 2009) (Marra, J.).  
Thus, before reaching the relative benefit and prejudice to each of the parties caused
by staying the cases, the Court must determine whether, if defendant Epstein were to invoke
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination1 and the Court were to allow an adverse
inference to be drawn therefrom, an adverse judgment against Epstein would be
automatically compelled.  The United States respectfully submits that it would not.

From a review of the Complaints filed by the plaintiffs in these cases, it appears that
some have filed claims based upon Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, some have
filed claims based upon common law torts, and some have filed a combination of the two.
Under general principles of tort law, a plaintiff is required to prove:  (1) that the defendant
committed a bad act; (2) that the plaintiff suffered damages; and (3) that the damages were
caused by the defendant’s bad act.  To succeed on a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a plaintiff
must show:  (1) that the plaintiff is a person who, while a minor, was a victim of an
enumerated offense committed by the defendant; (2) that the person suffered personal injury
as a result of that violation; and (3) the amount of damages she sustained.  
Epstein’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege could result in the drawing of
a negative inference only as to the first element under both of these claims.  Therefore, to
succeed on summary judgment (or at trial), the plaintiffs would still have to prove that they
suffered personal injury/damages as a result of the defendant’s bad act.  Cf. In re Financial
Federated Title & Trust, Inc., 252 B.R. 834, 838 (S.D. Fl. Bank. Ct. 2000) (Stay not
warranted in bankruptcy proceeding where criminal indictment was pending because
negative inference related only to defendant’s receipt of allegedly fraudulent transfers, but
“Trustee must still carry the burden of proving all of the elements of his complaint for
fraudulent transfers . . . includ[ing] fraudulent intent, insolvency, and financial condition at
the time of the transfers to the Defendants.”).
While Epstein may believe that his arguments and proof as to the first element are his
“most effective defense,” that alone is insufficient to warrant the imposition of a stay of the

suits.  To the extent that any are not “identified victims” under the NPA, this contractual provision
would not apply.

litigation.  There are two other items for the Court to consider in deciding this issue.  First,
pursuant to the terms of the NPA, as to those victims identified by the United States, Epstein
has already made a concession that they are victims of an enumerated offense committed by
Epstein.  Thus, this inference is drawn not due to his invocation of the right against self-
incrimination but due to his entry into a contractual agreement with the United States for
which the identified victims are third-party beneficiaries.2  Second, in Lot 5, the Eleventh
Circuit pointed out the wealth of evidence other than the defendant’s testimony that could
be used to defeat a liability claim.  See Lot 5, 23 F.3d at 364 (“Thus, Claimant’s assertion that
only her own testimony could vindicate her is groundless; other participants to the illegal acts
that gave rise to the forfeiture were available to testify at trial.  Claimant’s failure to indicate
with precision why she did not use other parties’ testimony to substantiate her defense was
fatal.”).  For example, Epstein could mount a defense using effective cross-examination,
telephone records, travel records, documents within the possession of the plaintiffs or third
parties, and/or the testimony of third parties to rebut the plaintiffs’ proof.

B. 
Additional Factors to Consider in Balancing the Prejudice to the
Parties
If the Court is persuaded that the negative inference drawn from Epstein’s assertion
of his Fifth Amendment privilege would result in an automatic grant of summary judgment
in favor of the plaintiffs, then the Court must engage in a balancing of equities in determining
whether there are “special circumstances” warranting the imposition of a stay “‘to prevent
a party from suffering substantial and irreparable prejudice.’”  Securites and Exchange
Comm’n v. Incendy, 936 F. Supp. 952, 956 (S.D. Fl. 1996) (quoting S.E.C. v. First Financial
Group of Texas, Inc., 659 F.2d 660, 668 (5th Cir. 1981) (add’l citations omitted).  
Examples of “special circumstances” provided by the Supreme Court in
[United States v. Kordel] are: (1) if the Government brought the civil action
solely to obtain evidence for its criminal prosecution, (2) if the Government
failed to advise the defendant in the civil proceeding that it contemplates his
criminal prosecution; (3) if the defendant is without counsel or reasonably
fears prejudice from adverse pretrial publicity or other unfair injury; or (4) any
other special circumstances indicating unconstitutionality or even impropriety.
Incendy at 956 (citing United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, 11 (1970)).  See also Securities
and Exchange Comm’n v. Wright, 261 Fed. Appx. 259, 263 (11th Cir. 2008) (“[N]o ‘special
circumstances’ existed in this case warranting a stay, as there is no record evidence
suggesting the Government had brought the civil case solely to obtain evidence for the
criminal prosecution or that the criminal case against [defendant] was unconstitutional or
inappropriately instituted.”).  
No “special circumstances” exist here.  First, unlike Wright and Incendy, the United
States Government is not a party to the civil litigation.  Each suit is brought on behalf of an
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 9 of 17

-10-
individual plaintiff represented by private counsel.  Some of those plaintiffs are adverse to
the United States and have filed suit against the Government based upon its handling of the
criminal case against Epstein.  (See In re Jane Doe Litigation, Court File No. 08-80736-Civ-
Marra.)  There has been no allegation, and certainly no showing, that the civil litigation is
a ruse to obtain discovery on behalf of the criminal investigation.  
As some of the plaintiffs have mentioned, one purpose of the NPA was to place the
identified victims in the same position where they would have been if Epstein had been
convicted after trial of an offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  (See, e.g., Court File No.
08-CV-80119 DE 49-2.)  If Epstein had proceeded to trial and been convicted, those victims
would have been entitled to restitution and to file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and
would have been entitled to the same sorts of discovery that they now seek.  None of the
plaintiffs has contacted the United States about passing on materials gathered through
discovery to any criminal investigators or about seeking discovery that would be relevant
only to the criminal proceedings, rather than to their individual cases.  If Epstein has
legitimate concerns that the civil discovery process is being abused in some way, he can ask
the Court for a protective order limiting the scope of discovery or its distribution.
Furthermore, if at some time in the future, Epstein were the subject of a criminal indictment
and he alleged that the evidence to be used against him was gathered improperly, he could
file a motion to suppress or to dismiss the indictment in that criminal action.  See, e.g., United
States, ex. rel. Westrick v. Second Chance, 2007 WL 1020808 *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2007)
(Defendant in civil False Claims Act suit moved to stay civil action pending criminal
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 10 of 17

3With respect to the other “special circumstances” mentioned in Incendy, the government
obviously advised Epstein of the potential for criminal charges, and that knowledge led to the
negotiation of the NPA.  Epstein also has a number of attorneys listed on the Service List for the
civil cases and has retained a similarly large number of attorneys to handle the criminal investigation
and negotiation of the NPA.  Epstein alleges a fear of adverse publicity, but as the plaintiffs have
pointed out, during the course of the state and federal criminal investigations, Epstein’s personal
publicist distributed stories to the press impugning the credibility of the victims and other witnesses
and averring that the victims’ allegations of abuse were made solely to extract money from the
defendant.  In the context of some of the civil suits currently pending, Epstein has asked the Court
-11-
investigation where no indictment had been returned.  The district court denied the motion,
noting that while “allowing civil discovery to proceed may afford the government [who was
the real party in interest in the civil case] the opportunity to gain evidence that it may not be
entitled to under the more restrictive criminal discovery rules, if and when discovery
becomes necessary, protective orders and other remedial measures may be taken.”) (citations
omitted).
By entering into the NPA, with its explicit discussion of 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein
acknowledged that the United States was trying to protect the victims’ rights to restitution
and that civil claims would likely follow.  Epstein did not bargain for a stay of those
proceedings.  Instead, both parties received benefits and gave consideration for the bargain
that was struck – while Epstein is faced with answering discovery requests that he would not
face during criminal proceedings, he also is entitled to the identification of and extensive
discovery from the victims, which he would not have received in the criminal case.  Based
upon a review of the discovery requests he has promulgated thus far, it appears that Epstein
is taking full advantage of this benefit and if a criminal case were ever filed, he would, no
doubt, seek to use that information in his defense.3
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 11 of 17

to unseal the victims’ names so that he may make use similar press efforts to impugn their
credibility.
-12-
Unlike Wright and Incendy, Epstein also has not been criminally indicted.  In some
districts, this alone is virtually dispositive.  See, e.g., Sterling Nat’l Bank v. A-1 Hotels
Internat’l, 175 F. Supp. 2d 573, 576-77 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“district courts in this Circuit
‘generally grant the extraordinary remedy of a stay only after the defendant seeking a stay
has been indicted.’” (quoting Citibank, N.A. v. Hakim, 1993 WL 481335 *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.
18, 1993) (add’l citations omitted).  As one court explained:
the consensus that a party seeking a stay bears a heavier burden when he has
not yet been indicted derives logically from the balancing test set out by the
courts of appeals that have considered the question.  When a defendant has
been indicted, his situation is particularly dangerous, and takes a certain
priority, for the risk to his liberty, the importance of safeguarding his
constitutional rights, and even the strain on his resources and attention that
makes defending satellite civil litigation particularly difficult, all weigh in
favor of his interest.  Moreover, if the potential prejudice to the defendant is
particularly high post-indictment, the prejudice to the plaintiff of staying
proceedings is somewhat reduced, since the criminal litigation has reached a
crisis that will lead to a reasonably speedy resolution.  Furthermore, at that
stage in the criminal proceeding, the contours of the indictment will provide
the Court with a reasonable basis for determining the extent of the threat to the
defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights, and the likely extent and timing of the
criminal litigation.
Pre-indictment, these factors must be balanced significantly differently.
Though many of the same risks to the civil defendant are present, the dangers
are at least somewhat more remote, and it is inherently unclear to the Court
just how much the unindicted defendant really has to fear.  Conversely, the
delay imposed on the plaintiff is potentially indefinite.  There is no telling how
complicated the government’s investigation may be, whether the allegations
of the particular civil plaintiff are merely the tip of an iceberg that will result
in a lengthy and open-ended investigation, what priority the government
assigns to the investigation, whether it will result in charges that will have to
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 12 of 17

4Epstein points to provisions requiring him to maintain certain evidence “inviolate” as proof
that the grand jury investigation is still active.  These provisions are meant only to insure that easily
destroyed evidence identified through the investigation, such as computer equipment, that is still in
Epstein’s control, will still be available to investigators if Epstein does, in fact, breach the NPA.
Epstein is well aware that litigation concerning those matters have been removed from the Court’s
docket, at the insistence of the United States, because it fully halted its investigation in accordance
with the terms of the NPA.
-13-
be litigated, or how time-consuming the resulting criminal case will be.  Under
these circumstances, the likelihood that a civil party can make the necessary
showing to obtain the “extraordinary” remedy of a stay is inevitably much
reduced.  
Sterling Nat’l Bank, 175 F. Supp. 2d at 577 (internal citations omitted).
The First Circuit has noted that the decision whether to grant a stay “is highly nuanced
. . . [and] involves competing interests.  Balancing these interests is a situation-specific task,
and an inquiring court must take a careful look at the idiosyncratic circumstances of the case
before it.”  Microfinancial, supra, 385 F.3d at 78.  Epstein’s case is more idiosyncratic than
most.
As the Court aptly noted in its Order denying Epstein’s first motion to stay the civil
proceedings, Epstein has not been indicted and there are no criminal proceedings pending
against him.4  The resurrection of criminal proceedings against Epstein lies entirely within
Epstein’s own hands, by performing or not performing under the terms of the NPA.  This tips
the balance of equities even further in favor of the plaintiffs.  Epstein makes allegations that
the U.S. Attorney’s Office has unfettered discretion in determining breaches of the NPA, but
this is no different than in any contractual setting.  If one party believes that there has been
a breach, it may seek the remedy set forth in the contract.  If the other party believes that
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 13 of 17

5The United States also notes that this finite termination to Epstein’s exposure to potential
criminal consequences is illusory.  The NPA addresses only certain victims identified during the
course of the government’s investigation.  To the extent that any of the plaintiffs who have already
filed suit against Epstein do not fall within that group, the NPA does not address potential charges
based upon crimes committed against them.  The NPA also does not bind any other state or federal
prosecutor from pursuing charges for criminal acts committed within their jurisdiction(s).  The
federal statute of limitations for offenses against children is ten years or the life of the child,
-14-
there has been no breach, it has a remedy at law or equity.  In this situation, Epstein would
be entitled to seek dismissal of the indictment.  See United States v. Beeks, 167 Fed. Appx
777 (11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Diaz, 138 Fed. Appx. 965 (9th Cir. 2005); United
States v. Davis, 393 F.3d 540 (5th Cir. 2004).
Epstein argues that because he is seeking a finite period of delay – until the time that
he asserts that the NPA “expires” – and that, thereafter, he will promptly provide full and
complete responses to all discovery, the harm to the plaintiffs is de minimis.  With all respect,
this overlooks a number of obvious issues.  First, if a stay is imposed until Epstein’s
proposed “expiration date,” it affords Epstein one of two incentives: (a) to delay any intended
breach until a time when he believes that the United States has no remedy and then to breach
the agreement with impunity (i.e, to use the NPA as a shield and a sword); or (b) to delay the
civil litigation as long as possible (until shortly before the “expiration” of the NPA), and
then, after criminal charges have been filed, to seek a mandatory stay of the civil cases until
the criminal case is resolved.  Thus, contrary to the assertions of Epstein, the delay is not
limited but, instead, is “potentially indefinite,” as Sterling Bank warns.  If the U.S. Attorney’s
Office were to proceed criminally, the litigation would likely be very lengthy, and would
result in an even greater delay to the plaintiffs.5
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 14 of 17

whichever is longer.  18 U.S.C. § 3283.  Thus, for Epstein (or any other person accused of sexually
abusing children) to “wait out” any chance of criminal liability, the court would have to stay civil
litigation until all of the plaintiffs have died.
-15-
The factors to consider include: “(i) the interests of the civil plaintiff in proceeding
expeditiously with the civil litigation, including the avoidance of any prejudice to the
plaintiff should a delay transpire; (ii) the hardship to the defendant, including the burden
placed upon him should the cases go forward in tandem; (iii) the convenience of both the
civil and criminal courts; (iv) the interests of third parties; . . . (v) the public interest[;] . . .
(vi) the good faith of the litigants (or the absence of it) and (vii) the status of the cases.”
Microfinancial, 385 F.3d at 78 (citations omitted).
In considering those factors, the United States respectfully recommends to the Court
that all of the factors weigh against a stay.  In making its decision, the Court should consider
that, unlike all of the cases cited herein, Epstein seeks to stay not one suit involving a single
plaintiff, but more than a dozen suits filed by individual plaintiffs.  Each of those plaintiffs,
in turn, impliedly asserts that she is a “crime victim” with the “right to full and timely
restitution” and the “right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.”  18 U.S.C. §
3771(a)(6) & (7).  As noted above, one of the purposes of the NPA was to provide these
rights to victims identified in the Government’s investigation.  Thus, this factor weighs more
heavily for the plaintiffs than in the average civil dispute as it embodies both the plaintiffs’
and the public’s interests.  The victims who were identified in the government investigation,
by and large, were without financial assets and had significant counseling needs that could
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 15 of 17

-16-
be remedied through obtaining restitution from Epstein.  In addition to those needs, they have
legitimate concerns about memories fading, witnesses becoming unavailable, and dissipation
of Epstein’s assets while the matter is stayed.  On the other hand, while the potential harm
to the defendant normally weighs in the defendant’s favor, in this case, Epstein has
significant control over whether the criminal investigation remains in abeyance and whether
criminal charges are ever filed.
CONCLUSION
In accordance with the Court’s Order, the United States hereby submits that it is not
aware of any “special circumstances” that warrant staying all of the civil cases pending the
“expiration” of the NPA.

SUPPORT OF MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY AND RESPONSE IN 
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL AND/OR IDENTIFY JANE DOE NO. 
101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102 IN THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENAS FOR PURPOSES 
OF DISCOVERY1 
Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 (together, “Plaintiffs”), by and 
through their undersigned attorneys, hereby file their Reply in Support of Motion to 
Proceed Anonymously and Response in Opposition to Motion to Compel and/or Identify 
Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 in Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of 
Discovery, and, as grounds, state as follows: 
1. 
Exposure of Plaintiffs to the public disclosure of their identity and the 
resultant shame and humiliation accompanying their sexual exploitation is wholly 
unnecessary and premature, and may cause further damage.  Plaintiffs respectfully assert 
that this Court should first decide the threshold issues of retroactivity and calculation of 
damages.  Plaintiffs, and all other victims of Defendant who have filed an action against 
Defendant in federal court, will have to litigate these two following threshold issues 
being reviewed by the Court in the C.M.A. action against Defendant (Case No. 08-CV-
80811-MARRA/ JOHNSON):  1) whether the most recent version of the statute, which 
provides for a minimum recovery of $150,000 (instead of the previous minimum of 
Plaintiffs respectfully file this Reply in the consolidated action, as the issue at hand pertains to discovery 
issues.   
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 4 of 17

$50,000) applies to cases arising from incidents predating the 2006 amendment to the 
statute; and 2) whether the applicable minimum amount is recoverable per incident and/or 
per count, or per victim.  Defendant has attempted to force settlements on any victims as 
possible without considering the possibility that the minimum amount recoverable under 
U.S.C. § 2255 is $150,000 per count and/or per incident.  Much of this Court’s 
caseload will be alleviated once the Court resolves these issues related to the minimum 
recovery; at that point, many of Defendant’s victims will likely agree to settle for the 
minimum statutory damages to which they are entitled, thus obviating Defendant’s 
specified need to destroy his victims’ anonymity and expose them to further harm and 
humiliation.   
2. 
This Court has discretion to deny Defendant’s Motion to Compel and/or 
Identify Plaintiffs in Third Party Subpoenas for Purposes of Discovery.  See Doe v. 
Stegall, 653 F.2d 180, 184 (5th Cir. Aug. 10, 1981)2 (“Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) vests in the 
trial court discretion over litigants’ requests for protection from ‘annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense’ in the discovery process.”) 
(internal quotation omitted).  As more fully discussed in Plaintiffs’ Response to 
Defendant’s Motion to Stay, which is adopted and incorporated herein, Defendant waived 
his right to contest liability in actions filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  Thus, third 
party discovery is relevant only if Plaintiffs seek recovery of damages in excess of the 
statutory minimum.  Additionally, if and when the parties are ready to proceed with 
discovery from non-party sources, the Court can put numerous measures in place to 
maximize Plaintiffs’ anonymity.  At the outset, Defendant can obtain records from 
In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this circuit adopted as 
binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981. 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 5 of 17

various non-party sources through Plaintiffs’ counsel, who can demonstrate and certify 
that they have obtained the very records being sought, or through an independent special 
master, who could be given releases by Plaintiffs to obtain such records on behalf of 
Defendant to eliminate any question of authenticity or completeness.  If Defendant 
nevertheless insists on conducting his own third-party discovery (needlessly increasing 
the cost of litigating these actions and causing unnecessary delay), subpoenas seeking 
documents from sources such as health care providers or employers should not disclose 
the type of action or identify Defendant.  Because of the highly-publicized nature of 
Defendant’s crimes as well as his designation as a sexual offender, the mere mention of 
Defendant’s name in any subpoena or deposition notice will automatically expose the 
subject Plaintiff as one of Defendant’s victims and may result in unnecessary public 
humiliation.  Similarly, records custodian depositions do not require the disclosure of the 
nature of the action and/or the identity of the defendant in the action.3   
3. 
Defendant’s only purpose in opposing Plaintiffs’ motions is harassment.  
Defendant’s intentions are clear.  He seeks to destroy these young women by outing them 
as being among his many victims, a pattern of behavior consistent with his status as a 
designated sex offender.  Defendant openly admits to his desire to reveal the victims’ 
names in newspapers so that individuals in their community can come forward to assault 
their credibility and tarnish their reputations (and, as a result, their dignity).  See 
Defendant’s Response in Opposition to Motion to Proceed Anonymously (DE# 5) at ¶ 6 
(“[O]nce the Plaintiff is identified, other individuals come forward in the discovery phase 
with information which often directly contradicts allegations as to the events and 
Depending upon claims of Plaintiffs, certain documents will be relevant.  At this point, however, 
Plaintiffs do not waive their privilege to prevent the release of each of their names under the doctor-patient 
relationship.

damages.  For instance, witnesses may testify that Plaintiff was paid by others for similar 
sexual acts she claims Mr. Epstein forced upon her or that she willingly participated in 
certain acts(s) that would negate or lessen her damages”).  Each of Defendant’s victims 
whom undersigned counsel represents continues to experience trauma and humiliation 
associated with sexual abuse.  See Ellen Bass & Laura Davis, The Courage to Heal: A 
Guide for Women Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse 3 (4th ed. 2008) (“The long-term 
effects of child sexual abuse can be so pervasive that it’s sometimes hard to pinpoint 
exactly how the abuse affected you.  It can permeate everything:  your sense of self, 
intimate relationships, sexuality, parenting, working, even your sanity.”)4  The U.S. 
Supreme Court in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 597 (1977), discussed the grave 
nature of the crimes at issue in the cases against Defendant, stating: 
[Rape] is highly reprehensible, both in a moral sense and in its almost total 
contempt for the personal integrity and autonomy of the female victim ... Short of 
homicide, it is the “ultimate violation of self.”  
Defendant committed crimes constituting the “ultimate violation of self” against minors.  
Because of the disdainful nature of these types of crimes, courts, including the Eleventh 
Circuit, “have carved out a limited number of exceptions to the general requirement of 
disclosure, which permit plaintiffs to proceed anonymously.”  Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. 
for Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 685 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted).  “The 
Although some Plaintiffs no longer live in the Palm Beach area, this should not undermine Plaintiffs’ 
need for anonymity.  As the Court in Doe No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 197 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (internal 
citation omitted), points out, “[I]t is now possible to ‘determine whether a given individual is a party to a 
lawsuit in federal court anywhere in the country by the simplest of computer searches, to access the docket 
sheet of any such case electronically, and … that entire case files will be accessible over the Internet.”  
Given the ease with which the public could access court files in these cases, it is reasonable that Plaintiffs’ 
fears extend beyond ostracism in the Palm Beach community.  The Palm Beach Post is available online all 
over the world.  In addition, many of Plaintiffs’ family members remain in the Palm Beach area and remain 
unaware of their daughter/granddaughter/niece’s involvement in Defendant’s sordid child sex exploitation 
enterprise.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs are exposed to harassment through social networking sites such as 
Facebook and MySpace as well as other forms of online harrassment. 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 7 of 17

ultimate test for permitting a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is whether the plaintiff has 
a substantial privacy right which outweighs the customary and constitutionally-embedded 
presumption of openness in judicial proceedings.”  Id. (internal quotation and citation 
omitted).   
4. 
Cases regarding sexual assault are the paradigmatic examples of the type 
of highly sensitive and personal matter that warrant a grant of anonymity.  See Doe No. 2 
v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 195-98 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (adult plaintiff, who, many years later, 
alleged that he was sexually abused by rabbi at private Jewish school when he was a 
child, was entitled to proceed anonymously because he feared retaliation and ostracism 
from his community); Doe v. Evans, 202 F.R.D. 173, 176 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (sexual assault 
victim granted use of pseudonym); Doe v. Smith, 105 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) 
(victim of assault, molestation, and sexual abuse granted anonymity because victim 
otherwise psychologically and emotionally unable to proceed with action); Roe v. Borup, 
500 F. Supp. 127, 130 (E.D. Wis. 1980) (“It is beyond argument that [a suit involving 
charges of sexual abuse of a child] is a highly sensitive issue”; thus, plaintiffs were 
entitled to use fictitious names in prosecuting the suit); see also Doe v. Blue Cross & 
Blue Shield United of Wis., 112 F.3d 869, 872 (7th Cir. 1997) (“[F]ictitious names are 
allowed when necessary to protect the privacy of children, rape victims, and other 
particularly vulnerable parties or witnesses.”).  The intensely personal nature of sexual 
exploitation creates an unusual case, and, in such a case, the general policy of full 
disclosure should give way to a policy of protecting privacy in a very private matter.  
This protection is especially necessary when the Court is dealing with young women who 
recently were sexually abused as minors.   
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 8 of 17

5. 
Defendant is using the threat of publicity to attempt to intimidate victims 
to cause them not to file suit or to settle their claims for the absolute minimum in order 
for them to avoid being held up to public ridicule and hostility.  His intention to attack the 
victims is at the heart of the protection afforded by numerous rape shield statutes, of 
which Defendant and his counsel are surely aware.  In 1994, Congress amended the 
Federal Rules of Evidence to promote the strong social policy of protecting a victim’s 
privacy and encouraging victims of crime to come forward.  “The reason for extending 
Rule 412 to civil cases is equally obvious.  The need to protect alleged victims against 
invasions of privacy, potential embarrassment, and unwarranted sexual stereotyping, and 
the wish to encourage victims to come forward when they have been sexually molested 
do not disappear because the context has shifted from a criminal prosecution to a claim 
for damages or injunctive relief.”  Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory committee’s note.  Rule 
412 now provides that, in civil trials in federal court involving alleged sexual misconduct, 
evidence that the victim engaged in other sexual behavior or evidence offered to prove 
any alleged victim's sexual predisposition can be admitted only in unusual circumstances, 
none of which apply to Plaintiffs’ cases.  Fed. R. Evid. 412 (a), (b).  “The rule aims to 
safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and 
sexual stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details and 
the infusion of sexual innuendo into the factfinding process.  By affording victims 
protection in most instances, the rule also encourages victims of sexual misconduct to 
institute and to participate in legal proceedings against alleged offenders.”  Fed. R. Evid. 
412 advisory committee’s note; see also Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145, 149-50 (1991) 
(Rape shield statutes represent the valid legislative determination that victims of rape and 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 9 of 17

attempted rape “deserve heightened protection against surprise, harassment, and 
unnecessary invasions of privacy.”); United States v. Elbert, 561 F.3d 771, 776-77 (8th 
Cir. 2009) (evidence that child plaintiffs had previously engaged in prostitution was 
rightfully excluded in federal sex trafficking suit); Stephens v. Miller, 13 F.3d 998, 1010 
(7th Cir. 1994) (Cummings, C.J., dissenting) (“The Indiana rape shield statute furthers 
laudable and pragmatic goals.  It protects victims from needless exposure of their sexual 
past conduct; [and] ensures that the focus of rape trials remains the guilt or innocence of 
the accused rather than the sexual history of the complainant.”); United States  v. Kasto, 
584 F.2d 268, 271-72 n.3 (8th Cir. 1978) (“[U]nchastity of a victim has no relevance 
whatsoever to [the victim’s] credibility as a witness.  Such a proposition would 
‘necessarily imply the absurd (corollary) that the extramarital sexual history of a female 
witness would be admissible to impeach her credibility in any case in which she 
testified.’”) (internal citation omitted).  Procedural protections such as the rape shield 
statutes reduce the embarrassment and anguish of trial, encouraging victims to report 
sexual offenses and offendors.  “Without the protection provided by rape shield statutes, 
victims may find trial an ordeal not worth enduring.”  Stephens, 13 F.3d at 1010 
(Cummings, C.J., dissenting) (quoting 124 Cong. Rec. H11944 (1978) (statement of Rep. 
Elizabeth Holtzman)); see Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory committee’s note (“Too often in 
this country victims of rape are humiliated and harassed when they report and prosecute 
the rape. … [R]ape trials become inquisitions into the victim’s morality, not trials of the 
defendant's innocence or guilt ….”).  Indeed, “many [victims] find the trial almost as 
degrading as the rape itself.”  Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory committee’s note.   
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 10 of 17

6. 
In addition, Congress enacted the Child Victims’ and Child Witnesses’ 
Rights Act (18 U.S.C. § 3509) in an effort to provide protection for victims who, while 
minors, were victims of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, or who have 
witnessed a crime committed upon another.  One of the primary protections provided by 
the statute is the restriction on the disclosure of the name of, or other information 
concerning, the victim.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d)(3) (2008).  Further, pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. § 3509(d)(2), “[a]ll papers to be filed in court that disclose the name of or any 
other information concerning a child shall be filed under seal without necessity of 
obtaining a court order.”  
7. 
Indeed, numerous states, including Florida and New York, have enacted 
laws to protect the anonymity of sexual assault victims.  See Fla. Stat. §§ 794.024, 
794.026 (2008); N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b (McKinney 2009).  In 1994, the Florida 
Legislature passed The Crime Victims Protection Act.  The legislative stated purpose for 
passage of the Act was “to protect the identity of victims of sexual crimes.”  Fla. AGO 
2003-56, 2003 WL 22971082 (Dec. 15, 2003) (“[T]he Legislature intended to make the 
identity of a victim of a sexual crime confidential in a court record or proceeding.”)   
Under Florida Section 794.024 of the Florida Statutes, court records that identify the 
name and/or address of a victim of a sexual crime are presumed to be confidential and 
exempt from public access.  Id.  That statute further imposes criminal and civil liability 
for the disclosure or communication of information identifying the victim of a sexual 
crime.  Fla. AGO 2003-56, 2003 WL 22971082 (citing Fla. Stat. §§ 794.024, 794.026 
(2008)).  Similarly, upon approving New York’s rape shield law, then Governor Mario 
Cuomo stated, “[S]exual assault victims have unfortunately had to endure a terrible 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 11 of 17

invasion of their physical privacy.  They have a right to expect that this violation will not 
be compounded by a further invasion of their privacy.”  1991 N.Y. Sess. Laws page nos. 
2211-12, quoted in Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 196 (internal citations omitted).   
8. 
Finally, Defendant should be estopped from outing his victims.  Plaintiffs 
attempted to utilize the process established by the Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) 
with the reasonable expectation that a specific purpose of the NPA was to allow 
Defendant’s victims to maintain anonymity, only to be subjected to deliberate and 
unreasonable delays and Defendant’s failure to engage in meaningful, good faith 
settlement discussions.  This left Plaintiffs no choice but to file suit.  Under these 
circumstances, Defendant should be estopped from seeking to lift anonymity.   
9. 
Many of Defendant’s victims are awaiting this Court’s decision regarding 
whether they will be allowed to proceed anonymously before making the difficult 
decision as to whether to pursue their claims against Defendant.  All of Defendant’s 
victims and any future victims of sexual exploitation must know that they can protect 
what remains of their personal dignity when appealing to the Federal Courts for justice. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully move this Court to grant Plaintiffs’ Motion 
to Proceed Anonymously and to deny Defendant’s Motion to Compel and/or Identify 
Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 in Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of 
Discovery.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NO. 101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102’s  MOTION FOR 
LEAVE TO FILE UNDER SEAL RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO 
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STAY OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TO UNSEAL 
THE NONPROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
Pursuant to Rule 5.4 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida, Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 (together, 
the “Plaintiffs”) by and through their undersigned attorneys, hereby file this Motion For 
Leave to File Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102’s Response in 
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay and/or Continue Action for Time Certain 
Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings With Incorporated Memorandum of 
Law Under Seal, and, as grounds, state as follows: 
1. 
Undersigned counsel seek to file this Response in Opposition to Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion to Stay under seal in order to abide by this Court’s August 21, 
2008 Order to Compel Production and Protective Order entered in Case No. 08-80736-
CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON (the “Protective Order”).  The Protective Order prohibits 
Plaintiffs from disclosing the Non-Prosecution Agreement (the “NPA”) or its terms to 
any third party.   The sealed document should be maintained under seal for the duration 
of this Court’s August 21, 2008 Protective Order.

5/29/2009 
4:41:55 PM 
2. 
Undersigned counsel recognize that this Court has previously unsealed 
documents referring to the NPA.  We seek to comply with the Protective Order for this 
new and independent filing in an abundance of caution, until directed otherwise by the 
Court.   
3. 
If this Court denies Plaintiffs’ instant motion, Plaintiffs seek appropriate 
disclosure of the NPA pursuant to this Court’s recent order in Case No. 08-80736-CIV-
MARRA/JOHNSON (DE #36) denying Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2’s 
motion to unseal the NPA.  As stated in that Order, the NPA has not been filed with the 
Court.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 would then have “a specific 
tangible need to be relieved of the restrictions” of the Protective Order because 
consideration of the terms of the NPA is necessary for this Court to resolve Defendant’s 
Motion to Stay.   
WHEREFORE,  
1. 
Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to enter an Order granting 
Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 the right to file under seal their 
Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay and/or Continue Action for Time 
Certain Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings With Incorporated 
Memorandum of Law.   
2. 
In the alternative, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to unseal the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement in order to allow Plaintiffs to concretely respond to 
Defendant’s Motion to Stay.    
3. 
Finally, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to grant such other and 
further relief to which this Court finds the Plaintiff otherwise entitled.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NO. 101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102's 
REPLY TO DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS 
JANE DOE NO. 101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102'S MOTION FOR A NO-
CONTACT ORDER 
Plaintiffs, JANE DOE No. 101 and JANE DOE No. 102 (together, the 
"Plaintiffs"), by and through undersigned counsel, hereby reply to Defendant Jeffrey 
Epstein's Response to Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102's Motion for a 
No-Contact Order(" Response") as follows: 
1. 
Plaintiffs have not, and will not, engage in any name-calling. For 
purposes of Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102's Motion for a No-
Contact Order ("Motion"), it does not matter whether "many of the alleged victims ... 
were or are admitted prostitutes, dancers at strip clubs ... or have criminal records or 
warrants for their arrests ... ," Def. 's Resp. 4, or whether they were living in a monastery 
or planning on becoming nuns, lawyers, or judges. This matter is quite simple: The 
allegations are that, when these victims were minors, Defendant sexually exploited, 
abused, molested, and/or battered them. Regardless of the victims' character or 
Defendant's character, it is obvious that Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, a 55-year-old 
designated sexual offender and convicted felon, should have no contact with his victims. 
2. 
Defendant makes much ado that one victim allegedly telephoned Jack 
Goldberger's office to complain that Mr. Goldberger was holding up the matter. Def.'s 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 27   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2009   Page 5 of 11
Resp. 5. We have no reason to doubt the truth of that statement by defense counsel. 
Unsurprisingly, a 21-year-old homeless, ill, and desperate victim who had waited for 
settlement funds for seven weeks regretfully may have called Mr. Goldberger's office; 
but whether she did so has nothing to do with Plaintiffs' Motion. Likewise, if Defendant 
attempts to telephone undersigned counsel to complain or have any other contact with 
undersigned counsel, undersigned counsel will handle the matter as professionally as Jack 
Goldberger did~by refusing to speak to the opposing party. 
3. 
The troublesome part of Defendant's position is his counsel's statement in 
the attached correspondence that, pursuant to Rule 4-4.2 of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct, "parties to a matter may communicate directly with each other .... " In this 
case, Plaintiffs' counsel are concerned that Defendant or his agents may assert that 
alleged right, and we vehemently disagree that they should have that prerogative in these 
Plaintiffs' cases. No legal justification exists for Defendant or his agents to have any 
direct communications with victims whom Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, sexually 
exploited, abused, molested, and/or battered. 
In his Response, see Def. 's Resp. 4, and in his letter, counsel for Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, professes that "it is not Mr. Epstein's intention to have any direct contact 
with [our] clients." This statement poses two significant problems. First, it leaves the 
door open for Defendant's investigator(s) or other agent(s) to contact the victims. Such 
contact would not be direct and would not be inconsistent with his professed intention to 
refrain from direct contact with his victims. See, e.g., Cook v. All State Home Mortgage, 
Inc., No. 08-3564, 2009 WL 1391527, at *1 (6th Cir. May 15, 2009) (intimidation of 
plaintiffs-loan officers with contentious relationship with defendant-mortgage company 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 27   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2009   Page 6 of 11
through threatening phone calls by defendant's employees considered indirect contact in 
violation of no-contact order in civil suit claiming violation of Fair Labor Standards Act); 
Commonwealth v. Butler, 661 N.E. 2d 666, 666-67 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996) (defendant's 
anonymous delivery of flowers to victim considered indirect contact in violation of no-
contact order). Second, Defendant's counsel does not state that Defendant will not have 
any contact with his victims. He merely states Defendant's intentions. Unfortunately, 
the last five months is replete with other incidents in which Defendant, through his 
counsel, has stated his intentions and thereafter changed his mind. Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, feels free-and actually is free-to change his mind and his stated intentions. 
His victims deserve more than that. Because they are traumatized and fearful, they 
require for their security a firm, unambiguous commitment that Defendant will not 
directly or indirectly contact either of them; considering the situation, any secure 
commitment is attainable only via a Court order. Plaintiffs cannot emotionally afford to 
be in a position in which Defendant can unilaterally change his mind. 
4. 
In the event that Defendant wants to be present at the deposition of a 
Plaintiff or at a Court hearing where a Plaintiff is to attend, the Court can easily resolve 
such situations at that time. Meanwhile, the sole purpose of Defendant's refusal to agree 
to not contact these Plaintiffs is to leave them intimidated and in fear of being in the 
presence of the man who has sexually exploited, abused, molested, and/or battered them. 
One would think that, instead, Defendant would have voluntarily agreed with Plaintiffs' 
prior request to have no contact directly or indirectly, including through his agents, and 
would want to demonstrate to the Court that he will not contact his victims; his refusal to 
stay away from them is nothing short of disturbing. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 27   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2009   Page 7 of 11
5. 
Although not requested, if Defendant's counsel seeks some type of 
reciprocity, Plaintiffs' counsel would agree in writing, and would not oppose a Court 
order prohibiting Plaintiffs from contacting Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein. It is obvious to

DECLARATION OF GILBERT KLIMAN, M. D. 
RE: EXPECTATION OF HARM FROM DISCLOSING THE PLAINTIFFS' IDENTITIES 
IN DOES V JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
1. I, Gilbert W. Kliman, M.D., of2105 Divisadero Street, San Francisco, California, 
CA. Physicians License 055912, declare the following under penalty of perjury: 
2. I have been retained by plaintiffs' law firm, Mermelstein & Horowitz, to give expert 
testimony. If called as a witness, I would testify truthfully and competently concerning 
my psychiatric findings about each of the plaintiffs' alleged experiences of sexual abuse, 
and the enduring effects that I find each of the young women have suffered as a direct 
result of the sexual acts perpetrated by the defendant. 
3. I have been asked to respond to the Defense motion, which requests that some of the 
plaintiffs, who are now adults, should be publicly named. It is my opinion that 
involuntary public disclosure will result in the plaintiffs experiencing revictimization, 
albeit by a justice system that is designed to protect them. If their identities are released, 
the victims will be at-risk of having their personal lives scrutinized by friends, extended 
family, spouses, children, fellow students, employers and fellow employees, the media 
and general public. This type of exposure humiliates many victims and represents another 
betrayal of trust. Public exposure places the plaintiffs at further risk of stigmatization, 
shame and retraumatization. 
4. Due to traumatization the plaintiffs are arrested in their development, and even those 
who are now legally adults are arrested in part to adolescent aspects of psychology. 
5. The plaintiffs do not hold their heads high with pride for having been sexually 
controlled by Mr. Epstein. They hold their heads low with shame. The internal life of a 
typical adolescent, into late adolescence and early adult years in the best of 
circumstances, usually involves generous proportions of self-consciousness, shame, self-
absorption and self-doubt and self-blame about sexual acts. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 2 of 5
6. Clinically harmful levels of shame, self-consciousness, self-doubt and self-blame are 
even more prominent among victims of molestations than among the general population. 
7. Molested teenagers are particularly vulnerable to wrongful manipulations and special 
clinical harms from the experiences of shame and humiliation. In fact, shame and efforts 
to cope with it played an underlying role in the harm to each plaintiff. Each was lured 
into Mr. Epstein's sexual lair with the promise of overcoming bodily and sexual shame 
by earning money and bettering their lot in life. The defendant capitalized on their sexual 
naivete, insecurities and effort to better themselves, and he worked hard to overcome 
their shame at his enlistment of them in his selfish gratifications. 
8. The defendant who wishes to make their identities public is one whom the criminal 
justice system has already determined is a person who has already committed a crime of 
child molestation. That surely means he has already exploited and manipulated the girls' 
state of adolescent sexuality, including their embarrassment, awkwardness and bodily 
self-consciousness. He perverted their nascent and developing moral structures by posing 
as a generous, avuncular mentor who could coach them about their bodies, sex and love. 
The exploitation of adolescent bodies, sex and love is - from a psychoanalytic point of 
view - an influence on the developing moral conscience of the children, as well as on 
their sexual urges. Now the ravaging of their internal and private moral conscience is 
intended by the perpetrator to be made a public ravaging. 
9. Among sexual trauma victims, the insidious and destructive persistence of shame, 
humiliation and associated self-blame is well-documented (Finkelhor and Brown, 1985). 
Stigmatization, as experienced by a sexual trauma victim, has especially painful and 
pathologic consequences. Shame lingers and becomes integrated within the adolescent 
victim's malleable emerging identity, character structure and self image. Moral clarity is 
distorted. Perceptions of self-blame and guilt are magnified. The impact of shame lends 
to cultivating a self image of being "spoiled goods." 
10. Stigmatization following sexual trauma results in long-term risks that can negatively 
shape multiple facets of adult development: sexual, emotional, interpersonal and 
vocational. Stigmatization, which is generally to be avoided among psychiatric patients, 
increases risks among those - as in our plaintiffs as a group - who experience clinical 
depression and self-destructive behaviors: drug use, criminal activity, even prostitution. 
Stigmatization following abuse is associated with delinquency due to increased anger 
and affiliation with deviant peers (Feiring et al., 2007). 
11. Shame and guilt are important dimensions of both complex and single event, 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms of shame are associated with feelings of 
helplessness and powerlessness, which each of the plaintiffs endorsed experiencing in 
relation to Mr. Epstein. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 3 of 5
12. The DSM-IV-TR recognizes both powerlessness and helplessness as requisite parts of 
the traumatic experience in Criterion A for the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder 
trauma (Martin Seligman, recent Past President of the American Psychological 
Association, coined relevant terms of "learned helplessness and "Loss of Personal Locus 
of Control." See Seligman, M.P. l 97 5: Helplessness, Depression, Development and 
Death. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco). The teenaged girls suffered the loss of personal 
locus of control to a much more experienced, sexually aggressive, powerful and 
dominant, manipulative perpetrator. 
13. Releasing names of the plaintiffs to the public will reenact experiences of 
powerlessness and helplessness in the face of a boundary violation. Repetition and 
reenactment represent central features of Criterion B in the DSM-IV -TR diagnosis of 
posttraumatic stress disorder trauma. In effect, release of their identity and public 
intrusion into their personal life represents a reenactment of the shame of sexual 
traumatization. Repetition and reenactment are central pathologies that afflict sexual 
trauma survivors. 
14. Victims of sexual abuse often rely upon some form of dissociation, splitting or denial, 
as a defensive means to manage overwhelming affects associated with the sexual trauma. 
Each of the plaintiff girls has employed some variation of this defense, both during the 
massages and then subsequently following disclosure of the abuse. Primitive, 
maladaptive responses of this nature will become additionally reinforced as a result of 
public disclosure. 
15. Another aspect of the plaintiffs' experience, which is recognized by DSM-IV -TR, is 
that the trauma was associated with human design factors (such as cruel intention to do 
harm, rape, torture). Trauma of this origin has a tendency to produce more "severe or 
long lasting" posttraumatic stress disorder than natural events (DSM IV TR p. 464). A 
policy of deliberate revelation of the names of the victims would reinforce the sense of 
design, pattern and policy of human intentions. 
16. Negative expectations about significant activities are noted in DSM-IV-TR, as part of 
Criterion C. Symptoms of foreshortened future are characteristic of a traumatized 
individual's clinical course (C4). They expect revictimization. They expect bad outcomes 
(C7) in their social, educational, vocational, relational plans. They are hypervigilant 
(Criterion D4) for further trauma, and this affects lifestyle choices and future planning. 
Hypervigilance is part of the arousal set of criteria. Public disclosure of the victims' 
identity will aggravate existing symptoms of hypervigilance. 
17. The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic category of "chronic" is justified for each of the 
plaintiffs. Scientific literature shows that the prognostic consequences of PTSD and 
residual effects may last for decades (U.S. Dept. of Health, 2005; Issues in Child Abuse 
Prevention Number 9 Autumn] 998: Long-term Effects of Child Sexual Abuse, Paul E 
Mullen and Jillian Fleming). The lasting impact upon character, identity and moral 
development will probably affect long-term influences upon adult development. It is 
more probable than not that stigmatization associated with public disclosure of the 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 4 of 5
plaintiffs' identities will intensify the scope, nature and severity of the chronic symptom 
course. 
18. In addition to PTSD, shame and humiliation themselves have also been associated 
with causing clinical depression. Coexisting PTSD and clinical depression places the 
plaintiffs at increased risk for re-victimization and high risk sexual behaviors (e.g., 
sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy, rape) (Nelson, 2002), and at greater 
risk to victimize others (Filipas and Ullman, 2006; Desai, Centers for Disease Control, 
2002) who are in their control. Studies have also shown that chronic symptoms of PTSD, 
in association with a single episode of Major Depressive Disorder, can produce lifetime 
adjustment difficulties, which include suicidality (Oquendo et al, 2005; Dube et al, CDC, 
2001; Rohde, J. Am. Acad. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 2005). The plaintiffs will be 
additionally vulnerable to these clinical outcomes, if they suffer the stigmatization and 
humiliation associated with public disclosure of their identities. 
19. Alternative hypothesis: I have applied the evidence shown from examination and 
testing of the plaintiffs and relevant observations and information from other 
professionals while testing an alternative hypothesis: that no harm would result from 
public disclosure of the plaintiffs' identities. During the evaluations with the six 
plaintiffs, I used generally acceptable criteria for establishing whether a DSM-IV-TR 
disorder occurred. I established that there were provable and diagnosable injuries, 
primarily posttraumatic stress disorder and comorbid depression. Based upon these 
diagnostic signs, it is more probable than not, that exposing the plaintiffs identity to the 
public is not a trivial concern or one without substantial clinical repercussions. I believe 
that most child, adolescent and adult psychiatrists would share the opinion that additional 
psychiatric injury will result from such exposure. 
20. However, consider for the sake of argument, that my diagnostic conclusions are 
incorrect, notwithstanding having fulfilled standard psychiatric evaluation procedures of 
taking a history from multiple sources, videotaping and transcribing my initial interview, 
and reviewing available medical and legal documents. Even if this was the case, and my 
diagnostic conclusions were faulty, I believe that multiple experts, even those who may 
now propose publication of the victims' names, would still come to a conclusion that the 
plaintiffs suffered sexual abuse, and in some cases, multiple acts of ongoing abuse, at the 
hands of Jeffery Epstein. Even without developing a subsequent disorder, there is much 
clinical evidence and scientific literature showing likelihood of substantial psychiatric 
harm to these sexually abused plaintiffs. 
21. To form these conclusions, I have used my extensive experience in forming these 
opinions. That experience is both as a treating child psychiatrist and separately as a 
forensic psychiatrist. I have treated hundreds of minor patients, as well as additionally 
evaluated hundreds of children and adolescents who have suffered sexual abuse. I have 
made long term followups of many of the children and have treated many adults who 
have been molested as adolescents. It is my opinion, with a reasonably high degree of 
medical certainty that the defense motion to allow public disclosure of the plaintiffs' 
identities is clinically and ethically a wrongful plan. The act of revealing their identities 
against their wishes places the plaintiffs at risk, in the best of circumstances, of suffering 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 5 of 5
an aggravation of existing diagnostic concerns. It is more probable than not that releasing 
personal identities will foster an exacerbation and magnification of symptoms lending to 
increased risk of revictimization and retraumatization. 
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the 
foregoing statements are true and correct, and that this declaration was executed at San 
Francisco, California on June 4, 2009.

professional publications include books and peer-reviewed medical journal articles on mass 
disasters, most recently concerning the Attack on America. 
He was extensively interviewed in 1997 by CBS Dallas TV regarding psychiatric testimony 
concerning eleven altar boys, testimony which had resulted in a record-making jury verdict 
against the Archdiocese of Dallas. In April, 1998, Dr. Kliman was interviewed by Channel Four 
anchorwoman, Linda Yee, concerning his Salvation Army project providing the Cornerstone 
form of psychoanalytic psychotherapy for homeless preschoolers and toddlers,. The Cornerstone 
project itself was viewed on the Channel II Five O'Clock News. KGO TV interviewed Dr. 
Kliman concerning a forensic testimony, with a focus on a Stanford football player who had 
allegedly become a child molester. During the Lewinsky-Clinton matter, Kliman was 
interviewed by Channel 12/20 concerning psychoanalytic views of leaders having exceptional 
sexual access to partners and the risk of a position of power overcoming the judgments of such 
leaders. 
During 2001 following the World Trade Building terrorism, Dr. Kliman was 
interviewed by Channel II News and appeared on five occasions thereafter through 2003 
concerning the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In May 2003, he was discussant with U.N. Secretary 
General Olaru Otonu, featured on Dhubai Business TV concerning the plight of children in war. 
In 2004, together with the International Psychoanalytic Association, Dr. Kliman helped organize, 
establish and supervise a therapeutic preschool project in Buenos Aires. 
"Cornerstone 
Argentina" is now in its second year of treating severely disturbed and impoverished 
preschoolers, with his continuing collaboration. 
Following the hurricane disasters of 2005 he collaborated with Mercy Corps and the Children's 
Psychological Health Center to produce a mental health resource. The result, "My Katrina and 
Rita Story", a guided activity resource of families who had to deal with the hurricanes. Mercy 
Corps is distributing copies to 20,000 families. 
In 2005, RE DISTURBED PRESCHOOLERS Dr. Kliman helped organize, establish and 
supervise a therapeutic project in Piedmont California, at the nonprofit Ann Martin Center. 
In 2007, RE HOMELESS CHILDREN: Dr. Kliman helped establish a Reflective Network 
Therapy service for homeless preschoolers in Seattle. He provided four days of training in that 
method for the Family Service Center of King County (located in Seattle), and created an 
organizational link between The Family Services Center and The Children's Psychological 
Health Center, Inc. of San Francisco in order to continue serving homeless children in Seattle. 
In 2008, Dr. Kliman activated the Reflective Network Therapy services for preschoolers m 
Seattle. He supervises there in person and by phone and video. 
In 2008, RE DISASTER SERVICES: Following the Sichuan Earthquake Disaster of May 12, 
2008, Dr. Kliman established a link between Children's Psychological Health Center, Inc., 
Mercy Corps, and The China America Psychoanalytic Alliance. 
He created mental health 
resources (see Publications) which were licensed for mass distribution in China by Mercy Corps. 
In 2008, Dr. Kliman helped found a new non-profit organization called Teach with Africa and is 
a member of its Board of Directors.

PROFESSIONAL COMMENDATIONS: 
A letter of commendation regarding clinical work in the classroom within a public school 
system: 
December 3, 2001 
To Whom It May Concern: 
This is to report that the San Mateo County Office of Education, Special Education programs, 
has benefited from the services of The Children's Psychological Health Center, specifically its 
Cornerstone Therapeutic School Project. 
We have worked together for the past six years. Under the leadership of Gilbert Kliman, MD., 
the Center has trained members of our teaching and school psychology staff to carry out a 
mental health service on our premises. We now have a collaborative project in its sixth year for 
our special education preschool children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) and 
for those with Serious Emotional Disorders (SED) which interfere with their education. As an 
alternative to sending children to a private nonpublic special education school for extremely 
intensive mental health services at significant cost, this project has created and provides just 
such intensive service within a public preschool special class program at 65 Tower Road, San 
Mateo. 
To my knowledge, among the 30 children served so far under the collaborative project, we are 
seeing cognitive, social and human gains which have decreased the gap between these children 
and their typically developing peers. Several families and children are thriving with less 
intensive special education service or returned to regular education class. Not only has the 
family and child suffering been reduced, the burden to taxpayers is also reduced. The children 
have been able to remain in the community, and some who were functioning as severely autistic 
and retarded now appear to be developing within a somewhat normal range. We are pleased 
with the quality of special education services our County provides for preschoolers with PDD or 
SED. We are also gratified with the research results provided by The Children's Psychological 
Health Center. 
We recommend the Cornerstone project to other school systems, so that they consider it an 
important opportunity should they be able to collaborate similarly with The Children's 
Psychological Health Center. At California's common cost of $15,000 to $40,000 or more a 
year, for a special education child who needs full time special education services and auxiliary 
intensive help, the savings for even one child's 12-year career of intensive services in special 
education can be substantial. The savings from one of the successes we have seen may equal the 
costs of the entire Cornerstone project with the 30 children helped so far. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 16 of 23
We have not yet seen any failures. The agency is showing measurable cognitive gains for our 
collaborative work which, according to their research, averages 20 to 28 points in independent 
WPPSI testing of the children in the Cornerstone program. The techniques are far more 
economical to use than we have found with the Lovaas method, which we also implement for 
some students. We have also seen the techniques transmitted to special education teachers as 
well as inexperienced therapists. 
I invite you to visit our project in action. 
Sincerely, 
JAYS. PARNES, Ed.D.

MAJOR FEDERAL COURT FORENSIC ACTIVITIES: 
EVALUATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS HEARD IN FEDERAL COURT, HANNIBAL 
MISSOURI, November 15, 2001 
Under Dr. Kliman's leadership, a Children's Psychological Health Center team of five clinicians 
and two administrative staff has been at work since May 2, 2001 conducting a behavioral audit 
regarding the psychiatric conditions and the residential treatment of over 100 children (mostly 
ages 13 to 17) at Heartland Christian Academy, as requested by the Academy's general counsel. 
2001: Doe vs. Three Springs Treatment Center, Nashville, TN. 
2004: Does vs. L.K. Baliredy et al (An international child trafficking matter). Five days of 
deposition. 
2004 Doe vs. State of New Mexico and Arthur Brokup. 
MAJOR STATE COURT CASES: 
Some cases of public health significance, concerning allegedly traumatized minors in care of 
governmental or institutional agencies: 
Does vs. OK Boys Ranch and State of Washington: 44 children in care at a state-licensed 
rehabilitation and foster care-related center were allegedly allowed to abuse each other while 
staff and therapists did not report harmful activities of which they knew, Dr. Kliman opined. The 
plaintiff children have to date all received settlements in four phases of this litigation over a nine 
year period, with Dr. Kliman as the principal expert. 
York vs. ChaparralNictor Treatment Facility. Orange County Superior Court. An eleven year 
old child severely and chronically molested by a residential treatment staff member was 
evaluated and an opinion given by Dr. Kliman concerning harm and how to rehabilitate the child 
as much as possible. Implications for standards of residential care are contained within the case. 
Carlson vs. Ray-Lara Foster Home. Orange County Superior Court. Dr. Kliman evaluated and 
testified concerning a twelve year old boy who was allegedly molested by a foster father and had 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 17 of 23
to rescue himself. The foster father's partner was negligent, Dr. Kliman opined. The judge 
agreed and awarded the child compensation for psychological damages. 
Does vs. Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Dr. Kliman was the lead psychiatric witness. The case 
settled after six days of his deposition testimony. 
Does vs. Salesian Order Western Region. Dr. Kliman was the lead psychiatric witness. The case 
settled after nine days of his deposition testimony and two days of trial. 
Does v South Dakota School for the Deaf. Multiple boys were molested by an older student. The 
state school administration was allegedly negligent and major psychological damages were 
claimed. Dr. Kliman served as the principal plaintiffs' expert on administrative liability issues 
and psychological damages. The case settled with major compensation for the plaintiffs during 
the time of jury deliberations. 
CHILD PSYCHIATRIC EXPERT TESTIMONY: 
Dr. Kliman helped set legal precedents for the inclusion of psychiatric testimony in matters 
concerning wrongful death of a parent and loss of parental services, in both New York State and 
California. He has testified in over 275 cases including over 100 trials. A Federal Rule 26 list is 
available on request and on www.expertchildpsychiatry.com. His courtroom and deposition 
testimony experience includes cases of institutional negligence of children leading to 
psychological trauma, negligent foster care, loss of parental services due to wrongful deaths, 
psychological trauma as part of personal injury of adults and children, childhood molestation, 
sexual harassment, termination of parental rights, and disputed custody. Since 2000 about 30% 
of his forensic work has been requested by defense, about 70% by plaintiffs, with the defense 
tasks increasing markedly in recent years. 
Dr. Kliman's evaluations and testimony regarding 16 children negligently cared for and abused 
at The Kiwanis' OK Boys' Ranch, Olympia, WA, helped lead to settlements and awards, 
totalling $25,000,000. Responding to disclosures in that case, many improvements have occurred 
in the publicly funded and licensed institutional care of children throughout the State of 
Washington, according to newspaper accounts. 
Dr. Kliman's evaluations and opinions, together with that of The Children's Psychological 
Trauma Center team led by Robert Wynne MFCC, led to record-making $8,000,000 loss of 
parental and other services compensation for 17 bereaved subsistence-economy Alaskan Inupiat 
Native Americans (Smith vs. Ryan Airlines, Anchorage, 1997). 
Principal expert regarding institutional negligence and psychological damages in Does vs. 
Rudolph Kos and the Diocese of Dallas, Dallas 1997. The Catholic Church of Dallas was held 
liable for institutional negligence, testimony concerning the need for major psychiatric treatment 
planning was accepted by the jury, and $119,000,000--including punitive damages against the 
Church--was awarded to the 11 plaintiffs, by unanimous decision.

OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND RECOGNITION: 
In response to the mental health needs of families following recent massive firestorms, United 
Way printed and distributed 10,000 copies of "My Fire Story -- a Guided Activity Workbook for 
Children, Families and Teachers," co-authored with Edward Oklan, M.D. Copies can be obtained 
from Family Development Press, 1010 Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, Kentfield, CA 94960. The 
State of Iowa purchased rights to reproduce 10,000 copies of "My Book about The Attack on 
America - a Guided Activity Workbook for Children, Families and Teachers", published in 2001. 
During 1996 - 2002 Sophie Murvis Foundation, The Windholz Foundation, The Atkinson, 
Cadence Corporation, Irving Harris Foundation and The Stullsaft Foundations have recently 
awarded grants to Dr. Kliman as principal investigator for his Cornerstone Therapeutic Nursery 
project, serving seriously disturbed preschoolers in the San Mateo Office of Education. 
Presentations on The Cornerstone Therapeutic Nursery Project have been made by Dr. Kliman 
during 1997 through 2002 at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute and the Seattle Institute 
for Psychoanalysis. 
Three documentary videotapes concerning Dr. Kliman's psychotherapies of disturbed children 
treated by him using this method in a therapeutic special education class are now available for 
scientific and educational purposes, parental permission having been gained. Such use requires a 
confidentiality agreement. 
Tape I: The Cornerstone Method. 
Tape II: Treatment of an Autistic Boy 
Tape III: Unique Features of The Cornerstone Method 
As a pilot application of his techniques for preschoolers, Dr. Kliman opened a Cornerstone 
Therapeutic Nursery at the Salvation Army Shelter for homeless families in January 1998, 
serving seven homeless families with preschool children. He is supervising the project weekly as 
Medical Director of The Children's Psychological Trauma Center. Unedited videotapes of that 
project are available to scientists and educators with a confidentiality agreement. The Wright 
Institute has provided a psychology intern to conduct the treatment under Dr. Kliman's training 
and supervision. The California School of Professional Psychology has assigned a doctoral thesis 
candidate to Dr. Kliman's supervision to study the I.Q. rise phenomenon previously documented 
in Cornerstone therapies. 
Peer-reviewed publications of Dr. Kliman's work with foster children appear in Zelman, A: 
Interventions with High Risk Children, Jason Aronson 1997 (Chapter by Kliman on Controlled 
Assessment of The Personal Life History Book Method for Foster Children). Results of Dr. 
Kliman's Cornerstone Method are also reported extensively in that book, focusing on the I.Q. rise 
phenomenon.

child has had severe stressors in his life, and suffers behavioral and overanxious 
symptoms. He has impulse dyscontrol, attentional deficits, and expressive language 
difficulties from which he can be seen to be recovering. Two excerpted tapes have been 
created to illustrate features of the child's pathology, and of the response to interpretive 
aspects of treatment. Gilbert Kliman, M.D. is the psychoanalyst, and the treatment is 
conducted three times a week, with parent guidance every two weeks. The videographer

started with Gilbert Kliman, M.D. working for a year as daily in-classroom therapist in a public 
special education school. He was assisted by Leanne Runyan and Gail Hernandez as the teachers 
at the San Mateo Early Childhood Education Center, a preschool special education facility of 
The County of San Mateo. A second team under his supervision included work at The San 
Francisco Unified School District (Vanessa Vigilante and Esther Kronenberg). Third and fourth 
teams were at The Salvation Army Gateway Shelter (Vanessa Vigilante as therapist and Lynda 
Byrd as teacher, Deanna Reardon as therapist and Lynda Byrd as teacher). A fourth was at The 
Cadence Cornerstone Site at Mt. Pleasant School, San Jose (Karita Hummer, therapist and Kathy 
Krall, teacher). Fifth team therapy was provided by Jane Christmas. The sixth team therapists 
was Dr. Miquela Diaz Hope, the seventh Molly Franklin, MFT. All have been extensively 
videotaped carrying out the method. An eighth team was assembled in late 2002, when Linda 
Hirshfeld Ph.D. joined as Fellow in Cornerstone Therapy. In 2001 Mike McDonald, Ed.D. 
became Special Education Director of Cornerstone School. All the treatments are have been 
under principal supervision of Dr. Kliman with additional supervision by Mali Mann, M.D., 
Myrna Frankel, Ed.D., and Jan Baeuerlen, M.D. 
Linda Hirshfeld, Ph.D. of the Ann Martin 
Center is conducting the archival work for her Cornerstone Services. 
A professional researcher/ training confidentiality agreement is required to study this archive.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES 2-7’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO 
COMPEL AND/OR IDENTIFY PLAINTIFFS IN THE STYLE OF THIS CASE AND 
MOTION TO IDENTIFY JANE DOE IN THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENAS FOR 
PURPOSES OF DISCOVERY, OR ALTERNATIVELY, MOTION TO DISMISS  
“SUA SPONTE”, WITH INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiffs, JANE DOES 2-7, hereby serve their Response to Defendant’s Motion to 
Compel and/or Identify Plaintiffs in the Style of this Case and Motion to Identify Jane Doe in 
Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of Discovery, or Alternatively, Motion to Dismiss “Sua 
Sponte”, With Incorporated Memorandum of Law, and state as follows:   
1. 
The lawsuits filed by JANE DOES 2-7 involve private, intimate facts pertaining 
to their own childhood sexual abuse and exploitation by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 3 of 15

2. 
Jane Does 2-7 filed their suits under a pseudonym1 to prevent public disclosure of 
the private, highly sensitive and intimate facts pertaining to their sexual assaults, and the public 
association of their identities with Defendant Epstein and these assaults. 
3. 
Dr. Gilbert Kliman,2 a well-known forensic psychiatrist with an expertise in the 
field of child trauma, has met with and evaluated each of Jane Does 2-7 and opined that public 
disclosure of their real names would create a substantial risk to them of further psychological 
harm. See Exhibit “A”, Declaration of Gilbert Kliman, M.D.  
4. 
Dr. Kliman opines as follows: 
Releasing names of the plaintiffs to the public will reenact experiences of 
powerlessness and helplessness in the face of a boundary violation. Repetition and 
reenactment represent central features of Criterion B in the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis 
of posttraumatic stress disorder trauma. In effect, release of their identity and 
public intrusion into their personal life represents a reenactment of the shame of 
sexual traumatization. Repetition and reenactment are central pathologies that 
afflict sexual trauma survivors. 
Victims of sexual abuse often rely upon some form of dissociation, splitting or 
denial, as a defensive means to manage overwhelming affects associated with the 
sexual trauma. Each of the plaintiff girls has employed some variation of this 
defense, both during the massages and then subsequently following disclosure of 
the abuse. Primitive, maladaptive responses of this nature will become 
additionally reinforced as a result of public disclosure.  
Another aspect of the plaintiffs’ experience, which is recognized by DSM-IV-TR, 
is that the trauma was associated with human design factors (such as cruel 
intention to do harm, rape, torture). Trauma of this origin has a tendency to 
produce more “severe or long lasting” posttraumatic stress disorder than natural 
events (DSM IV TR p. 464). A policy of deliberate revelation of the names of the 
victims would reinforce the sense of design, pattern and policy of human 
intentions.  
It is my opinion, with a reasonably high degree of medical certainty that the 
defense motion to allow public disclosure of the plaintiffs’ identity is clinically 
Defendant and his counsel are aware of the real names of Jane Does 2-7. 
A copy of the curriculum vitae of Dr. Gilbert Kliman is attached hereto as Exhibit “B”. 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 4 of 15

and ethically a wrongful plan. The act of revealing their identity against their 
wishes places the plaintiffs at risk, in the best of circumstances, of suffering an 
aggravation of existing diagnostic concerns. It is more probable than not that 
releasing personal identities will foster an exacerbation and magnification of 
symptoms lending to increased risk of revictimization and retraumatization.  
See Exhibit “A”, ¶¶ 13-15, 21 
5. 
Given the private nature of the allegations in this lawsuit and the serious risk of 
harm to the mental health of Jane Does 2-7 if a public disclosure of their identities were required, 
Jane Does 2-7 should be permitted to continue using a pseudonym in this lawsuit.   
6. 
Notably, in one of the  cases consolidated for purposes of discovery, Jane Doe v. 
Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 08-80893, this Court recognized the harm likely to result from public 
disclosure of the victims’ identities in these cases, and allowed the Plaintiff in that case to 
“proceed in this action under the pseudonym ‘Jane Doe’ ”, by Order dated October 6, 2008.   
7. 
Jeffrey Epstein sets forth no facts to support his bare contention that Jane Does 2-
use of a pseudonym in these proceedings interferes with his “constitutional due process right.” 
See Motion to Compel, p. 3.  Defendant and his counsel know the identities of these Plaintiffs.  
8. 
Defendant also requests the Court’s permission to use the real names of Jane Does 
2-7 in various third-party subpoenas for discovery purposes.  Defendant does not identify any of 
the entities or persons to whom he intends to send subpoenas.  An order granting the relief 
requested without limitations would essentially nullify Jane Does 2-7’s right to proceed 
anonymously.  Jane Does 2-7 therefore object to the issuance of third-party subpoenas, and 
submit that Defendant can obtain the discovery he seeks by alternative means that will preserve 
the confidentiality of the Jane Does 2-7’s identities.   
9. 
If this Court were to permit third party subpoenas or records custodian  
depositions using the existing captions and identifying Jane Does 2-7 in the body of the 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 5 of 15

subpoena by their names, due to publicity surrounding the Defendant’s crimes, then Jane Does 2-
would effectively be revealed as abuse victims in these cases against Defendant Epstein.  Any 
subpoenas or notices to third parties therefore should not disclose the type of action or the 
Defendant’s identity.  There are alternatives which would preserve Jane Does 2-7’s anonymity 
and be more efficient and cost-effective at the same time.  For instance, Defendant can obtain 
records from various non-party sources through Plaintiffs’ counsel, who can certify that they 
have obtained the records through authorizations signed by Jane Does 2-7.  Another means to 
obtain non-party records concerning Plaintiffs is the appointment of a special master, who would 
verify authenticity and completeness of the records.    
10. 
Finally, Jeffrey Epstein’s request that this Court order a “sua sponte” dismissal is 
illogical.  Sua sponte means “[w]ithout prompting or suggestion; on its own motion.” Black's 
Law Dictionary 1437 (7th ed.1999). Thus, the definition of sua sponte does not fit these 
circumstances, because the Court is being prompted by Epstein’s Motion. Velchez v. Carnival 
Corp., 331 F.3d 1207 (11th Cir. 2003).  In any event, there is no basis or authority to support a 
dismissal of these cases.  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 respectfully request that (i) this Court deny 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel and/or Identify Plaintiffs in the Style of this Case and Motion to 
Identify Jane Doe in Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of Discovery, or Alternatively, Motion 
to Dismiss “Sua Sponte”, in its entirety; (ii) Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 be permitted to continue 
using their pseudonyms in this litigation; (iii) this Court order that records from non-parties 
relating to Jane Does 2-7, including medical and employment records, only be obtained through 
Plaintiffs’ counsel by means of signed authorizations that do not include the caption or identify 
Epstein as the party seeking records, or alternatively, appoint a special master to obtain the 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 6 of 15
-

records, who would verify authenticity and completeness of the records; and (iv) all other relief 
this Court deems just and appropriate. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
I. 
PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES 2-7 SHOULD BE PERMITTED  
TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY IN THIS CASE DUE TO THE  
SENSITIVE, PRIVATE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING FACTS  
AND THE RISK OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM TO THE PLAINTIFFS 
Federal courts permit a party to proceed under a pseudonym when special circumstances 
warrant anonymity. See, e.g., Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 685-87 
(11th Cir.2001); Does I thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1068-69 (9th 
Cir.2000); James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233, 238-39 (4th Cir.1993); EW v. New York Blood Center, 
213 F.R.D. 108, 110-12 (E.D.N.Y.2003); Javier v. Garcia-Botello, 211 F.R.D. 194, 196 
(W.D.N.Y.2002); Doe v. Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d 40, 43-44 (E.D.N.Y.1999); Doe v. United Servs. 
Life Ins. Co., 123 F.R.D. 437, 439 (S.D.N.Y.1988). Sexual assault victims are a paradigmatic 
example of those entitled to a grant of anonymity. See Doe No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193 (E.D. 
N.Y. 2006); Doe v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wisc., 112 F.3d 869, 872 (7th Cir.1997) 
(“fictitious names are allowed when necessary to protect the privacy of ... rape victims, and other 
particularly vulnerable parties or witnesses”); see also Doe v. City of Chicago, 360 F.3d 667, 669 
(7th Cir. 2004). 
The decision whether to allow a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is within the court's 
discretion. See Aware Woman Ctr., 253 F.3d at 684; Javier, 211 F.R.D. at 195; EW, 213 F.R.D. 
at 110.  As set forth above, this Court exercised its direction in one of the consolidated cases, 
Jane Doe v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 08-80893, to allow a plaintiff to proceed under the 
pseudonym “Jane Doe” in an Order dated October 6, 2008.   
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 7 of 15

Courts will permit a party to proceed under a pseudonym where “the party's need for 
anonymity outweighs prejudice to the opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the 
party's identity.” Does I Thru XXIII, 214 F.3d at 1068; see Javier, 211 F.R.D. at 195; EW, 213 
F.R.D. at 111;  As set forth herein, the balancing test in this case weighs in favor of permitted 
plaintiff to continue to proceed anonymously:   
In undertaking this balance, courts have considered such facts as 
(1) whether the plaintiff is suing the government or a private 
person; (2) whether the plaintiff would be compelled to disclose 
intimate information; (3) whether plaintiff would be compelled to 
his or her intention in engage in illegal conduct, thereby risking 
criminal prosecution; (4) whether the plaintiff would risk injury if 
identified; (5) whether the party defending against a suit brought 
under a pseudonym would thereby be prejudiced; (6) the ages of 
the parties whose identity is to be suppressed; (7) the extent to 
which the identity of the litigant has been kept confidential; (8) 
whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues presented 
or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing 
the litigants’ identities; and (9) the public interest in guaranteeing 
open access to proceedings without denying litigants access to the 
justice system.  
Doe v. Del Rio, 241 F.R.D. 154, 157 (S.D. N.Y. 2006) 
The public has a strong interest in protecting the identities of sexual assault victims so 
that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes. See Doe v. Evans, 202 F.R.D. 
173, 176 (E.D.Pa.2001) (granting anonymity to sexual assault victim); Doe No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 
F.R.D. 193 (E.D. N.Y. 2006).  That is particularly true in these consolidated cases where there 
are numerous victims with similar claims. Although these cases have gained considerable media 
attention, there appears to be little public interest in knowing the specific identity of each of the 
victims. 
With regard to the second factor, courts have granted anonymity to protect against 
disclosure of a wide range of issues involving matters of the utmost intimacy, including sexual 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 8 of 15

assault. See, e.g., Aware Woman Ctr., 253 F.3d at 685 (abortion); EW, 213 F.R.D. at 111 
(infection with hepatitis B); Doe v. Evans, 202 F.R.D. 173, 176 (E.D.Pa.2001) (sexual assault 
victim); Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d at 42 (sexual assault victim); WGA v. Priority Pharmacy, Inc., 184 
F.R.D. 616, 617 (E.D.Mo.1999) (status as AIDS patient); Doe v. United Servs. Life Ins. Co., 123 
F.R.D. 437, 439 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (sexual orientation); see also Blue Cross, 112 F.3d at 872 
(recognizing rape victims as entitled to anonymity). It cannot be reasonably denied that a 
person’s sexual history – especially during their childhood – is an intimate fact.  When the 
childhood sexual history includes criminal sexual contact by an adult, the facts are even more 
intimate and personal.  In the electronic age in which we live, these concerns are heightened.  As 
federal courts have recognized in this context, it is now possible to “determine whether a given 
individual is a party to a lawsuit in federal court anywhere in the country by the simplest of 
computer searches, to access the docket sheet of any such case electronically, and ... that entire 
case files will be accessible over the Internet.” Doe v. City of New York, 201 F.R.D. 100, 102 
(S.D.N.Y.2001) (denying anonymity where any injury was purely reputational and case did not 
involve private or intimate matter); see EW, 213 F.R.D. at 112-13.
As Dr. Kliman explains in his Declaration, disclosure of Jane Does 2-7’s identities will 
place these Plaintiffs “at-risk of having their personal lives scrutinized by friends, extended 
family, spouses, children, fellow students, employers and fellow employees, the media and 
general public. This type of exposure humiliates many victims and represents another betrayal of 
trust. Public exposure places the plaintiff’s at further risk of stigmatization, shame and 
retraumatization.” See Exhibit “A” at ¶ 3.  Dr. Kliman also finds it of no consequence that some 
of the plaintiffs are now legally adults in that “[d]ue to traumatization the plaintiffs are arrested 
in their development, and even those who are now legally adult are arrested in part to adolescent 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 9 of 15
--

aspects of psychology.” Id. at ¶ 4 
The policy of protecting victims of sexual misconduct from undue embarrassment and 
disclosure of their private affairs is firmly established in Fed.R.Evid. 412.  The protections of 
Rule 412 are designed to “encourage victims of sexual misconduct to institute and participate in 
legal proceedings against alleged offenders.” (Committee Notes to 1994 Amendment).  
Likewise, many states in this country, including Florida and New York, have similarly enacted 
laws to protect the anonymity of sexual assault victims. See Fla. Stat. §§794.024, 794.026 
(2008); N.Y. Civil Rights Law § 50-b (McKinney 2009). In 1994, the Florida Legislature passed 
The Crime Victims Protections Act.  The legislative stated purpose for the Act was “to protect 
the identity of victims of sexual crimes.”  Fla. AGO, 2003-56, 2003 WL 22971082 (Dec. 15, 
2003).  Under §794.024, Florida Statutes, court records that identify the name and/or address of a 
victim of a sexual crime are presumed to be confidential and exempt from public access. Id.  
Similarly, upon approving New York's rape shield law, then Governor Mario Cuomo stated, 
“sexual assault victims have unfortunately had to endure a terrible invasion of their physical 
privacy. They have a right to expect that this violation will not be compounded by a further 
invasion of their privacy.” 1991 McKinney's Sessions Laws of N.Y., at 2211-2212 (quoted in 
Deborah S. v. Diorio, 153 Misc.2d 708, 583 N.Y.S.2d 872 (N.Y.City Civ.Ct.1992)); see also 
Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 597, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977) (“Short of homicide, 
[rape] is the ultimate violation of self”). 
As to the fourth factor of risk injury, Dr. Kliman has evaluated Jane Does 2-7,  and has 
concluded that the childhood sexual abuse at issue has caused features of post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD), including shame, guilt, helplessness, and powerlessness.  See Exhibit “A” at ¶¶ 
4-7.  Dr. Kliman further states, “it is more probable than not that releasing personal identities 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 10 of 15

will foster an exacerbation and magnification of symptoms lending to increased risk of 
revictimization and retraumatization.”  Id. at ¶ 21.  Thus, this is not a case analogous to those 
cited by defendant in which the plaintiffs were merely at risk of “personal embarrassment.”  
Instead, there is a genuine and immediate risk of psychological harm. 
None of the cases cited by Defendant where courts denied a plaintiff’s request for 
anonymity involved victims of childhood sexual assault or evidence of emotional or 
psychological harm that would result from disclosure of the plaintiff's identity. See Doe v. Hartz, 
F.Supp.2d 1027 (N.D.Iowa 1999); Doe v. Shakur, 164 F.R.D. 359 (E.D.N.Y.1996); Doe v. 
Bell Atlantic Bus. Sys. Servs., 162 F.R.D. 418 (D.Mass.1995); Doe v. Univ. of Rhode Island, 28 
Fed.R.Serv.3d 366, 1993 WL 667341 (D.R.I. Dec. 28, 1993). 
As to the factor of prejudice, the Defendant does not identify how his ability to conduct 
discovery or impeach Jane Does 2-7’s credibility has been or will be impaired if these Plaintiffs 
are permitted to proceed under a pseudonym. See EW, 213 F.R.D. at 112, Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d 
at 44-45. Other than the need to make redactions and take measures not to disclose these 
Plaintiffs' identities, Defendant will not be hampered or inconvenienced merely by Plaintiffs' 
anonymity in court papers.  As set forth above, Defendant already knows their true identities. See 
Aware Woman Center, 253 F.3d at 687 (no prejudice where plaintiff offered to disclose her name 
to defendant); EW, 213 F.R.D. at 112; Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d at 44-45.   
II. 
DEFENDANT SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO USE 
THE REAL NAMES OF JANE DOES 2-7 IN THIRD-PARTY 
SUBPEONAS EXCEPT FOR THOSE ISSUED TO PERSONS WHOM 
PLAINTIFFS HAVE ALREADY DISCLOSED THEIR SEXUAL ABUSE 
As for the use of Jane Does 2-7’s real names in subpoenas issued to non-parties, a party 
may obtain discovery of any non-privileged matter that is relevant to a claim or defense of any 
party. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1).  However, a district court may limit discovery “for good cause 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 11 of 15

shown” by making “any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense,” including that the 
discovery not be had or that it be had only by a method other than that selected by the party 
seeking discovery. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c).  Jane Does 2-7 have articulated a specific and substantial 
harm from disclosure of their identities.   
If this Court were to permit Defendant to issue third-party subpoenas containing Jane 
Doe 2-7’s real names, the identity of the Defendant, and/or facts pertaining to the nature of the 
case to whomever Defendant wants, it would be akin to requiring these Plaintiffs to use their real 
name in the pleadings.  Instead, Jane Does 2-7 propose to voluntarily execute authorizations 
(which would not contain the case names or the identity of the Defendant) to allow Defendant to 
obtain education, employment, and medical records to be used for purposes of this litigation 
only.3  Alternatively, Defendant can obtain the records through a special master, who would 
verify authenticity and completeness of the records.   Either of these approaches would not only 
place Jane Does 2-7 at less risk of psychological harm, but would also be more cost-effective and 
efficient. 
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 respectfully request that Defendant’s 
Motion to Compel and/or Identify Plaintiffs in the Style of this Case and Motion to Identify Jane 
Doe in Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of Discovery, or Alternatively, Motion to Dismiss 
“Sua Sponte” be denied in its entirety, and that Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 be permitted to continue 
using their pseudonyms in this litigation.  Additionally, to avoid public disclosure of the 
Plaintiff’s identities in non-party records discovery, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 request that such 
Defendant and Plaintiff have previously agreed that education records can be obtained in this 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 29   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 12 of 15

discovery be obtained either through Plaintiffs’ counsel by means of written authorizations, or by 
the appointment of a special master.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES’  2- 7 NOTICE OF JOINDER IN PLAINTIFFS’  
JANE DOES 101 AND 102’S MOTION FOR NO-CONTACT ORDER  
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 join in Plaintiffs Jane Does 101 and 102’s Motion for No-
Contact Order, filed May 22, 2009, and state as follows:   
1. 
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 incorporate and adopt the facts set forth in the pending 
Motion for No-Contact Order.  Additionally, Plaintiffs offer additional facts in support of the 
Motion for a No-Contact Order, as set forth below.   
2. 
Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 were all identified on the 
victims list provided to Defendant Epstein’s counsel in connection with the Non-prosecution 
Agreement, and each has been identified as victims to Defendant Epstein in their pending 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 30   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 3 of 7

actions.  In June 2008, Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Pucillo ordered Defendant Epstein “not 
to have any contact, direct or indirect,” with any of his victims.  Judge Pucillo clarified that 
forbidden “indirect” contact included, but was not limited to, text messages, emails, telephone 
calls, or messages through third parties.  As detailed herein, Jane Does 4 and 7 have been 
contacted on multiple occasions by at least one person representing that she is cooperating with 
and communicating on behalf of Defendant Epstein.  In these contacts, the Plaintiffs/victims 
were threatened and harassed. 
3. 
As with other Plaintiffs, Jane Does 4 and 7 were first introduced to Defendant 
Epstein by Hayley Robson, who was a high school friend.1 
4. 
Robson had had contact with these Plaintiffs on several occasions in which she 
represented to Plaintiffs Jane Doe 4 and 7 that she is cooperating with Defendant Epstein’s 
attorneys and that she is being financially supported by Defendant Epstein.  Moreover, Robson 
has told these Plaintiffs specifically that she is communicating on behalf of Defendant Epstein.   
5. 
During these contacts, Robson made disparaging comments to the Plaintiffs and 
also sent disturbing text messages to Jane Doe No. 4.  In one text, Robson specifically stated, “I 
just met with my lawyer today and I’m finally done with the Epstein case. LOL. I knew you were 
suing Jeffrey all along and I’ve learned so much about you in the meantime. LOL.” Jane Doe 4 
understood this to mean that Robson had exchanged private information about Jane Doe 4 with 
Defendant Epstein and his attorneys.  Since February, 2009, Jane Doe 4 has continued to receive 
text messages from Robson that are sometimes harassing and other times seek information about 
Jane Doe 4’s private life, her lawsuit against Defendant Epstein, and/or her lawyer’s strategy.  
Ms. Robson was  named in at least one civil case against Mr. Epstein as a co-defendant.  See 
Jane Doe v. Epstein, case no. 50-2008-CA-0065996, Palm Beach County Circuit Court. Ms. 
Robson brought multiple underage girls to Epstein in addition to Jane Does 4 and 7.  
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 30   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 4 of 7

6. 
On one occasion, Robson approached Jane Doe 7 and disclosed that she was 
cooperating with Defendant Epstein’s defense, and that she (Robson) agreed that she would 
testify against Jane Doe 7 and the other plaintiffs to make sure that none of the Plaintiffs ever 
received any money from Defendant Epstein, making clear that her testimony would not be 
truthful to achieve this end.  She also made disparaging comments to Jane Doe 7, accusing her of 
ruining Defendant Epstein’s reputation.  
7. 
The very possibility of any contact with Epstein or his agents, including Robson, 
causes anxiety and distress particularly to Jane Doe 4 and 7, as well as the other Plaintiffs.  A no-
contact order should prevent further harassment of the Plaintiffs by Epstein and his agents, 
including, but not limited to, Hayley Robson.   
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7, respectfully join Plaintiffs Jane Does 101 and 
102 in moving this Court to enter an order granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a No Contact Order 
prohibiting the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, from any contact or communication with Plaintiffs, 
either directly or indirectly, except through Plaintiffs’ attorneys of record for the duration of the 
Order.

PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO PLAINTFF’S FIRST 
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 
Plaintiff Jane Doe, hereby moves this Court for an order compelling defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, to answer her first request for production or, in the alternative, to prove 
that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege is proper.  Jane Doe also requests 
production of a privilege log. 
Jane Doe has propounded 16 requests for production, including such 
straightforward requests as requests for production of: 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 38   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 4 of 16

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Request No. 1: Copies of all telephone records; 
Request No. 2: Photos of the inside of your home located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida, that depict the room(s) where massages took place (including 
massage table).  
Request No. 10:  Correspondence between Epstein and federal prosecutors; 
Request No. 12:  Personal tax returns; 
Request No. 13:  Photocopies of Epstein’s passport;  
Request No. 14:  A statement of net worth; and  
Request No. 16:  Medical records. 
In response to each and every one of these requests, Epstein has given the 
following response (with only minor variations here and there): 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
This Court should order Epstein to provide all of the requested information or, in 
the alternative, prove that his Fifth Amendment invocations are valid. It is for the court, 
not the claimant, to determine whether the hazard of incrimination is justified.  United 
States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991).  “A court must make a 
particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 38   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 5 of 16

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.” Id.  
Typically this is done in an in camera proceeding wherein the person asserting the 
privilege is given the opportunity “to substantiate his claims of the privilege and the 
district court is able to consider the questions asked and the documents requested by 
the summons.”  Id.  
Here Epstein has made boilerplate invocation of the Fifth Amendment to each 
and every request propounded by Jane Doe, including for example the request for 
correspondence with federal prosecutors and for production of federal tax returns.  This 
obviously is not a request with Fifth Amendment implications, as the information has 
already been fully disclosed to the Government.   
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the requests or 
provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation with regard to 
each request. 
Epstein’s “cut and paste” response to the request for production also blatantly 
disregards the requirements for invoking privilege under the Court’s local rules.  Local 
rule 26.1.G very specifically requires the preparation of a privilege log with respect to all 
documents and oral communications (among other things) that are withheld on the 
basis of privilege.  Epstein has failed to prepare such a log, making it impossible for 
Jane Doe to effectively challenge his generic assertions.  Indeed, with respect to a few 
requests, Epstein has stated: “Further, the request may include information subject to 
work product or an attorney-client privilege.”  Of course, the whole purpose of forcing a 
defendant to prepare a privilege log is to force the defendant to decide whether or not 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 38   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 6 of 16

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
information is privileged.  An assertion that something “may” be privileged is obviously 
woefully deficient.  The Local Rules do not permit this tactic, and Epstein should be (at a 
minimum) promptly required to produce a privilege log.   
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to provide a privilege log 
and to answer the interrogatories or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth 
Amendment invocation with regard to each request. 
It should be noted that (with minor exceptions) the only grounds on which Epstein 
can refuse to answer the request for production is proof of a valid Fifth Amendment 
privilege.  This the only objection Epstein has asserted (with minor exceptions).  As a 
result, any other objections to production are deemed waived.  See Local Rule 
26.1G.3.(a) (“Any ground [for an objection] not stated in an objection within the time 
provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or any extensions thereof, shall be 
waived.”). 
SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION 
For the convenience of the court – and in compliance with Local Rule 26.1 H 
(party filing motion to compel shall list specific requests in succession) – Jane Doe’s 
requests for production and Epstein’s objections are as follows: 
Request No. 1:  Copies of all telephone records in your or your attorney’s possession 
from 2002 through 2005 that in any way relate to you (including all phone lines owned 
by you or that were used to contact girls for the purposes of scheduling massages for 
you.) 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
Request No. 2:  All massage appointment books, diaries, computer calendars or 
scheduling entities, scheduling books or any other writing or correspondence that 
contains the names of any of the girls that were called, contacted, scheduled or who 
otherwise went to your home located at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, for the 
purpose of giving you a massage. 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must

States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
Request No. 3:  Any and all documentation in your possession that contains Plaintiff’s 
name or that refers to Plaintiff, directly or indirectly, (includes e-mails, letters, message 
pads, diaries, appointment books, computer print outs).   
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective

constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
Request No. 4:  Any and all photos, videos, downloaded digital prints or any other visual 
depiction of Plaintiff, or of any other known or suspected minor females introduced to 
you, directly or indirectly, by Plaintiff.

massage table).

Request No. 7:  All discovery information obtained by you or your attorneys as a result 
of the exchange of discovery in the State criminal case against you or the Federal 
investigation against you. 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to

attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must

the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.  In addition to and without waiving his constitutional 
privileges, the information sought is privileged and confidential, and 
inadmissible to the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, Federal 
Rule of Evidence 410 and 408, and § 90.410, Fla. Stat.1  Further, the 
request may including information subject to work product or an attorney-
client privilege. 
Request No. 8:  All financial documents evidencing asset transfers from 2005 to present 
for you personally or any company or corporation owned by you. 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must

States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
Jane Doe does not intend to use these materials to draw a forbidden inference of guilt from the mere 
fact that information was provided to law enforcement officials as part of plea discussions, but rather for 
other purposes.  These materials are also quite clearly likely to lead to the discovery of other admissible 
evidence, as they relate to the same subject matter as this lawsuit.  To the extent that Epstein relies on 
the non-prosecution agreement, nothing in that agreement bars discovery of information relevant to this 
lawsuit.

Request No. 13:  A photocopy of your passport, including any supplemental pages 
reflecting travel to locations outside the 50 United States between 2002 and 2008, 
including any documents or records regarding plane tickets, hotel receipts, or

circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my

the Constitution. In addition to and without waiving his constitutional 
protections and privileges, the scope of information is so overbroad that it 
seeks information that is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead 
to the discovery of admissible evidence; compiling such information over a 
six year period would be unduly burdensome and time consuming.4

Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United States 
Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these circumstances would 
unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my constitutional rights, would be 
unreasonable, and would therefore violate the Constitution. 
Request No. 15:  All financial statements or affidavits produced by you for any reason, 
to any person, company, entity or corporation since 2005. 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to

the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
Jane Doe believes that Epstein used overseas travel as a means of obtaining underage girls for sexual 
purposes and for avoiding criminal prosecution for such activities.  Also, providing a copy of a passport is 
hardly “burdensome.”  Also, given the fact that Epstein is likely to have used the services of a travel agent 
or another intermediary, it should not be difficult for him to provide evidence of his overseas travels from 
such intermediaries.

CONCLUSION 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the request for 
production, or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation 
with regard to each request.  Epstein should also be required to provide a privilege log.  
Counsel for Jane Doe have conferred with opposing counsel on the issues raised in this 
motion, and no resolution was possible.

PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO PLAINTFF’S 
FIRST REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS TO DEFENDANT  
Plaintiff Jane Doe, hereby moves this Court for an order compelling defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, to answer her first requests for admissions or, in the alternative, to 
prove that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege is proper. 
Jane Doe has propounded 23 requests for admission to Epstein, including such 
straightforward requests as: 
• Your net worth is greater than $1 billion. 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 39   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 4 of 10

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
• You own or control, directly or indirectly, real estate property in foreign 
countries. 
• You are moving significant financial assets overseas, outside of the direct 
territorial reach of the U.S. and Florida Courts. 
• You currently have the ability to post a bond of $15 million to satisfy a 
judgment in this case without financial or other difficulty. 
In response to each and every one of these questions, Epstein has given the 
following response: 
In response, Defendant asserts his U.S. constitutional privileges as 
specified herein.  I intend to respond to all relevant discovery regarding 
this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled me that I cannot 
provide answers to any discovery relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
This Court should order Epstein to answer all of the requests for admission or, in 
the alternative, prove that his Fifth Amendment invocations are valid. It is for the court, 
not the claimant, to determine whether the hazard of incrimination is justified.  United 
States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991).  “A court must make a 
particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the 
questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.” Id.  
Typically this is done in an in camera proceeding wherein the person asserting the 
privilege is given the opportunity “to substantiate his claims of the privilege and the 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 39   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 5 of 10

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
district court is able to consider the questions asked and the documents requested by 
the summons.”  Id.  
Here Epstein has made boilerplate invocation of the Fifth Amendment to each 
and every question propounded by Jane Doe, including for example a request that he 
admit that his net worth is more than $500 million.  It is not apparent how admitting his 
net worth is incriminating in the circumstances of this case.  In any event, the Fifth 
Amendment does not operate in this fashion. It is Epstein’s obligation to explain his 
claims on a “question-by-question basis.”  Id.   
The only issue before the Court is Epstein’s Fifth Amendment privilege.  Epstein 
has only asserted a Fifth Amendment objection to production.  As a result, any other 
objections to production are deemed waived.  See Local Rule 26.1G.3.(a) (“Any ground 
[for an objection] not stated in an objection within the time provided by the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure, or any extensions thereof, shall be waived.”). 
SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION 
For the convenience of the court – and in compliance with Local Rule 26.1 H 
(party filing motion to compel shall list specific requests in succession) – Jane Doe’s 
requests for admission are as follows: 
1.  Your net worth is greater than $10 million. 
2.  Your net worth is greater than $50 million. 
3.  Your net worth is greater than $100 million. 
4.  Your net worth is greater than $500 million. 
5.  Your net worth is greater than $1 billion. 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 39   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 6 of 10

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
6.  Since being incarcerated you have, directly or indirectly (through the services 
or assistance of other persons), conveyed money or assets in an attempt to insulate or 
protect your money or assets from being captured in any civil lawsuits filed against you. 
7.  You own or control, directly or indirectly, real estate property in the Caribbean. 
8. You own or control, directly or indirectly, real estate property in foreign 
countries. 
9.  In the last 2 years you have transferred assets and/or money and/or financial 
instruments to countries outside the United States. 
10.  You have provided financial support to the modeling agency MC2. 
11. You have committed sexual assault against Plaintiff, a minor. 
12.  You committed battery against Plaintiff. 
13.  You digitally penetrated Plaintiff when she was a minor. 
14.  You offered Plaintiff more money contingent upon her having sex with your 
or giving you oral sex. 
15.  You intended to harm Plaintiff when you committed these sexual acts 
against her. 
16.  You knew Plaintiff was under the age of 16 when you sexually touched and 
fondled her. 
17.  You intend to hire investigators to intimidate and harass Plaintiff during this 
litigation. 
18.  You were engaged in the act of trafficking minors across state or country 
borders for the purposes of sex or prostitution between 2000 and the present. 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 39   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 7 of 10

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
19.  You coerced Plaintiff into being a prostitute and remaining in prostitution. 
20.  You are guilty of the following offenses against Jane Doe: 
A.  Procuring a minor for the purpose of prostitution as defined in F.S. 796.03; 
B.  Battery as defined by Florida Statutes. 
C.  Sexual Battery. 
21.  You are moving significant financial assets overseas, outside of the direct 
territorial reach of the U.S. and Florida Courts. 
22.  You are making asset transfers with the intent to defeat any judgment that 
might be entered against you in this or similar cases. 
23.  You currently have the ability to post a bond of $15 million to satisfy a 
judgment in this case without financial or other difficulty. 
CONCLUSION 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the requests 
for admission or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation 
with regard to each request.  Counsel for Jane Doe have conferred with opposing 
counsel on the issues raised in this motion, and no resolution was possible.

PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO PLAINTFF’S FIRST 
SET OF INTERROGATORIES  
Plaintiff Jane Doe, hereby moves this Court for an order compelling defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, to answer her first set of interrogatories or, in the alternative, to prove 
that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege is proper. 
Jane Doe has propounded 23 interrogatories, including such straightforward 
requests as: 
Interrogatory No. 2: Describe financial assets that are under your control, 
directly or indirectly, including interests in corporations or other business entities.   
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 40   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 4 of 20

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Interrogatory No. 3:  Describe which financial assets listed in your answer to 
interrogatory #2 are located outside the 50 states of the United States and where they 
are located. 
Interrogatory No. 4: 
Describe your net worth, including income and 
expenses for 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. 
Interrogatory No. 5: 
Describe any real property in which you have a total 
or partial interest, either directly or indirectly. 
Interrogatory No. 7: 
Describe any transfer of assets under your control, 
either directly or indirectly, to locations outside the 50 United States in 2005, 2006, 2007 
and 2008. 
Interrogatory No. 8:  Describe, with specificity, your travel to locations outside 
the 50 states of the United states in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, including your dates 
of travel, location to which you traveled and persons that accompanied you in each such 
travel.   
Interrogatory No. 11: Have you heard or do you know about any statement or 
remark (verbal or written) made by or on behalf of any party to this lawsuit, other than 
yourself, concerning any issue in this lawsuit? If so, state the name and address of each 
person who heard or read it, and the date, time, place and substance of each statement 
or remark. 
Interrogatory No. 12: Do you intend to elicit testimony of witnesses other than 
Plaintiff regarding any statements she has ever made?  If so, what statements do you 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 40   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 5 of 20

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
intend to produce through testimony?  Through which witness do you intend to elicit 
such statement?  And for what purpose do you intend to admit such statement? 
Interrogatory No. 23: State the facts upon which you rely for each affirmative 
defense in your answer. 
In response to these interrogatories, Epstein has given the following response 
(with only slight variations on the overbreadth objection): 
Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the interrogatories as 
well as his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled 
me that I cannot provide answers to any questions relevant to this lawsuit 
and I must accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to 
effective representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional 
rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed 
by United States Constitution.   Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.  In addition to and without waiving his constitutional 
privileges, Defendant objects as the interrogatory is so overbroad and, 
thus, seeks information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the 
pending action nor does it appear reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence. 
This Court should order Epstein to answer all of these interrogatories or, in the 
alternative, prove that his Fifth Amendment invocations are valid. It is for the court, not 
the claimant, to determine whether the hazard of incrimination is justified.  United States 
v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991).  “A court must make a 
particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the 
questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.” Id.  
Typically this is done in an in camera proceeding wherein the person asserting the 
privilege is given the opportunity “to substantiate his claims of the privilege and the 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 40   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 6 of 20

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
district court is able to consider the questions asked and the documents requested by 
the summons.”  Id.  
Here Epstein has made boilerplate invocation of the Fifth Amendment to each 
and every question propounded by Jane Doe, including for example the question: 
Do you intend to elicit testimony of witnesses other than Plaintiff regarding any 
statements she has ever made?  This obviously is not an interrogatory with Fifth 
Amendment implications.  Nor is Epstein’s claim that this interrogatory is somehow 
“overbroad” or “not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence” even 
facially plausible.   
Epstein’s  “cut and paste” response to the interrogatories also blatantly 
disregards the requirements for invoking privilege under the Court’s local rules.  Local 
rule 26.1.G very specifically requires the preparation of a privilege log with respect to all 
documents and oral communications (among other things) that are withheld on the 
basis of privilege.  Epstein has failed to prepare such a log, making it impossible for 
Jane Doe to effectively challenge his generic assertions.  The Local Rules do not permit 
this tactic, and Epstein should be (at a minimum) promptly required to produce a 
privilege log.   
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the 
interrogatories or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment 
invocation with regard to each request. 
It should be noted that the only two grounds on which Epstein can refuse to 
answer the interrogatories are either proof of a valid Fifth Amendment privilege or proof 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 40   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 7 of 20

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
of a valid overbreadth objection.  These are the only two objections Epstein has 
asserted.  As a result, any other objections to production are deemed waived.  See 
Local Rule 26.1G.3.(a) (“Any ground [for an objection] not stated in an objection within 
the time provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or any extensions thereof, 
shall be waived.”). 
SPECIFIC INTERROGATORIES 
For the convenience of the court – and in compliance with Local Rule 26.1 H 
(party filing motion to compel shall list specific requests in succession) – Jane Doe’s 
interrogatories are as follows: 
1. 
What is the full name and Florida address of the person answering these 
interrogatories, and, if applicable, the person's official position or relationship with 
the party to whom the interrogatories are directed? 
[Note: This is the only interrogatory Epstein answered in any way.] 
2. 
Describe financial assets that are under your control, directly or indirectly, 
including interests in corporations or other business entities. 
Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the interrogatories as 
well as his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled 
me that I cannot provide answers to any questions relevant to this lawsuit

located outside the 50 states of the United States and where they are located.

issues raised in this motion, and no resolution was possible.

DEFENDANT, JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S, NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE 
WITH COURT ORDER (DE #192) 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, by and through his undersigned attorneys, in compliance with 
the Court's Order (DE #192) hereby submits a proposed order on Plaintiffs Motion for 
Protective Order (DE #114), and states: 
1. 
The Court granted the Plaintiffs Motion for an Order for Preservation of 
Evidence, (DE #192). However the Court determined that the Plaintiffs proposed order was 
overly broad and directed that the parties attempt to submit an agreed order. The parties have 
worked diligently to provide an agreed order, and have reached common ground on many 
sections. However, we were unable to finalize an order. 
Therefore, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is providing his proposed order attached as 
Exhibit A. Plaintiffs counsel will be serving their proposed order. 
2. 
Should the Court allow, counsel for the parties are willing to provide the Court a 
brief joint statement setting forth the differences in their proposed order and their respective 
positions. However, neither party, absent this Court's permission believed it was appropriate.

Forensic Child Psychiatric Evaluations, Life Care Plans & Testimony 
DECLARATION OF GILBERT KLIMAN, M. D. 
RE: EXPECTATION OF HARM FROM DISCLOSING THE PLAINTIFFS' IDENTITIES 
IN DOES V JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
1. I, Gilbert W. Kliman, M.D., of2105 Divisadero Street, San Francisco, California, 
CA. Physicians License G55912, declare the following under penalty of perjury: 
2. I have been retained by plaintiffs' law firm, Mermelstein & Horowitz, to give expert 
testimony. If called as a witness, I would testify truthfully and competently concerning 
my psychiatric findings about each of the plaintiffs' alleged experiences of sexual abuse, 
and the enduring effects that I find each of the young women have suffered as a direct 
result of the sexual acts perpetrated by the defendant. 
3. I have been asked to respond to the Defense motion, which requests that some of the 
plaintiffs, who are now adults, should be publicly named. It is my opinion that 
involuntary public disclosure will result in the plaintiffs experiencing revictimization, 
albeit by a justice system that is designed to protect them. If their identities are released, 
the victims will be at-risk of having their personal lives scrutinized by friends, extended 
family, spouses, children, fellow students, employers and fellow employees, the media 
and general public. This type of exposure humiliates many victims and represents another 
betrayal of trust. Public exposure places the plaintiffs at further risk of stigmatization, 
shame and retraurnatization. 
4. Due to traumatization the plaintiffs are arrested in their development, and even those 
who are now legally adults are arrested in part to adolescent aspects of psychology. 
5. The plaintiffs do not hold their heads high with pride for having been sexually 
controlled by Mr. Epstein. They hold their heads low with shame. The internal life of a 
typical adolescent, into late adolescence and early adult years in the best of 
circumstances, usually involves generous proportions of self-consciousness, shame, self-
absorption and self-doubt and self-blame about sexual acts. 
EXHIBIT 
I A 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 2 of 5
6. Clinically harmful levels of shame, self-consciousness, self-doubt and self-blame are 
even more prominent among victims of molestations than among the general population. 
7. Molested teenagers are particularly vulnerable to wrongful manipulations and special 
clinical harms from the experiences of shame and humiliation. In fact, shame and efforts 
to cope with it played an underlying role in the harm to each plaintiff. Each was lured 
into Mr. Epstein's sexual lair with the promise of overcoming bodily and sexual shame 
by earning money and bettering their lot in life. The defendant capitalized on their sexual 
naivete, insecurities and effort to better themselves, and he worked hard to overcome 
their shame at his enlistment of them in his selfish gratifications. 
8. The defendant who wishes to make their identities public is one whom the criminal 
justice system has already determined is a person who has already committed a crime of 
child molestation. That surely means he has already exploited and manipulated the girls' 
state of adolescent sexuality, including their embarrassment, awkwardness and bodily 
self-consciousness. He perverted their nascent and developing moral structures by posing 
as a generous, avuncular mentor who could coach them about their bodies, sex and love. 
The exploitation of adolescent bodies, sex and love is - from a psychoanalytic point of 
view - an influence on the developing moral conscience of the children, as well as on 
their sexual urges. Now the ravaging of their internal and private moral conscience is 
intended by the perpetrator to be made a public ravaging. 
9. Among sexual trauma victims, the insidious and destructive persistence of shame, 
humiliation and associated self-blame is well-documented (Finkelhor and Brown, 1985). 
Stigmatization, as experienced by a sexual trauma victim, has especially painful and 
pathologic consequences. Shame lingers and becomes integrated within the adolescent 
victim's malleable emerging identity, character structure and self image. Moral clarity is 
distorted. Perceptions of self-blame and guilt are magnified. The impact of shame lends 
to cultivating a self image of being "spoiled goods." 
10. Stigmatization following sexual trauma results in long-term risks that can negatively 
shape multiple facets of adult development: sexual, emotional, interpersonal and 
vocational. Stigmatization, which is generally to be avoided among psychiatric patients, 
increases risks among those - as in our plaintiffs as a group - who experience clinical 
depression and self-destructive behaviors: drug use, criminal activity, even prostitution. 
Stigmatization following abuse is associated with delinquency due to increased anger 
and affiliation with deviant peers (Feiring et al., 2007). 
11. Shame and guilt are important dimensions of both complex and single event, 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms of shame are associated with feelings of 
helplessness and powerlessness, which each of the plaintiffs endorsed experiencing in 
relation to Mr. Epstein. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 3 of 5
12. The DSM-IV-TR recognizes both powerlessness and helplessness as requisite parts of 
the traumatic experience in Criterion A for the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder 
trauma (Martin Seligman, recent Past President of the American Psychological 
Association, coined relevant terms of "learned helplessness and "Loss of Personal Locus 
of Control." See Seligman, M.P. 1975: Helplessness, Depression, Development and 
Death. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco). The teenaged girls suffered the loss of personal 
locus of control to a much more experienced, sexually aggressive, powerful and 
dominant, manipulative perpetrator. 
13. Releasing names of the plaintiffs to the public will reenact experiences of 
powerlessness and helplessness in the face of a boundary violation. Repetition and 
reenactment represent central features of Criterion Bin the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of 
posttraumatic stress disorder trauma. In effect, release of their identity and public 
intrusion into their personal life represents a reenactment of the shame of sexual 
traumatization. Repetition and reenactment are central pathologies that afflict sexual 
trauma survivors. 
14. Victims of sexual abuse often rely upon some form of dissociation, splitting or denial, 
as a defensive means to manage overwhelming affects associated with the sexual trauma. 
Each of the plaintiff girls has employed some variation of this defense, both during the 
massages and then subsequently following disclosure of the abuse. Primitive, 
maladaptive responses of this nature will become additionally reinforced as a result of 
public disclosure. 
15. Another aspect of the plaintiffs' experience, which is recognized by DSM-IV-TR, is 
that the trauma was associated with human design factors (such as cruel intention to do 
harm, rape, torture). Trauma of this origin has a tendency to produce more "severe or 
long lasting" posttraumatic stress disorder than natural events (DSM IV TR p. 464). A 
policy of deliberate revelation of the names of the victims would reinforce the sense of 
design, pattern and policy of human intentions. 
16. Negative expectations about significant activities are noted in DSM-IV-TR, as part of 
Criterion C. Symptoms of foreshortened future are characteristic of a traumatized 
individual's clinical course (C4). They expect revictimization. They expect bad outcomes 
(C7) in their social, educational, vocational, relational plans. They are hypervigilant 
(Criterion D4) for further trauma, and this affects lifestyle choices and future planning. 
Hypervigilance is part of the arousal set of criteria. Public disclosure of the victims' 
identity will aggravate existing symptoms ofhypervigilance. 
17. The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic category of "chronic" is justified for each of the 
plaintiffs. Scientific literature shows that the prognostic consequences of PTSD and 
residual effects may last for decades (U.S. Dept. of Health, 2005; Issues in Child Abuse 
Prevention Number 9 Autumn] 998: Long-term Effects of Child Sexual Abuse, Paul E 
Mullen and Jillian Fleming). The lasting impact upon character, identity and moral 
development will probably affect long-term influences upon adult development. It is 
more probable than not that stigmatization associated with public disclosure of the 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 4 of 5
plaintiffs' identities will intensify the scope, nature and severity of the chronic symptom 
course. 
18. In addition to PTSD, shame and humiliation themselves have also been associated 
with causing clinical depression. Coexisting PTSD and clinical depression places the 
plaintiff's at increased risk for re-victimization and high risk sexual behaviors (e.g., 
sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy, rape) (Nelson, 2002), and at greater 
risk to victimize others (Filipas and Ullman, 2006; Desai, Centers for Disease Control, 
2002) who are in their control. Studies have also shown that chronic symptoms of PTSD, 
in association with a single episode of Major Depressive Disorder, can produce lifetime 
adjustment difficulties, which include suicidality (Oquendo et al, 2005; Dube et al, CDC, 
2001; Rohde, J. Am. Acad. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 2005). The plaintiffs will be 
additionally vulnerable to these clinical outcomes, if they suffer the stigmatization and 
humiliation ass_ociated with public disclosure of their identities. 
19. Alternative hypothesis: I have applied the evidence shown from examination and 
testing of the plaintiffs and relevant observations and information from other 
professionals while testing an alternative hypothesis: that no harm would result from 
public disclosure of the plaintiffs' identities. During the evaluations with the six 
plaintiffs, I used generally acceptable criteria for establishing whether a DSM-IV-TR 
disorder occurred. I established that there were provable and diagnosable injuries, 
primarily posttraumatic stress disorder and comorbid depression. Based upon these 
diagnostic signs, it is more probable than not, that exposing the plaintiff's identity to the 
public is not a trivial concern or one without substantial clinical repercussions. I believe 
that most child, adolescent and adult psychiatrists would share the opinion that additional 
psychiatric injury will result from such exposure. 
20. However, consider for the sake of argument, that my diagnostic conclusions are 
incorrect, notwithstanding having fulfilled standard psychiatric evaluation procedures of 
taking a history from multiple sources, videotaping and transcribing my initial interview, 
and reviewing available medical and legal documents. Even if this was the case, and my 
diagnostic conclusions were faulty, I believe that multiple experts, even those who may 
now propose publication of the victims' names, would still come to a conclusion that the 
plaintiff's suffered sexual abuse, and in some cases, multiple acts of ongoing abuse, at the 
hands of Jeffery Epstein. Even without developing a subsequent disorder, there is much 
clinical evidence and scientific literature showing likelihood of substantial psychiatric 
harm to these sexually abused plaintiffs. 
21. To form these conclusions, I have used my extensive experience in forming these 
opinions. That experience is both as a treating child psychiatrist and separately as a 
forensic psychiatrist. I have treated hundreds of minor patients, as well as additionally 
evaluated hundreds of children and adolescents who have suffered sexual abuse. I have 
made long term followups of many of the children and have treated many adults who 
have been molested as adolescents. It is my opinion, with a reasonably high degree of 
medical certainty that the defense motion to allow public disclosure of the plaintiffs' 
identities is clinically and ethically a wrongful plan. The act of revealing their identities 
against their wishes places the plaintiffs at risk, in the best of circumstances, of suffering 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 5 of 5
an aggravation of existing diagnostic concerns. It is more probable than not that releasing 
personal identities will foster an exacerbation and magnification of symptoms lending to 
increased risk of revictimization and retraumatization. 
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the 
foregoing statements are true and correct, and that this declaration was executed at San 
Francisco, California on June 4, 2009.

DECLARATION OF JANE DOE NO. 4 
I, 
, state as follows: 
I am the Plaintiff identified as Jane Doe No. 4 in this lawsuit. 
2. 
During the past week, three investigators working on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein 
contacted the office ofmy former employer, Florida Realty, on three separate occasions. 
3. 
During the contacts, the investigators asked my former employer personal 
questions about me, including whom I am dating and how they can contact my ex-boyfriend. 
The investigators obtained the name of my ex-boyfriend from my former employer and have 
been repeatedly contacting a former co-worker to get the telephone number of my ex-boyfriend. 
Once they obtained the number of my ex-boyfriend, they have repeatedly contact him, asking 
very personal questions about my relationship with him, as well as my current relationship, 
employment, and residence. 
4. 
None of the individuals whom the investigators have contacted or attempted to 
contact knew that I am a plaintiff in a childhood sexual abuse lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein, but 
now they are asking me questions about it. 
5. 
I am worried that J ef:frey Epstein will continue to send investigators to speak with 
people I know who do not know that I am a Plaintiff in this lawsuit. I am concerned that the 
investigators will ask these people very personal questions about my life and disclose that I am a 
Plaintiff in a sexual abuse lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein. It could cause problems in my social 
circle and with my future employment and educational opportunities if people fmd out that I am 
a plaintiff in a childhood sexual abuse suit against Jeffrey Epstein. 
I declare under penalty of perjury the foregoing to be true and correct.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES’  2- 7 MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE  
1. 
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 are proceeding with a Jane Doe pseudonym as this case 
involves facts of the utmost intimacy and there is a genuine risk of psychological harm if their 
identities are disclosed.  
ORDER AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW  
Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-7 (“Plaintiffs” or individually, “Plaintiff”), by and through 
undersigned counsel, hereby file Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order, pursuant to 
S.D.Fla.L.R. 7.1, and state as follows:   
See Exhibit “A” (Declaration of Gilbert Kliman, M.D.) (See also DE 
144, Jane Does’ 2-7 Response to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Identity, et al.).  
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 3 of 8

2. 
Despite the obvious need for Plaintiffs to have their identities protected, 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein has employed investigators who have made repeated contacts with ex-
boyfriends, former employers, and others who know nothing of the underlying facts of the case.  
These investigators have contacted such nonparties asking them for extensive personal 
information about a Plaintiff, such as names and contact information of former boyfriends and 
other friends and acquaintances in the Plaintiff’s community.    
3. 
The Defendant’s repeated contacts with these nonparties is harassing and 
designed to intimidate the Plaintiffs.  The purpose and intent of these contacts is to brand the 
Plaintiffs as alleged sexual abuse victims to their families, friends and communities.  
4. 
A Motion is pending in which this Court is being asked to determine whether and 
how Defendant may obtain discovery from nonparties. (DE 91, 144). Defendant’s investigative 
efforts improperly circumvent the issues in the pending Motion, and only serve to highlight the 
need for this Court to implement appropriate protective measures to prevent Defendant from 
harassing, intimidating, and intruding unnecessarily into the personal lives of the Plaintiffs. 
5. 
While it is not unusual for a defendant to use appropriate means to obtain records 
from former employers and others referenced in a plaintiff’s discovery responses, it is not 
customary for a defendant to retain private investigators to make personal contact with these 
individuals.  Indeed, this practice is particularly inappropriate in a sexual abuse case where these 
nonparties are unaware of the underlying abuse.  Plaintiffs have a well-grounded fear that the 
investigators will use the opportunity of their contacts with these nonparties to “out” the 
Plaintiffs’ as alleged childhood sexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein. (See Kliman Decl., Exh. 
“A” hereto).  
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 4 of 8
--

6. 
As an example of the investigators’ intimidation tactics, three of Defendant’s 
investigators recently called the former employer of Jane Doe 4 on repeated occasions over a 
two-day period, asking personal questions about her, including the name and telephone number 
of her ex-boyfriend.  See
7. 
Similarly, one of Defendant’s investigators contacted the former employer of Jane 
Doe 6.  
 Exhibit “B”, Declaration of Jane Doe 4. 
See
8. 
There is no basis for Defendant or his multiple investigators to make repeated 
personal contacts with former employers and ex-boyfriends to ask personal questions about a 
Plaintiff.  It is apparent that these contacts are not designed to obtain relevant information, but 
rather are intended to intimidate the Plaintiffs and to reveal that they are childhood sexual abuse 
victims. 
 Exhibit “C”, Declaration of Jane Doe 6. 
9. 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs request the entry of a protective order that would prevent 
Defendant, his attorneys and investigators from making ex parte contacts concerning this 
litigation with nonparties who have no knowledge that a Plaintiff was a childhood sexual abuse 
victim of Jeffrey Epstein.   
10. 
This Court has discretion to enter a protective order designed to protect a party 
from, among other things, annoyance or embarrassment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c).  As set forth above, 
given the investigators’ conduct, a protective order is appropriate to prevent unnecessary 
intrusion into the Plaintiffs’ personal lives and divulgation of Plaintiffs in their communities as 
childhood sexual abuse victims.  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7, respectfully request that this Court grant 
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order, as follows: (i) order Defendant, his attorneys and 
investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties identified in plaintiffs’ discovery 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 5 of 8

responses, such as, for example, former employers; (ii) order Defendant, his attorneys and 
investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties found during the course of 
discovery or investigation who know the Plaintiff or live in her community, such as, for example, 
current and former boyfriends and family friends of the Plaintiffs; (iii) order Defendant, his 
attorneys and investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties who otherwise 
know one of the Plaintiffs personally but who are unaware that she is an alleged victim of 
childhood sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein; and (iv) grant all such other relief this Court deems 
just and appropriate.    
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULE 7.1.A.3 
Undersigned counsel has conferred with Defendant’s counsel in a good faith effort to 
resolve the issues raised in this motion, and has been unable to do so, as Defendant’s counsel has 
advised that Defendant opposes this motion.

THIRD PARTY WITNESS, IGOR ZINOVIEW'S, 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LA ,v 
Third Paiiy Witness, Igor Zinoview's, ("Mr. Zinoview") by and through his 
undersigned attorney, moves this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) for a protective 
order regarding his deposition and as grounds therefore would state: 
1. 
As reflected on the affidavit of Igor Zinoview, attached as Exhibit A, he 
works for Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Mr. Epstein") as a driver and bodyguard. He did 
not know Mr. Epstein before November of 2005. He first became employed by Mr. 
Epstein in November of 2005. 
2. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview would testify as set forth on his affidavit, that 
at no time has he discussed with Mr. Epstein any issues involving Mr. Epstein's criminal 
case nor any of the cases or issues involved with civil plaintiffs. 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 55   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 2 of 26
3. 
In many of the depositions, counsel for L.M. and E.W., has asked them as 
witnesses to assume ce1iain facts about which they have no knowledge, and he then asks 
their opinions about certain facts. See Exhibit B ~Epstein's Motion for Protective Order 
to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions. 
4. 
There is no information which Mr. Zinoview has relating to the facts and 
circumstances surrounding any of the pending civil cases, in that none of their allegations 
directed to Mr. Epstein extend beyond September of 2005. 
Therefore whatever 
information Mr. Zinoview may have, postdates that time. 
5. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order (DE #377), "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, it 
is not without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 
1570 (11th Cir. 1992). . .. Cou1is have long held that ' [ w]hile the standard of relevancy 
[in discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear ge1111ane 
on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food & 
Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) (string 
cite omitted)." 
6. 
Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that, "[a] party or 
any person from whomn discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court 
where the action is pending.... The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect 
a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or 
expense, including one or more of the following: (A) forbidding the disclosure or 
discovery;". 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 55   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 3 of 26
7. 
As set forth in his affidavit, Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action. Accordingly, the 
Court should enter a protective order prohibiting his deposition. 
WHEREFORE, third~paity witness moves this comt for a protective order 
pursuant to Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that his deposition not take 
place or the questioning be limited.

____________ ____;/ 
EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER TO 
PROHIBIT INAPPROPRIATE DEPOSITION QUESTIONS 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), pursuant to Rule 1.280(c), Florida 
Rules of Civil Procedure, moves for a protective order to prohibit argumentative, 
harassing and inappropriate questions in depositions, and states: 
1. 
At numerous depositions, Plaintiff's counsel has repeatedly asked 
argumentative and harassing questions that are irrelevant and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
2. 
In particular, Plc;iintiff's counsel has asked questions that improperly 
sought to illicit lay opinions from fact witnesses, asked questions regarding witnesses' 
feelings towards Mr. Epstein and their beliefs regarding media reports of this case, 
asked whether they would leave their children with Mr. Epstein and asked whether they 
would go back to work for Mr. Epstein assuming the media reports were accurate, 
among other things. 
These questions and the responses thereto will never be 
admissible. 
They are argumentative, irrelevant and seek speculative answers and 
inadmissible lay opinions.

Page 2 of 9 
3. 
For example, in the deposition of Larry Visoski, one of Mr. Epstein's pilots, 
Plaintiff's counsel asked the following questions seeking to obtain Mr. Visoski's beliefs 
and opinions on Plaintiff's allegations: 
Q. 
All right. 
When you read in the newspapers 
the 
allegations that Mr. Epstein was involved with 
numerous 
underage girls for sexual reasons, were you surprised? 
A. I didn't believe it. 
Q. Do you believe it today? 
A. I don't believe it. 
Q. You don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was involved with 
underage girls in a sexual way? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: You're asking for my opinion, and I don't 
think my opinion is relevant in that matter. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I think it's relevant. Can you just tell me whether today 
you believe that Jeffrey Epstein has engag.ed in sex with 
underage girls? 
• 
• 
• 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation, irrelevant, always. 
THE WITNESS: It's irrelevant. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. I need an answer. 
A. I don't believe he had sex with underage women. 
Q. Or engaged in any· sexual acts with underage women? 
MR. CRITTON: Form.

Page 3 of 9 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
You think that this ls just a story that a bunch of 
underage women have made up? 
A. 
Speculatlon. 
* * * * 
Q. 
Then we'll handle the question this way: If you were to 
believe based on information and evidence that Mr. Epstein 
engaged in sex or some form of sex acts with people of the 
age range of 12, 13, 14, 15 years old, would you continue 
your employment with Mr. Epstein? 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation. 
THE 
WITNESS: 
I would 
certainly 
speculating 
and I have to discuss it with my wife long and hard. I don't 
think I could give you a correct and honest answer at this 
time. 
See Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Visokski at 66-67; 181-82 (attached as 
composite Exhibit A). Other examples of similar improper questions are included in 
Exhibit A. 
4. 
Not only do these questions seek improper lay opinions, Plaintiff's counsel 
asked Mr. Visoski his belief as to the truth of hearsay newspaper articles. 
The 
foregoing questions are obviously irrelevant, argumentative and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
5. 
Moreover, whether Mr. Visoski would continue working for Mr. Epstein if 
Plaintiff's allegations are true has absolutely no relevance to any claim or defense in this 
case. 
The questions are simply improper and meant to harass and embarrass the

witness. 
6. 
Mr. Visoski was questioned for over four hou'.s and much of the time was 
wasted on irrelevant and harassing questions. 
7. 
Plaintiff's counsel asked similar questions at the deposition of Larry 
Eugene Morrison, another one of Mr. Epstein's pilots: 
Q. 
Certainly you've read certain newspaper articles about 
the allegations, police reports, otherwise, the allegations that 
occurred or have been alleged to have occurred at his Palm 
Beach mansion, correct? 
A. 
Uh-huh. 
Q. 
Correct? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Given the nature of those allegations, would you leave 
your daughter of 17, 16, 15 years old with Mr. Epstein 
alone? 
MR PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. 
* * * * 
Q. 
And despite pleading guilty to procuring underage girls 
for the purposes of sex, you still feel comfortable leaving a 
13, 14, 15-year-old girl around him? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. I mean, with my daughter, yes. I don't know how 
he behaves around anybody else. 
I just know that the 
respect that he showed me, I feel safe with my daughter. 
Q. 
And have you read in detail the reports as to what 
happened at his house with the girls?

Page 5 of 9 
A. 
Only --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
-- what's been in the newspapers and published. 
Q. 
If you read and hear testimony given - well, I can tell 
you now - testimony has been given in this case that what 
happens is: A 13 or 14 year old is led upstairs by herself, 
told to get naked, he lays down on his back, there is a brief 
massage before he turns over, exposes himself erect, 
masturbates while he tells this 13 or 14 year old to pinch his 
nipples as hard as she can while he inserts his fingers into

maintain the airplanes and stuff like that, so. 
§ee Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Eugene Morrison at 135-36; 175-76; 184 
(attached as composite Exhibit B). 
8. 
Again, whether Mr. Morrison would work for Mr. Epstein "considering what 
[he has] read and what [he] may or may not believe" (i.e. considering hearsay media 
accounts and inadmissible lay opinion) has no bearing on the instant case. 
9. 
ln addition, questions regarding whether Mr. Morrison would leave his 
children alone with Mr. Epstein could have only been meant to harass and embarrass 
Mr. Morrison. Nevertheless, Mr. Morrison testified that he would leave his children with 
Mr. Epstein. As Plaintiffs counsel was obviously not happy with the answer to this 
question, he proceeded to press Mr. Morrison with inflammatory statements until he got 
the answer he wanted. 
10. 
Plaintiff's counsel has also asked the same improper line of questions in 
other witnesses' depositions. 
11. 
The above-cited questions exceed the bounds of permissible discovery; 
they have absolutely no relevance to this case. Accordingly, the Court should enter a 
protective order prohibiting such questions and should sanction Plaintiff's counsel if 
such inappropriate questions are asked at future depositions. 
12. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order, 1 "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, lt is not 
The Omnibus Order (DE #377) was entered in the federal companion case Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, 
Case No. 08-CIV-80119 MARRNJOH NSON in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida.

without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 1570 (11th 
Cir. 1992). ... 
Courts have long held that '[w]hile the standard of relevancy [in 
discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear 
germane on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United 
Food & Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) 
(string .cite omitted)." §ee also Capco Properties, LLC v. Monterry Gardens of Pinecrest 
Condo., 982 So. 2d 1211, (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (holding that discovery in civil cases must 
be relevant to the subject matter of the case and must be admissible or reasonably 
calculated to lead to admissible evidence); Morton Plant Hospital Ass'n, lnc. v. 
Shahbas, 960 So. 2d 820, 824 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007) (holding that ''discovery should be 
denied when it has been established that the information requested is neither relevant 
F 
to any pending claim or defense nor will it lead to the discovery of admissible evidence," 
citing Tanchel v. Shoemaker, 928 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006)). 
13. 
As illustrated above, the questions are simply not germane to any pending 
'--.. 
claim or defense nor will they lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Whether 
Mr. Visoski believes or disbelieves the media accounts of this case, or whether Mr. 
Morrison would leave his children with Mr. Epstein is not relevant and cannot 
conceivably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
14. 
The Court should curtail these inappropriate lines of questions and enter a 
protective order prohibiting them. 
15. 
Rule 1.280(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides the Court with 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 55   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 15 of 26

the power to "make any order to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense that justice requires including 
... (4) that certain matter not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be 
limited to certain matters." 
16. 
Accordingly, Epstein requests the Court enter a protective order 
prohibiting Plaintiff's counsel from asking witnesses' questions regarding opinions and 
beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case and whether they would 
leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar nature, and limiting the scope 
to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters relevant to the claims and 
defenses in this case. See Shahbas, 960 So. 2d at 824. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, respectfully requests the Court 
enter a protective order prohibiting Plaintiffs counsel from asking witnesses' questions 
regarding opinions and beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case 
and whether they would leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar 
nature, and limiting the scope to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters 
relevant to the claims and defenses in this case and grant any additional relief the Court 
deems just and proper.

MR. REINHART: Do it at the end, after we get 
him - whatever you want. It's your show. 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. There were --1 don't 
even think Mr. Willits is aware of this. There was 
a subpoena duces tecum for this witness, as well as 
the previous witness, which was another pilot, Dave 
Rogers, and that duces teoum was to bring the 
flight logs related from 1998 through 2005. What 
was produced at the previous deposition were flight 
logs from 2002 through 2005, ancl now Mr. Reinhart 
has agreed to produce the remainder of the flight 
logs requested, those going from 1998 t11rough 2002. 
MR. REINHART; Correct. They're pilot logs, 
not night logs. There are other records we 
indicated are corporate records, and with those you 
have to deal with Mr. Critton. 
MR. CRITTON: However, with the proviso, too,

don't, some of which have been on the airplane and some 
which haven'! - made this up, that Jeffrey Epstein

MR. EDWARDS: Is there a privilege that we're 
asserting? 
MR. REINHART: No, It's irrelevant. It's 
harassment and not likely to lead to discoverable 
evidence. 
'MR. EDWARDS: I'm going·to--put on the record 
right now that it is -- we are allowed discovery 
into a RICO count. We are also allowed discovery 
into the intent of Mr. Epstein In developing a 
criminal enterprise designed to sexually exploit 
and sexually abuse underage girls. We believe that 
in doing so, he associated intentionally with 
people of similar beliefs that sex with underage 
girls is okay, and that there have been rnany

other witnesses with -- to Ins lire his protection 
from law enforcement that they not answer these

REPLY TO ROTHSTEIN ROSENFELDT ADLER'S P.A.'S 
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S EMERGENCY MOTION FOR ORDER 
FOR THE PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE (DE 4051 
(AS TO JANE DOE v. EPSTEIN CASE NO.: 08-CIV- 80893) 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"), by and through his undersigned attorneys, 
hereby files his Reply to Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler P.A.' s ("RRA") Response to 
Defendant's Emergency Motion for Order for the Preservation of Evidence [DE 405], 
and states: 
1. 
It now appears that the Honorable Herbert Stettin ("Mr. Stettin") is the 
sole individual, as the Chief Restructuring Officer, in charge of RRA assets, including 
electronic and paper records. There also appears to be no objection to the entry of the 
preservation order consistent with his fiduciary/trustee duties for RRA, although certain 
documents may no longer exist within his possession. 
2. 
Par. 4 of the response reflects that some 40 plus boxes of documents were 
obtained by the Department of Justice from search warrants served on the offices of 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 2 of 5
RRA; "it is believed that the Department of Justice also sequestered about (13) boxes of 
documents related to this [Epstein] case." In fact there are three Epstein cases which 
have been brought by the RRA firm, one being in federal court, two in state court. Mr. 
Stettin confirms Defendant's belief that there are serious ethical and potentially criminal 
issues that may impact Plaintiffs' ability to pursue their cases. 
3. 
Unfortunately, time is critical with regard to this case in that there are 
deadlines to Disclose Experts and Exchange Reports by October 29, 2009 (but Plaintiff 
has not seen her expert, has no report and only made herself available for the Defendant's 
exam on November 13, 2009), deposition discovery deadline is November 28, 2009 and 
a calendar call of February 19, 2010 for the February 22, 2010 trial docket. While the 
undersigned understands that Mr. Stettin may be working expeditiously to deal with 
critical and pressing needs of stabilizing the firm, a delay of 45 days for his deposition 
(which has been set in the state court case in the 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach 
County, State of Florida, L.M. v. Epstein, Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB, 
not the case sub-judice) will place his deposition sometime during the first 15 days of 
January, after every pre-trial deadline has expired. 
4. 
If in fact there has been inappropriate and/or illegal conduct associated 
with the prosecution of this case by RRA or any of its attorneys or by the Plaintff herself, 
which might result in sanctions, dismissal or other remedy, Defendant Epstein will be 
severely prejudiced. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant Epstein request that the court's preservation order be 
made permanent, which does not seem inconsistent with Mr. Stettin's position as 
expressed by his lawyers but deny the relief sought for delaying the deposition unless the 

Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 3 of 5
court is disposed to modify the current scheduling deadlines and trial date that exist in 
this case.

PLAINTIFF, CAROLYN M. ANDRIANO’S, RESPONSE TO THIRD PARTY WITNESS, 
IGOR ZINOVIEW’S, MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND INCORPORATED 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, Carolyn M. Andriano, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby 
files her Response Third Party Witness, Igor Zinoview’s, Motion For Protective Order 
and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (D.E. 402), and in support thereof states as 
follows: 
1. 
Third party witness, Igor Zinoview, seeks to have this Court enter an order 
preventing his deposition from going forward at all, or, in the alternative, limiting the 
scope of permissible questioning during same.  Mr. Zinoview’s deposition is presently 
scheduled to be taken on December 18, 2009. 
2. 
Mr. Zinoview has been employed by Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” since November of 2005.  See Affidavit of Igor Zinoview 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 61   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 1 of 8

(D.E. 402) dated November 9, 2009.  Mr. Zinoview argues that his deposition should not 
go forward as scheduled because Defendant Epstein has never discussed nor 
attempted to discuss with him “any facts or information related to any legal matters in 
which he [Jeffrey Epstein] is involved.” Id.  From Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion springs 
the bold yet erroneous argument that “Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action.” 
3. 
It should initially be noted that a “complete prohibition of a deposition is an 
extraordinary measure which should be resorted to only in rare occasions.” Jennings v. 
Family Management, 201 F.R.D. 272 (D.D.C. 2001); See also, Salter v. Upjohn Co., 
593 F.2d 649, 651 (5th Circ. 1979)(It is very unusual for trial court to prohibit the taking 
of a deposition altogether, and absent extraordinary circumstances, such order would 
likely be in error.); Inv. Properties Intern., Ltd. v. IOS, Ltd., 459 F.2d. 705, 708 (2d Circ. 
1972)(“an order to vacate a notice of taking deposition is generally regarded as both 
unusual and unfavorable . . . “).  Neither Mr. Zinoview’s conclusory affidavit nor his 
Motion provide anything even approaching the “extraordinary circumstances” necessary 
to justify the entry of order precluding his deposition from going forward at all. 
4. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion that he and Defendant 
Epstein have never discussed any facts or information related to any legal matters that 
Mr. Epstein is involved in does not give rise to requisite “extraordinary circumstances” 
either. Detweiler Bros, Inc. v John Graham and Company, 412 F.Supp. 416 (E.D. Wash, 
1976)(Plaintiff could not properly seek to prohibit defendant from deposing plaintiff’s 
employee via a protective order on grounds that employee had no knowledge of matters 
at issue.) See also, 8 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. §2037, Wright and Miller(“A witness 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 61   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 2 of 8

ordinarily cannot escape examination by denying knowledge of any relevant facts, since 
the party seeking to take the deposition is entitled to test the witness’s lack of 
knowledge.”)  
5. 
The undersigned, as well as counsel for all of the other victims of Jeffrey 
Epstein, are entitled to question and challenge Mr. Zinoview on his purported lack of 
knowledge.  Mr. Zinoview and plaintiffs’ counsel very well might have a difference of 
opinion on what constitutes “facts and information related to any legal matters” in which 
Defendant Epstein is involved.  The victims of Jeffrey Epstein ought not to be forced to 
accept Mr. Zinoview’s opinion as to what constitutes “facts and information related to 
any legal matters” involving Jeffrey Epstein.  Instead, plaintiffs should be able to explore 
these relevant matters directly with Mr. Zinoview, rather than being forced to rely on his 
twenty seven (27) word claim of lacking any knowledge. 
6. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview worked for Defendant Epstein during portions of 
the Palm Beach Police Department’s months’ long investigation which spanned from 
March 15, 2005 through February 2006 into the illegal sexual contact committed by 
Defendant Epstein against these minor plaintiffs.  Accordingly, Mr. Zinoview certainly 
might have direct knowledge about what was going on in and around the Epstein 
residence during the time period in which he was employed by Defendant Epstein as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” while his employer was being investigated by law 
enforcement.  Given the Defendant’s voracious invocation of his Fifth Amendment 
privilege, the plaintiffs have consistently been denied the opportunity to seek any 
relevant information directly from Defendant Epstein himself.  Rather, plaintiffs have 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 61   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 3 of 8

been forced to build their cases against Mr. Epstein by other discovery methods, 
including deposing his employees who may have relevant information.  
7. 
Third party witness Igor Zinoview has failed to meet his very high burden 
of establishing “extraordinary circumstances.”  Mr. Zinoview has failed to demonstrate 
the “good cause” required by Rule 26(c) to protect a person from “annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” to overcome the liberal 
scope of permissible discovery.  The above proposed lines of inquiry of Mr. Zinoview 
are certainly reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  
Accordingly, to the extent that it seeks to preclude his deposition from going forward at 
all, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion should be denied 
8. 
Next, Mr. Zinoview also seeks to prevent questions being posed to him 
wherein he is first asked to “assume certain facts about which he has no knowledge,” 
and then be asked about his “opinions about certain facts.”  First, it remains to be seen 
exactly what facts about which Mr. Zinoview has no knowledge.  Second, Mr. Zinoview’s 
opinions and beliefs about the factual matters surrounding plaintiffs’ claims are relevant 
to exploring any potential bias and prejudice in favor of his employer and against 
Defendant Epstein’s victims.  For example, if Mr. Zinoview believes that these plaintiffs 
are simply inventing their claims against his employer that they were sexually victimized 
by Defendant Epstein while they were minor children, it very well might impact his 
impartiality as a witness.  Third, the undersigned has no present intention of engaging in 
this line of questioning unless the proverbial “door” has been opened by Mr. Zinoview 
first.  Lastly, counsel for Mr. Zinoview is certainly free to invoke the privileges afforded to 
Case 9:09-cv-80656-KAM   Document 61   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 4 of 8

him by the applicable procedural rules should he feel that his client is being asked 
inappropriate questions during the deposition. 
9. 
In conclusion and for the reasons cited above, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion For 
Protective Order should be denied in its entirety. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Carolyn Margaret Andriano, respectfully requests that 
this Court deny Third Party Igor Zinoview’s Motion For Protective Order.
