S.D. OF FLA. -W.P.B. 
UNITED STATES' PETITION TO UNSEAL GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS 
At the direction of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice hereby files this petition 
asking the Court to release grand jury transcripts associated with the grand jury investigations 
described above. 
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a 
memorandum describing an exhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to 
Jeffrey Epstein (the "Memorandum"). 1 The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the 
Department of Justice and Federal Bureau oflnvestigation to determine whether evidence existed 
that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, 
no such evidence was uncovered during the review. 
Since July 6, 2025, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the 
Memorandum's conclusions. While the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau oflnvestigation 
continue to adhere to the conclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American 
public is of the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the 
investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
into Epstein, the Department of Justice petitions the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury 
ht:t17s://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l40700l/dl?inline. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 2 of 6
transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other 
personal identifying information.2 The Department will work with the United States Attorney's 
Offices for Southern District of New York and Southern District of Florida to make appropriate 
redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information prior to 
releasing the transcripts. Transparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation 
under the law to protect victims. 
1. 
On July 2, 2019, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York returned 
an indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See Dkt. No. 2. On August 10, 2019, 
while awaiting trial, Epstein committed suicide in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in New York City. Soon after, the Court dismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52. 
2. 
On June 29, 2020, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York charged 
Epstein's longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking 
and coercion of minors. See United States v. Maxwell, 1 :20-cr-330, Dkt. No. 1 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 
2020). In December 2021, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts. Maxwell was sentenced 
to 240 months' imprisonment and the Second Circuit later affirmed her convictions and sentence. 
See United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2024). 
3. 
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
announced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein's crimes and death. Since 
then, the public's interest in the Epstein matter has remained. Given this longstanding and 
legitimate interest, the government now moves to unseal grand jury transcripts associated with 
Epstein. 
The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States v. Maxwell, 1 :20-cr-330 (S.D.N.Y.), and in 
United States v. Epstein, 1 :19-cr-490 (S.D.N.Y.). 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 3 of 6
4. 
"It is a tradition of law that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain 
secret." In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. 1973). "[T]he tradition of secrecy," however, "is not 
absolute." In re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive, 104 F. Supp. 3d 625, 628 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Although 
Rule 6(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure generally lists the exceptions to grand 
jury secrecy, the Second Circuit has recognized that "there are certain 'special circumstances' in 
which release of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule." In re 
Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 767 (7th 
Cir. 2016) ("Rule 6( e )(3 )(E) does not displace that inherent power. It merely identifies a permissive 
list of situations where that power can be used."). One such "special circumstance" is historical 
interest by the public. In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 105. Under In re Craig, this Court retains discretion 
to determine "whether such an interest outweighs the countervailing interests in privacy and 
secrecy[.]" Id. 
S. 
Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested 
and concerned about the Epstein matter. Indeed, other jurists have released grand jury transcripts 
after concluding that Epstein's case qualifies as a matter of public concern. See Order Granting 
Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Court's February 29, 2024 Order, CA Florida 
Holdings, LLC v. Dave Aronberg and Joseph Abruzzo, 50-2019 CA-014681 (15th Cir. July 1, 
2024).3 After all, Jeffrey Epstein is "the most infamous pedophile in American history." Id. The 
facts surrounding Epstein's case "tell a tale of national disgrace." In re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244, 1247 
(11th Cir. 2021) (discussing the plea agreement secured by Epstein in Florida). The grand jury 
records are thus "critical pieces of an important moment in our nation's history." In re Petition of 
Nat. Sec. Archive, 104 F. Supp. 3d at 629. "The time for the public to guess what they contain 
https://www.mypalm.beachclerk.com/home/showpublisheddocument/4\94/638554423710170000. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 4 of 6
should end." Id. Notably, the privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance are 
substantially diminished due to Epstein's death. Of course, as noted above, the Department of 
Justice will work with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York 
to redact all victim-identifying information prior to any release. 
6. 
The Department of Justice recognizes that this Court is bound by Pitch v. United 
States, 953 F.3d 1226 (11th Cir. 2020) (en bane) (district cmn1s lack inherent, supervisory power 
to authorize the disclosure of grand jury records outside of the exceptions enumerated in Rule 
6(e)(3)). Nevertheless, the Department raises this argument due to the significance of the matter 
and to preserve it for any potential appeal. To the extent this Court maintains that this "petition to 
disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district," Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(G), the Court 
should "transfer the petition to" the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Id. 
The Government is simultaneously filing motions for release of grand jury material in United 
States v. Maxwell, 1 :20-cr-330 (S.D .N. Y. ), and in United States v. Epstein, 1: 19-cr-490 (S .D.N. Y.). 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 5 of 6
7. 
For these reasons, this Court should conclude under In re Craig that Epstein's case 
qualifies as a matter of public interest, release the associated grand jury transcripts, and lift any 
preexisting protective orders. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 105 ("It is ... entirely conceivable that 
in some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury 
information.").

ORDER REQUIRING SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFI t. 
JUL 19 2025 
ANGELA E. NOBLE 
CLERK U.S. DIST. CT. 
S.D. OF FlA. - W.P.B. 
This Cause is before the Court on the United States' Petition to Unseal Grand Jury 
Transcripts (the ''Petition"), filed on July 18, 2025. 
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal 
Procedure 6, the Government requests that the transcripts related to grand jury investigations 05-
(WPB) and 07-103 (WPB) (the "Florida Proceedings") be unsealed "subject to appropriate 
redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information." Pet. at I. Additionally, 
the Government states that "[t]o the extent this Court maintains that this 'petition to disclose arises 
out of a judicial proceeding in another district' ... the Court should 'transfer the petition to'" the 
Southern District of New York. Id. at 4-5 (referencing other petitions filed in United States v. 
Maxwell, No. 1 :20-CR-330 (S.D.N.Y.) and United States v. Epstein, No. 1 :19--490 (S.D.N.Y.)) 
(the "New York Proceedings"). Having reviewed the Petition, the Court requires supplemental 
briefing on two issues. 
The Government's Request to Unseal Grand Jury Documents 
First, the Court requires the Government to clarify its legal position in support of its request 
to unseal the grand jury materials. The rule applicable to the Government's request, Rule 6 of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, "codifies the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy and 
provides a comprehensive framework for determining whether and under what conditions the 
records of grand jury proceedings may be released." Pitch v. United States, 953 F .3d 1226, 1229 
(11th Cir. 2020). This rule of secrecy is subject to exceptions, but in this Circuit, there are only 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 2 of 3
five-that is, there are five, limited exceptions under which a district court may authorize the 
disclosure of grand jury materials. Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E); Pitch, 953 F.3d at 1242. 
It is unclear from the Petition whether the Government is arguing that any of the five 
exceptions applies to its request. On the one hand, the Government acknowledges the governing, 
binding law on this Court, which limits the available grounds for disclosure. Pet.~ 6 (stating that 
the Government "recognize[ s] that this Court is bound by Pitch''). 
On the other hand, the 
Government implies that it may concede that, under governing law, this Court must deny the 
Petition, but the Government nonetheless intends to appeal. Id. (stating that the Government seeks 
to preserve the issue for any potential appeal). 
The Government shall therefore clarify its legal position. In supplemental briefing, the 
Government shall clarify whether: (1) it concedes that this Court must deny the Petition under 
binding Eleventh Circuit precedent, but that it nonetheless seeks an order from this Court 
so that it may file an appeal; or (2) it argues that an exception applies that would permit this 
Court to grant the Government's Petition, together with legal argument in support of the 
same. 
The Government's Request for a Transfer of the Petition to New York 
Second, the Court requires supplemental briefing on the Government's request to transfer 
the Petition. The rule applicable to the Government's request, Rule 6(e)(3)(G) of the Federal Rules 
of Criminal Procedure, mandates that "[i]f the petition to disclose arises out of a judicial 
proceeding in another district, the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court 
unless the petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper." Under this 
Rule, a transfer to another district is only permissible when a proceeding "arises out of a judicial 
proceeding in another district,'' yet the Government's Petition does not identify any facts or law in 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 3 of 3
support of the contention that the Florida Proceedings arose out of the New York Proceedings. 
Because the Florida Proceedings appear to have been initiated many years prior to the New York 
Proceedings, any argument that the Florida Proceedings nonetheless arose out of the New York 
Proceedings must be accompanied with an explanation and with legal argument in support of the 
same. Therefore, in supplemental briefing, the Government shall clarify: (1) whether it is the 
Government's position that the Petition is eligible for transfer to the New York Proceedings; 
(2) the legal basis under which the transfer is proper under Rule 6(3)(G); and (3) specifically 
how the materials, Petition, or Florida Proceedings arose out of the New York Proceedings. 
Alternatively, if, under applicable law, there is no legal basis to transfer the Petition, the 
Government should clearly state the same. 
It is hereby ORDERED that the Government must file a supplemental brief addressing the 
above-described issues. The Government's brief shall not exceed ten pages and shall be submitted 
by no later than 3 p.m. on Sunday, July 20, 2025. 
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, West Palm Beach, Florida, this 19th day of July,

CLERK U.S. DIST. CT. 
S.O. OF FLA, - W.P.B. 
UNITED STATES' RESPONSE TO ORDER ON SUPPLEMENTAL BREIFING 
Consistent with the Court's July 19, 2025 order, the United States files this supplemental 
brief addressing (I) the government's request to transfer this petition to the Southern District of 
New York; and (2) the government's request to unseal grand jury documents. 
A. 
The Court Should Transfer this Petition to the Southern District of New York 
In response to the second set of questions posed in the July 19, 2025 Order, the government 
responds as fol lows: (I) this petition is eligible for transfer to the Southern District of New York; 
(2) Rule 6(e)(3)(G) permits the transfer since the only judicial proceedings were in the Southern 
District of New York and not in the Southern District of Florida; and (3) this petition to disclose 
arose out of the highly-publicized indictment of Jeffrey Epstein and subsequent federal criminal 
trial of Ghislaine Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. Further, this petition is ancillary 
to the New York Proceedings seeking the same relief. 
The petition is eligible for transfer to the Southern District of New York under Rule 
6(e)(3)(G), which states the following: 
(G) If the petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district, 
the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court unless the petitioned 
court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper. If the petitioned court 
decides to transfer, it must send to the transferee court the material sought to be 
disclosed, iffeasible, and a written evaluation of the need for continued grand-jury 
secrecy. The transferee court must afford those persons identified in Rule 6(e)(3)(F) 
a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 2 of 14
Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(G) (emphasis added). 
This Petition to Disclose (filed on July 18, 2025) arises out of two highly publicizedjudicial 
proceedings in the Southern District of New York: the indictment and criminal prosecution of 
Jeffrey Epstein, United States v. Epstein, I: I 9-CR-490 (S.D.N.Y.), and the subsequent federal 
criminal indictment, trial, and conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell in the Southern District of New 
York, United States v. Maxwell, I :20-CR-330 (S.D.N.Y.). Indeed, the relief sought in this petition 
is ancillary to the relief sought in those cases. Motions seeking identical relief were 
contemporaneously filed in the Southern District of New York on July 18, 2025. 1 Rule 6(e)(3)(i) 
requires that this petition "must be filed in the district where the grand jury convened." As a result, 
this petition was also filed in this Court. 
The only judicial proceedings are in the Southern District of New York. In the July 19, 
2025 Order Requiring Supplemental Briefing, the Court defined the Southern District of Florida 
('·SDFL") grand jury proceedings as the "Florida Proceedings,'' and United States v. Maxwell, No. 
I :20-CR-330 (S.D.N.Y.) and United States v. Epstein, No. I: I 9-CR-490 (S.D.N.Y.) as the "New 
York Proceedings.'' But the "Florida Proceedings" were not judicial proceedings-they were grand 
jury proceedings. To that point, the Eleventh Circuit in Pitch distinguished between grand jury and 
judicial proceedings: "The grand jury is by design an institution independent from the Judicial 
Branch. Accordingly, the district court neither presides over the grand jury nor monitors its 
proceedings. In fact, Rule 6 does not permit the district judge to be present in the grand jury room 
at all." Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir. 2020) (en bane) (cleaned up); see 
also Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(d). 
Copies of those motions are attached hereto as Exhibits I and 2. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 3 of 14
Because the only judicial proceedings giving rise to this petition are located in the Southern 
District of New York, "the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court unless the 
petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper." Fed. R. Crim. P. 
6(e)(3)(G). The underlying matters have been litigated in the Southern District of New York, but 
no similar action exists in the Southern District of Florida. The Southern District of New York can 
better assess the need for the release of transcripts resulting from those historic cases and the scope 
of necessary redactions based upon information already disseminated through the trial and public 
docket. Cf Douglas Oil Co. of Ca. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211,212 (1979) ("[T]he better 
practice would have been for the [petitioned] Court, after making a written evaluation of the need 
for continued grand jury secrecy and a determination that the limited evidence before it showed 
that disclosure might be appropriate, to send the requested materials to the [] Court where the civil 
cases were pending."); Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(G) ("If the petitioned court decides to transfer, it 
must send to the transferee court the material sought to be disclosed, if feasible, and a written 
evaluation of the need for continued grand-jury secrecy.''). Judicial efficiency counsels in favor of 
transferring this petition to the Southern District of New York so that one court may consider all 
the related materials and issue consistent rulings. 
B. 
This Investigation Constitutes a Special Circumstance Justifying Disclosure 
Consistent with its petition, the government recognizes that Eleventh Circuit precedent 
holds that no exception outside those expressly enumerated under Criminal Rule 6(e)(3) authorizes 
a court to publicly disclose grand jury materials. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, I 229 
( I Ith Cir. 2020) ( en bane). The government also recognizes that, in this circuit, only an en bane 
decision or the Supreme Court may overrule that decision. See generally Scott v. United States, 
890 F.3d 1239. 1257 (discussing prior-panel-precedent rule). 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 4 of 14
That said, decisions from other circuits support public disclosure of grand jury materials 
under "special circumstances," including when a matter possesses historical interest by the public. 
See In re Biaggi. 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. 1973) (affirming release of grand jury witness 
testimony based on the "special circumstances" of the case); In re Craig, 13 I F.3d 99, I 02 (2d Cir. 
1997) ("[W]e hold today that there is nothing ... that prohibits historical interest, on its own, from 
justifying release of grand-jury material in an appropriate case."); Carlson v. United States, 837 
F.3d 753, 766-67 (7th Cir. 2016) ("While [the court's] inherent supervisory authority is limited to 
'preserving or enhancing the traditional functioning' of the grand jury, that includes the power to 
unseal grand jury materials in circumstances not addressed by Rule 6( e )(3 )(E). ") ( cleaned up). 
The Second Circuit's decision in In re Biaggi demonstrates that public interest in an 
investigation might constitute a special circumstance justifying public disclosure. There, the 
district court ordered the public disclosure of a political candidate's grand jury testimony given 
less than two years earlier. In re Biaggi, 4 78 F.2d at 490. The events preceding the district court's 
order included press coverage on how the candidate allegedly responded to questions during his 
testimony. See id. at 490-91. That coverage eventually led to a television broadcast during which 
the candidate announced that he would request to have his testimony reviewed by the court to 
determine whether he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to questions about his 
personal finances and assets. Id. at 491. Contrary to that more limited request, the U.S. Attorney 
moved for disclosure of all the candidate's testimony, which the district court ultimately ordered. 
Id. at 49 I. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court's order because the candidate's more 
limited request "was framed .. . in such a manner as to create a false impression in light of the 
publicity that had given rise to it." Id. at 494. Thus, the Second Circuit concluded that the district 
court did not abuse its discretion considering the "special circumstances" of the case. See id. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 5 of 14
Similar to the U.S. Attorney's request in In re Biaggi, the governmenfs position here is 
that the public's strong interest in this historical investigation into Jeffrey Epstein constitutes a 
special circumstance justifying the public disclosure of grand jury materials. The public's interest 
in this investigation persists despite the findings from the Department of Justice and Federal 
Bureau of Investigation discussed in the July 5, 2025 memorandum. Given the historical public 
interest in this investigation, public disclosure of grand jury materials is justified under the special 
circumstances of this case. To the extent this Court's decision is preordained by Pitch, the 
government preserves its right to appeal that decision and rely on decisions from the Second and 
Seventh Circuit for support. 
Finally. many of the rationales supporting grand jury secrecy under Rule 6(e) no longer 
apply to this investigation because of Jeffrey Epstein's death. With this grandjury investigation no 
longer pending, concerns over the defendant's flight or obstruction or possible collusion among 
grand jury witnesses no longer apply. Therefore, the stasis of this investigation further justifies 
public disclosure of grand jury transcripts. See In re Pub. First Law Ctr., No. I :24-mc-00215-
TMB-NC, 2024 WL 1885724. at *6 (D. Haw. Apr. 29, 2024) ("[O]ther courts have noted that the 
policy rationale to preserve grand jury secrecy is less obvious after the grand jury proceedings 
have ended because the primary reasons for grand jury secrecy, namely to 'prevent flight, protect 
the jurors, and protect witnesses from being pressured,' are generally less applicable.") (footnote 
omitted). 
C. 
Conclusion 
This Court should transfer this petition to the Southern District of New York because this 
matter arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district under Rule 6(G). Alternatively. this 
Court should grant the government's petition and order the release of grand jury transcripts from 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 6 of 14

UNITED STATES' MOTION TO UNSEAL GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS 
At the direction of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice hereby moves the Court 
to release grand jury transcripts associated with the above-referenced indictment. 
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a 
memorandum describing an exhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to 
Jeffrey Epstein (the "Memorandum''). 1 The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the 
Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether evidence existed 
that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, 
no such evidence was uncovered during the review. 
Since July 6, 2025. there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the 
Memorandum ·s conclusions. While the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
continue to adhere to the conclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American 
public is of the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the 
investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
into Epstein. the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury

transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other 
personal identifying infonnation. 2 The Department will work with the United States Attorney's 
Office for Southern District of New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related 
information and other personal identifying information prior to releasing the transcripts. 
Transparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation under the law to protect 
victims.

On July 2, 2019, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York returned 
an indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See Dkt. No. 2. On August 10, 2019, 
while awaiting trial, Epstein committed suicide in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in New York City. Soon after, the Court dismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52. 
2. 
On June 29, 2020, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York charged 
Epstein's longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking 
and coercion of minors. See United States v. Maxwell, 1 :20-cr-330, Dkt. No. I (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 
2020). In December 2021, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts. Maxwell was sentenced 
to 240 months· imprisonment, and the Second Circuit later affirmed her convictions and sentence. 
See United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2024).

On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation 
announced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein's crimes and death. Since 
then, the public's interest in the Epstein matter has remained. Given this longstanding and 
legitimate interest, the government now moves to unseal grand jury transcripts associated with 
Epstein. 
The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States\'. ,\la.me//, 1 :20-cr-330 (S.D.N.Y.), and in the

Rule 6(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure generally lists the exceptions to grand

to determine ··whether such an interest outweighs the countervailing interests in privacy and 
secrecy[.]" Id.

Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested

ORDER DENYING PETITION TO UNSEAL GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS 
The matter before the Court is the United States' request to unseal grand jury transcripts 
stemming from the Government's investigation into Mr. Jeffrey Epstein in the Southern District 
of Florida. For the reasons set forth below, Eleventh Circuit law does not permit this Court to grant 
the Government's request; the Court's hands are tied-a point that the Government concedes. 
The Government initiated the matter before the Court by filing the United States' Petition 
to Unseal Grand Jury Transcripts on July 18, 2025, and the Government's Response to the Court's 
Order on Supplemental Briefing (hereinafter "Supp. Br.") on July 20, 2025 (together, the 
"Petition"). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6, the Government requests that the 
transcripts related to grand jury investigations 05-02 (WPB) and 07-103 (WPB) (the "Florida 
Federal Grand Jury Proceedings") be unsealed "subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related 
and other personal identifying information." Pet. at I. Additionally, the Government states that 
"[t]o the extent this Court maintains that this 'petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding 
in another district' ... the Court should 'transfer the petition to"' the Southern District of New 
York. Id. at 4-5 (referencing other petitions filed in United States v. Maxwell, No. 1 :20-CR-330 
(S.D.N.Y.) and United States v. Epstein, No. 1: 19-490 (S.D.N.Y.)) (the "New York Federal 
Proceedings").

I. 
BACKGROUND 
The Government's Petition seeks to unseal transcripts from the Florida Federal Grand Jury 
Proceedings-grand jury investigations into Mr. Epstein. The federal grand juries were convened 
in West Palm Beach in 2005 and 2007. 
Simultaneously with its filing of the instant Petition, the Government also filed parallel 
petitions to unseal transcripts in the Southern District of New York ("SONY"), which pertain to 
the 2019 and 2020 SONY federal grand jury investigations. The 2019 SONY grand jury returned 
an indictment charging Mr. Epstein with crimes including sex trafficking offenses. Pet. 1 I. The 
indictment was dismissed after Mr. Epstein committed suicide while awaiting trial. Id. The 2020 
SONY grand jury charged Mr. Epstein's "longtime confidant, Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell," with 
offenses related to the sex trafficking and coercion of minors. Id. 12; Maxwell, 1 :20-CR-330, 0kt. 
No. 1. After a conviction and sentencing in her case, Ms. Maxwell's sentence was affirmed by the 
Second Circuit. United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2024). 
On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation issued a memorandum "describing an exhaustive review undertaken of investigative 
holdings related to" Mr. Epstein. Pet. at 1. The DOJ memorandum concluded that no evidence was 
uncovered "that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties." Id. Since the 
issuance of the DOJ memorandum, "there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the 
[m]emorandum's conclusions." Id. Because "[p]ublic officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary 
citizens remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein matter," the Government 
petitioned to unseal the relevant grand jury transcripts-including the Florida transcripts at issue 
in the pending Petition in this District. Id.

II. 
DISCUSSION 
The Petition contains two requests for relief: (I) a request to disclose evidence; and (2) a 
request to transfer the Petition to the Southern District of New York. Both requests are denied for 
the reasons stated below. 
1. 
The Government's Request to Disclose Evidence 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) governs the disclosure of grand jury proceedings. 
The Rule emphasizes a presumption of secrecy and mandates that, generally, "[ u ]nless the rules 
provide otherwise[,]" participants in the proceeding ''must not disclose a matter occurring before 
the grand jury." Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(8). Rule 6(e)(3) enumerates several specific exceptions 
to the general rule of nondisclosure. For example, the Rule provides that "a government attorney 
may, without prior court approval, disclose grand jury records to other government attorneys or 
officials for use in performing the attorneys' duties, or to other grand juries for the purpose of 
conducting criminal or intelligence investigations." Pitch v. United States, 953 F .3d 1226, 1234 
(I Ith Cir. 2020) (en bane) (citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(A)-(D)), cert. denied, -- U.S.--, 141 S. 
Ct. 624 (2020) (citation modified). The Rule also provides exceptions where a district court may 
allow for disclosure of grand jury materials and states that a "court may authorize disclosure-at 
a time, in a manner, and subject to any other conditions that it directs-of a grand-jury matter" 
(I) "preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding"; (2) "at the request of a defendant 
who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred 
before the grand jury"; or (3) at the request of the government for use in a foreign, state, tribal, or 
military criminal investigation. Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i)-(v). 
The Government's Petition to unseal the grand jury transcripts is not based on any of the 
exceptions in Rule 6. Instead, the Government makes two arguments outside Rule 6. First, the 
Government argues that disclosure is proper because "many of the rationales supporting grand jury 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 4 of 12
secrecy under Rule 6(e) no longer apply to this investigation because of Jeffery Epstein's death." 
Supp. Br. at 5. It further argues that "the public's strong interest in th[e] historical investigation 
into Jeffrey Epstein constitutes a special circumstance justifying public disclosure." Id. (citation 
modified). Notably, the Government's requested exception is recognized only in the Second and 
Seventh Circuits. In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. 1973) (affirming release of grand jury 
witness testimony based on the "special circumstances'' of the case); In re Craig, 131 F .3d 99, 102 
(2d Cir. 1997) ("[W]e hold today that there is nothing ... that prohibits historical interest, on its 
own, from justifying release of grand-jury material in an appropriate case."); Carlson v. United 
States, 837 F.3d 753, 766-67 (7th Cir. 2016) (holding that a district court's inherent authority 
"includes the power to unseal grand jury materials in circumstances not addressed by 
Rule( e )(3 )(E)"). 
Contrary to the Government's stated basis and the Second and Seventh Circuits, 1 the 
Eleventh Circuit has directly held that a district court "do[ es] not possess the ... power to order 
the release of grand jury records in instances not covered by" Rule 6(e)(3)(E). 2 Pitch, 953 F.3d at 
1241. "District courts may only authorize the disclosure of grand jury materials if one of the five 
A district court is bound by the decisions of its intermediate appellate court. That is, this Court, the Southern District 
of Florida, is bound by the decisions of the Eleventh Circuit of Appeals. The Southern District ofNew York is bound 
by the decisions of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. As discussed above, the Eleventh and Second Circuits have 
differing decisions regarding a district court's authority to disclose materials under Rule 6. Cf United States v. 
Maxwell, No. I :20-CR-330, Dkt. No. 789, 1-2 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2025) (requiring supplemental briefing on a "special 
circumstances" exception to Rule 6 recognized in the Second Circuit); United States v. Epstein, No. 1: 19-490, Dkt. 
No. 63, 1-2 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2025)(same). 
Before 2020, Eleventh Circuit case law held that •·a [district] court's power to order disclosure of grand jury records 
is not strictly confined to instances spelled out in" Rule 6. In re Petition to Inspect & Copy Grand Jury Materials, 735 
F.2d 126 I ( I Ith Cir. 1984 ). The Eleventh Circuit's en bane decision in Pitch, however, specifically overruled that 
decision. Pitch, 953 F.3d at 1229 ("We now hold that Rule 6(e) is exhaustive, and that district courts do not possess 
inherent, supervisory power to authorize the disclosure of grand jury records outside of Rule 6(e)(3)'s enumerated 
exceptions. We therefore overrule our holding in Hastings to the contrary."). And because Pitch was decided by an 
en bane panel of the Eleventh Circuit, it is the definitive law in this circuit. See Scott v. United States, 890 F.3d 1239, 
1257 (11th Cir.2018) ("The prior-panel-precedent rule requires subsequent panels of the court to follow the precedent 
of the first panel to address the relevant issue, 'unless and until the first panel's holding is overruled by the Court 
sitting en bane or by the Supreme Court."'). 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 5 of 12
exceptions listed in Rule 6(e)(3)(E) applies." Id.; accord McKeever v. Barr, 920 F.3d 842, 850 
(D.C. Cir. 2019) ("[A] district court has no authority outside Rule 6(e) to disclose grand jury 
matter[s]."); United States v. McDougal, 559 F.3d 837, 840 (8th Cir. 2009) ("[C]ourts will not 
order disclosure absent a recognized exception to Rule 6(e) or a valid challenge to the original 
sealing order or its implementation."); In re Grand Jury89-4-72, 932 F.2d 481,488 (6th Cir. 1991) 
("[A court] cannot, and must not, breach grand jury secrecy for any purpose other than those 
embodied by [Rule 6]."). 
The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that the drafters of Rule 6 "permitted deviations from the 
general rule of secrecy only when the 'rules provide otherwise'-not when the court provides 
otherwise." Pitch, 953 F.3d at 1235 (citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)) (emphasis in original). That 
"intentional choice" by the drafters highlights their "understanding that disclosure should be 
limited to the text of Rule 6(e).'' Id. To hold otherwise would have been to "render the detailed list 
of exceptions to Rule 6(e)(2) merely precatory." Id. at 1236; see also Andrus v. Glover Constr. 
Co., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (I 980) ("Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to 
a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a 
contrary legislative intent."). Accordingly, Pitch held that "Rule 6(e) is exhaustive, and that district 
courts do not possess ... power to authorize the disclosure of grand jury records outside of Rule 
6( e)(3)'s enumerated exceptions." 953 F .3d at 1229. 
The Government does not assert that disclosure is appropriate under any exception in Rule 
6( e )(3 )(E). Instead, it argues that special circumstances exist and that the po I icy reasons for grand 
jury secrecy have expired. However, the Government's stated rationale are not exceptions in Rule 
6. The Court cannot grant a request for disclosure unless one of the five exceptions in Rule 
6(e)(3)(E) applies. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 6 of 12
The Government concedes as much in its Petition. It acknowledges that the "Department 
of Justice recognizes that this Court is bound by Pitch'' and that it "raises this argument due to the 
significance of the matter and to preserve it for any potential appeal." Pet.~ 6. In its Supplemental 
Briefing, the Government further recognizes that "Eleventh Circuit precedent holds that no 
exception outside those expressly enumerated under" Rule 6 "authorizes a court to publicly 
disclose grand jury materials." Supp. Br. at 3. Finally, the Government acknowledges that this 
Court cannot contravene binding Eleventh Circuit case law. Id. ("The [G]ovemment also 
recognizes that, in this circuit, only an en bane decision or the Supreme Court may overrule that 
decision."). Consistent with Pitch and the Government's concessions, the request to disclose is 
denied. 
2. 
The Government's Request for Transfer to the Southern District of New York 
The Court denies the Government's request for transfer for two reasons. The Court 
concludes that the Government must argue a potentially valid exception for the Court to consider 
a request for transfer of the Petition to another district, which the Government has not done. The 
Court also concludes that, in the alternative, the applicable standard for a transfer of the Petition 
to another district is not met in this case. 
a) The Petition is Not Eligible for Transfer Under Rule 6(e)(3)(G) 
The Government argues that its Petition is eligible for transfer to the New York Federal 
Proceedings under Rule 6(e)(3)(G), which states that "[i]f the petition to disclose arises out of a 
judicial proceeding in another district, the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other 
court unless the petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper." Supp. 
Br. at 1. Transfer is proper here, the Government argues, because the Florida Federal Grand Jury 
Proceedings were merely grand jury investigations, whereas the New York Federal Proceedings 
resulted in an indictment and a criminal proceeding. Id. at 2-3. Therefore, the Government argues, 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 7 of 12
"[t]he Southern District of New York can better assess the need for the release of transcripts 
resulting from those historic cases and the scope of necessary redactions based upon information 
already disseminated through the trial and public docket." Id. 
Based on the Court's review of Rule 6(e)(3)(G), the Government cannot invoke Rule 6 
because it has not accompanied its request to transfer with an argument for a legally permissible 
disclosure exception. Stated differently, the Government must first argue that there is a valid 
ground to request a Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) disclosure-disclosure authorized preliminarily to or in 
connection with a judicial proceeding. The Court reaches this conclusion based upon Rule 6(e)(3), 
the advisory committee notes, and the Supreme Court case that resulted in Rule 6(e)(3)(G). 
The 1983 Advisory Committee Note explains that a potential Rule 6(e)(3)(G) transfer "is 
currently governed by Douglas Oil and the authorities cited therein, and is best left to elaboration 
by future case law." Turning to Douglas Oil Co. of California v. Petrol Stops Northwest, the 
Supreme Court set forth the test for when a district court may authorize disclosure of grand jury 
transcripts "preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding": 
Parties seeking grand jury transcripts under Rule 6(e) must show [1] that the 
material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial 
proceeding, [2] that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued 
secrecy, and that [3] their request is structured to cover only material so needed. 
441 U.S. 211, 222 (1979). The Supreme Court noted, however, that it can be difficult for the 
petitioned court 3 to conduct the Douglas Oil balancing test because the petitioned court lacks 
special knowledge about the related judicial proceeding. Id. at 229-30. Therefore, the Supreme 
Court explained that the "better practice'' in this circumstance would be for the petitioned court to 
conduct a written evaluation of the need for continued grand jury secrecy and then transfer the 
Pursuant to Rule 6(e)(3)(F), "[a] petition to disclose a grand-jury matter under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) must be filed in the 
district where the grand jury convened." 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 8 of 12
petition, requested materials, and evaluation to the court presiding over the related judicial 
proceeding. Id. at 230-31. The Supreme Court reasoned that the court overseeing the related 
judicial proceeding would have the required "special knowledge" of the underlying litigation and 
could therefore best "consider[] the requests for disclosure in light of the [transferring] court's 
evaluation of the need for continued grand jury secrecy." Id. at 231. 
This "better practice" articulated by the Supreme Court was codified in the current Rule 
6(e)(3)(G) governing transfer. Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 advisory committee's note to 1983 amendment; 
United States v. Lischewski, No. 18-CR-00203-EMC-1, 2023 WL 2600451, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 
22, 2023). The 1983 Committee Note highlights the connection between Rules 6(e)(3)(E)(i) and 
6(e)(3)(G), stating that "[u]nder the first sentence in new subdivision (e)(3)(E), the petitioner or 
any intervenor might seek to have the matter transferred to the federal district court where the 
judicial proceeding giving rise to the petition is pending." 
The Court reads Rule 6(e)(3)(G) to require a Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception-that is, transfer 
of a petition to disclose made "preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding." See 
Fed. Grand Jury§ 18: 10 (2d ed.) ("Rules 6(e)(3)(F) and 6(e)(3)(G) combine to create a procedure 
that must be followed when seeking disclosure under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i), i.e., for use preliminary 
to or in connection with a judicial proceeding."); see also In re Grand Jury Investigation, No. l 8-
GJ-00008 (BAH), 2019 WL 13160140, at *3 (D.D.C. Oct. 30, 2019) (discussing the Rule 
(6)(e)(3)(G) transfer provision in the context of the Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception). 
The Government indirectly acknowledges the need for its transfer request to be 
accompanied with a Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception because it relies upon the language of Rule 
6(e)(3)(F) as a basis for filing the Petition in this District. Supp. Br. at 2; Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e)(3)(F). 
Pursuant to its text, Rule 6(e)(3)(F) applies only when there is a basis for disclosure under Rule 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 9 of 12
6(e)(3)(E)(i), yet no argument exists in the Petition in support of a Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception. 
Instead, the Government's arguments concern only the public-interest-focused special 
circumstances justifying disclosure-circumstances not addressed in Rule 6( e )(3 )(E). 
Because the Government does not seek disclosure under the Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) exception, 
and because the Government provides no argument as to why that exception should apply, the 
Government's request to transfer the Petition to the Southern District of New York pursuant to 
Rule 6(e)(3)(G) is denied. 
b) The Legal Standard for a Rule 6(e)(3)(G) Transfer is Not Met 
In the alternative, even if the Government made an argument for an exception under Rule 
6(e)(3)(E) that is recognized in this Circuit such that the Government could potentially seek a 
transfer under Rule 6(e)(3)(G), which the Government has not, Rule 6(e)(3)(G) states: " If the 
petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district, the petitioned court 
must transfer the petition to the other court unless the petitioned court can reasonably 
determine whether disclosure is proper." (emphasis added). The Government's request does not 
meet either standard. 
Arising Out of a Judicial Proceeding 
The Government's request for transfer does not arise out of a judicial proceeding; the 
Government does not seek the disclosure of evidence for itself. Indeed, the Government provided 
the evidence sought to be unsealed with the Petition. Consistent with the fact that the Government 
does not need the evidence, it has not filed the Petition for the purpose of prosecuting4 the New 
York Federal Proceedings-the trial-level proceedings concluded years ago. Similarly, the 
The evidence is similarly not sought for the purpose of aiding a party's defense in the New York Federal Proceedings. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 10 of 12
Government has not filed the Petition because unsealing the evidence is necessary for the proper 
litigation of the New York Federal Proceedings. 
Instead, the specifics of the New York Federal Proceedings are absent from the Petition. 5 
This lack of information and discussion stands in stark contrast to cases where courts grant Rule 
6(e)(3)(G) requests for transfer. For example, in Lischewski, plaintiffs in an MDL asked a district 
court to unseal grand jury transcripts. 2023 WL 2600451, at * 1. Both the litigants and the court 
engaged in extensive discussion and analysis of the state of the litigation of the MDL, and how the 
transcripts would be used in the MDL. Id. at *1-*3. Because the district court had doubt about its 
ability to understand all of the nuances and history of the MDL, the district court transferred the 
petition to the MDL. Id. at *8. 
At the root of cases such as Lischewski is the commonsense question to the movant: "Why 
do you need the evidence?" Based upon the answer, courts question whether they know enough 
about the destination court proceedings to rule. See Douglas Oil, 441 U.S. at 228. But in this 
Petition, the Government's request is not to assist with litigation in the New York Federal 
Proceedings. The Government wants the Petition to be granted so that it can release evidence to 
the public at large. The need to disclose renders the New York Federal Proceedings irrelevant. 
Such a circumstance strongly suggests that the Petition does not arise from the New York Federal 
Proceedings. 
Further, the text of the Petition sources the need for the Petition in the Government's recent 
public memorandum summarizing its investigation into Mr. Epstein. Pet. at 1 ("[T]he Department 
of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a memorandum describing an internal review 
The Government's briefing on the status of the New York Federal Proceedings is limited to informing the Court that 
it has filed what are almost identical petitions in the Southern District of New York. 

Case 9:25-mc-80920-RLR   Document 4   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2025   Page 11 of 12
of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein.'"). Because that memorandum resulted in great 
public interest, the Government filed the instant Petition. Id. ("[T]here has been extensive public 
interest in the basis for the Memorandum's conclusions."). As such, the request to unseal arises 
from the Government's internal investigation, from its public statements about that investigation, 
and from great public interest in the investigation, but it does not arise from the New York Federal 
Proceedings themselves. The Government has not filed the Petition in response to a pleading, 
objection, strategy, or ruling in the New York Federal Proceedings, and it does not state that it will 
use the unsealed evidence in furtherance of any case-related objective-the trial proceedings have 
concluded. 
Whether the Court Can Determine if Disclosure is Proper 
This Court may transfer the Petition to another district only if it is unable to reasonably 
determine whether disclosure is proper. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e)(3)(G). By way of an example 
discussed above, the Lischewski court transferred a petition to unseal to an MDL because the 
Lischewski court was uncertain it could appreciate all of the nuances and history of the MDL. In 
contrast to cases such as Lischewski, this Court has already determined that the disclosure sought 
in this case would not be proper under clear Eleventh Circuit law; the Government has effectively 
conceded that the Court's hands are tied, but the Government wishes to preserve the issue for a 
potential appeal. See Part I; Pet. at 4. Pursuant to Pitch and for all of the reasons set forth above, 
this Court can determine whether disclosure is proper-it is not. The Government's request to 
transfer is therefore denied for all of the reasons set forth above. 
III. 
RULING 
For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Petition is 
DENIED.
