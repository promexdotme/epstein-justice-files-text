FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
23. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Epstein was an adult male over 45 
years old.  Epstein was a tremendously wealthy individual, widely recognized as a billionaire, 
who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal sexual crimes in 
violation of federal and state laws and who employed or conspired with other individuals and 
corporate entities to assist him in committing those crimes or torts or who facilitated or enabled 
those acts to occur. 
24. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his employees; to 
the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his direction, to the victims 
procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to advance, carry out, and conceal his 
crimes and torts. 
25. 
At all relevant times, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, as well as a fleet 
of airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and one or more helicopters.  For example, he regularly 
traveled by private jet aboard a Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-31H with tail number 
N908JE) or a Gulfstream aircraft (of make and model G-1159B with tail number N909JE). 
26. 
Epstein also inhabited and frequently travelled between numerous properties and 
homes, each of which he admitted to being owned or controlled by him, including a Manhattan 
townhome located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York  10021 valued conservatively by 
Epstein’s own admission at $55,931,000.00 (but valued by the US Attorney’s office for this

conservatively by Epstein’s own admission at $8,672,820.00; an Island located at Great St. 
James Island No. 6A USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, and C); and an Island Little St. James Island 
No. 6B USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, and C).  See Jeffrey Epstein “Asset Summary – June 30, 
2019” filed in Case No. 1:19-cr-00490-RMB on July 15, 2019 attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
27. 
Epstein controlled or was affiliated with the corporation or business entities that 
owned, managed, or maintained each of the real properties listed in the preceding paragraph and 
enumerated in Exhibit A. 
28. 
The allegations herein concern Epstein’s tortious conduct committed against 
Plaintiff while at the residences owned by Defendant Nine East in New York, Defendant Laurel 
in Florida, Defendant Cypress in New Mexico and Defendants LSJE and Nautilus in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.  Many such acts were facilitated by Defendant NES or Defendant HBRK or 
Defendant JEGE. 
29. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females, as young as 14 
years old, and acted on that sexual preference for decades. 
30. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor children, and 
also took pleasure corrupting vulnerable and innocent young females, including minor children, 
into engaging in sexual acts with him. 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 1     Filed 10/17/19     Page 6 of 34

Page 7 of 34 
31. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees and 
associates of Defendant entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the purpose of 
harming young females through sexual exploitation, abuse and trafficking. 
32. 
It was widely known among individuals regularly in Epstein’s presence that he 
obtained pleasure from corrupting and inducing vulnerable young females into engaging in 
uncomfortable and unwanted sexual acts for his own gratification. 
33. 
Epstein’s illegal sexual activities were investigated by law enforcement on at least 
two occasions, once in 2005-2008 by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, and more recently by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
34. 
On July 2, 2019 the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
New York filed a sealed Two Count Indictment including One Count of Sex Trafficking 
Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking for violations of 18 U.S.C. §1591, in part due to 
Epstein’s criminal activities against children in the New York Mansion located at 9 East 71st 
Street. 
35. 
In addition to the allegations in the criminal indictment referenced above, Epstein 
also utilized a similar, if not the same; scheme many years before the time period that was 
charged and many years after as well as in additional locations nationally and internationally. 
36. 
Corporate Defendants enabled Epstein to receive daily massages from young 
females, often minors, who were not experienced in massage.  Rather than receive regular body 
massages, Epstein was predictably sexually abusing young females, including Plaintiff, in 
violation of New York Penal Law §130. 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 1     Filed 10/17/19     Page 7 of 34

Page 8 of 34 
37. 
Additionally, employees of the various Corporate Defendants performed actions 
or failed to perform actions that further placed victims, including Plaintiff, in danger of being 
sexually abused by Epstein, and assisted in the concealment of his sexually abusive acts. 
38. 
Defendants employed many recruiters of young females, or directed employees of 
his related companies, to recruit young females   In order to grow the enterprise and satisfy his 
insatiable sexual desire, Epstein and those working at his direction enabled victims themselves to 
elevate their status within the enterprise to that of a paid recruiter of other victims, an elevation 
only made possible through the assistance of Defendants. 
39. 
Recruiters were taught by Epstein or by employees of Corporate Defendants to 
inform targeted young female victims that Epstein possessed extraordinary wealth, power, 
resources, and influence; that he was a philanthropist who would help female victims advance 
their education, careers, and lives; and that she only needed to provide Epstein with body 
massages in order to avail herself of his nearly unlimited assistance and influence. 
40. 
Epstein and Corporate Defendants and their many employees fulfilled Epstein’s 
compulsive need for sex with young females by preying on their personal, psychological, 
financial, and related vulnerabilities.  Epstein and Defendants’ tactics included promising the 
victims money, shelter, transportation, gifts, employment, admission into educational 
institutions, education tuition, professional licensure, protection, healthcare and other things of 
value. 
41. 
Epstein’s sexual attraction to young, often underage, females dated back to at 
least the mid-nineties and the number of victims increased substantially with the necessary 
assistance from Defendants and Defendants’ employees. 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 1     Filed 10/17/19     Page 8 of 34

Page 9 of 34 
42. 
Defendants, at the direction of Epstein or in furtherance of his demands, and with 
help from assistants, associates and underlings, and even other victims, recruited or procured 
dozens if not hundreds of young females, including minors, for the purpose of Epstein’s sexual 
gratification. 
43. 
Epstein, and employees of certain Corporate Defendants, including at least 
Defendant HBRK, specifically targeted underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or 
economically disadvantaged young females to sexually molest and abuse. 
44. 
Additionally, Epstein and Corporate Defendants, through employees, informed 
young females, including Plaintiff that Epstein was wealthy, well-connected, and had the power 
and ability to impact the life of any young female recruited or obtained to provide a massage. 
45. 
Each of the Corporate Defendants committed acts of negligence that allowed for 
Epstein to commit acts in violation of New York Penal Law §130. 
46. 
Each of the Defendants committed acts against Plaintiff in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§1591 – §1595. 
JANE DOE 17 
47. 
Consistent with Epstein’s foregoing plan, scheme/enterprise, the Plaintiff was 
recruited to provide Epstein with massages for monetary compensation.  These massages 
provided to Epstein by Plaintiff progressed to instances of inappropriate sexual contact with the 
Plaintiff by Epstein in touching, inappropriate vaginal penetration, and outright rape.  Plaintiff 
was sexually assaulted, violated, and otherwise degraded, injured, victimized, and subjected to 
outrageous, reckless abuse and insult. 
48. 
In this regard, the Defendants willingly participated, contributed, cooperated, and 
assisted the inappropriate and illegal scheme by facilitating such scheme by and through the 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 1     Filed 10/17/19     Page 9 of 34

Page 10 of 34 
employees of the Corporate Defendants such that the Corporate Defendants were acting jointly 
and in concert with the illegal scheme with the goal designed to produce corrupt sexual 
gratification for Epstein and degradation for the targets and victims of the corrupt scheme set in 
motion with the active involvement of the Corporate Defendants and their employees.   
49. 
Epstein’s abuse of the Plaintiff was not incidental or fleeting but rather was born 
out of a pathological desire to achieve, corrupt and deviate sexual gratification through the 
subjugation and abuse of Epstein’s targeted victims.  The actions on behalf of the Corporate 
Defendants by and through its employees enhanced, facilitated, and promoted the deviate sexual 
acts of Epstein and contributed a corrupting influence which ensnared unsuspecting women and 
girls in its reach. 
50. 
Epstein, by acting singularly and in concert with the Corporate Defendants, 
devised a sophisticated plan and a modus operandi which subtly and pervasively over time 
connived to influence the victims and subjects of the corrupt and deviant sexual scheme to 
influence the will to resist the temptations both actual and promised on behalf of the scheme and 
thereby manipulate the victims into acceptance of the scheme as being one that was acceptable 
and appropriate by virtue of communications and representations made on behalf of Epstein by 
the Corporate Defendants and in fact Epstein himself.  The scheme utilized a gradual wearing 
down of the victim’s will to resist and did so by virtue of offering positive and negative rewards 
for compliance with the scheme’s overall deviant methodology and goals.  
51. 
Once Epstein and the Corporate Defendants’ victims were entrapped and the 
scheme’s methodologies enabled, Epstein and the corporate defendants through its employees 
utilized techniques to further inhibit, indoctrinate, and threaten Epstein’s victims such that 
compliance with the deviant scheme’s goals could be further obtained. 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 1     Filed 10/17/19     Page 10 of 34

Page 11 of 34 
52. 
The deviant scheme was perpetuated over years by the actions of Epstein and the 
Corporate Defendants such that victims were caught up in the scheme, pressure, threats, and 
indoctrination techniques utilized to bring the victims to heel. 
53. 
For victims young, vulnerable, and struggling financially, the scheme’s 
methodology was particularly effective. 
54. 
As part and parcel of the scheme’s goals, Epstein’s colleagues and acquaintances 
were involved in the scheme and benefited from the scheme by virtue of receiving sexual favors 
and inappropriate, illegal, and otherwise commercial sexual services provided by Epstein’s 
victims such that the corrupt intent of this scheme involved males other than Epstein himself. 
As a direct and proximate result of the methodology of the deviant scheme and the goals of 
sexual exploitation of the women recruited and victimized, Plaintiff was subject to unwanted 
touching of her breasts and genitals, other sensitive areas of her body, required to perform acts 
of a sexual nature against her will and subjected to genital penetration and otherwise sexually 
degraded, abused, insulted, coerced, and injured, experience resulting in confusion, emotional 
distress, mental pain and suffering, shame, humiliation, loss of the enjoyment of life, 
inconvenience, and other injuries to body, mind and soul.  
55. 
Epstein and the Corporate Defendants by and through their employees and agents 
substantially contributed to proximately cause injury to the Plaintiff as aforementioned.   
56. 
Over a course of years, Epstein and the Corporate Defendants, by and through its 
employees and agents, facilitated the multiple rapes conducted on the Plaintiff in addition to 
other deviant sexual acts against her will.  Furthermore, the plaintiff’s virginity was forcefully 
taken from her against her will.

57. 
This fraudulent scheme of Epstein’s constituted acts of coercion from beginning 
to end, from 2001 through mid-2006, inasmuch as the scheme was designed to and in fact, 
caused Plaintiff to believe that her failure to perform any sex act required by Epstein would 
result in serious financial, reputational, physical and emotional harm to her.

COUNT III 
(CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DARREN K. INDYKE AND RICHARD D. KAHN AS 
JOINT PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY E. 
EPSTEIN PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. § 1595) 
64. 
Plaintiff adopts and realleges paragraphs 1 through 57 above.  
65. 
Epstein, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United 
States, in interstate and foreign commerce, and/or affecting interstate and foreign commerce, 
knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, 
solicited, threatened, forced, or coerced Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts.    
66. 
Such actions were undertaken knowing that his use of force, threats of force, 
fraud, coercion, and/or combinations of such means would be used, and were in fact, used, in 
order to cause Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts.  In doing so, Epstein violated 18

MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY ON BEHALF OF JANE DOE 17 
AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe 17, herein files her Motion to Proceed Anonymously and Supporting 
Memorandum of Law and in support thereof states: 
I. 
PLAINTIFF IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY IN THIS 
CIRCUIT. 
This action involves Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual assault of Plaintiff (“Plaintiff”) in violation 
of the New York Law and/or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 
through 1595. Plaintiff submits this Memorandum of Law in support of Plaintiff’s Motion for 
Leave to Proceed Anonymously. Allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously will protect her 
highly sensitive personal information that will remain the focus of this litigation. There is no 
prejudice to Defendants in allowing Plaintiff to proceed anonymously, nor is there any significant 
public interest in the disclosure of the Plaintiff’s identity. In fact, the public interest in this case 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 1 of 13

Page 2 of 7 
weighs in favor of granting Plaintiff’s request to proceed anonymously for her protection. 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a) requires a Complaint to “include the names of all 
the parties.” However, the court has discretion to allow a plaintiff to proceed anonymously. 
Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 190 (2d. Cir. 2008). “[C]ourts have granted 
anonymity to protect against disclosure of a wide range of issues involving matters of the utmost 
intimacy, including sexual assault.” Doe. No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 196 (EDNY 2006); see 
also 1991 McKinney’s Sessions Laws of N.Y. at 2211-2212 (“sexual assault victims have 
unfortunately had to endure a terrible invasion of their physical privacy. They have a right to 
expect that this violation will not be compounded by a further invasion of their privacy”). 
“When determining whether a plaintiff may be allowed to maintain an action under a 
pseudonym, the plaintiff’s interest in anonymity must be balanced against both the public 
interest in disclosure and any prejudice to the defendant.” Id. at 189. The balancing of interests 
entails the consideration of ten non-exhaustive factors, though the court has discretion to 
consider “other factors relevant to the particular case under consideration.” Id. at 189-190. The 
ten factors are: 
(1) whether the litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a 
personal nature; (2) whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or 
mental harm to the party seeking to proceed anonymously or even more 
critically, to innocent non-parties; (3) whether identification presents other harms 
and the likely severity of those harms, including whether the injury litigated 
against would be incurred as a result of the disclosure of the plaintiff’s identity; 
(4) whether the plaintiff is particularly vulnerable to the possible harms of 
disclosure, particularly in light of [her] age; (5) whether the suit is challenging 
the actions of the government or that of private parties; (6) whether the defendant 
is prejudiced by allowing the plaintiff to press [her] claims anonymously, 
whether the nature of that prejudice (if any) differs at any particular stage of the 
litigation, and whether any prejudice can be mitigated by the district court; (7) 
whether the plaintiff’s identity has thus far been kept confidential; (8) whether 
the public’s interest in the litigation is furthered by requiring the plaintiff to 
disclose his identity; (9) whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing the 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 2 of 13

Page 3 of 7 
litigants’ identities; and (10) whether there are any alternative mechanisms for 
protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff. 
Id. at 190 (internal citations and quotations omitted). 
II. 
ALL TEN ANONYMITY FACTORS WEIGH IN FAVOR OF 
PERMITTING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY. 
In this case, all delineated Sealed Plaintiff factors support Plaintiff’s application for 
anonymity, which should be granted for her protection. Plaintiff is a victim of multiple instances 
of sexual assault. The acts that were committed against Plaintiff are highly sensitive in nature 
and are particularly difficult for her to address in a public forum. 
For those reasons, among many others (some of which, if revealed in a public filing might 
disclose Plaintiff’s identity), identification of Plaintiff in this matter may pose a risk of 
retaliation. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.  In order to warrant anonymity, the possible 
retaliatory harm may be either physical or psychological in nature. See Doe v. Del Rio, 241 
F.R.D. 154, 158 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) Epstein’s vast wealth and far reaching connections make it 
clear that retaliation could be employed against individuals pursuing claims against the Estate 
of Jeffrey Epstein. In addition to exposing Plaintiff to physical or psychological harm, retaliation 
could also silence potential witnesses from coming forward. 
The public exposure of Plaintiff’s identity would certainly cause her to suffer additional 
or exacerbated emotional or psychological harm including shame, embarrassment, depression, 
anxiety, and the array of side effects that go along therewith. Should Plaintiff’s real identity be 
revealed, her safety could also be at risk as the media and the press worldwide are currently laser 
focused on Jeffrey Epstein and his sexually exploitative escapades. 
Despite the fact that Defendants are private parties and not Government entities, 
Defendants are not “ordinary” private parties because of Epstein’s known wealth, power, and 
reputation. See Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195 (2006). Jeffrey Epstein has been a known sexual 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 3 of 13

Page 4 of 7 
predator with substantial financial influence for many years. For years before his death, Epstein 
had been investigated by various state prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
for his sexual assaults on young girls. 
Given Epstein’s notoriety, Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse and the widespread 
concealment of the same “raise concerns affecting a larger association rather than the interest of 
an individual plaintiff.” See id. at 195. In this case, the “larger association” is society in general. 
Society has an interest in eradicating the predatory practices of powerful men against vulnerable, 
susceptible women— including the practice of luring young girls for sexual purposes. This case 
is therefore more “analogous to one involving a government defendant, where personal 
anonymity is more readily granted because of the existence of a public interest in the action.” EW 
v. New York Blood Center, 213 F.R.D. 108, 112 (EDNY 2003). 
“The public right to scrutinize governmental functioning is not so completely impaired 
by a grant of anonymity to a party as it is by closure of the trial itself . . . Party anonymity does 
not obstruct the public’s view of the issues joined or the court’s performance in resolving them.” 
See Doe v. Stegall¸ 653 F.2d 180, 185 (5th Cir. 1981). The public’s interest in this legal question 
is not furthered by requiring Plaintiff to disclose her identity. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 
190 (citing Del Rio, 241 F.R.D. at 154 (“whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing the litigants’ 
identities”)); see also Free Speech v. Reno, Case No. 98 Civ. 2680 MBM, 1999 WL 47310 at *3 
(SDNY Feb. 1, 1999) (“because the particular plaintiffs in this constitutional challenge are 
essentially interchangeable with similarly situated persons, there appears little public interest in 
which particular persons have actually sued…”). Because Plaintiff’s anonymity would not 
impair the public’s right to view or scrutinize this lawsuit, this factor weighs in favor of 
nondisclosure. Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting the identities of 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 4 of 13

Page 5 of 7 
sexual assault victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.” 
Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 195. 
Finally, [t]he Second Circuit directed district courts to evaluate “whether there are any 
alternative mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff.” Sealed Plaintiff, 537 
F.3d at 190 (citing Roe v. Aware Woman Center for Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 687 (11th Cir. 
2001)): 
The only justification the defendants offer for stripping Roe of her privacy is the 
argument that they will not be able to adequately conduct discovery without 
knowing her true identity. However, that argument is eviscerated by Roe’s offer 
to disclose her name to the defendants for discovery purposes on condition that 
they do not disclose it to the general public. That is a reasonable way to 
reconcile the competing interests, and the district court can enter an appropriate 
protective order. The district court should have granted Roe’s motion to proceed 
anonymously. 
Here, Plaintiff will cooperate with the court and the Defendants and reveal Plaintiff’s 
identity to Defendants for discovery purposes on the condition that Defendants do not disclose 
Plaintiff’s name to the general public. 
Just recently, under circumstances virtually identical to that of Jane Doe 17, Judge Castel 
granted a Motion to Proceed Anonymously in the matter of Katlyn Doe v. Darren K. Indyke, et 
al., Case No. 19-cv-7771-PKC finding the presence of at least 7 of the 10 Sealed Plaintiff factors 
which either supported or weighed strongly in favor of permitting the Plaintiff to proceed 
anonymously.  The Court held that “the public right to know is substantially outweighed by the 
plaintiff’s legitimate need for anonymity and that prejudice to a defendant can be mitigated by 
orders of the Court.”  A copy of Judge Castel’s Order of September 11, 2019 is annexed hereto 
as Exhibit A. 
III. CONCLUSION 
The balancing factors articulated by the Second Circuit weigh in favor of protecting 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 5 of 13

Plaintiff’s identity by allowing her to proceed anonymously. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff 
respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion for Leave to Proceed Anonymously.

Defendant. 
-----------------------------------------------------------x 
CASTEL, U.S.D.J. 
19-cv-7771 (PKC) 
ORDER 
Plaintiff seeks leave to proceed in this action without disclosing her identity using 
instead a pseudonym. She alleges that Jeffrey Epstein, with the assistance of associates and 
entities, engaged in "manipulate[ion]," "c011trol," "sexual exploitation," "sexual assault[]," 
"sexual abuse," and "forced ... intercourse" of or with plaintiff; she was seventeen when the 
course of conduct began. (Complaint ,r,r 58-68.) At this juncture, no defendant has been served. 
Rule I0(a), Fed. R. Civ. P., provides that "[t]he title of [a] complaint must name 
all the parties." The Second Circuit has recognized that the use of a pseudonym is, however, 
appropriate in limited circumstances where the reasons for anonymity outweigh the public's right 
of access to judicial proceedings and any prejudice to a defendant. Sealed Plaintiffv. Sealed 
Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. 2008). The Circuit's opinion in Sealed Plaintiff lays out 
ten non-exhaustive factors to be considered in determining whether to allow a case to proceed on 
an anonymous basis. Id. at 190. The Court analyzes the Complaint in light of these factors. 
- 1 -

Case 1:19-cv-07771-PKC   Document 28   Filed 09/12/19   Page 2 of 5
Case 1:19-cv-07773-ER   Document 22-1   Filed 10/16/19   Page 2 of 5
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 10 of 13
(1) whether the litigation involves matters that are 
highly sensitive and of a 
personal nature. 
The Complaint alleges an on-going pattern of sexual assault and abuse beginning 
when plaintiff was seventeen years-old and asserts that she has and is continuing to suffer 
psychological injury as a result. (Complaint 1152-65.) These are highly sensitive allegations of 
a personal nature. 
(2) whether identification of the plaintiff poses a risk of 
physical or mental retaliation to the plaintiff or to a 
third paity. 
No risk of retaliation is alleged. Jeffrey Epstein is dead and there is no credible 
evidence of a risk of retaliation from others. There is an allegation of threats of retaliation in the 
past if she did not comply with demands for sex acts that she would suffer financial, 
psychological, and reputational harm (Id. 1 84) but no facts me alleged that those threats are 
likely to continue after the death of Epstein. 
(3) whether identification of plaintiff poses the risk of other 
harms, their likely severity and whether they ai·e of the type 
that the litigation seeks to redress. 
The nature of the allegations make it logical to conclude at this emly stage that 
disclosure of plaintiffs identity would cause further psychological hmm to plaintiff which is the 
precise hann the litigation seeks, in pai-t, to redress.

Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 24-1     Filed 11/08/19     Page 11 of 13
( 4) whether there are other factors that make the 
plaintiff paiticularly vulnerable to hmm of 
disclosure, for exainple, because of her age. 
By the Comt's calculation, the plaintiff is 29 or 30. She is described in the 
complaint as having physical conditions that make her paiticularly vulnerable. (Id. ,i,r 54-55.) 
She alleges that she has incmTed and will continue to incur "medical and psychological 
expenses" as a result of the conduct alleged. (Id. ,i 132.) 
(5) whether the action challenges the actions of government or 
government actors, or merely private parties. 
The actions alleged are not the actions of a government actor or instrumentality 
but rather those of private paities. 
( 6) the nature of any prejudice to a defendant from 
allowing the plaintiff to proceed anonymously and 
whether any prejudice can be mitigated by the court. 
The Complaint alleges that the representatives of the estate of Epstein have 
liability for his actions. It also alleges that various non-natural persons are liable for acts and 
omissions causing plaintiff harm. In such circumstances it is critical that the accused defendants 
know the identity of the plaintiff in order to investigate and defend against the claim. The Court 
can mitigate the prejudice to defendants by requiring the disclosure of the actual name of the 
plaintiff in a document to be served on defendants and also filed under seal with the Comt. 
Plaintiff does not object to disclosure "for discovery purposes on the condition that Defendants 
do not disclose Plaintiff's name to the general public." (P. Mem. 6; Doc 3-1.)

(7) whether the plaintiff's identity has thns far been 
kept confidential. 
Insofar as the Comi is aware, the identity of the plaintiff is not widely known. 
(8) whether there is a legitimate public interest or 
benefit in requiring the plaintiff 
to disclose her identity. 
There is public interest in the litigation because of the notoriety of Epstein and 
those with whom he associated, but disclosure of the identity of the plaintiff is not likely to be of 
a legitimate importance or benefit to the public. 
(9) Whether the issues in the action are predominately 
or purely legal nature suggesting that the public 
interest in the plaintiffs identity may be weak. 
The issues in the case are not purely or predominately of a legal nature. This case 
turns principally on its facts. 
(I 0) whether there are any alternative mechanisms for 
protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff. 
It is the disclosure of her identity that would exacerbate any preexisting harm to 
plaintiff and hence there is not alternative mechanism for protecting her confidentiality. 
CONCLUSION 
Factors 1 and 3 tilt strongly in favor of permitting plaintiff to proceed 
anonymously and are supported by factors 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Factors 2, 5, 9 are either neutral or

weakly support denying the motion. The Court concludes that, at this juncture, the public right to 
know is substantially outweighed by the plaintiffs legitimate need for anonymity and that 
prejudice to a defendant can be mitigated by orders of the Court. The Court reserves the right to 
modify this Order as the case progresses. 
Plaintiffs motion (Doc 3) is GRANTED. Within seven days of the appearance of 
a defendant, plaintiff shall disclose her identity to the appearing defendant in a document to be 
submitted to the Court for sealing. No defendant may disclose the identity of plaintiff to any 
person other than counsel without further order of this Comi. 
SO ORDERED.

Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, et al., 1:19-cv-09610 (PAE) 
Dear Judge Engelmayer: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (named herein as “Joint Personal Representative[s] of the Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein”), Nine East 71st Street, Corporation, Financial Trust Company, Inc., NES, LLC, Laurel, 
Inc., Maple, Inc., LSJE, LLC, HBRK Associates, Inc., Nautilus, Inc., Cypress, Inc., and JEGE, 
Inc. (together, “Defendants”) in the referenced action.  We write to respectfully request that the 
Court vacate its Order dated November 8, 2019 (ECF #25) granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Proceed 
Anonymously (the “Motion”) (ECF #24) filed earlier that day.  The basis for this request is that 
Your Honor’s Order dated November 5, 2019 (ECF #21) provides Defendants through 
December 21, 2019 to respond to Plaintiff’s Motion.    
Defendants did not have an opportunity to respond to Plaintiff’s Motion.  Defendants do not 
object to Plaintiff proceeding anonymously to prevent the disclosure of her identity to the 
general public.  However, Defendants seek the opportunity to be heard so the relief granted on 
Plaintiff’s Motion ensures Plaintiff may protect her anonymity without jeopardizing Defendants’ 
fundamental right to fully and fairly defend against this action.   
Plaintiffs’ counsel does not consent to this request. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The Court vacates its November 8, 2019 Order, Dkt. 25, granting plaintiffs motion to proceed 
anonymously, as having been issued prematurely. Since issuing that Order, the Court has 
referred this litigation to the Hon. Debra C. Freeman, Magistrate Judge, for general pretrial 
purposes. See Dkt. 26. Accordingly, all further applications for non-dispositive pretrial relief 
should be directed to Judge Freeman. 
SO ORDERED.

40881533v1
Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (named herein as “Joint Personal Representative[s] of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein”) 
(together, the “Estate”), Nine East 71st Street, Corporation (“Nine East”), Financial Trust 
Company, Inc. (“FTC”), NES, LLC (“NES”), Laurel, Inc. (“Laurel”), Maple, Inc. (“Maple”), 
LSJE, LLC (“LSJE”), HBRK Associates, Inc. (“HBRK”), Nautilus, Inc. (“Nautilus”), Cypress, 
Inc. (“Cypress”), and JEGE, Inc. (“JEGE”, and together with Nine East, FTC, NES, Laurel, Maple, 
LSJE, HBRK, Nautilus, Cypress and JEGE, the “Corporate Defendants”; and the Corporate 
Defendants together with the Estate, the “Defendants”) respectfully submit this Memorandum of 
Law in support of their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Jane Doe 17’s (“Plaintiff”) Complaint (ECF 
Doc. # 1)1 with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state 
a claim. 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
This action is time barred.  Plaintiff—who was not a minor at any time at issue in her 
Complaint—alleges that, “from 2001 through mid-2006,” Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Decedent”) 
sexually assaulted her. (Compl. ¶¶ 47, 57.)    
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s two causes of action sounding in battery (Counts I and II), which 
are subject to at most a 3-year statute of limitations, expired by 2009.  Plaintiff’s remaining causes 
of action, all of which are brought pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 1589, et seq. (the “TVPA”), are subject to a 10-year statute of limitations. 
U.S.C. § 1595(c)(1).  Therefore, Plaintiff’s TVPA claims expired in mid-2016 at the latest—
several years before she filed her Complaint in October 2019.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s Complaint 
should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). 
A copy of Plaintiff’s Complaint is attached to the Declaration of Bennet J. Moskowitz submitted herewith.  
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 35     Filed 12/23/19     Page 5 of 12

40881533v1
Plaintiff fails to state a claim against the Corporate Defendants for the additional reason 
that her allegations against them consist of threadbare, conclusory recitations of the elements of 
civil TVPA causes of action.  Such conclusory allegations are precisely the type that are deemed 
insufficient under the pleading standards set forth in Twombly and Iqbal.  Moreover, Plaintiff is 
relying on impermissible group pleading against the Corporate Defendants.  
Counts I and II for battery based on the same alleged misconduct are also impermissibly 
duplicative of each other.  At least one of these causes of action should be dismissed for this 
independent reason.   
Separately, Plaintiff’s demand for punitive damages fails as a matter of law and must also 
be dismissed.  Under New York law and Federal Common law, punitive damages are unavailable 
where, as here, a plaintiff asserts battery and TVPA claims based on alleged torts committed by a 
decedent.  
I.
ALLEGED FACTS 
Few paragraphs of Plaintiff’s Complaint allege what happened to her.  Instead, the 
Complaint consists largely of allegations related to Decedent generally without any nexus to 
Plaintiff, such as allegations pertaining to Decedent’s wealth (see, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 4, 19, 23-26) 
and what he allegedly did to unidentified individuals other than Plaintiff (see, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 40-41).   
The scant allegations concerning Plaintiff set forth in conclusory fashion that, from 2001 
through mid-2006, she received money to give Decedent massages which “progressed to instances 
of inappropriate sexual contact” including rape. (Id. ¶¶ 47, 57.)  Plaintiff does not allege she was 
a minor when the alleged abuse occurred.  Facts subject to judicial notice also firmly establish that 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 35     Filed 12/23/19     Page 6 of 12

- 3 - 
40881533v1
Plaintiff has repeatedly stated and has sworn under oath that she did not even meet Decedent until 
Plaintiff was an adult.2
Based on Plaintiff’s scant allegations related entirely to conduct allegedly committed by 
Decedent, Plaintiff claims the Corporate Defendants, which she lumps together, are somehow 
liable to her as well.  Plaintiff alleges without any supporting factual allegations that all “Corporate 
Defendants” were part of an “illegal scheme” that somehow “facilitated” Decedent’s alleged abuse 
of Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 48.)  However, Plaintiff does not identify a single person who worked for or 
otherwise acted on behalf of any of the Corporate Defendants let alone allege what any such person 
specifically did or failed to do that renders their employer or principal liable to Plaintiff.  
Based on her few general allegations related to Decedent and her threadbare, conclusory 
allegations against and lumping together the “Corporate Defendants,” Plaintiff asserts two 
duplicative battery causes of action against the Estate (Counts I and II) and TVPA violations 
against each Defendant (Counts III – XIII, respectively). Plaintiff seeks various damages in 
unspecified amounts, including punitive damages (see, e.g., id. at p. 33).  
II.
ARGUMENT 
Legal Standard: Plaintiff’s legal conclusions are not accepted as true. 
Although the Court normally accepts as true all well-pleaded factual allegations in a 
complaint and draws all inferences in a plaintiff’s favor, ATSI Commc’ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 
493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007), those principles are “inapplicable to legal conclusions.” Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Thus, a pleading that offers only “labels and conclusions” or 
“a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 
Should Plaintiff now allege otherwise, Defendants reserve the right on reply to submit under seal facts subject to 
judicial notice and thus properly considered on a motion to dismiss, including Plaintiff’s sworn statements, decisively 
showing she was over 18 when she met Decedent.

40881533v1
550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  Moreover, “‘[w]here [the] plaintiff’s own pleadings are internally 
inconsistent, a court is neither obligated to reconcile nor accept the contradictory allegations in the 
pleadings as true in deciding a motion to dismiss.’”  Whitley v. Bowden, No. 17-CV-3564 (KMK), 
2018 WL 2170313, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2018) (quoting Carson Optical Inc. v. eBay Inc., 202 
F. Supp. 3d 247, 255 (E.D.N.Y. 2016)). 
Here, as further explained below, Plaintiff asserts formulaic recitations of the elements of 
her battery and TVPA causes of action.  Per the well-established case law cited above, such 
allegations are insufficient to state a claim. 
Plaintiff’s battery causes of action expired in 2009 at the latest. 
Under New York law, actions for battery must be commenced within one year (CPLR § 
215(3)); and actions for personal injury must be commenced within three years (CPLR § 214(5)).  
Plaintiff, who was not a minor at the time relevant to her allegations, alleges the misconduct at 
issue in her Complaint ended in mid-2006.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s causes of action asserting 
battery and personal injury expired in mid-2009 at the latest. 
Plaintiff’s TVPA claims expired in 2016 at the latest. 
The TVPA expressly states no civil action may be maintained thereunder “unless it is 
commenced not later than the later of—(1) 10 years after the cause of action arose; or (2) 10 years 
after the victim reaches 18 years of age, if the victim was a minor at the time of the alleged 
offense.”  18 U.S.C. § 1595(c). Plaintiff does not allege she was a minor at the time of the alleged 
sexual assaults that ended in mid-2006. (Compl. ¶ 57.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s TVPA claims 
expired in mid-2016 at the latest.

C. 

- 5 - 
40881533v1
Plaintiff’s claims against the Corporate Defendants must be dismissed 
for the additional reason that they are based on conclusory statements 
and impermissible group pleading—not facts. 
Plaintiff failed to allege “enough facts” to state any claim against the Corporate 
Defendants “that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) 
(emphasis added).  It is well-settled that Plaintiff must demonstrate grounds for relief beyond 
mere “labels and conclusions.”  Id. at 555.  
Rather, to state a claim, Plaintiff’s Complaint must set forth “[f]actual allegations [that 
are] ... enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Id. “Though the Court must 
accept the factual allegations of a complaint as true, it is ‘not bound to accept as true a legal 
conclusion couched as a factual allegation.’”  Swan Media Grp., Inc. v. Staub, 841 F. Supp. 2d 
804, 806 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). 
Additionally, “[w]here a complaint names multiple defendants, that complaint must 
provide a plausible factual basis to distinguish the conduct of each of the defendants.  ... A plaintiff 
cannot merely lump all the defendants together in each claim and provide no factual basis to 
distinguish their conduct.”  Ochre LLC v. Rockwell Architecture Planning & Design, 12-cv-2837, 
2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172208, at *16-17 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 28, 2012) (citing Atuahene v. City of 
Hartford, 10 Fed. App’x 33, 34 (2d Cir. 2001)). 
With respect to the allegations against the Corporate Defendants, Plaintiff has not made 
factual allegations sufficient to “raise the right to relief above the speculative level.”  See Twombly, 
550 U.S. at 555.  Besides generic conclusions that the Corporate Defendants “enabled [Decedent]” 
(Compl. ¶ 36), “facilitated” Decedent’s acts (id. ¶ 49) and the like, there are no alleged facts 
describing what any of the Corporate Defendants’ employees or other agents specifically did or 
failed to do that constituted a TVPA violation as to Plaintiff (or anyone else, for that matter).

d. 

- 6 - 
40881533v1
Further, most of Plaintiff’s allegations about the Corporate Defendants impermissibly 
lump their conduct together.  (See id. ¶¶ 22, 36-37, 39-40, 43-45, 48-52, 55-56.)  The Corporate 
Defendants cannot reasonably prepare a response to such conclusory, vague claims. 
Plaintiff’s two battery counts are impermissibly duplicative of each 
other. 
Counts I and II are also impermissibly duplicative of each other.  See Price v. L'Oreal USA, 
Inc., 17-cv-0614, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165931, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2017) (“Defendants’ 
motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim under New York law (see Count V) is granted 
because it is duplicative of the other claims.”).  Counts I and II are based on the same alleged 
occurrences and seek the same relief.  Therefore, it would serve no legitimate purpose to permit 
Plaintiff to pursue both claims.  
Plaintiff’s demand for punitive damages must be dismissed because it 
is precluded by New York law and otherwise unavailable under the 
TVPA.
Plaintiffs may not recover punitive damages in this action as a matter of law.  Plaintiff 
alleges a substantial part of the acts and omissions giving rise to her causes of action occurred in 
New York (Compl. ¶ 21).  Therefore, New York law applies to the issue of punitive damages.  See 
Starr Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Am. Claims Mgmt., 14-cv-0463-JMF, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60272, 
*7 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2015) (“Because punitive damages are conduct-regulating, ‘the law of the 
jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply.’”) (quoting Deutsch v. Novartis Pharms. 
Corp., 723 F. Supp. 2d 521, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 2010); Guidi v. Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., No. 
95-CV-9006, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6390, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2003)). 
New York Estates, Powers And Trusts Law provides: “No cause of action for injury to 
person or property is lost because of the death of the person liable for the injury. For any injury, 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 35     Filed 12/23/19     Page 10 of 12
e. 
f.

40881533v1
an action may be brought or continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but 
punitive damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought to 
recover damages for personal injury.”  NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1) (emphasis added).  “Also, ‘there 
is a strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an estate on account of 
wrongful conduct of the decedent.’”  Graham v. Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) 
(quoting Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996)).  
Nor are punitive damages available to Plaintiffs under the TVPA, which is a punitive 
statute.  A federal cause of action that is penal in nature, as opposed to remedial, abates upon a 
party’s death.  Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Exeter Holdings, Ltd. v. Haltman, 13-
cv-5475, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123752, at *22 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2017).  Even where a federal 
cause of action survives death, punitive damages are unavailable.  See, e.g., Medrano v. MCDR, 
Inc., 366 F. Supp. 2d 625, 635 (W.D. Tenn. 2005) (dismissing deceased plaintiff’s claim for 
punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1981). 
Accordingly, even if Plaintiff’s claims are not dismissed as untimely—which they should 
be—Plaintiff’s demand for punitive damages should be dismissed. 
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants respectfully request that the Court grant their Motion 
to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint in its entirety with prejudice together with such other and further 
relief as the Court deems just and proper.

COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, JANE DOE 17, by and through the undersigned counsel, in support of her 
claims against Defendants, alleges and states as follows: 
1. 
This action is brought, inter alia, pursuant to common law, statutory law and 18

New York Penal Law §130.35; or New York Penal Law §130.50; or New York Penal Law 
§130.52; or New York Penal Law §130.66; or any violation of 18 U.S.C. §1591- §1595. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
23. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Epstein was an adult male over 45 
years old.  Epstein was a tremendously wealthy individual, widely recognized as a billionaire, 
who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal sexual crimes in 
violation of federal and state laws and who employed or conspired with other individuals and 
corporate entities to assist him in committing those crimes or torts or who facilitated or enabled 
those acts to occur. 
24. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his employees; to 
the employees of the corporate or company entities who worked at his direction, to the victims 
procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to advance, carry out, and conceal his 
crimes and torts. 
25. 
At all relevant times, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, as well as a fleet 
of airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and one or more helicopters.  For example, he regularly 
traveled by private jet aboard a Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-31H with tail number 
N908JE) or a Gulfstream aircraft (of make and model G-1159B with tail number N909JE). 
26. 
Epstein also inhabited and frequently travelled between numerous properties and 
homes, each of which he admitted to being owned or controlled by him, including a Manhattan 
townhome located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York  10021 valued conservatively by 
Epstein’s own admission at $55,931,000.00 (but valued by the US Attorney’s office for this 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF   Document 1   Filed 10/17/19   Page 5 of 34

District at $77,000,000); a ranch located at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New Mexico 87056 
valued conservatively by  Epstein’s own admission at $17,246,208.00; a home located at 358 El 
Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida  33480 valued conservatively by Epstein’s own admission at 
$12,380,209.00; an apartment located at 22 Avenue Foch, Paris, France 75116 valued 
conservatively by Epstein’s own admission at $8,672,820.00; an Island located at Great St. 
James Island No. 6A USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, and C); and an Island Little St. James Island 
No. 6B USVI 00802 (parcels A, B, and C).  See Jeffrey Epstein “Asset Summary – June 30, 
2019” filed in Case No. 1:19-cr-00490-RMB on July 15, 2019 attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
27. 
Epstein controlled or was affiliated with the corporation or business entities that 
owned, managed, or maintained each of the real properties listed in the preceding paragraph and 
enumerated in Exhibit A. 
28. 
The allegations herein concern Epstein’s tortious conduct committed against 
Plaintiff while at the residences owned by Defendant Nine East in New York, Defendant Laurel 
in Florida, Defendant Cypress in New Mexico and Defendants LSJE and Nautilus in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.  Many such acts were facilitated by Defendant NES or Defendant HBRK or 
Defendant JEGE. 
29. 
Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for young females, as young as 14 
years old, and acted on that sexual preference for decades. 
30. 
Epstein enjoyed sexual contact with young females, including minor children, and 
also took pleasure corrupting vulnerable and innocent young females, including minor children, 
into engaging in sexual acts with him. 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF   Document 1   Filed 10/17/19   Page 6 of 34

Page 7 of 34 
31. 
Epstein directed a complex system of individuals, including employees and 
associates of Defendant entities, to work in concert and at his direction, for the purpose of 
harming young females through sexual exploitation, abuse and trafficking. 
32. 
It was widely known among individuals regularly in Epstein’s presence that he 
obtained pleasure from corrupting and inducing vulnerable young females into engaging in 
uncomfortable and unwanted sexual acts for his own gratification. 
33. 
Epstein’s illegal sexual activities were investigated by law enforcement on at least 
two occasions, once in 2005-2008 by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, and more recently by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
34. 
On July 2, 2019 the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
New York filed a sealed Two Count Indictment including One Count of Sex Trafficking 
Conspiracy and One Count of Sex Trafficking for violations of 18 U.S.C. §1591, in part due to 
Epstein’s criminal activities against children in the New York Mansion located at 9 East 71st 
Street. 
35. 
In addition to the allegations in the criminal indictment referenced above, Epstein 
also utilized a similar, if not the same; scheme many years before the time period that was 
charged and many years after as well as in additional locations nationally and internationally. 
36. 
Corporate Defendants enabled Epstein to receive daily massages from young 
females, often minors, who were not experienced in massage.  Rather than receive regular body 
massages, Epstein was predictably sexually abusing young females, including Plaintiff, in 
violation of New York Penal Law §130. 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF   Document 1   Filed 10/17/19   Page 7 of 34

Page 8 of 34 
37. 
Additionally, employees of the various Corporate Defendants performed actions 
or failed to perform actions that further placed victims, including Plaintiff, in danger of being 
sexually abused by Epstein, and assisted in the concealment of his sexually abusive acts. 
38. 
Defendants employed many recruiters of young females, or directed employees of 
his related companies, to recruit young females   In order to grow the enterprise and satisfy his 
insatiable sexual desire, Epstein and those working at his direction enabled victims themselves to 
elevate their status within the enterprise to that of a paid recruiter of other victims, an elevation 
only made possible through the assistance of Defendants. 
39. 
Recruiters were taught by Epstein or by employees of Corporate Defendants to 
inform targeted young female victims that Epstein possessed extraordinary wealth, power, 
resources, and influence; that he was a philanthropist who would help female victims advance 
their education, careers, and lives; and that she only needed to provide Epstein with body 
massages in order to avail herself of his nearly unlimited assistance and influence. 
40. 
Epstein and Corporate Defendants and their many employees fulfilled Epstein’s 
compulsive need for sex with young females by preying on their personal, psychological, 
financial, and related vulnerabilities.  Epstein and Defendants’ tactics included promising the 
victims money, shelter, transportation, gifts, employment, admission into educational 
institutions, education tuition, professional licensure, protection, healthcare and other things of 
value. 
41. 
Epstein’s sexual attraction to young, often underage, females dated back to at 
least the mid-nineties and the number of victims increased substantially with the necessary 
assistance from Defendants and Defendants’ employees. 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF   Document 1   Filed 10/17/19   Page 8 of 34

Page 9 of 34 
42. 
Defendants, at the direction of Epstein or in furtherance of his demands, and with 
help from assistants, associates and underlings, and even other victims, recruited or procured 
dozens if not hundreds of young females, including minors, for the purpose of Epstein’s sexual 
gratification. 
43. 
Epstein, and employees of certain Corporate Defendants, including at least 
Defendant HBRK, specifically targeted underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or 
economically disadvantaged young females to sexually molest and abuse. 
44. 
Additionally, Epstein and Corporate Defendants, through employees, informed 
young females, including Plaintiff that Epstein was wealthy, well-connected, and had the power 
and ability to impact the life of any young female recruited or obtained to provide a massage. 
45. 
Each of the Corporate Defendants committed acts of negligence that allowed for 
Epstein to commit acts in violation of New York Penal Law §130. 
46. 
Each of the Defendants committed acts against Plaintiff in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§1591 – §1595. 
JANE DOE 17 
47. 
Consistent with Epstein’s foregoing plan, scheme/enterprise, the Plaintiff was 
recruited to provide Epstein with massages for monetary compensation.  These massages 
provided to Epstein by Plaintiff progressed to instances of inappropriate sexual contact with the 
Plaintiff by Epstein in touching, inappropriate vaginal penetration, and outright rape.  Plaintiff 
was sexually assaulted, violated, and otherwise degraded, injured, victimized, and subjected to 
outrageous, reckless abuse and insult. 
48. 
In this regard, the Defendants willingly participated, contributed, cooperated, and 
assisted the inappropriate and illegal scheme by facilitating such scheme by and through the 
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF   Document 1   Filed 10/17/19   Page 9 of 34
Case 1:19-cv-09610-PAE-DCF     Document 36-1     Filed 12/23/19     Page 10 of 37

Page 10 of 34 
employees of the Corporate Defendants such that the Corporate Defendants were acting jointly 
and in concert with the illegal scheme with the goal designed to produce corrupt sexual 
gratification for Epstein and degradation for the targets and victims of the corrupt scheme set in 
motion with the active involvement of the Corporate Defendants and their employees.   
49. 
Epstein’s abuse of the Plaintiff was not incidental or fleeting but rather was born 
out of a pathological desire to achieve, corrupt and deviate sexual gratification through the 
subjugation and abuse of Epstein’s targeted victims.  The actions on behalf of the Corporate 
Defendants by and through its employees enhanced, facilitated, and promoted the deviate sexual 
acts of Epstein and contributed a corrupting influence which ensnared unsuspecting women and 
girls in its reach. 
50. 
Epstein, by acting singularly and in concert with the Corporate Defendants, 
devised a sophisticated plan and a modus operandi which subtly and pervasively over time 
connived to influence the victims and subjects of the corrupt and deviant sexual scheme to 
influence the will to resist the temptations both actual and promised on behalf of the scheme and 
thereby manipulate the victims into acceptance of the scheme as being one that was acceptable 
and appropriate by virtue of communications and representations made on behalf of Epstein by 
the Corporate Defendants and in fact Epstein himself.  The scheme utilized a gradual wearing 
down of the victim’s will to resist and did so by virtue of offering positive and negative rewards 
for compliance with the scheme’s overall deviant methodology and goals.  
51. 
Once Epstein and the Corporate Defendants’ victims were entrapped and the 
scheme’s methodologies enabled, Epstein and the corporate defendants through its employees 
utilized techniques to further inhibit, indoctrinate, and threaten Epstein’s victims such that 
compliance with the deviant scheme’s goals could be further obtained.

Page 11 of 34 
52. 
The deviant scheme was perpetuated over years by the actions of Epstein and the 
Corporate Defendants such that victims were caught up in the scheme, pressure, threats, and 
indoctrination techniques utilized to bring the victims to heel. 
53. 
For victims young, vulnerable, and struggling financially, the scheme’s 
methodology was particularly effective. 
54. 
As part and parcel of the scheme’s goals, Epstein’s colleagues and acquaintances 
were involved in the scheme and benefited from the scheme by virtue of receiving sexual favors 
and inappropriate, illegal, and otherwise commercial sexual services provided by Epstein’s 
victims such that the corrupt intent of this scheme involved males other than Epstein himself. 
As a direct and proximate result of the methodology of the deviant scheme and the goals of 
sexual exploitation of the women recruited and victimized, Plaintiff was subject to unwanted 
touching of her breasts and genitals, other sensitive areas of her body, required to perform acts 
of a sexual nature against her will and subjected to genital penetration and otherwise sexually 
degraded, abused, insulted, coerced, and injured, experience resulting in confusion, emotional 
distress, mental pain and suffering, shame, humiliation, loss of the enjoyment of life, 
inconvenience, and other injuries to body, mind and soul.  
55. 
Epstein and the Corporate Defendants by and through their employees and agents 
substantially contributed to proximately cause injury to the Plaintiff as aforementioned.

Civ. 9610 (PAE) 
ORDER 
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:  
On December 23, 2019, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Under Rule 15(a)(1)(B), a plaintiff has 21 days after the 
service of a motion under Rule 12(b) to amend the complaint once as a matter of course. 
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that plaintiff shall file any amended complaint by 
January 13, 2020.  No further opportunities to amend will ordinarily be granted.  If plaintiff does 
amend, by February 3, 2020, defendants shall: (1) file an answer; (2) file a new motion to 
dismiss; or (3) submit a letter to the Court, copying plaintiff, stating that they rely on the 
previously filed motion to dismiss.1 
It is further ORDERED that if no amended complaint is filed, plaintiff shall serve any 
opposition to the motion to dismiss by January 13, 2020.  Defendants’ reply, if any, shall be 
served by January 27, 2020.  At the time any reply is served, the moving party shall supply the 
Court with two (2) courtesy copies of all motion papers by mailing or delivering them to the 
Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York, New York 10007. 
If defendants file a new motion to dismiss or rely on their previous motion, plaintiff’s 
opposition will be due 14 days thereafter, and defendants’ reply, if any, will be due seven days 
after that.

Dear Judge Freeman: 
We write to you pursuant to Local Civil Rule 1.4. This firm was retained as local counsel 
for Jane Doe 17 in the above-referenced matter. We recently received correspondence from the 
client indicating her desire to discharge us as her counsel. She will continue to be represented by 
the other attorneys who have appeared on her behalf, namely David H. Brodie and Laura Starr of 
Weisman, Brodie, Starr & Margolies, P.A., and Alan Goldfarb and David Appleby of Alan 
Goldfarb, P.A. The case is presently stayed per Hon. Paul A. Engelmayer’s order of January 9, 
2020, which permitted the stay pending potential participation in the Epstein Victims’ 
Compensation Program. 
Based on the above, we respectfully request that Your Honor enter an order, pursuant to 
Local Civil Rule 1.4, relieving myself and Buzin Law, P.C. of representation of Jane Doe 17. We 
waive and otherwise renounce any right to a retaining or charging lien. 
This letter motion is being served upon Jane Doe 17 through counsel and upon all other 
parties.
