SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
___________________________________________x 
TEALA DAVIES, 
Case No. 19 Civ. 10788 
Plaintiff, 
COMPLAINT 
-against- 
AND JURY DEMAND 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as EXECUTORS OF THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY E.  
EPSTEIN, 
Defendants.   
___________________________________________x 
Plaintiff Teala Davies, by and through her attorneys, Cuti Hecker Wang LLP and 
Allred, Maroko & Goldberg, for her Complaint alleges as follows: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1. 
When Plaintiff Teala Davies was just seventeen years old, living on her 
own and working full-time to support herself, Jeffrey Epstein preyed open her, manipulated her 
to be completely dependent on him, and sexually abused her. 
2. 
Epstein was presented to Teala as someone who had learned about her 
challenging circumstances and had the resources and interest to assist her – including by helping 
her to attend college and study abroad to see the world.  Teala was introduced to Epstein by her 
sister, but Teala was unaware that Epstein had been manipulating and sexually abusing her sister, 
as Epstein’s total power and control over Teala’s sister made it impossible for her to say 
anything about it. 
3. 
During their early interactions, Epstein led Teala to believe that he would 
help her achieve her dream of becoming a translator, and he arranged for Teala to study abroad 
in Spain.  Teala gave up her job and her apartment in anticipation of this life-changing 
opportunity, leaving her completely dependent on Epstein and his continuing generosity. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/21/19     Page 1 of 13

4. 
Epstein exploited this power over seventeen-year-old Teala to sexually 
abuse her repeatedly.  Ultimately, he raped and sexually assaulted her frequently and in a variety 
of places and settings, including by trafficking Teala to his homes in New York, New Mexico, 
Florida, the Virgin Islands, and France.  He treated her like an object for his sexual gratification.   
5. 
These assaults caused Teala to feel completely intimidated and fearful.  
She froze up and began to cry, able to think only about trying to survive.   
6. 
Epstein continued to exert total control over Teala’s life for two more 
years, trafficking her around the country and the world and sexually abusing her on a frequent 
basis.  During this time, Teala felt deep despair and isolation, and developed a severe and self-
destructive eating disorder.  Still within his power and control, Teala confided in Epstein about 
her disorder, mistakenly believing that she could trust him.  Rather than help her, Epstein cast 
her out within hours of her admission, sending her back to a place where she no longer had a 
home, a job or any resources or support.   
7. 
Epstein’s abuse destroyed Ms. Davies’s life.  She sank into alcoholism and 
other self-harm, unable to trust others but not understanding why.   
8. 
At the same time, like so many childhood sex abuse victims, she did not 
comprehend how it had undone her or her life, or how it impacted her. 
9. 
Now a working mother of three, Ms. Davies is still just beginning to 
understand the depth of the injuries from the sexual assaults that Epstein inflicted on her 
beginning when she was seventeen.  She feels the toll of Epstein’s abuse every day.  She feels 
dysfunctional, on-edge, overwhelmed, and like she is on the verge of a psychological 
breakdown.  She has difficulty sleeping and often has flashbacks to Epstein’s abuse. 
10. 
Epstein died in August 2019, before Ms. Davies or the countless other 
girls he preyed upon could obtain a modicum of justice.  
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/21/19     Page 2 of 13

11. 
Ms. Davies brings this action seeking, at last, some remedy for the 
egregious abuse that Epstein inflicted when she was a child. 
PARTIES 
12.

because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this 
District.   
16.

County at the time of his death. 
20. 
Epstein conducted substantial business operations in New York.  
21.

places of business in New York. 
22. 
Epstein owned substantial real property assets in New York, including the 
townhouse located at 9 East 71st Street in Manhattan, which is valued at $55 million or more.    
23. 
New York was the epicenter of Epstein’s criminal sex-trafficking 
enterprise.  For years, Epstein and his agents took actions in New York in order to arrange for

for him.  Epstein’s trafficking and abuse of Ms. Davies was part of that New York-based 
criminal enterprise.   
24. 
From his Manhattan townhouse, Epstein directed a vast network of agents 
in recruiting minor girls to be brought to him for his sexual use.   
25. 
Epstein sexually abused many minor girls, including Ms. Davies, in his

26. 
On many occasions, Epstein and his agents made phone calls from New 
York to schedule appointments for minor girls to come to Epstein’s residences outside of New 
York in order to perform commercial sexual acts for Epstein.   
27. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein and/or his agents were present in 
New York when they took various actions to facilitate the trafficking of Ms. Davies for the 
purpose of performing sexual acts for Epstein. 
JURY DEMAND 
28. 
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all of her claims in this action.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
29. 
When Plaintiff Teala Davies was seventeen years old, Jeffrey Epstein 
preyed upon her, manipulating her to be completely dependent on him and then sexually 
assaulting and raping her on numerous occasions.  Epstein continued this pattern of manipulation 
and frequent sexual assault for years, leaving Ms. Davies with deep emotional wounds that she is 
still just beginning to grapple with.  
30. 
By age seventeen, Teala had already lived through tremendously 
challenging circumstances.  At eleven years old, she was homeless for a year, staying with 
various friends and seeing her mother only about once a week.  At fifteen, Teala began working 
in order to support herself.  At sixteen, Teala’s living situation was again unstable, and she 
moved to Los Angeles to live with her older sister. 
31. 
Teala initially tried to go to school in Los Angeles, but was unable to 
continue due to the need to work full-time to support herself.  Teala lived with her sister and 
worked at a hair salon, eventually getting her GED.  By the time Teala met Epstein, she had 
already been living on her own and working full-time for a year-and-a-half.   
32. 
Teala’s sister – who is five years older than her – had previously met 
Epstein and traveled with him.  Teala’s sister described Epstein to her as a generous wealthy 
person, and reported that he often helped make it possible for people to attend college.  Teala’s 
sister reported that Epstein had heard Teala’s story and that he wanted to help.   
33. 
Unbeknownst to Teala, Epstein had been manipulating and sexually 
abusing her sister.  Teala had no idea that her sister had been involved in any type of sexual 
interactions with Epstein.  Epstein’s power and control of Teala’s sister made it impossible for 
her to say anything. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/21/19     Page 5 of 13

34. 
Teala met Epstein for the first time in 2002, when she was seventeen years 
old.  Epstein was visiting Los Angeles, and Teala drove with her sister to meet him at the Hotel 
Bel-Air.   
35. 
During that first meeting, Epstein lay on a bed in his spacious hotel suite, 
fully clothed.  He asked Teala’s sister to massage his feet, then encouraged Teala to join her.  
Afterwards, Epstein took them shopping, and insisted on buying several items for Teala. 
36. 
After that meeting, Epstein kept in touch with Teala through frequent 
phone calls.  Epstein veered the conversation toward Teala’s career goals and how Epstein could 
help her achieve them.  He purported to want to help her and guide her to a better life. 
37. 
Epstein offered to send Teala to school to learn hairdressing, but Teala 
made clear that this was not what she wanted to do in the long term.  Teala explained that she 
had a passion for languages and for people, and that her dream was to be a translator.   
38. 
Epstein claimed that he wanted to help Teala study to become a translator.  
He suggested that he would pay for Teala to study in Spain for a semester.  Soon after, Epstein 
helped her to obtain a letter of recommendation from her high school counselor and helped her 
get accepted to study at the University of Madrid. 
39. 
Teala was over the moon, feeling her dreams were coming true.  Epstein 
made sure she felt that it was all his doing. 
40. 
Teala prepared for this exciting opportunity to study abroad and pursue 
her dream career.  She gave notice at her hairdressing job and gave up her apartment in Los 
Angeles, preparing to move to Spain.   
41. 
Before Teala left for her school program, however, Epstein began what 
would become a long pattern of using her as his sexual object. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/21/19     Page 6 of 13

42. 
In approximately the summer of 2002, Epstein flew Teala and her sister to 
his ranch in New Mexico.  Teala felt no reason to be wary of Epstein.  He had been kind in their 
first meeting and had acted with generosity towards her.   
43. 
When Teala got to Epstein’s ranch, Epstein’s close associates Ghislaine 
Maxwell and Sarah Kellen were there.  Maxwell asked Teala questions about herself and took 
her horseback riding.  Kellen invited Teala to go swimming.   
44. 
After Teala swam, Epstein asked her to go into a massage room along with 
Kellen.  Kellen began massaging Epstein, and Teala innocently joined in, as she had when her 
sister massaged Epstein’s feet the first time. 
45. 
At that point, Epstein began fondling Kellen and took off Kellen’s shirt.  
Teala became very uncomfortable, as the massage had quickly and unexpectedly turned into a 
sexual encounter.  Epstein reached inside Teala’s bathing suit and fondled her genitals.  Teala 
began crying, but Epstein continued to grope her as he masturbated to completion. 
46. 
Teala felt extremely vulnerable.  Epstein had arranged the circumstances 
to ensure that Teala was completely at his mercy.  Teala had given up her job and her apartment 
in order to travel to Spain at Epstein’s expense.  If Epstein decided to rethink his generosity at 
any point, Teala would have had nothing, and would have been left homeless and jobless once 
again, after being brought so close to her dream.  Even though Epstein had preyed upon her and 
sexually assaulted her, Teala understood she had no choice but to submit to him.  His power over 
her was all-encompassing. 
47. 
Epstein viciously exploited this power dynamic.  In the summer and fall of 
2002, he flew seventeen-year-old Teala to his homes in New York, Florida, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, sexually assaulting her in each of those locations. 
48. 
In or around December 2002, Epstein flew Teala to stay at his townhouse 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/21/19     Page 7 of 13

located at 9 East 71st Street in Manhattan.  While they were in the dining room of the townhouse, 
Epstein without warning stuck his hand down Teala’s pants and fondled her genitals.  It was as if 
she were his toy.    
49. 
In or around that same month, at Epstein’s home in Florida, Epstein crept 
into Teala’s bedroom while she was sleeping and raped her.   
50. 
Also around that same month, at the private island Epstein owned in the 
Virgin Islands, Epstein ordered Teala to massage him, then proceeded to sexually assault her in 
the massage room. 
51. 
Teala finally traveled to Spain to study in or around the end of 2002.   
52. 
In early 2003, when Teala was still seventeen years old, Epstein flew her 
from Madrid to Paris.  At his home in Paris, Epstein again crept into Teala’s bedroom while she 
slept and raped her. 
53. 
When Epstein inflicted these sexual assaults on Teala, she felt completely 
intimidated and fearful.  All she could think about was trying to survive.  Her body froze up, and 
she began crying. 
54. 
After Teala’s semester in Madrid, she had no home and no job.  Instead, 
Epstein brought her to live a nomadic lifestyle in his close orbit.  Teala traveled around the 
country with Epstein and his entourage, which generally included Maxwell, Kellen, and others.  
Virtually every few days, Epstein would bring Teala to a different home of his, including his 
Manhattan townhouse and throughout the country, where he continued to sexually assault her on 
a frequent basis.  Epstein regularly used his private planes to traffic Teala into various locations 
for his sexual abuse of her.    
55. 
Epstein had power over every aspect of Teala’s life, and he had groomed 
Teala to be completely dependent on him and completely submissive to him.  Epstein treated 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/21/19     Page 8 of 13

Teala as a sexual object, using her body for his sexual gratification frequently and at his whim.   
56. 
Eventually, by approximately 2004, Epstein arranged for Teala to live in 
an apartment at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan, just blocks from his townhouse, when she 
was in New York.  
57. 
This pattern – of Epstein exercising total control over Teala’s life and 
using her as a sexual object whenever he desired – continued throughout 2003 and 2004.  Epstein 
arranged for Teala to study abroad two more times, apparently when he grew bored with having 
her around.  Each time, Teala lived in this nomadic orbit with Epstein both before and after 
traveling to attend school.  
58. 
Epstein also tried to introduce Teala to his “friends” and essentially offer 
her as a sexual object to them.  In one instance, Epstein had Teala spend time with a well-known 
Hollywood producer, who then demanded and attempted to engage in abusive sexual behavior.  
Teala barely escaped. 
59. 
By 2004, Teala felt deep despair and isolation.  There was no one she 
could talk to about what Epstein was doing to her.  Instead, Epstein had ensured that she thought 
he was the only person in her life whom she could trust.   
60. 
Teala developed a severe eating disorder, for the first time, in or around 
2004.  After she had struggled with the disorder for six months or a year, it became too much to 
bear.  She confided in Epstein about the eating disorder, still manipulated into thinking he was 
someone she could trust. 
61. 
Instead, from the moment Epstein learned of Teala’s self-destructive 
behavior, he immediately cast her out.  Literally within hours of Teala anxiously confessing to 
Epstein that she did not know why, but had a compulsive need to binge and purge, he threw her 
out.  He instructed her to pack up her belongings and arranged for her to be flown to Arizona.   
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/21/19     Page 9 of 13

62. 
But there was nothing left for her in Arizona.  She still had no idea what 
had happened to her and felt it was all her fault. 
63. 
Epstein’s abuse destroyed Teala’s life.  After being cast out by him after 
two years of a lavish, if abusive, lifestyle, she sank into alcoholism and other self-harm, unable 
to trust others but not understanding why.   
64. 
Ms. Davies is now a working mother raising three children.  She is still 
struggling to put her life back together.  
65. 
Ms. Davies is still in the nascent stages of understanding the deep and 
lasting injuries that Epstein’s pattern of abuse has caused her, but she feels the effects every day.  
She feels dysfunctional, on-edge, and constantly overwhelmed.  She has difficulty sleeping.  She 
often has flashbacks to Epstein’s sexual assaults.  She feels like she is on the verge of a 
psychological breakdown. 
66. 
This action is timely under the law of each jurisdiction whose law might 
be determined to govern Ms. Davies’s claims or aspects thereof, including without limitation 
New York, New Mexico, Florida, and the Virgin Islands.  
67. 
Ms. Davies still has not disclosed her abuse to a licensed medical or 
mental health care provider in the context of receiving health care from the provider.  
68. 
Ms. Davies is still just beginning to process and understand the full extent 
of the injuries that Epstein’s abuse had caused her and the connection between Epstein’s abuse 
and the emotional and psychological injuries she had experienced. 
69. 
This action is timely under New York law because it falls within New 
York CPLR 214-g and is brought during the one-year time period set forth in that section.  The 
claims brought herein allege intentional and negligent acts and/or omissions for physical, 
psychological, and other injury suffered as a result of conduct that would constitute sexual 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 1     Filed 11/21/19     Page 10 of 13

offenses as defined in Article 130 of the New York Penal Law, and such acts and/or omissions 
were committed against Ms. Davies when she was less than eighteen years of age.  
70. 
Epstein’s conduct constitutes “childhood sexual abuse” within the 
meaning of New Mexico Stat. § 37-1-30 and “abuse” within the meaning of Florida Stat. § 
95.11(7).

Mary Doe, and Teala Davies, the “Parties”) in the referenced actions.  Pursuant to the Court’s 
direction at the initial conference, we write on behalf of all Parties to report to the Court 
regarding status on these actions.  
First, with respect to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”), Plaintiffs’

substantive changes to it and to confer with the Program’s designers and administrator, and are 
considering whether their clients will participate. 
Second, with respect to the litigation of these three actions, the Parties conducted their Rule

to anonymity (to the extent that is relevant, for two of the three actions) and a Protective Order; 
the Parties further agree to exchange initial disclosures by January 23, 2020, proposed

DEBRA FREEMAN, United States Magistrate Judge: 
The above-referenced cases - all brought by plaintiffs claiming that they were sexually 
abused by Jeffrey Epstein and seeking damages from his estate - have been neither consolidated 
for any purpose, nor designated as "related" by the Court. Nonetheless, these cases (together 
with certain other, similar cases, not listed above) have been referred to the undersigned for 
general pretrial supervision, so that discovery - and potentially settlement - may be coordinated 
as reasonable. While, at the parties' request, discovery in the other Jeffrey Epstein cases referred 
to this Court has been stayed pending a further report on the parties' settlement efforts, the 
parties to each of the above-referenced cases have requested, by submissions dated January 10, 
2020, that this Court set a discovery schedule. This Court's having reviewed the parties' 
submissions, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
1. 
In each of the above-referenced cases in which the parties have not yet submitted 
a jointly proposed discovery plan pursuant to Rule 26( t) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
the parties are directed to submit a proposed discovery schedule for this Court's review no later 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 15     Filed 01/14/20     Page 2 of 2
than February 6, 2020. This submission should address all of the matters set out in Rule 26(t)(3), 
and should specifically include proposed deadlines for: 
a. 
service of initial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(l); 
b. 
service of initial document requests and interrogatories; 
c. 
any motion for joinder of other parties or amendment of the pleadings; 
d. 
completion of fact discovery; and 
e. 
expert disclosures and the completion of expert discovery, if any. 
. 
. 
2. 
As to each of the above-referenced cases, this Court will hold a pretrial 
conference pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on February 11, 2020, at 
10:00 a.m., in Courtroom 17 A at the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY 
10007. The parties should be aware, however, that the mere fact that this Court will be holding a 
single, joint case-management conference does not necessarily mean that this Court will set an 
identical discovery schedule in each case. At the conference, counsel should be prepared to 
address whether there are reasons why these cases should be treated differently for scheduling 
purposes.

Re: 
Teala Davies v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Executors of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:19-cv-10788 (GHW) (DCF) 
Dear Judge Woods: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action.  We 
write pursuant to Your Honor’s Individual Rules 1(A) and 2(C)(i) to set forth the grounds for the 
Co-Executors’ anticipated motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss the time-barred 
claims and punitive damages demand in Plaintiff Teala Davies’ Complaint (ECF No. 1). 
1. Plaintiff alleges torts occurring over 15 years ago in NY and other jurisdictions.   
Plaintiff, who claims Arizona residency, alleges that Mr. Epstein, now deceased, sexually 
assaulted her from 2002 to 2004 in Florida, New Mexico, New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands 
(“USVI”) and France. (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 12, 17, 29, 34, 59-61.)  Plaintiff alleges causes of action for 
battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Id. ¶¶ 71 – 82.) Plaintiff seeks, 
among other things, “punitive damages in an amount to be determined.” (Id. p. 12.) 
2. Plaintiff’s causes of action are partially time-barred. 
CPLR § 202 provides that, when a non-New York resident such as Plaintiff sues on a 
cause of action accruing outside New York, the complaint must be filed timely under the statute 
of limitations of both New York and the jurisdiction where the cause of action accrued.  A claim 
that is untimely under one or both of the two jurisdictions must be dismissed. 
Plaintiff turned 18 at some point in 2003.  (Compl. ¶ 34.)  Plaintiff alleges she was 
sexually assaulted by Mr. Epstein until 2004, i.e., when Plaintiff was an adult (Compl. ¶¶ 34, 59-
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 16     Filed 01/21/20     Page 1 of 4
troutmariP 
sanders 

January 21, 2020 
Page 2 
61).  Accordingly, excluding Plaintiff’s alleged torts subject to the New York Child Victims Act,1 if 
any, Plaintiff’s causes of action sounding in battery must be commenced within one year of 
accrual (CPLR § 215(3)); or, if Plaintiff’s claims sound in personal injury, within three years 
(CPLR § 214(5)).  Therefore, under New York law, Plaintiff’s claims arising from her alleged 
sexual abuse expired in 2007 at the latest. 
Plaintiff’s claims based on alleged torts occurring outside New York also expired long 
ago, including torts that occurred while she was a minor, as follows:  (Florida) for torts occurring 
while she was a minor, the later of within 7 years after she reached age of majority (i.e., by 
2010), within 4 years after she left the dependency of Mr. Epstein (2008 at the latest),2 or within 
years from the time she discovered both the injury and the causal relationship between the 
injury and the abuse (Fla. Stat. § 95.11(7));3 and, after Plaintiff reached age of majority, within 4 
years (i.e., sometime in 2007) (Fla. Stat. § 95.11 (3)(O)); (New Mexico) for torts occurring while 
she was a minor, the later of the “first instant” of Plaintiff’s 24th birthday (i.e., sometime in 2009) 
or 3 years from the date that Plaintiff first disclosed her childhood sexual abuse to a licensed 
medical or mental health care provider in the context of receiving health care (N.M. Stat. § 37-1-
30) (plaintiff alleges she never made such a disclosure (Compl. ¶ 67)); and, after Plaintiff 
reached age of majority, 3 years (i.e., in 2006) (N.M. Stat. § 37-1-8); (USVI) when Plaintiff 
turned 23 (i.e., sometime in 2008) (5 V.I.C. §§ 31(5)(A), 36(a)(1)). 
Although Plaintiff suggests she is only suing on claims based on torts that occurred while 
she was still a minor (Compl. ¶ 69), she also alleges Mr. Epstein abused her “for years” (Id. at ¶ 
29).  The Court is not required to reconcile Plaintiff’s contradictory allegations. See Whitley v. 
Bowden, No. 17-CV-3564 (KMK), 2018 WL 2170313, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2018) (“‘a court is 
neither obligated to reconcile nor accept the contradictory allegations in the pleadings as true in 
deciding a motion to dismiss.’” (citation omitted)). 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s claims based on torts occurring in New York after she reached majority, 
as well as her claims based on torts occurring in New Mexico, Florida and the USVI – 
regardless of whether she was a minor at the time – must be dismissed.   
The Child Victims Act created a one-year window period in which civil claims alleging damages “suffered 
as a result of conduct which would constitute a sexual offense as defined in article one hundred thirty of 
the penal law committed against a child less than eighteen years of age” may be filed despite the statute 
of limitations having already run. CPLR § 214-g (emphasis added).  
Plaintiff alleges Mr. Epstein “cast her out” in 2004. (Compl. ¶¶ 59-61.)  Therefore, Plaintiff could not have 
depended on him after that time.   
Plaintiff’s allegations that she is only now beginning to “process” her injuries (Compl. ¶¶ 65, 68) is not 
equivalent to alleging tolling due to her belated discovery of such injuries.  She makes no such allegation.

January 21, 2020

3. Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law.  
Courts in this District regularly grant motions to dismiss claims for punitive damages.  
See, e.g., The Cookware Co. (USA), LLC v. Austin, No. 15 Civ. 5796, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
177691, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2016) (Batts, J.) (granting motion to dismiss claim for punitive 
damages without leave to replead because allegations regarding defendant’s bad faith conduct 
were conclusory and did not rise to required level of malice); SJB v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 
Civ. 6653, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13227, at *25-26 (S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2004) (Buchwald, J.) 
(granting motion to dismiss punitive damages claims because punitive damages were not 
statutorily available); Blasetti v. Pietropolo, 213 F. Supp. 2d 425, 431-32 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) 
(Kaplan, J.) (“[the] claim for punitive damages … is dismissed.”). 
Here, Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages must be dismissed as a matter of law 
because none of the jurisdictions where the alleged torts against Plaintiff occurred permit 
punitive damages against the personal representatives of a decedent tortfeasor’s estate. See
Poindexter v. Zacharzewski, 18-civ-14155, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189861, at *6 (Nov. 5, 2018 
S.D. Fla.) (“Florida law prohibits recovery of punitive damages from the estate of a wrongdoer 
who is deceased.”); Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 117 N.M. 337, 346 (N.M. 1994) 
(“punishment and deterrence are not accomplished by enabling recovery of punitive damages 
from the estate of deceased tortfeasors.”); NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1) (“For any injury, an action 
may be brought or continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but punitive 
damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought to recover 
damages for personal injury.” (emphasis added)). That is also the law in most U.S. jurisdictions, 
as reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Restat. (Second) Of Torts § 908 cmt. a 
(“Punitive damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor.”). 
See also Powell v. Chi-Co’s Distrib., No. ST-13-TOR-14, 2014 V.I. LEXIS 21, at *5 n.13 
(U.S.V.I. Super. Ct. Apr. 3, 2014) (Section 908(2) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts “reflects 
the common law of this jurisdiction”).4,5
USVI courts apply a “Banks analysis” to determine U.S.V.I. common law.  Banks v. Int’l Rental & 
Leasing Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 979 (V.I. 2011).  The Banks analysis includes consideration of three factors: 
(1) whether any USVI courts have previously adopted a particular rule; (2) the position taken by a majority 
of courts of other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, which approach represents the soundest rule for 
the USVI.  Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Connor, No. S. CT. CIV. 2013-0095, 2014 WL 702639, at *1 (V.I. 
Feb. 24, 2014).  Each Banks factor favors the Estate: (1) pre-Banks, USVI courts expressed approval for 
the general rule that punitive damages cannot be recovered against the personal representatives of a 
wrongdoer’s estate (see, e.g., Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 (D.V.I. 2009) 
(considering the inverse issue)); (2) a majority of courts from other jurisdictions preclude punitive 
damages against the personal representatives of a wrongdoer’s estate (2 Linda L. Schlueter, Punitive 
Damages § 20.4 (7th ed. 2015)); and (3) post-Banks, USVI courts have held Restatement § 908 
represents the soundest rule for the USVI (see Powell, supra.).   
French law does not recognize punitive damages. See 2 Linda L. Schlueter, Punitive Damages § 22.4 
(7th ed. 2015) (citing Rouhette, The Availability of Punitive Damages in Europe: Growing Trend or 
Nonexistent Concept, 74 Def. Coun. J. 320 (2007)).

Re: 
Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
Your Honor: 
We represent Plaintiff Teala Davies, and write on behalf of all parties.    
On January 21, 2020, Defendants submitted a pre-motion letter to 
Judge Woods proposing to file a motion to dismiss.  (ECF 16).  On January 22, 
Judge Woods issued an Amended Order Referring Case to Magistrate Judge 
clarifying that dispositive motions in this matter will be referred to Your Honor for 
Report & Recommendation.  (ECF 17).  It is our understanding of Your Honor’s 
Individual Practices that no pre-motion letters are required for motions other than 
discovery motions, though Plaintiff’s counsel is of course happy/prepared to submit 
one should Your Honor prefer that. 
Accordingly, we write 1) to seek clarification that Plaintiff need not 
submit a letter in response to Defendants’ January 21 pre-motion letter addressed 
to Judge Woods, and 2) to propose the following briefing schedule for Defendants’ 
motion: 
- 
Defendants’ motion papers to be filed by February 25, 2020; 
- 
Plaintiffs’ opposition papers to be filed by March 17, 2020; 
- 
Defendants’ reply papers to be filed by March 31, 2020. 
We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to this matter.

Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
Your Honor: 
We represent the plaintiffs in the three above-referenced cases.  As 
directed in Your Honor’s Order dated January 14, 2020, we write jointly with 
counsel for Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), to provide a proposed discovery 
schedule for these cases.  The area where the parties have not reached agreement is 
indicated in italics, and each side’s position is set forth below. 
1. Initial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) were exchanged on January 23, 2020. 
2. Plaintiffs will provide HIPAA-compliant medical records release authorizations to 
Defendants no later than 14 days from Defendants’ request, provided such date is 
not earlier than February 28, 2020. 
3. The parties shall serve initial document requests and interrogatories by 30 days 
from the Court’s entry of the discovery schedule.  Plaintiffs served Defendants 
with their initial document requests and interrogatories but the parties have 
agreed that Defendants have until February 28, 2020 to respond thereto. 
4. Any motion for joinder of other parties or amendment of the pleadings shall be 
made by 30 days from the Court’s entry of the discovery schedule.   

PAGE 2 OF 4 
5. Deadlines for fact and expert discovery   
Plaintiffs’ Position 
Plaintiffs’ position is that the default timelines set forth in both Judge Engelmayer’s 
and Judge Woods’s Civil Case Management Plan and Scheduling Orders should be 
used, which provide for: 
o Fact discovery to be completed 120 days after the Court’s entry of the 
discovery schedule 
o Expert disclosures to be made by the fact discovery deadline 
o Rebuttal expert disclosures to be made 14 days after expert disclosures 
o Expert discovery to be completed 45 days after the close of fact discovery 
Both Judge Engelmayer’s and Judge Woods’s Civil Case Management Plan and 
Scheduling Orders indicate that those timelines be used unless the case presents 
“unique complexities or exceptional circumstances.”  Plaintiffs have few documents 
in their possession, and expect that these cases will not involve an unusual number 
of depositions.  Plaintiffs do not believe that the fact that the Co-Executors are 
defendants in multiple lawsuits makes the discovery process in these lawsuits more 
complex or time-consuming.  To the contrary, the fact that multiple lawsuits have 
been filed (including prior to these actions) suggests that the Co-Executors should 
have been working to identify and locate responsive documents many months ago. 
Co-Executors’ Position 
The Co-Executors’ position is that the parties should adopt a compromise schedule.   
The Co-Executors disagree that the cases Plaintiffs filed do not present “unique 
complexities or exceptional circumstances.”  Among other things, there are more 
than twenty cases pending in various jurisdictions against the Co-Executors 
concerning various time frames, parties, non-parties and alleged conduct.  Also, the 
Defendants are the Co-Executors of a large Estate, not an individual alleged 
tortfeasor.  As a result, discovery in these matters requires more flexibility than 
typical lawsuits.   
Separately, it does not make sense to require that the parties’ expert disclosures 
coincide with completion of fact discovery. The experts should have at least 30 days 
from the close of fact discovery to proffer initial reports. Nor is it reasonable for 
experts to proffer rebuttal reports a mere 14 days after receiving initial reports from 
each other. Thirty days is more appropriate. 
The original dates the Co-Executors proposed and which Plaintiff rejected, as well 
as the Co-Executors’ compromise proposals, which Plaintiff also rejected, are as 
follows: 
o Completion of fact discovery:  160 days from the Court’s entry of the 
discovery schedule. (Compromise proposal: 140 days.) 

PAGE 3 OF 4 
o Expert disclosures and completion of expert discovery: 240 days from the 
Court’s entry of the discovery schedule. (Compromise proposal: 200 days.) 
o Expert reports due 30 days from the close of fact discovery; and 
rebuttal reports due 30 days thereafter. 
6. The subjects on which discovery may be needed, when discovery should be 
completed, and whether discovery should be conducted in phases or be limited to 
or focused on particular issues 
The general subjects of each action are: (1) Mr. Epstein’s alleged abuse of 
plaintiffs; and (2) the plaintiffs’ alleged damages.  We see no reason to stage 
discovery. 
7. Any issues about disclosure, discovery, or preservation of electronically stored 
information, including the form or forms in which it should be produced 
The parties will confer about an ESI protocol. 
8. Any issues about claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation 
materials, including—if the parties agree on a procedure to assert these claims 
after production—whether to ask the court to include their agreement in an 
order under Federal Rule of Evidence 502 
The parties are conferring about confidentiality orders in these cases, and expect 
to submit proposed orders to the Court soon, which will include a standard 
clawback provision regarding privileged materials. 
9. What changes should be made in the limitations on discovery imposed under 
these rules or by local rule, and what other limitations should be imposed 
The parties have no proposed changes at this time. 
10.  Any other orders that the court should issue under Rule 26(c) or under Rule 
16(b) and (c) 
The parties have no proposed orders at this time other than the protective orders 
mentioned above. 
* * * 
Finally, with respect to Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 
(GHW)(DCF), in the Memo Endorsement dated January 28, 2020 (ECF 19), Your 
Honor directed the parties to submit an update addressing the status of settlement 
discussions before the Court sets a briefing scheduling for Defendants’ proposed 
motion to dismiss.  Plaintiff remains open to the possibility of participating in the 

PAGE 4 OF 4 
proposed voluntary compensation program if and when such program is approved, 
but it has not yet been approved.  The parties have not yet had substantive 
settlement discussions.  
We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to these matters.  
Very truly yours, 
 /s/ Mariann Meier Wang

Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Co-Executors of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), submit this memorandum of law in support of their 
motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF 
No. 1) to the extent it is time-barred and Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages because it is 
prohibited as a matter of law. 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
This action is largely time-barred. Plaintiff alleges that Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Decedent”), 
now deceased, sexually assaulted her from 2002, when she was 17, to 2004, in Florida, New 
Mexico, New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”), and France. (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 12, 17, 29, 34, 
59-61.) Plaintiff alleges causes of action for battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional 
distress. (Id. ¶¶ 71–82.) Plaintiff seeks, among other things, “punitive damages in an amount to be 
determined.” (Id. p. 12.)  
Excluding Plaintiff’s alleged torts occurring in New York when she was 17 and thus subject 
to New York’s Child Victims Act (“CVA”),1 Plaintiff’s claims expired many years ago. Under 
New York law, for example, Plaintiff’s claims arising from her alleged sexual abuse as an adult 
expired in 2007 at the latest. Therefore, all of the Plaintiff’s non-CVA claims must be dismissed.  
Plaintiff’s demand for punitive damages must also be dismissed as a matter of law. Each 
jurisdiction where the alleged torts occurred bars recovery of punitive damages from a decedent 
tortfeasor’s estate—i.e., exactly what Plaintiff seeks here. 
1The CVA created a one-year window period, commencing in August 2019, in which civil claims alleging damages 
“suffered as a result of conduct which would constitute a sexual offense as defined in article one hundred thirty of the 
penal law committed against a child less than eighteen years of age” may be filed, despite the statute of limitations 
having already run. CPLR § 214-g (emphasis added).

STATEMENT OF ALLEGED FACTS 
A.
Plaintiff Alleges Torts Occurring Over 15 Years Ago In New York And 
Other Jurisdictions, Starting When She Was Age Seventeen 
Plaintiff, who claims Arizona residency, alleges that in 2002, when she was 17, her sister, 
who is five years older, introduced Plaintiff to Decedent, describing him as generous and desiring 
to help Plaintiff attend college. (Compl. ¶¶ 32, 34.) Plaintiff further alleges that, starting in 2002 
and ending in 2004, Decedent sexually assaulted her in Florida, New Mexico, New York, the 
USVI, and France. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 12, 17, 29, 34, 59-61.) Although Plaintiff suggests she is only suing 
on claims based on torts that occurred while she was still a minor (id. ¶ 69), she also alleges 
Decedent abused her “for years” (id. ¶ 29). Plaintiff largely fails to articulate which alleged torts 
happened when and in which jurisdictions.  
Plaintiff asserts three causes of action: battery (First Cause of Action); assault (Second 
Cause of Action); and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Third Cause of Action). (Id. ¶¶ 
71–82.) As noted above, Plaintiff seeks punitive damages in an unspecified amount. (Id. p. 12.)  
ARGUMENT 
A.
Legal Standard: Plaintiff’s Legal Conclusions, Labels And Formulaic 
Recitations Of The Elements Of Her Causes Of Action Are Insufficient To 
State A Claim 
 “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, 
accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 
662, 678 (2009). While a Court must normally accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations 
in a complaint and draw all inferences in a plaintiff’s favor, those principles are “inapplicable to 
legal conclusions.” Id. at 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 556 
(2007)). Thus, a pleading that offers only “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of 
the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (2007).  Nor is the Court 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 27     Filed 02/28/20     Page 7 of 14

required to reconcile Plaintiff’s contradictory allegations concerning whether she is suing only for 
alleged torts that occurred when she was 17, or for sexual abuse allegedly committed when she 
was an adult. See Whitley v. Bowden, No. 17-CV-3564 (KMK), 2018 WL 2170313, at *11 
(S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2018) (“‘a court is neither obligated to reconcile nor accept the contradictory 
allegations in the pleadings as true in deciding a motion to dismiss.’” (citation omitted)). 
B.
Most Of Plaintiff’s Claims Expired Many Years Ago 
CPLR § 202 provides that, when a non-New York resident such as Plaintiff sues on a cause 
of action accruing outside New York, the complaint must be timely filed under the applicable 
statutes of limitations of both New York and the jurisdiction where the cause of action accrued. A 
claim that is untimely under one or both of the two jurisdictions must be dismissed.  
Plaintiff turned 18 at some point in 2003. (Compl. ¶ 34.) Plaintiff alleges she was sexually 
assaulted by Decedent until 2004, i.e., when Plaintiff was an adult. (Id. ¶¶ 34, 59-61.) Excluding 
Plaintiff’s alleged torts subject to the CVA (i.e., torts occurring in New York when she was under 
18), Plaintiff’s causes of action sounding in battery must be commenced within one year of accrual 
(CPLR § 215(3)); or, if Plaintiff’s claims sound in personal injury, within three years (CPLR § 
214(5)). Therefore, under New York law, Plaintiff’s non-CVA claims arising from her alleged 
sexual abuse expired in 2007 at the latest. 
Plaintiff’s claims based on alleged torts occurring outside New York also expired long ago 
under the laws of those jurisdictions, including non-New York torts that occurred while she was a 
minor (if any), as follows: (Florida) for torts occurring while she was a minor, the later of within 
years after she reached the age of majority (i.e., by 2010), within 4 years after she left Decedent’s 
dependency (2008 at the latest),2 or within 4 years from the time she discovered both the injury 
Plaintiff alleges Decedent “cast her out” in 2004. (Compl. ¶¶ 59-61.) Therefore, Plaintiff could not have depended 
on him after that time. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 27     Filed 02/28/20     Page 8 of 14

and the causal relationship between that injury and the alleged abuse (Fla. Stat. § 95.11(7));3 and, 
after Plaintiff reached age of majority, within 4 years (i.e., sometime in 2007) (Fla. Stat. § 95.11 
(3)(O)); (New Mexico) for torts occurring while she was a minor, the later of the “first instant” of 
Plaintiff’s 24th birthday (i.e., sometime in 2009) or 3 years from the date that Plaintiff first 
disclosed her childhood sexual abuse to a licensed medical or mental health care provider in the 
context of receiving health care (N.M. Stat. § 37-1-30) (Plaintiff alleges she never made such a 
disclosure (Compl. ¶ 67)); and, after Plaintiff reached age of majority, 3 years (i.e., in 2006) (N.M. 
Stat. § 37-1-8); (USVI) when Plaintiff turned 23 (i.e., sometime in 2008) (5 V.I.C. §§ 31(5)(A), 
36(a)(1)).  
C.
Plaintiff’s Claim For Punitive Damages Fails As A Matter Of Law 
Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law because it is barred by the 
law of each potentially applicable jurisdiction. Courts in this District regularly grant motions to 
dismiss legally deficient claims for punitive damages. See, e.g., The Cookware Co. (USA), LLC v. 
Austin, No. 15 Civ. 5796, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177691, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2016) (Batts, 
J.) (granting motion to dismiss claim for punitive damages without leave to replead because 
allegations regarding defendant’s bad-faith conduct were conclusory and did not rise to the 
required level of malice); SJB v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 03 Civ. 6653, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
13227, at *25-26 (S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2004) (Buchwald, J.) (granting motion to dismiss punitive 
damages claims because punitive damages were not statutorily available); Kunica v. St. Jean Fin., 
No. 97 Civ. 3804, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11867, at *26 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 1998) (Sweet, J.) 
(granting motion to dismiss claim for punitive damages because, even if conduct alleged in 
complaint was true, it did not rise to the level necessary to award punitive damages); Purdy v. 
Plaintiff’s allegation that she is only now beginning to “process” her injuries (Compl. ¶¶ 65, 68) is not equivalent to 
alleging her belated discovery of such injuries. She makes no such allegation. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 27     Filed 02/28/20     Page 9 of 14

Consumers Distrib. Co., 648 F. Supp. 980, 981, 984 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (Cedarbaum, J.) (granting 
motion to dismiss claim for punitive damages). 
When determining what law applies, the Court looks to the choice-of-law rules of the forum 
state. Simons v. Marriott Corp., No. 92 Civ. 3762 (SWK), 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14365, at *15 
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 1993). Under New York law, the law of the state where a tort occurs generally 
applies to punitive damages. See Starr Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Am. Claims Mgmt., No. 14-cv-0463-
JMF, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60272, *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2015) (“Because punitive damages are 
conduct-regulating, ‘the law of the jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply.’” 
(quoting Deutsch v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 723 F. Supp. 2d 521, 524 (E.D.N.Y. 2010)); Guidi 
v. Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., No. 95-CV-9006 (LAP), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6390, at *1 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2003)).  
Here, Plaintiff alleges tortious conduct occurring in New York, Florida, New Mexico, the 
USVI, and France. (Compl. ¶¶ 40, 42.) None of these jurisdictions permits recovery of punitive 
damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate. That is unsurprising given that is the law in most 
jurisdictions, as reflected in the Restatement. See Restat. (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (punitive 
damages not available against representatives of deceased tortfeasor). Each of these jurisdictions 
is addressed below in turn. 
New York: New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law provides: “No cause of action for 
injury to person or property is lost because of the death of the person liable for the injury. For any 
injury, an action may be brought or continued against the personal representative of the decedent, 
but punitive damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought 
to recover damages for personal injury.” NY EPTL § 11-3.2 (a)(1) (emphasis added). “Also, 
‘there is a strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an estate on account 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 27     Filed 02/28/20     Page 10 of 14

of wrongful conduct of the decedent.’” Graham v. Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) 
(quoting Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996)). 
New York General Construction Law § 37-a defines “personal injury” as including “an 
assault, battery, false imprisonment, or other actionable injury to the person either of the plaintiff, 
or of another.” Here, Plaintiff seeks to recover damages for personal injuries. Accordingly, 
Plaintiff may not recover punitive damages against the Co-Executors based on alleged torts that 
occurred in New York. 
Florida: “Florida law prohibits recovery of punitive damages from the estate of a 
wrongdoer who is deceased.” Poindexter v. Zacharzewski, No. 18-14155, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
189861, at *6 (Nov. 5, 2018 S.D. Fla.) (citing Lohr v. Byrd, 522 So. 2d 845 (Fla. 1988)).  
New Mexico: The Supreme Court of New Mexico has unequivocally held that “punishment 
and deterrence are not accomplished by enabling recovery of punitive damages from the estate of 
deceased tortfeasors.” Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 117 N.M. 337, 346 (N.M. 1994). 
France: French law does not recognize punitive damages. See 2 Linda L. Schlueter, 
Punitive Damages § 22.4 (7th ed. 2015) (citing Rouhette, The Availability of Punitive Damages in 
Europe: Growing Trend or Nonexistent Concept, 74 Def. Coun. J. 320 (2007)). 
USVI:  In 2011, the Supreme Court of the USVI effectively instructed USVI courts to 
apply what is now known as a “Banks analysis” to determine U.S.V.I. common law.  Banks v. Int’l 
Rental & Leasing Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 979 (V.I. 2011).  The Banks analysis includes consideration 
of three non-dispositive factors: (1) whether any USVI courts have previously adopted a particular 
rule; (2) the position taken by a majority of courts of other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, 
which approach represents the soundest rule for the USVI.  Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Connor, No. 
S. CT. CIV. 2013-0095, 2014 WL 702639, at *1 (V.I. Feb. 24, 2014). 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 27     Filed 02/28/20     Page 11 of 14

Applying the Banks factors here demonstrates that USVI courts would adopt the rule in the 
Restatement (Second) of Torts—which is also followed in the majority of United States 
jurisdictions, including New York, Florida and New Mexico—and hold that punitive damages are 
not available against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate. 
1.
Banks factor one: previously, USVI courts favorably cited the 
Restatement section that precludes punitive damages against estates. 
USVI courts have favorably recited the Restatement’s rule precluding punitive damages 
against a decedent tortfeasor’s estate.  See, e.g., Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 
628 (D.V.I. 2009); Booth v. Bowen, No. CIV. 2006-217, 2008 WL 220067, at *5 (D.V.I. Jan. 10, 
2008).  In these cases, the U.S. District Court of the Virgin Islands considered the inverse of the 
issue here, i.e., whether the personal representatives of an estate may obtain punitive damages in 
an action arising from the decedent’s wrongful death.  In determining that punitive damages were 
not available under such circumstances, the courts cited the Restatement, which provides that 
“[p]unitive damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor nor, 
ordinarily, in an action under a death statute.”  Restat. (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (emphasis 
added).  Accordingly, this Banks factor favors the Co-Executors. 
2.
Banks factor two: a majority of U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an 
award of punitive damages based on the wrongful acts of a decedent. 
This Banks factor overwhelmingly supports the Co-Executors’ position.  The majority of 
U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an award of punitive damages against the personal representatives 
of an estate based on the actions of the deceased tortfeasor.  See Crabtree v. Estate of Crabtree, 
837 N.E.2d 135, 138 (Ind. 2005) (“The majority view denies punitive damages.”); 2 Linda L. 
Schlueter, Punitive Damages § 20.4 (7th ed. 2015) (“[A] majority of jurisdictions will not award 
punitive damages against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate.” (citing Alec A. Beech, Adding Insult to 
Death: Why Punitive Damages Should Not Be Imposed Against a Deceased Tortfeasor’s Estate in 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 27     Filed 02/28/20     Page 12 of 14

Ohio, 49 Akron L. Rev. 553 (2016))); Timothy R. Robicheaux and Brian H. Bornstein, Punished, 
Dead Or Alive: Empirical Perspectives on Awarding Punitive Damages Against Deceased 
Defendants, 16 Psych. Pub. Pol. and L. 393, 398 (2010) (“The Restatement (Second) of Torts 
(1965) is one authority stating that punitive damages should not follow the death of a wrongdoer, 
and the majority of courts considering the issue have provided rulings consistent with this 
position.”). 
3.
Banks factor three: Post-Banks, USVI courts have favorably applied 
Restatement Section 908 to questions regarding punitive damages. 
The third Banks factor weighs strongly in favor of the Co-Executors as well.  Post-Banks, 
USVI Courts have already found that Section 908 of the Restatement is “the soundest rule for the 
Virgin Islands with respect to the imposition of an award of punitive damages.”  Pappas v. Hotel 
on the Cay Time-Sharing Ass’n, 69 V.I. 3, 15 n.8 (U.S.V.I. Super. Ct. 2015) (citing Davis v. 
Christian, 46 V.I. 557 (D.V.I. App. Div. 2005), Isaac v. Crichlow, 63 V.I. 38, 2015 V.I. LEXIS 
(V.I. Super. Ct. 2015), St. Thomas House, Inc. v. Barrows, 15 V.I. 435 (V.I. Terr. Ct. 1979), 
Brandy v. Flamboyant Inv. Co., Ltd., 24 V.I. 249 (V.I. Terr. Ct. 1989), and Thomas v. Rijos, 780 
F. Supp. 2d 376, 380 (D.V.I. 2011)); Powell v. Chi-Co’s Distrib., No. ST-13-TOR-14, 2014 V.I. 
LEXIS 21, at *5 n.13 (U.S.V.I. Super. Ct. Apr. 3, 2014) (“Applying a Banks analysis, the Court 
finds that Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(2) reflects the common law of this jurisdiction.”). 
Therefore, every Banks factor favors the Co-Executors: (1) pre-Banks, USVI courts 
expressed approval for the general rule that punitive damages cannot be recovered against a 
wrongdoer’s estate; (2) the majority of courts from other jurisdictions preclude punitive damages 
against a wrongdoer’s estate; and (3) post-Banks, USVI courts have held that Section 908 of the 
Restatement of Torts (Second) represents the soundest rule for the USVI with respect to the 
availability of punitive damages.

*** 
In conclusion, even if any of Plaintiff’s claims survive, her claim for punitive damages 
must be dismissed in its entirety.  
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated above, Defendants respectfully request that the Court dismiss 
Plaintiff’s Complaint to the extent it is time-barred and Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages, 
together with such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
___________________________________________x 
TEALA DAVIES, 
        Case No. 19 Civ. 10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
Plaintiff, 
-against- 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as EXECUTORS OF THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY E.  
EPSTEIN, 
Defendants.   
___________________________________________x 
STIPULATED CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER 
WHEREAS, Plaintiff Teala Davies and Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. 
Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (collectively, the “Parties” and each 
individually, a “Party”), request that this Court issue a protective order pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 26(c) to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic and sensitive information that 
they may need to disclose in connection with discovery in this action; 
WHEREAS, the Parties, through counsel, agree to the following terms; and 
WHEREAS, this Court finds that good cause exists for issuance of an appropriately 
tailored confidentiality order governing the pretrial phase of this action; 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Parties to this action, their respective agents, 
employees, and attorneys, any other person in active concert or participation with any of the 
foregoing, and all other persons with actual notice of this Order will adhere to the following 
terms, upon pain of contempt: 

- 2 - 
1. 
  With respect to “Discovery Material” (i.e., documents, information or tangible 
things of any kind produced or disclosed in the course of discovery in this action) that a person 
has designated as “Confidential” pursuant to this Order, no person subject to this Order may 
disclose such Confidential Discovery Material to anyone else except as expressly permitted 
hereunder. 
2. 
The Party or person producing or disclosing Discovery Material (each, 
“Producing Party”) may designate as Confidential only the portion of such material that it 
reasonably and in good faith believes consists of: 
(a) medical, mental health and/or other health care records; 
(b) previously non-disclosed financial information; 
(c) any other material the Parties agree in writing is Confidential;  
(d) non-public information that the producing person in good faith considers to 
be, reflect, or reveal business, marketing, financial, or regulatory information or 
data, or information of commercial value, including, without limitation, trade 
secrets, contracts with third parties, or other information required by law or 
agreement to be kept confidential; or 
(e) any other category of information given confidential status by this Court after 
the date of this Order. 
3. 
With respect to the Confidential portion of any Discovery Material other than 
deposition transcripts and exhibits, the Producing Party or its counsel may designate such portion 
as “Confidential” by: (a) stamping or otherwise clearly marking as “Confidential” the protected 
portion in a manner that will not interfere with legibility or audibility; and (b) producing for 

- 3 - 
future public use another copy of said Discovery Material with the confidential information 
redacted. 
4. 
A Producing Party or its counsel may designate deposition exhibits or portions of 
deposition transcripts as Confidential Discovery Material either by: (a) indicating on the record 
during the deposition that a question calls for Confidential information, in which case the 
reporter will bind the transcript of the designated testimony in a separate volume and mark it as 
“Confidential Information Governed by Protective Order;” or (b) notifying the reporter and all 
counsel of record, in writing, within 30 days after a deposition has concluded, of the specific 
pages and lines of the transcript that are to be designated “Confidential,” in which case all 
counsel receiving the transcript will be responsible for marking the copies of the designated 
transcript in their possession or under their control as directed by the Producing Party or that 
person’s counsel. During the 30-day period following a deposition, all Parties will treat the entire 
deposition transcript as if it had been designated Confidential. 
5. 
If at any time before the termination of this action a Producing Party realizes that 
it should have designated as Confidential some portion(s) of Discovery Material that it 
previously produced without limitation, the Producing Party may so designate such material by 
notifying all Parties in writing. Thereafter, all persons subject to this Order will treat such 
designated portion(s) of the Discovery Material as Confidential. In addition, the Producing Party 
shall provide each other Party with replacement versions of such Discovery Material that bears 
the “Confidential” designation within two business days of providing such notice. 
6. 
Nothing contained in this Order will be construed as: (a) a waiver by a Party or 
person of its right to object to any discovery request; (b) a waiver of any privilege or protection; 
or (c) a ruling regarding the admissibility at trial of any document, testimony, or other evidence. 

- 4 - 
7. 
Where a Producing Party has designated Discovery Material as Confidential, 
other persons subject to this Order may disclose such information only to the following persons: 
(a) the Parties to this action; 
(b) counsel retained specifically for this action, including any paralegal, clerical, 
or other assistant that such outside counsel employs and assigns to this matter; 
(c) outside vendors or service providers (such as copy-service providers and 
document-management consultants) that counsel hire and assign to this matter, 
provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form 
annexed as Exhibit A hereto; 
(d) any mediator or arbitrator that the Parties engage in this matter or that this 
Court appoints, provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure 
Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto; 
(e) as to any document, its author, its addressee, and any other person indicated on 
the face of the document as having received a copy; 
(f) any witness who counsel for a Party in good faith believes may be called to 
testify at trial or deposition in this action, provided such person has first executed 
a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A hereto; 
(g) any person a Party retains to serve as an expert witness or otherwise provide 
specialized advice to counsel in connection with this action, provided such person 
has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto; 
(h) stenographers engaged to transcribe depositions the Parties conduct in this 
action; and 

- 5 - 
(i) this Court, including any appellate court, its support personnel, and court 
reporters. 
10. 
Before disclosing any Confidential Discovery Material to any person referred to 
in subparagraphs 7(c), 7(d), 7(f), or 7(g) above, counsel must provide a copy of this Order to 
such person, who must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit A 
hereto stating that he or she has read this Order and agrees to be bound by its terms. Said counsel 
must retain each signed Non-Disclosure Agreement, hold it in escrow, and produce it to 
opposing counsel either before such person is permitted to testify (at deposition or trial) or at the 
conclusion of the case including any and all appeals, whichever comes first. 
11. 
This Order binds the Parties and certain others to treat as Confidential any 
Discovery Materials so classified. The Court has not, however, made any finding regarding the 
confidentiality of any Discovery Materials, and retains full discretion to determine whether to 
afford confidential treatment to any Discovery Material designated as Confidential hereunder. 
All persons are placed on notice that the Court is unlikely to seal or otherwise afford confidential 
treatment to any Discovery Material introduced into evidence at trial, even if such material has 
previously been sealed or designated as Confidential. 
12. 
In filing Confidential Discovery Material with this Court, or filing portions of any 
pleadings, motions, or other papers that disclose such Confidential Discovery Material 
(“Confidential Court Submission”), the Parties shall publicly file a redacted copy of the 
Confidential Court Submission via the Electronic Case Filing System. The Parties shall file an 
unredacted copy of the Confidential Court Submission under seal with the Clerk of this Court, 
and the Parties shall serve this Court and opposing counsel with unredacted courtesy copies of 
the Confidential Court Submission.  Any Party that seeks to file Confidential Discovery Material 

- 6 - 
under seal must file an application and supporting declaration justifying—on a particularized 
basis—the sealing of such documents. The parties should be aware that the Court will unseal 
documents if it is unable to make “specific, on the record findings . . . demonstrating that closure 
is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.”  Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2006).  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this paragraph, if the parties stipulate that specific portions of a document are both 
confidential and immaterial to this lawsuit, a party may publicly file a version of the document 
with those confidential and immaterial portions redacted, and that party need not submit an 
unredacted version to the Court or file a motion to seal. 
13. 
Any Party who objects to any designation of confidentiality may at any time 
before the trial of this action serve upon counsel for the Producing Party a written notice stating 
with particularity the grounds of the objection. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, 
counsel for all affected Parties will address their dispute to the Court by motion. The Parties shall 
treat the disputed materials as Confidential pending the Court’s resolution of such motion.  
14. 
Any Party who requests additional limits on disclosure (such as “attorneys’ eyes 
only” in extraordinary circumstances), may at any time before the trial of this action serve upon 
counsel for the recipient Parties a written notice stating with particularity the grounds of the 
request. If the Parties cannot reach agreement promptly, counsel for all affected Parties will 
address their dispute to the Court.  
15. 
Recipients of Confidential Discovery Material under this Order may use such 
material solely for the prosecution and defense of this action, any appeals thereto, and any 
alternative dispute resolution proceeding intended to resolve this action with prior express 
permission of the producing party, and not for any other purpose or in any other litigation 

- 7 - 
proceeding. Nothing contained in this Order, however, will affect or restrict the rights of any 
Party with respect to its own documents or information produced in this action.  Nor shall 
anything contained in this Order prejudice a Party’s ability to seek discovery in this and any 
other legal proceeding, without prejudice to any other Party’s right to object to such discovery.  
16. 
Nothing in this Order will prevent any Party from producing any Confidential 
Discovery Material in its possession in response to a lawful subpoena or other compulsory 
process, or if required to produce by law or by any government agency having jurisdiction, 
provided that, unless precluded by applicable laws or rules, such Party gives written notice to the 
Producing Party as soon as reasonably possible, and if permitted by the time allowed under the 
request, at least 10 days before any disclosure. Upon receiving such notice, the Producing Party 
will bear the burden to oppose compliance with the subpoena, other compulsory process, or other 
legal notice if the Producing Party deems it appropriate to do so. 
17. 
Each person who has access to Discovery Material designated as Confidential 
pursuant to this Order must take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized or 
inadvertent disclosure of such material. 
18.  
If a receiving party receives documents or other materials that it has reason to 
believe are subject to a good faith claim of attorney-client privilege, work product protection, or 
other privilege or immunity from disclosure, the receiving party must refrain from examining the 
documents or other materials any more than is essential to ascertain whether the documents or 
other materials are reasonably subject to such a claim.  The receiving party shall promptly notify 
the producing person in writing that the receiving party possesses documents or other material 
that appears to be privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure. 

- 8 - 
19. 
If, in connection with this litigation, a producing person inadvertently discloses 
information that is subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product 
protection, or any other privilege or immunity from disclosure (“Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information”), such disclosure shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of any 
claim of privilege, work product protection, or other privilege or immunity from discovery with 
respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information or its subject matter.  In addition, a producing 
person may use its own document (e.g., as a deposition exhibit) containing material that is 
subject to a claim of privilege or immunity from disclosure for the purpose of establishing the 
basis of such claim without waiver of any applicable privilege or immunity from disclosure, 
unless the producing person affirmatively uses or relies upon the specific material contained in

deleted and deleted from “trash” files, and the recipient must take reasonable measures to ensure 
that unauthorized persons do not have access to Confidential information residing on the 
recipient’s computer server and back-up media; and (ii) outside counsel for the parties are 
permitted to retain one archival copy of all pleadings, motion papers, court filings made under 
seal, transcripts, legal memoranda, correspondence, attorney work product, written discovery

Re: 
Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
Your Honor: 
We represent Plaintiff Teala Davies.  With the consent of all parties, 
we write respectfully to request a one-week extension of the briefing deadlines for 
the Defendants’ pending motion to dismiss (ECF 26).   
Plaintiff’s opposition papers are currently due on March 20 and 
Defendants’ reply papers are currently due on March 30.  We request a one-week 
extension of both of those deadlines, so that Plaintiff’s opposition papers would be 
due on March 27 and Defendants’ reply papers would be due on April 7.  This 
extension of time is needed due to challenges arising from COVID-19 response 
measures, including school and office closures.   
We have conferred with Bennet J. Moskowitz, counsel for Defendants, 
and he consents to this extension.  This extension would not affect any other 
deadlines in this case.  No previous extension of time has been requested since Your 
Honor entered the parties’ proposed briefing schedule on February 28, 2020 (ECF 
25).   
We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to this matter. 
Very truly yours,

This Court has personal jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 V.I.C. § 4903. 
4. 
The Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States. It consists 
of St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John, and Water Island, and more than 40 surrounding islands and 
Cays, some of which are privately owned. Among these privately owned islands are Little St. 
James and Great St. James. 
5. 
Jeffrey E. Epstein ("Epstein") was a resident of the Virgin Islands and he 
maintained a residence on Little St. James, which he acquired in 1998 and in 2016 he also 
purchased Great St. James. 
6. 
Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands in 2010. He was a Tier 1 
offender under Virgin Islands law based upon his Florida conviction of procuring a minor for 
prostitution. As a Tier 1 offender, Epstein was required to register annually with the Virgin Islands 
Department of Justice ("VIDOJ") and give advance notice of his travel to and from the Virgin 
Islands. Epstein was also subject to random address verification by VIDOJ. 
7. 
Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019 while in custody in New York for sex 
cnmes. 
8. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke ("Defendant Indyke") is co-executor of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein and Administrator of The 1953 Trust. 
9. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn ("Defendant Kahn") is co-executor of The Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein and Administrator of The 1953 Trust. 
10. 
Defendant, the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein ("Estate"), created upon Epstein's death, 
is domiciled in the Virgin Islands. On August 15, 2019, Defendants Indyke and Kahn filed a 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 4 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 3 of55 
Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary which included Epstein· s last will and testament 
with the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
11. 
The Petition reports the value of the real and personal property in The Estate located 
in the Virgin Islands at $577,672,654.00 dollars. 
12. 
According to the Petition, the assets in the Virgin Islands thus far includes: 
a. $56.5 million in cash; 
b. $127 million in fixed income and equity investments; 
c. $195 million in hedge fund and private equity investments; and 
d. $18.5 million in planes, boats, and automobiles. 
The Estate has not yet valued his fine arts, antiques, and other valuables. 
13. 
The Estate also includes shares of various corporate entities which hold residences 
and real property used by Epstein, namely: 
a. Brownstone in New York City valued at $56 million; 
b. Ranch in New Mexico valued at $72 million; 
c. Gated home in Palm Beach, Florida, valued at $12 million; 
d. Seven units in an apartment building in Paris, valued at $8 million; and 
e. Great St. James and Little St. James, collectively valued at $86 million. 
14. 
The Estate is responsible to pay damages for the acts committed by Epstein and the 
Epstein Enterprise described below. 
15. 
Defendant The 1953 Trust ("The Trust") was created by Epstein, who "amended 
and restated" its terms only two days before his suicide. That same day, Epstein revised his Last 
Will and Testament, transferring all of his "property, real and personal, wherever situated" to The 
Trust.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page4 of55 
16. 
The Trust also contains Epstein's financial assets and is also responsible to pay 
damages for the acts committed by Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise described below. 
Defendants Indyke and Kahn, filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands 
for The Trust on August 26, 2019. 
17. 
Epstein maintained a deliberately complex web of Virgin Islands corporations, 
limited liability companies, foundations, and other entities, not all of which are yet known to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands, through which he carried out and concealed his criminal 
conduct. 
18. 
Epstein regularly created new entities in the territory and transferred properties and 
funds between them in order to preserve and shield Epstein's assets and to facilitate and conceal 
the unlawful acts described in this Complaint. 
19. 
These entities held properties, including Little St. James and Great St. James, at 
which Epstein trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls. Epstein owned and 
arranged for private planes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from, and 
within the Virgin Islands, and provided money to pay these young women and underage girls. 
20. 
Epstein sat at the hub of this web, serving as president, member, manager, or 
director of each of the entities and, upon information and belief, directing their activities. 
21. 
Defendant, Nautilus, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
of the Virgin Islands. It was incorporated on November 22, 2011. 
22. 
According to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Nautilus, Inc. owns 
Little St. James, a/k/a Parcel Number 109803010100, a parcel of 3.1 million square feet valued at 
$3.2 million, with buildings and improvements valued at $4 million. 
T

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 5 of55 
23. 
Epstein was president and director of Nautilus, Inc., which corporate filings 
describe as ·'holding property for personal use." Defendants Indyke and Kahn are the secretary and 
treasurer of Nautilus, Inc., respectively. The Estate values Epstein's holdings of Nautilus, Inc., 
which holds title to Little St. James at $63.9 million. 
24. 
A deed recorded with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds on December 30, 2011 
reflects that the prope1iy was transferred from a Delaware entity, L.S.J., LLC, to Nautilus, Inc. for 
"TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration.'' The quitclaim deed lists 
Jeffrey Epstein as the sole member of L.S.J., LLC, which it acquired Little Saint James via a 
warranty deed dated April 27, 1998. 
25. 
As described below, Epstein engaged in a pattern and practice of trafficking and 
sexually abusing young women and female children on this private, secluded island of Little St. 
James where Epstein and his associates could avoid detection of their illegal activity from Virgin 
Islands and federal law enforcement and prevent these young women and underage girls from 
leaving freely and escaping the abuse. 
26. 
Thus, Nautilus, Inc. participated m carrymg out, facilitating and concealing 
Epstein's crimes, hence Little St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
27. 
Defendant, Great St. Jim, LLC, is a limited liability company established and 
organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands. Great St. Jim, LLC was organized on October 26, 
2015. Great St. Jim, LLC, according to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, owns at 
least three properties that make up Great St. James acquired on January 28, 2016: Parcel Number 
109801010100, consisting of 3 .5 million square feet and valued at $17 .5 million; Parcel Number 
109801010200, consisting of 450,000 square feet of land, valued at $2.8 million; and Parcel 
Number 109801010300, 1.2 million square feet of land, valued at $2. 7 million. According to a 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 7 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 6 of55 
warranty deed filed with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Epstein, through Great St. Jim, 
LLC, acquired the last two parcels for $5 million each. 
28. 
Epstein is listed as manager and a member of Great St. Jim, LLC and the nature of 
its business is described as "holding assets." 
29. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein purchased these Great St. James properties-
the island with closest proximity to Little St. James-to further shield his conduct on Little St. 
James from view, prevent his detection by law enforcement or the public, and allow him to 
continue and conceal his criminal enterprise. Epstein's significant investment in the purchase of 
Great St. James demonstrates his intent to expand his illegal operation in the Virgin Islands for 
years to come. Thus, Great St. Jim, LLC participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and 
continuing Epstein's crimes, and Great St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
30. 
Defendant, Poplar, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
of the Virgin Islands. Poplar, Inc. was incorporated on November 22, 2011. Epstein was president 
and director of Poplar, Inc., and its purpose was described in corporate filings as "holding property 
for personal use." Defendants Indyke and Kahn are secretary and treasurer of Poplar, Inc., 
respectively. 
31. 
A certificate of incumbency provided to the Department of Planning and Natural 
Resources ("DPNR") also lists Epstein as president of Poplar, Inc. and expressly authorizes the 
incorporators to conduct "transactions related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great 
St. Jim, LLC." 
32. 
Poplar, Inc. is listed as the signatory for the 2017 Annual Report for Great St. Jim, 
LLC, and the signature appears to be Epstein's. The Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 8 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 7 ofSS 
filed by The Estate lists Poplar, Inc. as holding title to Great St. James. Thus, Poplar, Inc. 
participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and continuing Epstein's crimes. 
33. 
Defendant, Plan D, LLC is a limited liability company established and organized 
under the laws of the Virgin Islands. In its original Articles of Organization, filed October 19, 
2012, and Annual Report filings, Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski. was listed as Plan D, LLC's sole 
manager/member. However, the July 31, 2019 Annual Report revealed Epstein as the principal 
behind Plan D, LLC. 
34. 
Upon infonnation and belief, Plan D, LLC owns one or more of the airplanes and 
helicopters that Epstein used to transport young women and children to and from the Virgin Islands 
to carry out the criminal pattern of activity described below. Among the airplanes owned by Plan 
D, LLC is a Gulfstream with N-number N212JE. Flight logs and travel notices indicate that 
Epstein used this plane to traffic and transport and young women and underage girls to the Virgin 
Islands. 
35. 
Defendant, Hyperion Air, LLC is a limited liability company established and 
organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands on October 19, 2012. Jeffrey Epstein is a 
manager/member of Hyperion Air, LLC, along with his pilot, Larry Visoski. The purpose of 
Hyperion Air, LLC is listed in its Annual Report as "holding assets." 
36. 
Hyperion Air, LLC is the registered owner of a Bell helicopter with N-number 
N331JE and a Keystone helicopter with N-number N722JE. Upon information and belief, Epstein 
used these helicopters to transport young women and underage girls between St. Thomas and Little 
St. James. 
37. 
Defendant Southern Trust Company, Inc. was originally incorporated in the Virgin 
Islands on November 18, 2011 as Financial Informatics, Inc., but changed its name to Southern 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 9 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 8 of55 
Trust Company in September 2012. Southern Trust Company is a tenant at American Yacht 
Harbor in Red Hook, St. Thomas, and Epstein is a '·passive investor" in IG Y-A YH, d/b/a American 
Yacht Harbor. By the end of 2013, according to its corporate filings, Southern Trust Company 
has assets of $198.5 million; four years later, its assets reached $391.3 million. From 2011 until 
at least 2018, Jeffrey Epstein was the President/Director of Southern Trust Company, and 
Defendants Kahn and Indyke were Treasurer/Director and Secretary/Director, respectively. 
Epstein was the sole owner of Southern Trust Company. 
38. 
John and Jane Does represent individuals and entities whose identities or 
involvement with Epstein are currently unknown. The Government of the Virgin Islands will 
amend the Complaint to add these individuals and entities when discovered. 
39. 
The Attorney General brings this action to seek all remedies available to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands in enforcing its laws and protecting the public interest and public 
safety. These claims are distinct from, and are not intended to supplant, the claims of victims who 
were unconscionably hanned by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. The Conduct of the "Epstein Enterprise" in the Virgin Islands 
40. 
Epstein and his associates, including Defendants, identified and recruited female 
victims, including children, and transported them to the Virgin Islands where they were abused 
and injured. Epstein, through and in association with Defendants, trafficked, raped, sexually 
assaulted and held captive underage girls and young women at his properties in the Virgin Islands. 
41. 
Epstein created a network of companies and individuals who participated in and 
conspired with him in a pattern of criminal activity related to the sex trafficking, forced labor, 
sexual assault, child abuse, and sexual servitude of these young women and children. Epstein and

Page 9 of 55 
his associates trafficked underage girls to the Virgin Islands, held them captive, and sexually 
abused them, causing them grave physical, mental, and emotional injury. 
42. 
To accomplish his illegal ends, Epstein fonned an association in fact with multiple 
Defendants and others (both companies and individuals) who were willing to participate in, 
facilitate, and conceal Epstein's criminal activity in exchange for Epstein's bestowal of financial 
and other benefits, including sexual services and forced labor from victims. 
43. 
This illicit association of Epstein, Defendants, and his associates constitute what is 
referred to herein as the '"Epstein Enterprise." Epstein's associates in the Epstein Enterprise, 
including, but not limited to, those named as Defendants knowingly facilitated, participated in, and 
concealed Epstein's illegal conduct. 
44. 
Epstein used his wealth and power to create the Epstein Enterprise which engaged 
in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin Islands by repeatedly procuring and subjecting 
underage girls and young women to unlawful sexual conduct, sex trafficking, and forced labor. 
45. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin 
Islands (and elsewhere) with the criminal purpose and goal of placing a steady supply of vulnerable 
female children and young women into sexual servitude in service of Epstein's desires, and those 
of his associates. The Epstein Enterprise maintained and made available young women and 
underage girls for the purpose of engaging them in forced labor and sexual activities and used 
coercion and deception to procure, abuse, and harbor its victims. 
46. 
Flight logs and other sources establish that between 2001 and 2019 the Epstein 
Enterprise transported underage girls and young women to the Virgin Islands, who were then taken 
via helicopter or private vessel to Little St. James where they were then deceptively subjected to

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 10 of55 
sexual servitude, forced to engage in sexual acts and coerced into commercial sexual activity and 
forced labor. 
47. 
In furtherance of its criminal activities, the Epstein Enterprise used its aircrafts to 
transport the young women and underage girls to the Virgin Islands for purposes of sexual abuse 
and exploitation. 
48. 
The Epstein Enterprise facilitated and participated in the sexual molestation and 
exploitation of numerous girls between the age of 12 and 17 years old. 
49. 
On the pretext of providing modeling opportunities, careers and contracts, 
associates of the Epstein Enterprise, funded by the Epstein Enterprise, lured and recruited young 
women and underage girls to travel to locations including the Virgin Islands where, upon 
information and belief, based on the pattern and practice of the Epstein Enterprise, they were 
sexually abused and exploited. 
50. 
Associates in the Epstein Enterprise recruited both victims and abusers into the 
Epstein Enterprise, participated in sexual acts of rape and abuse of minors and witnessed Epstein 
and others engage in sexual acts with children. 
51. 
As recent as 2018, air traffic controllers and other airport personnel reported seeing 
Epstein leave his plane with young girls some of whom appeared to be between the age of 11 and 
years. 
52. 
Upon information and belief, based on Epstein's pattern of trafficking and sexually 
abusing young girls, the Epstein Enterprise trafficked and abused these girls, and others, in the 
Virgin Islands through 2018. 
53. 
When sued in civil court for committing sex trafficking and sex crimes, Epstein 
never denied engaging in sexual acts with underage females and procuring underage females for 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 12 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 11 of 55 
prostitution, but instead consistently invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination. 
54. 
Upon infonnation and belief, the Epstein Enterprise kept a computerized list of 
underage girls who were in or proximate to the Virgin Islands, and able to be transported to 
Epstein's residence at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. 
55. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct by trafficking 
children and young women and placing them in sexual servitude and forced labor in the Virgin 
Islands. The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 133 to I 38, which prohibit 
trafficking and sexual abuse. The Epstein Enterprise also repeatedly violated laws against child 
abuse and neglect, including 14 V.1.C. § 505, which defines the crime of child abuse as knowingly 
or recklessly causing "·a child to suffer physical, mental, or emotional injury," or causing a child 
to be placed in a situation where such injury is foreseeable, and 14 V.I.C. § 506, which applies, as 
here, where the child suffers serious physical, mental, or emotional injury as a result of that abuse. 
The harm to Epstein's victims was both fully foreseeable and deeply damaging. 
56. 
The Epstein Enterprise knowingly recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, 
received, procured, obtained, isolated, maintained, and enticed young women and girls to engage 
in forced labor (such as providing massages) and, ultimately, sexual servitude at his little St. James 
residence. 
57. 
A 15 year old victim was forced into sexual acts with Epstein and others and then 
attempted to escape by swimming off the Little St. James island. Epstein and others organized a 
search party that located her and kept her captive by, among other things, confiscating her passport. 
58. 
Another victim, who was first engaged in provide massages to Epstein, was then 
forced to perform sexual acts at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. When she attempted to 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 13 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 12 ofSS 
escape from the "private island," Epstein and a search party found her, returned her to his house, 
and suggested physical restraint or hann if she failed to cooperate. 
59. 
The Epstein Enterprise deceptively lured underage girls and women into its sex 
trafficking ring with money and promises of employment, career opportunities and school 
assistance. 
The Epstein Enterprise preyed on their financial and other vulnerabilities, and 
promised victims money, shelter, gifts, employment, tuition and other items of value. 
For 
example, participants in the Epstein Enterprise targeted young and underage females under the 
pretext that they would be paid substantially merely to provide massages to him and others. 
However, once drawn in, victims were then pressured and coerced to engage in sexual acts. 
60. 
The Epstein Enterprise forced underage victims to recruit others to perform services 
and engage in sexual acts-a trafficking pyramid scheme. 
61. 
The Epstein Enterprise paid girls for each "meeting,'' with additional money if they 
brought additional girls. Epstein reportedly required three meetings per day. 
62. 
The Epstein Enterprise used the term "work'' as a code for sexual abuse, and, upon 
information and belief, reportedly kept computer records of the contact information for the victims. 
63. 
Consistent with his creation and use of a complex web of entities to carry out and 
conceal the criminal trafficking enterprise in the Virgin islands, the Epstein Enterprise sometimes 
paid young women and underage girls he exploited and trafficked through his charitable 
foundations. 
64. 
Once the girls and women were recruited, participants in the Epstein Enterprise 
enforced their sexual servitude of victims by coercion, including but not limited to, confiscating 
passports, controlling and extinguishing external communications, and threatening violence. They 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 14 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 13 of 55 
also made fraudulent statements to family members of victims, claiming victims were being well 
cared for and supported financially in college and other educational opportunities. 
65. 
The Epstein Enterprise transported, held, sexually abused, trafficked, and 
concealed women and children at his property in the Virgin Islands dozens of times over nearly 
two decades. 
B. The "Epstein Enterprise" Abused Privileges of Residency to Carry out its 
Criminal Scheme 
66. 
The Epstein Enterprise in 1998 acquired Little St. James in the Virgin Islands as 
the perfect hideaway and haven for trafficking young women and underage girls for sexual 
servitude, child abuse and sexual assault. Little St: James is a secluded, private island, nearly two 
miles from St. Thomas with no other residents. It can be visited only by private boat or helicopter; 
no public or commercial transportation is available to carry persons on or off the island, and no 
bridge connects the island to St. Thomas. Epstein had easy access to Little St. James from the 
private airfield on St. Thomas, only 10 minutes away by his private helicopter, but the women and 
children he trafficked, abused, and held there were not able to leave without his permission and 
assistance, as it was too far and dangerous to swim to St. Thomas. 
67. 
In 2016, upon information and belief, using a straw purchaser to hide Epstein's 
identity, the Epstein Enterprise acquired Great St. James the nearest island to Little St. James. By 
then, Epstein was a convicted sex offender. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise 
purchased the island for more than $20 million because its participants wanted to ensure that the 
island did not become a base from which others could view their activities or visitors. By acquiring 
ownership and control of Great St. James to the exclusion of others, the Epstein Enterprise created 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 15 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 14 of 55 
additional barriers to prevent those held involuntarily on Little St. James from escaping or 
obtaining help from others. 
68. 
Great St. James and Little St. James are environmentally sensitive locations, with 
native coral and wildlife protected by federal and territorial law and enforcement authorities. The 
Department of Planning and Natural Resources ("DPNR'') regulates and monitors construction in 
the Coastal Zone to protect, maintain and manage the precious natural resources of the Virgin 
Islands. Under its authority, DPNR repeatedly issued citations and assessed thousands of dollars 
of fines for violations of the Virgin Islands construction code and environmental protection laws 
on both Little St. James and Great St. James-significant penalties to the agency and to the average 
resident of the Virgin Islands. But because of Epstein· s enormous wealth, these fines had little 
effect in curbing or stopping the Epstein Enterprise's unlawful conduct or conforming its activities 
to the law. 
69. 
As a result of illegal construction activity of the Epstein Enterprise, the Virgin 
Islands has incurred, and will incur, significant expenses to remove the illegal construction or 
remediate its effects on natural resources in and around Little St. James and Great St. James. The 
extent of the potential environmental damage is unknown at this time as the illegal construction 
has not been removed or remediated. 
70. 
The Epstein Enterprise continues to attempt to prevent or limit DPNR authorities 
from conducting random inspections on the Little St. James and Great St. James necessary to 
comply with Virgin Islands law. 
71. 
The Epstein Enterprise's violation of the construction and environmental laws was 
part of a pattern of behavior in flouting the laws of the Virgin Islands and holding itself above the 
law. 
Upon information and belief, as described above, the Epstein Enterprise undertook 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 16 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 15 of 55 
construction at Great St. James after 2016 to continue the scheme to carry out and conceal his 
trafficking and sexual abuse of young women and children in the Virgin Islands. These actions 
are also indicative of the Epstein Enterprise's disregard for Virgin Islands' law. The Epstein 
Enterprise used the Virgin Islands' land, resources, people, and laws for its illicit purposes. Rather 
than participating lawfully in this community, the Epstein Enterprise took advantage of the 
secluded nature of the islands in furtherance of its crimes. 
72. 
As a result of its deplorable and unlawful conduct, the Epstein Enterprise has 
subjected the Virgin Islands to public portrayals as a hiding place for human trafficking and sex 
cnmes. 
C. The "Epstein Enterprise" Fraudulently Concealed its Conduct 
73. 
The Epstein Enterprise fraudulently concealed its actions to prevent detection by 
the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
74. 
The secluded properties at Little St. James and Great St. James were repeatedly 
used by the Epstein Enterprise as the locations for unlawfully soliciting, transporting, transferring, 
harboring, receiving, providing, isolating, patronizing, maintaining, deceiving, coercing, and 
sexually abusing young women and children and concealing these crimes. 
75. 
The Epstein Enterprise was able to hide the trafficking ring from law enforcement, 
despite the fact that Epstein was a registered sex offender. Given the isolation of the Little St. 
James and Great St. James and the nature of the crimes and of the victims targeted by the Epstein 
Enterprise, the activities of the Epstein Enterprise were not readily detectable. Moreover, Epstein's 
great wealth and power likely made witnesses reluctant to report their observations to the local law 
enforcement. 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 17 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 16 of 55 
76. 
Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise prevented its employees from 
cooperating with law enforcement. Employees and others were required to sign confidentiality 
agreements that prohibited them from speaking to or sharing infonnation with law enforcement. If 
they were contacted by law enforcement they were to notify the Epstein Enterprise and be 
represented by Epstein's counsel. 
77. 
The employees were directed not to communicate or interact with guests visiting 
Little St. James and were also directed not to disclose to anyone events that occurred on the island. 
78. 
Monitoring a sex offender with his own private islands and the resources to fly 
victims in and out on private planes and helicopters presented unique challenges and allowed the 
Epstein Enterprise to limit scrutiny by the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
79. 
Sexual Offender Registration and Community Protection Act ("SORCPA") 14 
V .LC. § 1721, et. seq. requires sex offenders to register in their resident jurisdictions and to make 
periodic in-person appearances to verify and update their registration information. 
80. 
Epstein renewed his registration each year in the Virgin Islands. In addition, 
beyond this statutory requirement, the Virgin Islands periodically visited--or attempted to visit-
Little St. James to conduct additional address verifications. 
81. 
At his last verification in July 2018, Epstein refused to permit Virgin Islands 
Department of Justice Investigators, assisted by United States Marshals, to enter Little St. James 
beyond its dock, claiming that the dock was his "front door." Instead, Epstein arranged to be met 
at his office on St. Thomas. 
82. 
Epstein also misled the Government regarding his travel plans. On March 19, 2019, 
the Virgin Islands was notified that Epstein would be traveling to France for 10 days on the private 
plane owned by Plan D, LLC. His notification form did not disclose travel to any other countries. 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 18 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 17 of 55 
It was later found by law enforcement authorities that Epstein also travelled to Vienna and Monaco 
during that trip. 
83. 
Similarly, the Epstein Enterprise sought to prevent DPNR from conducting routine 
site visits to inspect unpermitted and potentially damaging construction activity on Great St. James. 
The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly objected to DPNR' s inspections referring to them as "invasions" 
of Epstein's constitutional right to privacy in his home, which he described defined as the entire 
island. These DPNR inspections are required for all construction and Virgin Islands residents are 
required to cooperate with the inspections to assure compliance with the law throughout the 
construction phases. 
84. 
These efforts represent Epstein Enterprise's intent to conceal its unlawful activity 
on Little St. James and Great St. James. 
85. 
The Epstein Enterprise also created numerous corporations and limited liability 
companies in the Virgin Islands to help conceal its unlawful activity. Most of these companies 
were created in 2011 and 2012, soon after Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands. 
86. 
Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski is identified as member or co-member in companies 
that serviced and maintained the planes that the Epstein Enterprise used to traffick young women 
and children - Freedom Air Petroleum, LLC (registered November 28, 2011 to hold assets); and 
JEGE, LLC (registered October 19, 2012 to hold assets). 
87. 
Other Epstein entities include LSJ Employees, LLC (registered October 27, 2011 
to provide services); Southern Financial, LLC (registered February 25, 2013 to provide services) 
and LSJ Emergency, LLC (registered December 2, 2015 to provide services). 
88. 
Some of these companies held considerable assets: Financial Informatics, Inc. 
(incorporated November 18, 2011, also known as Southern Trust Company, Inc.) had assets of 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 19 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 18 of 55 
approximately $391 million in 2015; and Financial Trust Company, Inc. (incorporated November 
6, 1998) had assets of $212 million when it publicly filed its last balance sheet in 2012. 
89. 
Though often absent in the original incorporation or registration documents or 
annual filings, Epstein ultimately appeared as president, director, manager, or sole member of each 
of these companies. Upon infonnation and belief, the purpose of this complex array of corporate 
entities-some of which may still be discovered-was to allow Epstein to shelter his assets in 
order to fund, carry out, and conceal his identity and pattern of criminal conduct. 
90. 
The Estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the 
criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise. On November 24, 2019, Epstein's Estate filed an 
Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program in the Superior 
Court of the Virgin Islands. ('·Motion··). According to the Motion, the proposed program was to 
be designed to "establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program for purposes of 
resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein." (Motion, at l). 
91. 
The program proposed by the Estate, whose executors are trustees of The 1953 
Trust and officers in at least two Epstein entities, imposes confidentiality requirements and 
requires any claimant accepting an award under the program to sacrifice any other claims against 
"any person or entity arising from or related to Mr. Epstein's conduct." (Motion, at 5). It acts to 
conceal the criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise and shield its participants from liability 
and accountability for the injury they caused to the victims. 
92. 
Two days before his death, Epstein amended The Trust and his Last Will and 
Testament. Upon information and belief, he did so, as part of a pattern and ongoing effort to 
conceal and shield his assets from potential recovery by claimants.

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 19 of 55 
D. The "Epstein Enterprise" Violated Numerous Virgin Islands Laws 
93. 
The pattern of criminal activity engaged in by Epstein and other participants in the 
Epstein Enterprise violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 605 and 607 of the Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act ("CICO"). 
94. 
The Epstein Enterprise also violated Title 14, Chapter 3A, The Virgin Islands 
Unifonn Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act relating to Trafficking of 
Persons; Title 14, Chapter 24, relating to Child Protection and Child Abuse and Neglect; Title 14, 
Chapter 81, relating to Prostitution and Related Offenses; Title 18, Chapter 85, relating to Rape 
and Sexual Assault and other related offenses, as well as other Virgin Islands laws. 
95. 
The Epstein Enterprise violated Virgin Islands laws by engaging in the human 
trafficking of underage girls and young women and commercial sex with young women and 
underage girls by force, fraud, enticement, or coercion, which serve as predicates to the Epstein 
Enterprise's violations of CICO. 
96. 
Certain participants who recruited women and underage girls to be trafficked and 
forced into sexual servitude themselves were sexually trafficked and abused by the Epstein 
Enterprise and may be afforded the protections of 14 V.I.C. § 145. 
97. 
Specifically, Plan D, LLC knowingly and intentionally facilitated the trafficking 
scheme by flying underage girls and young women into the Virgin Islands to be delivered into 
sexual servitude. 
Plan D LLC repeatedly made flights from the mainland to St. Thomas with 
Epstein and underage girls and young women for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity on 
Little St. James. 
On some occasions, they would transport Epstein and female children by 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 21 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 20 of 55 
helicopter to Little St. James. On other occasions, Epstein and the young women and girls would 
be transported by boat. 
98. 
Great St. Jim, LLC and Nautilus, Inc. knowingly participated in the Epstein 
Enterprise and facilitated the trafficking and sexual servitude of young women and underage girls 
by providing the secluded properties at, from, or to which Epstein and his associates were able to 
transport, transfer, receive, maintain, isolate, harbor, provide, entice, deceive, coerce, and sexually 
abuse underage girls and young women. 
99. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a continuing course of unlawful conduct. 
I 00. 
After Epstein's suicide, the Epstein Enterprise continued to exist as each of the 
participants continued to conspire to prevent detection of the breadth and scope of the Epstein 
Enterprise's criminal wrongdoing and to prevent accountability. These conspiratorial acts are 
ongoing. 
I 01. 
The conduct of the Epstein Enterprise offends the core purpose of the Virgin Islands 
Unifonn Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act, 14 V.I.C. §131 et seq, and 
violates CICO, enacted to "curtail criminal activity and lessen its economic and political power in 
the Territory of the Virgin Islands by establishing new penal prohibitions and providing to law 
enforcement and the victims of criminal activity new civil sanctions and remedies." 14 V.I.C. § 
601. 
102. 
The Epstein Enterprise is an illicit enterprise within the meaning of 14 V.I.C. §§ 
604 and 605. 
103. 
The Government is entitled to recover civil penalties, damages and other remedies 
and to extinguish and recoup from the Epstein Enterprise any and all financial and other benefits, 
and any personal and real property that was used during the course of, or intended for use in the 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 22 of 55
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 21 of 55 
course of the conduct or criminal activity in violation of the laws of the Virgin Islands. The 
Government is entitled to obtain through divestiture, forfeiture, or other equitable relief all 
properties and instrumentalities used by the Epstein Enterprise in the criminal pattern of trafficking 
and sexual abuse in the Virgin Islands, including but not limited to Great St. James and Little St. 
James, and all other remedies and penalties permitted by law in the interest of justice. 
E. The Epstein Enterprise Used Corporate Entities to Defraud the Government and 
Fund its Criminal Activities 
104. 
In October 2012, the Southern Trust Company applied for economic benefits from 
the Economic Development Commission ("EDC''). The EDC is a subsidiary of the Virgin Islands 
Economic Development Authority ("EDA"), a semi-autonomous governmental instrumentality 
created and governed pursuant to 29 VIC§ 1101. 
I 05. 
In sworn testimony at a public hearing on the tax incentive application conducted 
by the EDC on November 15, 2012, Epstein and his attorney, Ericka Kellerhals, described 
Southern Trust Company as providing ''cutting edge consulting services'' in the area of 
"biomedical and financial informatics." 
106. 
The EDC granted Southern Trust Company a 10-year package of economic 
incentives running from February 1, 2013 until January 31, 2023 that included a 90% exemption 
from income taxes and 100% exemptions from gross receipts, excise, and withholding taxes in the 
Virgin Islands. 
107. 
Between 2013 and 2019, Southern Trust Company employed 13 different 
individuals (not including Epstein). Of those 13 individuals, 11 served in administrative or support 
roles: six as personal, administrative, or executive assistants, receptionists, or as a driver/helper, 
one as an office manager, one as a clerk, and three in accounting or payroll functions (though only 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 23 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 22 of 55 
one was licensed as a certified public accountant). There was one network administrator/IT 
manager, and a second who was added in 2019. 
108. 
In fact, several of those individuals seemed to perfonn other personal services for 
Jeffrey Epstein. Though he was reported by Southern Trust Company to be resident of the Virgin 
Islands, the network administrator/IT manager was issued a Florida driver's license, which listed 
an address in Miami. Further, he appears, in fact, to have served as Epstein's driver and picked up 
luggage and cargo from Epstein's private planes on his behalf. 
109. 
Another executive assistant lived at 301 E. 66th Street, Apartment 11 B, New York, 
New York. Epstein's address book lists units various units in this building as providing "Apt. for 
models" and she is publicly identified as a model. As noted above, the Epstein Enterprise used 
modeling opportunities and contracts as a pretext for recruiting underage girls and young women 
into its sex trafficking scheme. 
110. 
During several time periods, Southern Trust Company affinned to EDC that it had 
no employees who were non-residents, even though it employed non-residents. 
111. 
Despite having only one full-time employee working on infonnation technology 
during the bulk of the period, Southern Trust Company reportedly generated net income of $50.3 
million in 2013, $67 .5 million in 2014, $52.8 million in 2015, and $4.8 million in 2016 and $17 .1 
million in 2017, with aggregate income of $117.8 million in 2014, $170.6 million in 2015, $175.3 
million in 2016 and $192.4 million in 2017, or aggregate income for the period of $656 million. 
112. 
For the period between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017, Southern Trust 
Company received tax exemptions totaling $73.6 million. 
113. 
As of December 31, 201 7, Southern Trust Company, Inc. elected to file its income 
tax as an S-corporation, which elects to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credits 

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 33-2     Filed 03/27/20     Page 24 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 23 of55 
through to its sole shareholder-Jeffrey Epstein-for tax purposes. For this time period, Epstein's 
income tax exemption was $71.3 million. 
114. 
Based upon these facts, it is clear that Southern Trust Company did not perfonn the 
•'inforn1atics" business represented to the EDC and could not have generated the business income 
attributable to that business. Instead, upon information and belief, Southern Trust Company 
existed to secure tax benefits for Epstein, to employ individuals associated with the Epstein 
Enterprise, and to provide a source of income to support his criminal activities and properties in 
the Virgin Islands.

The Co-Executors1 submit this Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion, 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF No. 1). 
ARGUMENT 
I.
This motion is procedurally proper and ripe, regardless of its title 
In her opposition brief, Plaintiff argues that this motion should be denied because it is 
procedurally improper.  Plaintiff is wrong.  “[T]he technical name given to a motion challenging 
a pleading is of little importance.”  See C. Wright & A. Miller, 5C Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1380 
(3d ed.).  The Second Circuit has expressly found: “Where the dates in a complaint show that an 
action is barred by a statute of limitations, a defendant may raise the affirmative defense in a pre-
answer motion to dismiss.” Ghartey v. St. John's Queens Hosp., 869 F.2d 160, 162 (2d Cir. 1989) 
(citations omitted).  See also Zimmelman v. Teachers’ Ret. Sys., No. 08-cv-6958 (DAB) (DF), 
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29791, at *16-17, (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2010) (Freeman, M.J.), approved by, 
adopted by, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 29783 (Mar. 26, 2010) (“a motion to dismiss on the basis that a 
plaintiff failed to file a timely administrative charge is analyzed under [Rule] 12(b)(6)”) (citations 
omitted)).  
Plaintiff, citing William A. Gross Construction Assocs. v. American Manufacturers Mutual 
Ins., 600 F. Supp. 2d 587, 590 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) and Underwood v. Roswell Park Cancer Inst., No. 
Civ. 684 (FPG), 2017 WL 131740, at *11 n.8 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 13, 2017), argues that the Court 
should not dismiss her time-barred claims because “the scope of discovery would remain the 
same.”  (Op. Br. p. 4.)2   However, those cases are factually distinguishable.  
William was a construction defects and delay lawsuit in which the court found that, because 
Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Co-Executors’ moving brief (ECF No. 
27). 
ECF. No. 32. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 34     Filed 04/07/20     Page 6 of 16

- 2 - 
the issue of liability would need to be resolved regardless of ancillary motions to dismiss (e.g., to 
dismiss indemnification claims), it made sense to let such claims proceed and revisit them after 
discovery.  Id. at 590.  By contrast, here, it would make no sense to permit Plaintiff to prosecute 
claims that her own allegations establish are time-barred.   
Underwood  was a Title VII lawsuit in which the court declined to dismiss claims on statute 
of limitations grounds because that issue depended on whether each alleged discriminatory action 
was a discrete, unlawful practice, an issue of fact which necessarily depended on the “specific 
nature” and surrounding circumstances of such actions.  Id. at 31.  Here, the issue is whether 
Plaintiff can demonstrate she was unable to discover the alleged abuse for years.  She cannot 
because she alleges the opposite: she knew about the abuse when it allegedly happened to her. 
As explained in the Co-Executors’ moving brief, courts in this District also regularly grant 
motions to dismiss legally deficient claims for punitive damages.  (Mov. Br. pp. 4-5.)  Plaintiff’s 
retort that such cases are “cherry-picked” (Op. Br. p. 4) is unconvincing.  Plaintiff’s suggestion 
that Judges Batts, Buchwald, and Kaplan, among others, misapplied the law, is not credible.  
None of the cases cited by Plaintiff to argue otherwise involves a plaintiff impermissibly 
claiming punitive damages in a personal injury lawsuit against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate in 
direct contravention of applicable law.3  As opposed to those cases, here there are no, and will 
See Range v. 535 Broadway Grp. LLC, No. 17 Civ. 0423 (WHP), 2019 WL 4182966, at *7 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3,

never be any, facts entitling Plaintiff to punitive damages.  (See Op. Br. pp. 4-6.)  Therefore, unlike 
in those actions, here there is no reason to permit the punitive damages claim to stand. 
Even if the Court were to treat this motion as one to strike pursuant to Rule 12(f), it should 
still be granted.  Courts in this District routinely grant motions to strike punitive damages including 
at the pleadings stage.  See, e.g., In re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Sec. Litig., 851 F. Supp. 2d 512, 
544 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting defendant’s motion to strike sections of complaint asserting 
punitive damages); Cerveceria Modelo, S.A. de C.V. v. USPA Accessories LLC, No. 07-cv-7998 
(HB), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28999, at *21-22 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 2008) (“Because Defendant 
has failed to allege that Plaintiff’s conduct was egregious and directed at the public generally, its 
claim for punitive damages cannot proceed.”); Nash v. Coram Healthcare Corp., No. 96-cv-0298 
(LMM), 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9101, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 1996) (granting motion to strike 
punitive damages prayer from the Complaint). 
Citing Burrell v. State Farm & Cas. Co., 226 F. Supp. 2d 427 (S.D.N.Y 2002), and 
Orietview Techs, LLC v. Seven For All Mankind, LLC, No. 13-cv-0538 (PAE), 2013 WL 4016302 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 7, 2013), Plaintiff argues that, even if this motion is deemed one to strike, it should 
be denied.  (Op. Br. p. 4.)  However, those cases are factually distinguishable.  In Burrell, 
homeowners sued an insurer and others alleging Fair Housing Act and RICO violations.  226 F. 
Supp. 2d at 431.  Orietview was a patent infringement lawsuit.  2013 WL 4016302, at *1-2.  Such 
actions have no bearing on this personal injury action against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate.  
II.
Plaintiff invokes inapplicable limitations statutes and tolling principles 
As an initial matter, Plaintiff ignores that, under CPLR § 202, her Complaint must be timely 
under New York law and the law of the jurisdictions where the alleged torts occurred.  Plaintiff’s 
arguments in her opposition brief about why her claims are timely under Florida, N.M. and USVI 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 34     Filed 04/07/20     Page 8 of 16

- 4 - 
law fail to address that her claims are still untimely under N.Y. law.  (Mov. Br. p. 3.)4
In her opposition brief, Plaintiff argues her claims based on alleged abuse occurring in 
N.M. are timely because she has yet to disclose it to a licensed medical or mental health care 
provider, which would trigger the limitations period under N.M. Stat. § 37-1-30(A)(2).  Plaintiff 
is wrong for at least two reasons.  
First, because her cause of action expired long before the current version of N.M. Stat. § 
37-1-30(A)(2) became effective on April 6, 2017, Plaintiff is not entitled to avail herself of it.  See 
In re Venie, 2017-NMSC-018, 395 P.3d 516 (Sup. Ct. N.M. 2017) (distinguishing cases such as 
this, in which a cause of action expires before the enactment of a new limitations period, from 
cases in which a new limitations period extends the time to bring a cause of action before the prior 
limitations period had expired such that a defendant has no vested right in the statute of limitations 
defense based on the prior limitations period).5  Rather, Plaintiff is only entitled to invoke the prior 
version of N.M. Stat. § 37-1-30(A)(2), which provides that an action for damages based on 
personal injury caused by childhood sexual abuse must be commenced “three years from the date 
of the time that a person knew or had reason to know of the childhood sexual abuse and that the 
childhood sexual abuse resulted in an injury to the person, as established by competent medical or 
psychological testimony.”  Plaintiff’s Complaint establishes she knew she was abused and injured 
in 2002.  (Compl. ¶¶ 42-45.)  Therefore, her claims expired 15 years ago. 
Second, even assuming the current version of N.M. Stat. § 37-1-30(A)(2) applies – which 
One of the N.Y. CVA predicates is a NY Penal Law § 130 offense. Plaintiff’s alleged torts occurring outside New 
York do not qualify.  See 1 Kamins, Mehler, Schwartz & Shapiro, New York Criminal Practice, Second Ed., § 2.07 
(Matthew Bender) (“It is axiomatic that the prosecution of a criminal action must rely on a necessary nexus between 
the alleged crime and the geographic jurisdiction of the court.”) 
Accordingly, the N.M. Court of Appeals previously held that a statutory amendment to § 37-1-30 applied where the 
amendment was enacted before the original limitations period expired.  See Grygorwicz v. Trujillo, 2006 NMCA 89 
(N.M. Ct. App. June 13, 2006). 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 34     Filed 04/07/20     Page 9 of 16

- 5 - 
it does not – Plaintiff concedes she has failed to  disclose her alleged abuse to a licensed medical 
or mental health care provider, which is a necessary condition precedent to its application.  (See
Op. Br. 6.)  Plaintiff’s claim based on New Mexico law must be dismissed on that basis alone.  
Plaintiff next argues her claims have not run under Fla. Stat. Ann. § 95.11(7) because she 
has “not yet discovered ‘the causal relationship between the injury and the abuse.’”  (Op. Br. 7 
(citing Fla. Stat. Ann. § 95.11(7).)  Plaintiff is wrong about this as well.   Fla. Stat. Ann. § 95.11(7) 
only applies where a plaintiff alleges she was unable to discover her abuse and its effects, such as 
due to memory loss or a lack of access to records.  See Davis v. Monahan, 832 So. 2d 708, 710 
(Sup. Ct. Fl. 2002) (“In Hearndon, we applied the delayed discovery doctrine to the plaintiff’s 
cause of action … for injuries resulting from childhood sexual abuse.… Although the Legislature 
did not specifically provide for delayed accrual, we reasoned that in the narrow circumstance of 
lack of memory in childhood sexual abuse cases, the doctrine was appropriate because the lack of 
memory was caused by the abuser.”  (citing Hearndon v. Graham, 767 So. 2d 1179 (Sup. Ct. Fla. 
2000)).  Plaintiff makes no such allegations. 
Omar ex rel. Cannon v. Lindsey, 243 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1347 (M.D. Fla.), aff’d, 334 F.3d 
1246 (11th Cir. 2003), which Plaintiff cites in support of her invocation of Fla. Stat. Ann. § 
95.11(7), confirms it is inapplicable to this action.  In Omar, a minor (at the time of the alleged 
torts and lawsuit) foster-child who was under the care of the Florida Department of Children and 
Families (“DCAF”) since he was two years old alleged that, until DCAF produced his records to 
him in 2001, he had no meaningful opportunity to discovery who was responsible for abuse he had 
suffered.  See Omar, No. 02-cv-01063, Compl. (ECF No. 18) at ¶¶ 4, 177-179 (Oct. 15, 2002).  
Here, Plaintiff alleges she knew exactly who abused her when she was 17 and into adulthood and 
that she suffered from such abuse including when it occurred. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 34     Filed 04/07/20     Page 10 of 16

- 6 - 
Plaintiff’s ambiguous allegation intended to plead around the statute of limitations – that 
she is “just beginning to process” the “full extent” of her injuries caused by Decedent due to abuse 
occurring over 15 years ago including when she was an adult – is not a basis to invoke Fla. Stat. 
Ann. § 95.11(7), which is intended to protect victims of childhood sex abuse who are unable to 
discern and thus assert their legal claims.  Plaintiff cites no legal authority establishing otherwise.  
Nor is Plaintiff’s “full extent” allegation a basis to invoke the USVI “discovery rule.” 
“[T]he present case is not one of those exceptional cases where the injury or its cause was not 
immediately known to the victim, as is required for application of the ‘discovery rule’ to the statute 
of limitations.”  Santiago v. V.I. Hous. Auth., 57 V.I. 256, 298 (U.S.V.I. Sup. Ct. 2012) (Swan, 
A.J., concurring).  The USVI Supreme Court has recognized this issue may be decided on the 
pleadings.  Id. at 272. 
In Santiago, the plaintiff argued that the trial court had erred in granting a motion to dismiss 
based on statute of limitations grounds because the “environmental discovery rule” – a claim-
specific counterpart of the general discovery rule invoked by Plaintiff here – applied.  Id. at 272.   
The Supreme Court held the discovery rule did not toll the statute of limitations, finding: 
The discovery rule is not applicable … In her complaint, Santiago asserts 
that she witnessed Stanley open a bucket of Red Hot Sewer Solvent and 
pour its contents into a sewer pipe outside her home. Santiago further claims 
that upon inhaling the fumes from the sewer solvent her eyes, nose and 
throat began to burn; she started vomiting; and she sustained physical 
injuries. Based on her own assertions, Santiago was both aware of her 
alleged injures and their cause on the date they occurred, October 23, 2001. 
Id. at 273 (emphasis added). 
 In this action, Plaintiff  alleges that: Decedent sexually abused her and destroyed her life 
(Compl. ¶¶ 4-7); that “[w]hen [Decedent] inflicted these sexual assaults on [her] … her body froze 
up, and she began crying” (id. ¶ 53); that, “[b]y 2004, [she] felt despair and isolation”; and that, 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 34     Filed 04/07/20     Page 11 of 16

- 7 - 
after Decedent “cast her out” in 2004, she “sank into alcoholism and other self-harm” (id. ¶ 63). 
Accordingly, much like the plaintiff in Santiago, Plaintiff’s own allegations establish that she was 
“aware of her alleged injuries and their cause” long before she filed this lawsuit. 
The cases Plaintiff cites to support her invocation of the discovery rule confirm it only 
applies where, unlike here, a plaintiff is unable to pursue her claims until a belated fact discovery.   
See Joseph v. Hess Oil, 867 F.2d 179, 182 (3d Cir. 1989) (issue was when plaintiff knew he had 
become sick because of asbestos exposure); Hill v. Gov’t Emples. Ret. Sys., 1118/1992, 1993 V.I. 
LEXIS 23, at *1 (Feb. 22, 1993) (issue was when plaintiff knew of the permanency or her physical 
disability following automobile accident for purposes of applying for disability benefits). 
III.
Plaintiff disregards black-letter law establishing punitive damages are barred here. 
Plaintiff does not argue that Florida, N.M. or N.Y. law permits her claim for punitive 
damages.  Therefore, should the Court find the laws of those jurisdictions apply, this motion should 
be granted.   
Nor does Plaintiff cite any legal authority justifying a departure from the black-letter 
choice-of-law principle holding that the law of the place of an alleged tort applies to issues 
regarding punitive damages, which are conduct regulating.  (Mov. Br. p. 5.)   Plaintiff’s central 
premise used to gin up a (feeble) connection to the USVI is that Decedent “purposefully availed 
himself of the benefits of USVI estate law.”  (Op. Br. at p. 11.)  Plaintiff’s assertion is based on 
newspaper articles and other non-binding sources that do not overcome the fact that, per her 
Complaint, N.Y. has a much stronger connection to this lawsuit than the USVI: Plaintiff chose to 
sue here (which is only possible pursuant to the same N.Y. statute that prohibits punitive damages 
against a deceased tortfeasor’s estate);6 Plaintiff alleges N.Y. “was the epicenter” of Decedent’s 
Plaintiff largely ignores Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996). That is because it establishes 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 34     Filed 04/07/20     Page 12 of 16

- 8 - 
wrongdoing (Compl. ¶ 23); and Plaintiff alleges Decedent resided in N.Y. during a “substantial 
portion” of the time relevant to this lawsuit, resided in N.Y. when he died, conducted “substantial” 
business operations in N.Y., and owned or controlled “numerous companies” with a principal place 
of business in N.Y. as well as real property here (id. ¶¶ 18-27).   
The USVI has no interest in applying its laws on punitive damages, which in any event are 
the same as Florida, N.M. and N.Y., to alleged torts that took place in those locations.  The fact 
that Decedent’s estate is being probated in the USVI 16 years after the alleged tortious conduct 
took place is a connection much weaker than the one deemed “tenuous” in Nat’l Jewish 
Democratic Council v. Adelson, No. 18 Civ. 8787 (JPO), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168675, 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2019), on which Plaintiff heavily relies.  Even under the framework of 
Adelson, Florida, N.M. and N.Y., not the USVI, have the greater interests in applying their laws 
to torts that allegedly occurred there.   
Plaintiff’s reliance on Adelson is based on an apparent misinterpretation of that action. In 
Adelson, the National Jewish Democratic Council and its chair sued Sheldon G. Adelson for 
damages based on Adelson’s prior filing of a defamation suit against them in the same court 
pursuant to Nevada law. Id. at *1-2. The court had dismissed Adelson’s prior action pursuant to 
Nevada’s anti-SLAPP statute, which has its own punitive damages provision. Id. at *1-2, 11. In 
the action against Adelson, the court held that Nevada had a much stronger interest in applying its 
punitive damages law because Adelson had previously attempted to use Nevada’s defamation law 
to chill First Amendment rights. Id. at *14. By contrast, “New York’s interest [was] relatively 
attenuated” in the second action because “[i]ts sole connection to this suit [was] that the suit was 
Plaintiff may not have the Court simultaneously apply the first sentence of E.P.T.L. § 11-3.2(a)(1), permitting her to 
bring this case in the first place, but to disregard the very next sentence precluding punitive damages.  See id. at 457. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 34     Filed 04/07/20     Page 13 of 16

filed here.” Id. at *15. Here, the situation is the opposite given the strong N.Y. contacts stated 
above. Other cases Plaintiff cites are distinguishable or support the Co-Executors’ argument.7
a.
Plaintiff’s Banks analysis and supporting arguments are erroneous. 
Plaintiff’s response to the Co-Executors’ Banks analysis is that “USVI case law makes 
clear that the USVI permits punitive damages against any defendant ‘for conduct that is 
outrageous, because of the defendant’s evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of 
others.’”  (Op. Br. p. 13.)  Plaintiff misses the point.  The issue here is not whether the USVI 
permits punitive damages generally.  Rather, the issue is whether a proper Banks analysis shows 
the USVI adopts the majority position by precluding the recovery of punitive damages against a 
deceased tortfeasor’s estate.  As established in the Co-Executors’ moving brief, every Banks factor 
favors the estate on this question.  (Mov. Br. pp. 7-8.) 
Plaintiff’s arguments against the Co-Executors’ Banks analysis are erroneous.  First, 
Plaintiff argues that, unless a jurisdiction enacts a statutory prohibition on punitive damages 
against a tortfeasor’s estate, this Court should find the jurisdiction does not have such a prohibition.  
Plaintiff is wrong.  Many jurisdictions among the majority have judicially adopted the prohibition.  
See Alec A. Beech, COMMENT: Adding Insult to Death: Why Punitive Damages Should Not Be 
Imposed Against a Deceased Tortfeasor’s Estate in Ohio, 49 Akron L. Rev. 553, 564 (2016) 
(thirteen states and D.C. have judicially adopted the majority view).   
Second, Plaintiff contends that the USVI A.G.’s request for punitive damages in a lawsuit 
against Decedent’s estate means the third Banks factor weighs in Plaintiff’s favor.  However, even 
See James v. Powell, 19 N.Y.2d 249, 259-60 (1967) (applying N.Y. law to punitive damages against party who 
sought to prevent collection of N.Y. judgment because N.Y. had strongest interest in protecting its judgment creditors); 
Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Ally Fin. Inc., No. 11-cv-7010 (DLC), 2012 WL 6616061, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2012) 
(“It can hardly be disputed that [N.Y.] and Minnesota, within whose borders the primary conduct allegedly took place, 
have a stronger interest”); King v. Car Rentals, Inc., 29 A.D.3d 205, 212 (2d Dep’t 2006) (applying N.J. law in car 
accident case because the vehicle was owned by a N.J. domiciliary and registered, insured and rented there); Schultz 
v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc., 65 N.Y.2d 189, 195 (1985) (N.J. law applied to injuries “inflicted” there). 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 34     Filed 04/07/20     Page 14 of 16

- 10 - 
where an attorney general purports to interpret a law -- and here the USVI AG did no such thing -
-- the Supreme Court has warned against accepting such interpretation as authoritative. See 
Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 940, 120 S. Ct. 2597, 2614 (2000) (“[O]ur precedent warns 
against accepting as ‘authoritative’ an Attorney General’s interpretation of state law.”). 
Third, Plaintiff argues the availability of punitive damages in this action would further the 
USVI’s rationales for awarding punitive damages – i.e., to punish wrongdoers and for deterrence. 
Yet, a majority of jurisdictions have already deemed that rationale inapplicable after the tortfeasor 
dies.  See, e.g., Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 117 N.M. 337, 346 (N.M. 1994) 
(“punishment and deterrence are not accomplished by enabling recovery of punitive damages from 
the estate of deceased tortfeasors”). 
Fourth, Plaintiff contends there are no “innocent heirs” in this matter.  However, this 
argument is based on pure speculation and otherwise unsupported by any legal authority.   
Fifth, Plaintiff asks the Court to create new law by holding Decedent’s suicide was an 
attempt to avoid punitive damages and, therefore, punitive damages should be permitted.  This is 
also speculation.  Moreover, the only legal authority Plaintiff cites to support this argument is dicta
from an Indiana state law case in which that state joined the majority of jurisdictions holding that 
“Indiana law does not permit recovery of punitive damages from the estate of a deceased 
tortfeasor.” Crabtree ex rel. Kemp v. Estate of Crabtree, 837 N.E.2d 135, 139 (Ind. 2005). 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated above and in their moving brief, the Co-Executors respectfully 
request that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint with prejudice to the extent it is time-barred 
and Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages, together with such other and further relief as the Court 
deems just and proper.

Re: 
Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
Your Honor: 
We represent Plaintiff Teala Davies.  We write regarding Defendants’ 
pending motion to dismiss (ECF 26) to ask the Court to disregard a new legal 
argument that Defendants have improperly raised for the first time in their reply 
brief (ECF 34).   
In their motion, Defendants contend, inter alia, that Plaintiff’s claims 
arising from sexual assaults inflicted on her by Jeffrey Epstein in New Mexico when 
she was seventeen years old are time-barred under New Mexico law.  Defs.’ MOL in 
Support of Motion (ECF 27) at 4.  In their moving brief, Defendants correctly 
identified the applicable New Mexico law governing statutes of limitations in 
childhood sexual abuse cases such as this one: 
Plaintiff’s claims based on alleged torts occurring outside New York 
also expired long ago under the laws of those jurisdictions, including 
non-New York torts that occurred while she was a minor (if any), as 
follows: . . . (New Mexico) for torts occurring while she was a minor, the 
later of the “first instant” of Plaintiff’s 24th birthday (i.e., sometime in 
2009) or 3 years from the date that Plaintiff first disclosed her 
childhood sexual abuse to a licensed medical or mental health care 
provider in the context of receiving health care (N.M. Stat. § 37-1-30) 
(Plaintiff alleges she never made such a disclosure (Compl. ¶ 67)); and, 
after Plaintiff reached age of majority, 3 years (i.e., in 2006) (N.M. 
Stat. § 37-1-8) . . . . 
Id. at 3-4 (emphasis added).   Plaintiff agrees that this is the governing legal 
standard under New Mexico law, and that her claim is timely if brought within 

PAGE 2 OF 3 
three years from the date that she “first disclose[s] the person’s childhood sexual 
abuse to a licensed medical or mental health provider in the context of receiving 
health care from the provider.”  Plaintiff’s MOL in Opposition (ECF 32) at 6 
(quoting N.M. Stat. § 37-1-30(A)(2)).   
Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement on the applicable legal 
standard governing the timeliness of Plaintiff’s New Mexico claims, Defendants’ 
reply brief attempts for the first time to suggest that a different legal standard 
applies.  Even though Defendants cited New Mexico Statutes § 37-1-30 in their 
opening brief and correctly stated that under that the statute the limitations period 
does not begin to run until “Plaintiff first disclosed her childhood sexual abuse to a 
licensed medical or mental health care provider in the context of receiving health 
care,” Defendants now contend for the first time on reply that “Plaintiff is not 
entitled to avail herself” of that standard, and that the Court must apply an older 
version of that statute.  Defs.’ Reply MOL (ECF 34) at 9.   
It is well established that “arguments raised for the first time in a 
reply brief are waived.”  Cottam v. Global Emerging Capital Group, LLC, No. 16 
Civ. 4584 (LGS), 2020 WL 1528526, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2020); RL 900 Park 
LLC v. Ender, No. 18 Civ. 12121 (AT), 2020 WL 70920, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 
2020); Gonzalez v. United States, No. 17 Civ. 1093 (WHP), 2019 WL 3408886, at *2 
n.2 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2019); Centeno v. City of New York, No. 16 Civ. 2393 (VSB), 
2019 WL 1382093, at *6 n.13 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2019); Coscarelli v. ESquared 
Hosp. LLC, 364 F. Supp. 3d 207, 219 n.10 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  Accordingly, the Court 
must ignore Defendants’ belated attempt to argue that a different legal standard 
applies. 
Even if Defendants had not plainly waived this new argument, and 
even if the pre-2017 version of New Mexico Statutes § 37-1-30 applied to Plaintiff’s 
claims, Defendants’ motion would still fail.  Under the version of that statute that 
was in effect between 1995 and 2017, a claim is timely if brought before the latter of 
the plaintiff’s twenty-fourth birthday or “three years from the date of the time that 
a person knew or had reason to know of the childhood sexual abuse and that the 
childhood sexual abuse resulted in an injury to the person, as established by 
competent medical or psychological testimony.”  Kevin J. v. Sager, 999 P.2d 1026, 
1028 (N.M. App. 1999).  In Kevin J., for example, after discovery had been 
completed, the Court considered testimony from the plaintiff’s expert that, “even 
though Plaintiff had some cognitive understanding and realization of the abuse and 
its effect upon him prior to February 5, 1994, Plaintiff did not finally pull it all 
together and realize the impact that the abuse had on his life until after February 
5, 1994,” and that “it’s a process that unfolds for people.”  Id. at 1029; see also id. at 
1027 (“Plaintiff does not claim that he repressed any memory of the alleged 
abuse.”).   The court denied summary judgment was improper, holding that “[t]he 
question of when Plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the alleged abuse and its 
impact is a question for the jury to decide.”  Id. at 1030.  Here, Plaintiff has alleged 
that that she “is still in the nascent stages of understanding the deep and lasting 

PAGE 3 OF 3 
injuries that Epstein’s pattern of abuse has caused her,” and that she “is still just 
beginning to process and understand the full extent of the injuries that Epstein’s 
abuse had caused her and the connection between Epstein’s abuse and the 
emotional and psychological injuries she had experienced.” Complaint (ECF 1) ¶¶ 
65, 68.  Accordingly, even if the pre-2017 version of the New Mexico statute applied, 
Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to allege that her claims are timely, and 
Defendants’ cannot meet their burden of proving that Plaintiff’s New Mexico claims 
are time-barred, particularly at this phase before fact and expert discovery have 
been conducted.  
The Court should ignore Defendants’ new argument both because it 
was raised for the first time in reply and because it is in any event meritless.   
Respectfully submitted,

Re: 
Teala Davies v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Executors of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:19-cv-10788 (GHW) (DCF) 
Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. We 
write in response to Plaintiff Teala Davies’ (“Plaintiff”) April 8, 2020 letter (ECF No. 35) seeking 
to strike an argument from the Co-Executors’ reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss 
Plaintiff’s claims based on torts that allegedly occurred over fifteen years ago. Plaintiff’s 
counsel filed their letter, without first conferring with us, incorrectly claiming that the Co-
Executors raised a new legal argument in their reply, and supplying new argument themselves, 
in a rushed attempt at a do-over following their failure to avoid the correct version of the statute 
of limitations applicable to Plaintiff’s claims based on conduct that allegedly occurred in New 
Mexico in 2002. The Court should reject Plaintiff’s request for at least five reasons.  
First, there is no “new” argument here. Plaintiff’s counsel argues that the Co-Executors’ 
reply brief “attempts for the first time to suggest that a different legal standard applies.” (ECF 
No. 35 at 2.) That is wrong. The Co-Executors contended from the outset, and continue to 
contend, that Plaintiff’s New Mexico claims are time-barred. The Co-Executors argued this in 
both their motion to dismiss and their reply. (ECF No. 27 at 4; ECF No. 34 at 4.) And Plaintiff’s 
counsel concedes that the Co-Executors “correctly identified the applicable New Mexico law.” 
(ECF No. 35 at 1). Plaintiff has thus been aware since day one that the Co-Executors are 
moving to dismiss her claims as time-barred and was apprised of the legal bases for that 
motion. 
Even where an argument in a party’s reply brief is deemed an “extension” of an 
argument made in its moving brief, the argument is not “new.” Niv v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 710 F. 
Supp. 2d 328, 338 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). In Niv, the court rejected plaintiff’s letter request to 
disregard defendants’ argument that Israel was an adequate alternative forum on the ground it

April 10, 2020 
Page 2 
was newly raised in defendants’ reply. Id. The Niv court held that the argument was not new, as 
defendants’ motion argued that New York was not an adequate forum, and thus the contention 
that Israel was an adequate forum was simply an extension of this argument. Id. 
There is also no unfair surprise1 warranting the Court’s disregard of the Co-Executors’ 
legal arguments. See Ruggiero v. Warner-Lambert Co., 424 F.3d 249, 252 (2d Cir. 2005) 
(finding plaintiff could not claim she was “blind-sided” by defendants’ reliance on a particular 
argument that was raised, albeit more generally, in defendants’ moving papers).  
Second, even if an argument is deemed “new,” where, as here, it is reasonable to expect 
that argument, it is not prejudicial for the Court to consider it. Niv, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 338 n.4 
(“[E]ven if considered a new argument, the Court believes that it was reasonable to expect this 
argument and therefore it is not prejudicial to plaintiffs to consider those materials.”). 
Third, even if the Co-Executors supplied a new argument in their reply brief—they did 
not—the Court has the discretion to and should consider it in the interest of justice. See Am. 
Hotel Int’l Grp. Inc. v. OneBeacon Ins. Co., 611 F. Supp. 2d 373, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“[T]he 
Second Circuit has made it abundantly clear that a district court has discretion to consider a 
belatedly-raised argument.”); Niv, 710 F. Supp. 2d at 338 n.4 (holding a court may consider a 
new argument raised in reply where “in the interest of justice”). The correct version of the statute 
applicable to Plaintiff’s New Mexico claims is a potentially dispositive legal issue this Court must 
determine. This Court should not be precluded from considering that version merely because 
Plaintiff failed to consider it. That is especially so where, as here, Plaintiff does not contend that 
she has been unfairly prejudiced or surprised. 
Fourth, Plaintiff’s substantive argument—that, even under the correct version of the 
statute, her claims arising from alleged acts in New Mexico are timely—is incorrect. The 
applicable version of the statute of limitations required her to commence an action by the later 
of: (1) the first instant of the person’s twenty-fourth birthday (“Prong One”); or (2) three years 
from the date of the time that a person knew or had reason to know of the childhood sexual 
abuse and that the childhood sexual abuse resulted in an injury to the person, as established 
by competent medical or psychological testimony (“Prong Two”). Kevin J. v. Sager, 2000-
NMCA-012, ¶ 7, 128 N.M. 794, 796-97, 999 P.2d 1026, 1028-29 (citing the correct version of 
N.M. Stat. § 37-1-30, emphasis added). Plaintiff alleges in her Complaint that she “still has not 
disclosed her abuse to a licensed medical or mental health care provider in the context of 
receiving health care from that provider.” (ECF No. 1 ¶ 67.) Because there is no date under 
Prong Two, Plaintiff must have filed her claims by the date established in Prong One. Because 
Plaintiff’s Complaint establishes conclusively that she knew she was abused and injured in New 
Mexico in 2002, and that she turned twenty-four in 2009, her claims expired under Prong One 
years ago. (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 34, 42-45.)  
Plaintiff’s reliance on Kevin J. v. Sager is misplaced. In Kevin J., plaintiff saw a licensed 
counselor who helped plaintiff understand the abuse he had suffered and established the date 
upon which this understanding occurred. 128 N.M. at 795. Here, Plaintiff concedes she has not 
seen a licensed medical or mental health care provider.   
Plaintiff does not claim she was surprised or unfairly prejudiced by the so-called “new argument.”

Fifth, Plaintiff continues to ignore that, under New York’s borrowing statute, CPLR § 202, 
which is applicable to federal diversity actions such as this,2 her claim must be timely under the 
statute of limitations of both New York and the jurisdiction where the claim accrued. Thus, even 
if Plaintiff’s claims were timely under New Mexico law—they are not—they still fail because they 
are untimely under New York law. At the time Plaintiff was allegedly sexually assaulted in 2002, 
New York’s statute of limitations required a plaintiff sexually assaulted as a minor to file her 
cause of action one year after reaching the age of 18. (CPLR 208; CPLR 215(c).) According to 
the Complaint, Plaintiff turned 18 sometime in 2003. Accordingly, her claims for alleged torts 
occurring in New Mexico while she was a minor expired in 2004.3
In sum, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Co-Executors rely on a new argument in 
their reply and concedes the Co-Executors have always argued that Plaintiff’s New Mexico 
claims were untimely under N.M. Stat. § 37-1-30. Nor has Plaintiff established any unfair 
prejudice or surprise warranting disregard of the Co-Executors’ legal arguments. Finally, Plaintiff 
is incorrect on the merits, as her claims are untimely.  
The real issue here is that Plaintiff failed to plead around the correct version of N.M. Stat 
§ 37-1-30 in her Complaint or to address it in her opposition brief. The version she (erroneously) 
attempted to invoke is inapplicable to her claims because it became effective years after those 
claims expired. That Plaintiff missed this important legal issue and did not address the proper 
version of the statute in her Complaint or opposition brief is not a basis on which to disregard 
the Co-Executors’ arguments, nor to permit Plaintiff to offer new argument by de facto sur-reply 
brief submitted without leave of the Court. The Court should reject Plaintiff’s letter motion and 
grant the Co-Executors’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF. No. 27).

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
MARY DOE, 
Plaintiff,  
-v-  
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
and SARAH VICKERS, 
Defendants. 
Civ. 10758 (PAE) 
OPINION & ORDER 
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:  
In this diversity action, plaintiff Mary Doe1 brings tort claims under New York law 
against, inter alia, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, the executors of the estate of Jeffrey 
Epstein (“Indyke and Kahn” or “the executor defendants”).  The executor defendants now move 
to dismiss Doe’s claim against them for punitive damages, on the grounds that, as a matter of 
New York law, such damages are categorically unavailable in a personal injury action against the 
personal representative of an estate.2  For the reasons that follow, the Court grants that motion.  
I. 
Background 
A. 
Doe’s Complaint 
Doe’s Complaint, filed on November 20, 2019, alleges a horrific course of sexual and 
psychological abuse at Epstein’s hands during 2004 and 2005.  Cmplt. ¶¶ 1–15 (summary 
account); id. ¶¶ 38–106 (detailed account).  It alleges that Doe came to the United States with her 
Doe has been granted leave to proceed pseudonymously.  Dkt. 21. 
Doe also sues Sarah Vickers, who is alleged to have served as Epstein’s scheduler and assistant.  
See Dkt. 1 (Complaint, or “Cmplt.”) ¶ 19.  Doe’s bid for punitive damages against Vickers is not 
implicated by this motion.  
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 1 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 39-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 1 of 17

parents as a young refugee from a war-torn country, and was working in pursuit of a promising 
career as a model when, in 2004, at age 16, she met Epstein through another model.  Id. ¶ 2.  
Epstein made clear to Doe how important and powerful he was and promised to help her with her 
modeling career and college admissions.  Id. ¶ 3.  Doe, in turn, “believed she could trust him” 
and “that he could change her life.”  Id. ¶ 4.  Epstein, however, “used his power over Mary to 
sexually abuse her, viciously and repeatedly.”  Id. ¶ 5.  Aided by defendant Sarah Vickers, 
Epstein’s scheduler and assistant, Epstein “would summon Mary to his Manhattan townhouse, 
order her to give him massages, and then subject her to sexual acts, the severity of which 
increased over time.”  Id.; see also id. ¶ 19.  The Complaint graphically chronicles Epstein’s acts 
of sexual abuse in the townhouse, which included forcing Doe to perform oral sex on him and 
later raping her.  Id. ¶¶ 7–9; 56–105.  
In late 2005, the Complaint alleges, Doe—as a result of an incident at the townhouse—
“suddenly saw the truth: she was not even a human being to Epstein, she was an object,” and 
Epstein was treating her as a prostitute, “one of many girls he treated as sexual objects.”  Id. 
¶ 11.  Doe had a breakdown, almost immediately thereafter left New York City, returned to her 
parents’ home across the country, and never saw Epstein again.  Id. ¶ 12.  Epstein’s abuse caused 
Doe to abandon her modeling career and left her humiliated, angry, and suicidal, with debilitating 
panic attacks and “dramatic psychological scars.”  Id. ¶¶ 13–14.  Epstein’s arrest in July 2019 
gave Doe “brief[] hope that he might finally face consequences,” but his death in August 2019 at 
a federal jail in Manhattan “left Mary with the desolate sense that he has evaded justice yet 
again.”  Id. ¶ 15. 
In this action, Doe brings claims, under New York law, of battery, id. ¶¶ 108–13, assault, 
id. ¶¶ 114–19, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress, id. ¶¶ 120–27, against Indyke

and Kahn, solely in their capacities as executors of Epstein’s estate, id. ¶ 18, and against Vickers, 
for her “integral role in operating Epstein’s operation of sex trafficking Mary and other girls,” id. 
¶ 19.  As its basis for personal jurisdiction over the executors, it alleges that “Epstein was subject 
to personal jurisdiction at the time of his death,” id. ¶ 22, “because the tortious acts giving rise to 
Plaintiff’s claims took place in New York State,” id. ¶ 23.  The Complaint seeks, in addition to 
compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees and costs, “punitive damages in an amount to be 
determined at trial.”  Id. p. 19. 
B. 
The Executors’ Partial Motion to Dismiss 
 On January 21, 2020, the executor defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss, Dkt. 17, 
and a supporting memorandum of law, Dkt. 18 (“Def. Mem.”).  It sought dismissal of the prayer 
for punitive damages on the ground that such damages cannot, as a matter of New York law, be 
sought against the personal representatives of an estate.  On March 3, 2020, Doe filed a 
memorandum of law in opposition, Dkt. 28 (“Doe Opp’n”), and a supporting declaration by 
Daniel Mullkoff, Esq., Dkt. 29 (“Mullkoff Decl.”), which attached Epstein’s will.  On March 20, 
2020, the executor defendants filed a reply.  Dkt. 33 (“Def. Reply”). 
II. 
Applicable Legal Standards Under Rule 12(b)(6)  
To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must plead “enough 
facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 
550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim will only have “facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads 
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable 
for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  A complaint is 
properly dismissed where, as a matter of law, “the allegations in a complaint, however true, 
could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558.  When resolving a 
motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 3 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 39-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 3 of 17

and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  Steginsky v. Xcelera Inc., 
741 F.3d 365, 368 (2d Cir. 2014).  That tenet, however, “is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”  
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  Pleadings that offer only “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic 
recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. 
III. 
Discussion 
 In moving to dismiss Doe’s prayer for punitive damages against them, the executor 
defendants argue that New York law applies to this personal injury action and categorically 
prohibits an award of punitive damages against the personal representatives of an estate.  
Specifically, they note, § 11-3.2(a)(1) of New York’s Estates, Powers and Trusts Law (“EPTL”) 
provides: 
No cause of action for injury to person or property is lost because of the death of 
the person liable for the injury.  For any injury, an action may be brought or 
continued against the personal representative of the decedent, but punitive 
damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought 
to recover damages for personal injury. 
EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1) (emphasis added).  
Applying this statute, courts have held punitive damages unavailable in personal injury 
actions against executors or administrators of estates.  These include federal courts determining 
the damages available for constitutional-tort claims under New York law, see, e.g., Graham v. 
Henderson, 224 F.R.D. 59, 63 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (precluding, based on EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), 
punitive damages claims in § 1983 action against estate administrators, and noting that New 
York law is “very clear” on this point); Blissett v. Eisensmidt, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996) 
(overturning, based on EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), jury’s punitive damages award in § 1983 case 
against estate, and noting “strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an 
estate on account of wrongful conduct of the decedent”), and state courts in personal injury 
actions governed by New York law, see, e.g., Gordon v. Nathan, 352 N.Y.S.2d 464, 464

(1st Dep’t. 1974) (affirming dismissal of punitive damages claim because, under EPTL 
§ 11-3.2(a)(1), defendant’s death precluded recovery of punitive damages from personal 
representatives of estate); cf. Flaum v. Birnbaum, 582 N.Y.S.2d 853, 857 (4th Dep’t. 1992) 
(affirming denial of punitive damages in case against deceased executor; citing EPTL 
§ 11-3.2(a)(1) and the “strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an 
estate on account of the wrongful conduct of the decedent”).   
The law of a majority of states is in accord with EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), as reflected in the 
Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (1979) (“Punitive 
damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor[.]”); see also Doe 
Opp’n at 12 (acknowledging that “a majority of states do not permit punitive damages against 
estates”).  This majority rule aligns with “[t]he general rule under federal common law,” that “an 
action survives the death of a party insofar as it is remedial[,] and not penal[,] in nature.”  See, e.g., 
Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Exeter Holdings, Ltd. v. Haltman, No. 13 Civ. 5475 
(JS) (AKT), 2017 WL 9485707, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2017) (collecting cases), report and 
recommendation adopted, 2017 WL 3981299 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2017).   
The justification commonly given for precluding punitive damage awards against estates 
is that punishment and deterrence—the recognized bases for imposing punitive damages on a 
tortfeasor—are not advanced by imposing punitive damages on his or her estate.  As the New 
Mexico Supreme Court explained in adopting the majority rule:  “[P]unishment and deterrence 
are not accomplished by enabling recovery of punitive damages from the estate of deceased 
tortfeasors”; “[w]hen the tortfeasor cannot be punished for his culpable behavior, punitive 
damages no longer have the desired effect and, therefore, the victim loses the legal entitlement to

recover those damages.”  Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 871 P.2d 1343, 1351 
(N.M. 1994) (canvassing laws of other states). 
 Doe does not dispute that EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1) precludes punitive damages in a personal 
injury action under New York law.  Instead, Doe makes three arguments: (1) that defendants’ 
motion is premature, Doe Mem. at 4; (2) that defendants’ motion is improperly styled as a 
motion to dismiss, id. at 3; and (3) that the law of the United States Virgin Islands (“USVI”), not 
New York law, applies, and permits punitive damages against an estate, id. at 4–13. 
Doe’s first argument is quickly dispatched.  Doe cites cases where courts have declined 
to resolve motions to dismiss aimed at prayers for relief, finding such motions premature.  See id. 
at 4 (citations omitted).  But a review of these cases reflects that the motions in those cases were 
not based on categorical preclusions of punitive damages.  In contrast, where punitive damages 
have been unavailable as a matter of law, courts have not hesitated to dismiss prayers for such 
damages at the threshold.  See, e.g., Murtha v. N.Y. State Gaming Comm’n, No. 17 Civ. 10040 
(NSR), 2019 WL 4450687, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2019) (dismissing demand for punitive 
damages under the New York State Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”) because it “does not 
provide for punitive damages”); Rosen v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 18 Civ. 6670 (AT), 
2019 WL 4039958, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2019) (granting motion to dismiss demand for 
punitive damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the New York City 
Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”) where neither statute permitted a plaintiff to recover punitive

“precluded as a matter of law”); Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Ctr. v. Gen. Reins. Corp., 
No. 16 Civ. 2063 (CM), 2016 WL 5793996, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2016) (“In this case, the 
circumstances surrounding the denial of the insurance indemnification claim do not warrant the 
rare exception provided for punitive damages under a breach of contract claim.  For this reason,

14, 2004) (dismissing punitive damages claim because such damages are unavailable in § 1983 
actions against municipalities).  Provided that New York law applies to this action, this case, too, 
involves a categorical preclusion of such damages, under EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), that can be 
adjudicated at the threshold. 
Doe’s second argument is that the defendant-executors’ challenge is improperly brought 
as a motion to dismiss.  Doe Mem. at 3 & n.3.  There is divided case authority on this point.  
Courts, including in the cases cited above, have granted motions to dismiss prayers for such 
relief.  But others have declined to entertain such motions, stating that, “[b]ecause punitive 
damages are a form of damages, not an independent cause of action, a motion to dismiss a prayer 
for relief in the form of punitive damages is ‘procedurally premature.’”  Farina v. Metro. Transp.

961 F. Supp. 2d 522, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).   
The Court has no occasion to resolve this conceptual debate, because the executors’ 
motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) alternatively can be treated as a motion to strike under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f).  See C. Wright & A. Miller, 5C Federal Practice and 
Procedure § 1380 (3d ed.) (“[T]he technical name given to a motion challenging a pleading is of 
little importance inasmuch as prejudice to the nonmoving party hardly can result from treating a 
motion that has been inaccurately denominated a motion to strike as a motion to dismiss the 
complaint.”).  And under Rule 12(f), on a motion or sua sponte, a court may strike from a 
pleading an “insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous 
matter.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  Although motions to strike under Rule 12(f) are generally 
“disfavored and granted only if there is a strong reason to do so,” Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. 
Media, Inc., No. 09 Civ. 2227 (PAC), 2013 WL 1746062, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2013) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Roe v. City of New York, 151 F. Supp. 2d 495, 510 
(S.D.N.Y. 2001)); see also Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., 551 F.2d 887, 893 (2d 
Cir. 1976)), ample authority permits striking prayers for punitive damages where such relief is 
unavailable as a matter of law.  See, e.g., In re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Sec. Litig., 
851 F. Supp. 2d 512, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting motion to strike sections of complaint

necessary to sustain punitive damages award in case involving fraud and deceit); Ladenburg 
Thalmann & Co. v. Imaging Diagnostic Sys., Inc., 176 F. Supp. 2d 199, 207 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) 
(granting motion to strike punitive damages because complaint did not allege, inter alia, egregious 
conduct sufficient to sustain such an award); Brady v. Port. Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., No. 93 Civ. 1679 
(NG) (CLP), 1998 WL 724061, at *2–3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 1998) (granting motion to strike 
punitive damages claims on grounds that Port Authority was immune from such damages); Nash v. 
Coram Healthcare Corp., No. 96 Civ. 0298 (LMM), 1996 WL 363166, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 1996) 
(granting motion to strike prayer for punitive damages because complaint did not allege facts 
sufficient to support such damages in breach of contract case).   
Here, there is practical wisdom in treating defendant’s motion as one to strike, if doing so 
is necessary to enable the Court to resolve at the jump the viability of Doe’s prayer for punitive 
damages.  With numerous personal injury actions pending against the Epstein estate as a result of 
the recent enactment of the New York Child Victims Act, there is value in clarifying—for the 
parties and settlors—the damages available in actions where the law permits a sure answer on 
this point. 
Doe’s final argument is that USVI, not New York, law governs whether punitive 
damages are available.  Because this Court sits in New York, it applies a New York choice of 
law analysis to that question.  See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 
(1941); Md. Cas. Co. v. Cont’l Cas. Co., 332 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir. 2003) (“A federal court 
sitting in diversity applies the choice-of-law rules of the forum state.”).  “Where, as here, the 
claims sound in tort, New York courts apply an ‘interest analysis’ to determine choice-of-law 
issues.”  Golden v. Wyeth, Inc., No. 04 Civ. 2841 (JS), 2013 WL 4500879, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 20, 2013).  Under that analysis, punitive damages are considered to be conduct-regulating, 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 9 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 39-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 9 of 17

and “the law of the jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply.” See, e.g., Starr 
Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Am. Claims Mgmt., Inc., No. 14 Civ. 0463 (JMF), 2015 WL 2152816, *3 
(S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2015) (quoting Guidi v. Inter-Cont’l Hotels Corp., No. 95 Civ. 9006 (LAP), 
2003 WL 1907901, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2003)); Bauta v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., No. 14 Civ. 3725 
(RER), 2019 WL 8060183, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2019).  Here, the torts alleged occurred 
entirely in New York.  The personal injury claims which Doe’s Complaint brings arise from 
sexual assaults and related conduct that, as alleged, occurred exclusively within New York 
City—in and around Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse.  
Doe counters by noting that, while this rule applies as a general matter, it may be overcome 
if there is good reason not to apply it.  Doe Mem. at 5 (citing Nat’l Jewish Democratic Council v. 
Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d 416, 424–25 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)).  In arguing that there is reason not to 
apply New York law to the punitive damages question here, Doe relies on the doctrine of dépeçage, 
under which courts may treat the choice of law analysis for one (or more) issues in a case––in 
this instance, the availability of punitive damages––as distinct from the rest of its analysis, here 
the applicability of New York law to Doe’s tort claims for compensatory damages.  Id.; see also 
2002 Lawrence R. Buchalter Alaska Tr. v. Phila. Fin. Life Assurance Co., 96 F. Supp. 3d 182, 
200 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Ally Fin. Inc., No. 11 Civ. 7010 (DLC), 
2012 WL 6616061, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2012).   
Doe argues that, although New York may have the greater interest in resolving issues 
relating to compensatory damages, the USVI, where the executors are domiciled and where 
Epstein’s will is to be probated, has the greater interest as to punitive damages, which, unlike 
compensatory damages, are defendant-focused.  Doe Mem. at 7–8.  Doe does not argue that the 
executor-defendants themselves merit punishment or are in need of deterrence.  Instead, Doe 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 10 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 39-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 10 of 17

argues that Epstein’s decision to alter his will shortly before his suicide to provide that it would 
be probated in the USVI was strategically motivated.  She argues that his executors “should not 
be permitted to selectively avail themselves of certain benefits of USVI law but avoid those 
aspects of USVI law that they do not like.”  Id. at 7. 
The Court is unpersuaded.  Whatever benefits Epstein envisioned for his estate by virtue 
of probating his will in the USVI, Doe does not articulate any relevant to this litigation.  Other 
than conclusorily, Doe does not argue that the decision to probate Epstein’s will in the USVI will 
have any adverse bearing on a personal injury action brought against the estate in New York that 
involves tortious conduct in New York.  Doe does not argue, for example, that the probating of 
Epstein’s will in the USVI stands to insulate his assets from recovery from such a plaintiff, or 
otherwise impede her or others victimized in New York from recovering on meritorious claims.  
Doe’s point that the estate may prosper from being probated in the USVI is disconnected from 
her claims.3   
More fundamentally, Doe does not articulate any concrete interest that the USVI has in 
either vindicating the rights of a victim sexually abused in a Manhattan townhouse in 2004 and 
2005 or, specially relevant to punitive damages, in assuring that the perpetrator of that abuse is 
adequately punished and deterred.  In contrast, the Second Circuit has noted the strong interest 
that New York has with respect to “conduct-regulating” rules, including regarding damages, with 
respect to unlawful behavior within its borders: 
“If conflicting conduct-regulating laws are at issue, the law of the jurisdiction 
where the tort occurred will generally apply because that jurisdiction has the 
greatest interest in regulating behavior within its borders.”  Cooney v. Osgood 
If anything, the probating of the estate in the USVI may stand to benefit the estate’s creditors, 
and thereby potentially Doe, to the extent that an estate probated in the USVI may avoid the high 
estate-tax rates imposed by New York State.

Mach., Inc., 81 N.Y.2d 66, 72 (1993).  In Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian 
Bank, SAL[,] . . . we observed that, under New York law, when the jurisdictions of 
the conduct and injury are distinct, “it is the place of the allegedly wrongful 
conduct that generally has superior ‘interests in protecting the reasonable 
expectations of the parties who relied on the laws of that place to govern their 
primary conduct and in the admonitory effect that applying its law will have on 
similar conduct in the future.’”  [739 F.3d 45, 50–51 (2d Cir. 2013)] (quoting 
Schultz [v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc., 65 N.Y.2d 189, 198 (1985)]) (alterations 
omitted).  Here, the allegedly wrongful conduct . . .  took place in New York . . . .  
We therefore conclude that New York’s rules on fraud damages and negligent 
misrepresentation apply. 
AHW Inv. P’ship, MFS v. Citigroup, Inc., 661 F. App’x 2, 5 (2d Cir. 2016).  New York’s interest 
is also reinforced by the fact that Doe’s suit is timely only by virtue of the state’s recent 
enactment of the New York Child Victims Act, which temporarily revived time-barred suits.  See 
Cmplt. ¶ 107. 
That New York law governs the availability of punitive damages is further reinforced by 
Doe’s having sued the executor defendants under EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1).  It is problematic for her 
to cherrypick within that provision, invoking the part that authorizes a personal injury suit 
against an executor while disclaiming the balance, which delimits the recovery available in such 
a suit.4  See Blissett, 940 F. Supp. at 457 (“[I]t would be an anomalous situation indeed if 
plaintiff were allowed to proceed with this [§] 1983 action against the estate of Casey because of 
[§] 11-3.2(a)(1), while at the same time he was allowed to recover relief in the form of punitive 
damages, which clearly is beyond the scope of relief which that statute authorizes.”).  Such a 
result is also inconsistent with the doctrine of dépeçage, where one forum’s law is “applied to 
regulate certain issues arising from a given transaction or occurrence, while those of another 
system regulate the other issues.”  Schwartz v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., 492 F. Supp. 2d 308, 328 
Doe’s claims undisputedly all qualify as personal injury claims.  See N.Y. Gen. Constr. Law 
§ 37-a. (defining “personal injury” as including “an assault, battery, false imprisonment, or other 
actionable injury to the person either of the plaintiff, or of another”).  Doe does not argue 
otherwise.

539 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2008).  Here, Doe, in selectively drawing upon EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), seeks 
to invoke dépeçage to apply two different sets of laws to a single issue.  The doctrine does not 
invite such a result. 
Finally, Adelson, on which Doe relies in claiming that USVI law governs punitive 
damages, is inapposite.  Adelson had brought an earlier action in this District for defamation, in 
breach of Nevada law, against the National Jewish Democratic Council and its chair (together, 
“NJDC”).   Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d at 420–21.  That action had been dismissed pursuant to 
Nevada’s anti-SLAPP statute.  NJDC then sued Adelson, seeking punitive damages under that 
same Nevada statute.  Id.  On Adelson’s motion to dismiss the punitive damages prayer, Judge 
Oetken held that Nevada’s interest was stronger than New York’s as to punitive damages, 
because Adelson had brought the initial suit under Nevada law and because it had been 
dismissed under the Nevada SLAPP statute on which the NJDC now pursued punitive damages.  
He reasoned that “because the litigant has attempted to use Nevada’s defamation law to chill 
First Amendment rights, Nevada has a corresponding interest in punishing the litigant for 
maliciously invoking Nevada law and in deterring future litigants from doing the same.”  
Adelson, 417 F. Supp. 3d at 426 (citing Schultz, 65 N.Y.2d at 198).  Noting that “[p]unitive 
damages are designed to punish the defendant, not to compensate the plaintiff,” Judge Oetken 
explained that “the choice-of-law inquiry for punitive damages provisions is necessarily 
defendant-focused” in this way.  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Golden, 
2013 WL 4500879, at *3).  By contrast, Judge Oetken concluded that New York’s interest in the 
dispute was “relatively attenuated” and effectively limited to the fact that the suit was filed in 
federal district court in Manhattan where, notably, the claims were brought under Nevada 
Case 1:19-cv-10758-PAE-DCF   Document 38   Filed 04/28/20   Page 13 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 39-1     Filed 04/28/20     Page 13 of 17

defamation law.  “After all, New York lacks a particularized interest either in protecting 
defendants from liability under Nevada defamation law or in controlling the behavior of litigants 
who file in the federal courts.  And where the locus jurisdiction has a merely fortuitous 
relationship with the case, that jurisdiction’s interest in the case is minimal.”  Id. at 426–27 
(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Doe’s case in this District, in contrast to 
Adelson, does not build on a prior litigation in, or based on the law of, the USVI. 
In any event, the choice of law debate here appears academic.  That is because, while the 
USVI does not have a statute on point and USVI courts have not squarely resolved the issue, it is 
likely that USVI common law would not permit an award of punitive damages against an estate.  
In 2011, the USVI Supreme Court instructed courts to apply what it terms a “Banks analysis” to 
determine USVI common law.  This entails consideration of “three non-dispositive factors”: 
(1) whether any USVI court has previously adopted a particular rule; (2) the position taken by a 
majority of courts of other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, which rule represents the 
soundest rule for the USVI.  See Gov’t of Virgin Islands v. Connor, 60 V.I. 597, 600 (2014); 
Matthew v. Herman, 56 V.I. 674, 680 (2012); Banks v. Int’l Rental & Leasing Corp., 55 V.I. 967, 
979 (2011).  The parties differ as to how these factors apply, but the executors’ assessment is the 
more persuasive. 
As to the first Banks factor, USVI courts have repeatedly cited the Restatement (Second) 
of Torts § 908 favorably.  Twice, albeit in dicta, they have expressly quoted the language in 
comment (a) to § 908 that bars an award of punitive damages against the estate of a decedent 
tortfeasor.  See Hamilton v. Dowson Holding Co., 51 V.I. 619, 628 (D.V.I. 2009) (“Punitive 
damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor nor, ordinarily, in 
an action under a death statute.” (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (1979))

2014 WL 1394183, at *2 n.13 (V.I. Super. Ct. Apr. 3, 2014) (“Applying a Banks analysis, the 
Court finds that Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(2) reflects the common law of this 
jurisdiction . . . .  [C]onsidering the longstanding application of the Restatement (Second) of 
Torts § 908(2) in this jurisdiction and the apparent widespread application of this rule in a 
majority of jurisdictions, the Court finds that the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908(2) 
represents the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands, and is in accord with local public policy.”).  
Doe has not cited any contrary authority. 
As to the second Banks factor, the parties agree that, consistent with the Restatement, 
most U.S. jurisdictions do not permit an award of punitive damages against a tortfeasor’s estate.  
See, e.g., Crabtree ex rel. Kemp v. Estate of Crabtree, 837 N.E.2d 135, 138 (Ind. 2005) (“[t]he 
majority view denies punitive damages” from a deceased tortfeasor’s estate); Jay Zitter, Annotation, 
Claim for punitive damages in tort action as surviving death of tortfeasor or person wronged, 30 
A.L.R. 4th 707 (2020); 1 Punitive Damages: Law and Prac. 2d § 9:8 (2019 ed.) (“The prevailing 
view appears to be that punitive damages may not be recovered against the estate of a deceased 
wrongdoer.”).  Doe notes that some jurisdictions (like New York) have adopted this result by 
The decisions in Hamilton and Booth were dicta on this point, because the executor in each 
case was the plaintiff, not the defendant.

statute while others have done so by court decision.  Doe Mem. at 12.  This distinction, however, 
does not appear germane to the Banks inquiry. 
As to the third Banks factor, the parties have not cited any evidence—beyond USVI 
courts having repeatedly cited Restatement § 908 with favor, including in the course of a Banks 
analysis—as to which rule would most soundly fit the USVI’s interests.  Beyond recognizing 
that USVI courts appear comfortable with the majority rule, the Court therefore cannot assign 
significant independent weight to this factor.  Doe notes that the USVI’s attorney general, in a 
separate lawsuit, is pursuing punitive damages against the Epstein estate based on alleged 
predations by Epstein in the USVI.  See Mullkoff Decl. Ex. B ¶¶ 307–10.  Doe further argues 
that because the only heir listed in Epstein’s will—his brother Mark Epstein—allegedly knew or 
had constructive knowledge of Epstein’s pattern of sexual abuse, it is just to deny him recovery 
from the estate by exposing the estate to punitive damages awards in cases such as hers.  Doe 
Mem. at 11.  But the decision by a government lawyer to attempt to obtain such damages in a 
high-profile case involving allegations of extreme conduct, or the alleged guilty knowledge of an 
heir in this case, do not speak to the question that the third Banks factor assays: which rule of law 
best durably serves the USVI’s interests.  The Court therefore has no basis to treats this Banks 
factor as countervailing, let alone outweighing, the first two. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons above, the Court grants the defendant-executors’ motion to dismiss the 
prayer for punitive damages against them.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to 
terminate the motion pending at docket 17.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 15, 
Plaintiff,  
-v-  
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
Defendants. 
Civ. 10653 (PAE) 
ORDER 
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:  
In this diversity action, plaintiff Jane Doe 15 (“Doe”)1 brings claims of battery, assault, 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in 
their capacities as co-executors of the estate of Jeffrey Epstein.  These claims arise from Doe’s 
allegations of sexual trafficking and abuse perpetrated against her by Epstein in 2004, when she 
was age 15.  Doe alleges that Doe visited Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in New York City, 
where Epstein’s secretary photographed her and groomed her for future sexual exploitation; on 
Epstein’s behalf, the secretary later invited Doe to visit Epstein at his ranch in New Mexico, and 
arranged Doe’s visit.  See Dkt. 1 (“Cmplt.”) ¶¶ 2–4, 25–26, 30–37.  Epstein’s sexual abuse of 
Doe occurred during the visit to the New Mexico ranch that ensued.  Id. ¶¶ 5–6, 41–69. 
The defendants have filed a partial motion to dismiss, directed solely at Doe’s prayer for 
punitive damages.  They argue that New Mexico law governs Doe’s claims, and that under New 
Mexico law, punitive damages are unavailable in a personal injury action against the personal 
Doe has been granted leave to proceed pseudonymously.  Dkt. 22. 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 1 of 4
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 40-1     Filed 04/30/20     Page 1 of 4

representative of an estate.  See Dkt. 18 (motion); Dkt. 19 (memorandum of law in support); 
Dkt. 34 (reply).  Doe opposes that motion.  Dkt. 29 (memorandum of law in opposition). 
The Court grants defendants’ motion.  The Court’s analysis substantially tracks the 
analysis in a memorandum and opinion it issued earlier this week granting a motion seeking the 
same relief in another case in which a plaintiff has brought the same personal injury claims 
against the executors arising from sexual abuse Epstein allegedly perpetrated on her.  See Mary 
Doe v. Indyke and Kahn, 19 Civ. 10758 (PAE) (“Mary Doe”); see id. Dkt. 38 (“Mary Doe Op.”) 
(issued April 28, 2020).  The Court here incorporates that decision by reference. 
In Mary Doe, Epstein’s abuse was alleged to have occurred in his Manhattan townhouse.  
The Court noted that the New York statute that authorizes personal injury actions against the 
personal representative of the decedent precludes punitive damages in such actions, see Mary 
Doe Op. at 4 (citing New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law (“EPTL”) § 11-3.2(a)(1)), and 
required dismissal of Mary Doe’s prayer for such damages, id. at 4–6.  The Court rejected Mary 
Doe’s counter-arguments: that defendants’ motion was premature, id. at 6–7, and improperly 
styled as a motion to dismiss, id. at 7–9, and that the law of the United States Virgin Islands 
(“USVI”), where Epstein’s estate is being probated, applies, and permits punitive damages 
against an estate in such an action, id. at 9–16.  As to the final argument, the Court noted that 
under New York choice-of-law rules, the substantive law of the location of the tortious conduct 
occurred generally applies as to punitive damages, and that there was no reason to depart from 
that rule here, id. at 9–14.  In any event, the Court held, it is likely that, as a matter of common 
law, the USVI—like New York, the majority of states, and Restatement (Second) of Torts 
§ 908—would not allow imposition of punitive damages on a tortfeasor’s estate, id. at 14-16. 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 2 of 4
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 40-1     Filed 04/30/20     Page 2 of 4

The parties in this case are represented by the same counsel as in Mary Doe, and make 
substantially the same arguments for and against dismissal.  The one variation is that, because 
Epstein’s abuse is alleged to have occurred at the New Mexico ranch, defendants argue that New 
Mexico law applies.  See Dkt. 19 at 2–6; Dkt. 34 at 5–8.  But that, defendants argue, does not 
change the result, because New Mexico common law as announced by the state supreme court, 
like EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), bars punitive damages in a personal injury action against a tortfeasor’s 
estate.  See Jaramillo v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 871 P.2d 1343, 1351–52 (N.M. 1994) 
(canvassing laws; noting that “punishment and deterrence are not accomplished by enabling 
recovery of punitive damages from the estate of deceased tortfeasors”; and adopting majority 
rule that “[w]hen the tortfeasor cannot be punished for his culpable behavior, punitive damages 
no longer have the desired effect and, therefore, the victim loses the legal entitlement to recover 
those damages”); see also Barbara R. as next friend of S.R. v. Couch, No. 03 Civ. 1225 (MCA) 
(WDS), 2006 WL 8443923, at *28 (D.N.M. Sept. 30, 2006) (citing Jaramillo and noting that 
“[t]he rationale behind this rule is that ‘to punish the estate ignores the central purpose of 
punitive damages, which is to punish the tortfeasor and to deter him from repeating the wrongful 
act”).  Doe, for her part, does not dispute that New Mexico law mirrors New York law.  Instead, 
in opposing dismissal, she makes the same three arguments as in Mary Doe.   
The Court again finds punitive damages unavailable as a matter of law and plaintiffs’ 
counter-arguments unavailing.  As to the third argument, relating to choice of law, unlike in 
Mary Doe, there is indeed room for debate about which jurisdiction’s law applies.  But the 
debate is between New York (where the grooming process began) and New Mexico (where the 
sexual abuse occurred).  And under either state’s law, imposition of punitive damages on the 
Case 1:19-cv-10653-PAE-DCF   Document 39   Filed 04/30/20   Page 3 of 4
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 40-1     Filed 04/30/20     Page 3 of 4

Epstein estate is squarely prohibited.  Doe does not have any stronger argument than did Mary 
Doe that USVI law applies in her case, or, if it did, that it would permit such damages. 
The Court, accordingly, grants defendants’ motion to dismiss the prayer for punitive 
damages.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at Dkt. 18. 
SO ORDERED.

Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GHW)(DCF) 
Your Honor: 
We represent the plaintiffs in the three above-referenced cases.  With 
the consent of Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), we write respectfully 
to request that the Court extend the current discovery deadlines in these three 
cases by ninety (90) days and the Co-Executors’ answer deadlines in the Jane Doe 
and Mary Doe matters by thirty (30) days. 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause substantial difficulties for 
all parties, and is inhibiting the parties’ ability to fully conduct discovery.  In 
addition, as Your Honor is aware, the parties are awaiting the approval by the 
Superior Court of the Virgin Islands of a voluntary claims resolution program.  If 
that program is approved in the near future and quickly implemented, the plaintiffs 
in these actions wish to participate in it, and the parties are hopeful that the 
program might resolve the plaintiffs’ claims.  As a result of this confluence of factors 
– the substantial challenges to the discovery process as a result of the pandemic and 
the possibility that the alternative dispute resolution mechanism may soon be 
available and speedy – the parties believe that the most appropriate and efficient 
course of action would be for the parties to enter into an informal stay of the three 
proceedings for thirty days, after which time the parties will evaluate the current 
status of both the pandemic-related limitations and the claims resolution program 
and consider whether an additional informal stay would be appropriate.  We will of 
course confer and write again to keep the Court apprised.  
In order to facilitate that informal stay while ensuring that the parties 
are not prejudiced in the discovery process if and when the litigation process 

PAGE 2 OF 2 
resumes, we ask the Court to extend the current discovery deadlines in these three 
cases, as set forth in the Court’s April 14, 2020 Endorsed Memorandum, by ninety 
(90) days, and to extend the Co-Executors’ answer deadlines in the Jane Doe 15 and 
Mary Doe matters by thirty (30) days as follows: 
• the deadline for the Co-Executors to file Answers in the Jane Doe 15 
and Mary Doe actions, which are currently due on May 12 and May 14, 
respectively, be extended to June 8, 2020;   
• the deadline for Plaintiffs to file any motions to amend the pleadings or 
to join any additional parties be extended from June 1, 2020 to August 
31, 2020; 
• the deadline for the Parties to submit joint status reports to the Court, 
regarding discovery and the progress of settlement discussions, be 
extended from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020; 
• the deadline for the completion of fact discovery be extended from July 
10, 2020 to October 8, 2020; 
• the deadline for service of Plaintiffs’ expert reports be extended from 
July 10, 2020 to October 8, 2020; 
• the deadline for service of the Co-Executors’ rebuttal reports be 
extended from August 10, 2020 to November 9, 2020; and 
• the deadline for the completion of expert discovery be extended from 
August 31, 2020 to November 30, 2020. 
The Court has granted one previous extension of the discovery 
deadlines, of thirty (30) days, on April 14, 2020.  The Co-Executors’ answer 
deadlines in the Jane Doe 15 and Mary Doe actions have not been extended since 
the Court ruled on the motions to dismiss in those actions. 
We appreciate the Court’s attention to these matters. 
Respectfully submitted,

PROCEEDINGS 
HONORABLE DEBRA C. FREEMAN (THE COURT):   All 
right, so this is Judge Freeman.  And if I've got this 
calendared right, this should be a conference in three of 
the cases involving the Jeffrey Epstein Estate:  Jane Doe 
v. Indyke, 19-cv-10653; Mary Doe v. Indyke, 19-cv-10758; 
and Davies v. Indyke, 19-cv-10788. 
Anybody have a different understanding as to why 
you're here? 
(No response.) 
THE COURT:  No.  Can I have your appearances, 
starting with the first of the cases that I listed, the 
Jane Doe case? 
MS. MARIANN M. WANG:  So for plaintiffs, Mariann 
Wang.  And I believe my colleague, Dan Mullkoff, is on the 
line.  And we represent the plaintiffs in all three cases, 
so -- (Stopped talking.) 
THE COURT:  Okay.  And on defendants' side? 
MR. BENNET J. MOSKOWITZ:  Good morning, your Honor.  
Bennet Moskowitz, Troutman Sanders, for the co-executors.  And 
on the line should be my colleagues, Matthew Aaronson, Valerie 
Sirota, and Molly DiRago.  And that's true for all three of 
the actions. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So that would count for 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, 6 people.  Is my law clerk on?

PROCEEDINGS 
MS. HANNAH MARTIN:  Yes, Judge, I'm here. 
THE COURT:  Okay, that's Hannah Martin.  She's one 
of my clerks.  There should be still more people on, based on 
what I heard when I joined the call.  Is there anyone else on 
the call? 
MS. EMILY FALL:  Hi.  My name is Emily Fall; I'm a 
reporter with 3M Canny 4 Productions.  I'm also on the call. 
THE COURT:  Okay, is there anyone else on? 
MR. JAMES HILL:  Your Honor, this is James Hill.  
I'm a reporter with ABC News, and I am monitoring the call and 
will keep my line on mute. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  I've slightly lost count.  If 
there's anyone else on the call from the public or press, you 
are, of course, welcome to listen in.  I would appreciate it 
if you would keep your phones on mute, which you seem to have 
been doing until I asked who was here.   
Do we have a court reporter?  I know that in one of 
the conferences scheduled today -- it may have been the one 
that's at 11 o'clock -- there was a request to have a court 
reporter.  No?   
All right.  So the conference is being recorded 
through the AT & T conference system.  And if anyone wants a 
transcript, you can get it through us through that system.  
Because someone may be trying to transcribe it from an audio 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 5 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
recording, if you do speak, please state your name before you 
speak so someone can keep the voices straight and be able to 
make a transcript that makes sense if there should be a need. 
All right, so what I thought I would do, rather than 
have a conference in all of the cases that I have in front of 
me for supervision, I thought I would take them in clusters 
where issues had arisen.  In each of these three cases there 
was a consent letter filed for an extension of time.  And even 
though it was on consent, I thought I would hear from you as 
to this concept of an informal stay and just what was 
happening.  And I don't mind a 30-day extension of deadlines, 
but I wanted to get a sense of where things were with respect 
to potential settlement.  And, you know, I read in the news as 
much as anyone else, but that doesn't really tell me the full 
story.  So can I just hear from plaintiffs' counsel about 
general status here? 
MS. WANG:  Sure, your Honor.  This is Mariann Wang 
again.  So we have made some progress in terms of the 
litigation; that is, we've exchanged discovery responses, 
interrogatory responses -- 
THE COURT:  Hold on a second.  Did someone join the 
call?  No?  I want to make sure -- 
MS. LAURA MENNINGER:  Hi.  I'm just -- I'm listening 
in, your Honor.  It's counsel for another party. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 6 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
THE COURT:  Oh, that's fine.  Okay. 
MS. WANG:  Can I just ask counsel for which party?  
Just to know. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Oh, I'm sorry. 
THE COURT:  Are you counsel in another case that's 
pending in front of me? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, your Honor.  I have a hearing 
in front of you at nine o'clock AM.  This is Laura Menninger 
for Ms. Maxwell. 
THE COURT:  At nine o'clock?  You must mean 11 
o'clock New York time? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Oh, I'm sorry, yes.  I'm in 
Colorado.  Yeah, 11 o'clock Eastern time.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  You're welcome. 
All right, you were saying, counsel? 
MS. WANG:  Sure.  So, again, Mariann Wang for 
plaintiffs.  So we have made some progress.  We're also -- 
we were kind of on the cusp of about to exchange a lot of 
paper discovery and starting to talk about depositions.  
And so there was progress being made on the litigation 
side.  At the same time that aspect of litigation was 
not -- was hindered a bit because of the pandemic, just in 
terms of communications and timeliness and ease of 
gathering things because of, obviously, not being able to 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 7 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
meet in person with the clients.  We had also started to 
have some essentially, I guess, one would say some 
conflicts potentially with defense counsel about whether 
and how depositions can proceed, in person or remotely. 
In any event, because of the kind of -- the 
combination of perfect storm of both the hindrance of the 
pandemic and logistics -- should I stop? 
THE COURT:  Yes.  Did someone just join the call? 
MALE:  Yes.  Inner City Press.  Not a participant. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Fine.  If you could keep your 
phone on mute, I would appreciate that. 
MALE:  I will.  Thanks. 
THE COURT:  Go ahead, Ms. Wang. 
MS. WANG:  Again, Ms. Mariann Wang.  And, at the 
same time, our understanding that in the Virgin Islands 
there seems to be potential progress and potentially in the 
short term a possibility, really, of getting the claims 
resolution process started.  We just felt that it might 
make sense to put a pause and see whether that would have 
some, you know, traction and whether we could get going on 
that before essentially, really, both working extremely 
hard and potentially draining resources on the estate front 
of, you know, having apparently four or five lawyers 
working nonstop on fighting us to some degree.  It just 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 8 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
seemed to make sense to hit pause for a little while.  So 
that's the basic concept. 
THE COURT:  I will say on defendants' side you 
seem to have four attorneys on this call.  I hope you're 
keeping costs under control under the circumstances. 
So I gather what you want to do is you don't want 
an extension of discovery; what you want to do is basically 
have a hiatus of discovery and then put the same amount of 
time back on the clock as you had before?  You want to stop 
everything for 30 days and have another 30 days thereafter 
to finish discovery if you need it? 
MS. WANG:  That was the idea, yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  How much optimism do you have during 
this 30-day period this process is going to get rolling and 
you'll be able to enter into it and get these cases 
resolved? 
MS. WANG:  Well, this is where it is a little bit 
trying to balance.  And I think that -- I mean, I have -- I 
guess I probably would have more optimism -- I have 
optimism that in 30 days we will know much more and we will 
be able to then -- at least that's my hope -- be able to 
really say okay, let's turn back to the litigation; or, 
okay, let's really, you know, put this on hold/pause for 
more amount of time because it looks like that's going.  
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 9 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
That's my hope, at least.  Perhaps the estate would know 
better, in fact, what -- you know, whether or not my 
optimism is warranted. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Your Honor, Bennet Moskowitz.  If 
I may, I'm happy to provide an update about the Epstein 
Victims Compensation Program. 
THE COURT:  I'd appreciate it. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.  And I'd first, since you've 
raised it, like to address the issue of keeping costs -- 
and I can assure your Honor that the sole reason the 
attorneys are on who are on is because it is more efficient 
in terms of managing all the 15 or so active cases for only 
those who are on to be on rather than have lengthy back-
and-forth follow-ups with each other.  And, in fact, we are 
very concerned about litigation costs.  And the people 
driving those costs have been various plaintiffs' firms.  I 
will not necessarily pin that on Ms. Wang, as she is 
actually trying to be reasonable here with the stay of some 
sort, although -- which I'll get to -- we disagreed on how 
to best do that. 
But it bears mentioning the biggest drivers have 
been the plaintiffs' firms, including making the estate 
fight for months over whether they can get punitive 
damages, which Judge Engelmayer in two cases ruled that no, 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 10 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
they can't; and as we've been saying all along, it's black 
letter law.  And those are two of the cases on which we're 
meeting for you now.  So I'm surprised to hear any comment 
by plaintiffs' counsel attributing cost concerns to us.  
The other culprit is the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney 
general, which I'll get to. 
But to get back to the program, we are confident 
that the program will commence by June 15, at the latest.  
To date, counsel for around 69 individual claimants have 
come forward, including through the U.S.V.I. Probate Court, 
in support of the program.  We believe that figure 
constitutes the vast majority of claimants.  In fact, we 
are only aware of one claimant through her counsel who has 
stated that she does not intend to participate.  That's one 
of the state court plaintiffs, not one of the cases before 
your Honor.  And I don't even know if that's the current 
position of that individual.   
As your Honor is probably aware, we're now up to 
seven Southern District of New York plaintiffs in three 
lawsuits who have formally stayed their actions pending 
their participation in the program, including most recently 
Maria Farmer, whom Boies Schiller represents.  Ms. Wang's 
three clients, of course, as they put it, sought this 
informal stay, and they intend to participate in the 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 11 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
program.  The program administrator and the designers have 
nearly finalized the protocol for the program.  Recall 
that's the nuts and bolts of how the program actually 
works.  They've done that in close consultation with 
claimants' counsel and with input from the co-executors. 
So to recall, the only reason that the program did 
not formally commence several months ago, which is what we 
wanted, which would have avoided all these litigation 
costs, is that in January 2020, the U.S. Virgin Islands 
attorney general, who again does not represent a single 
alleged victim, unilaterally imposed liens on the estate's 
bank accounts in the Virgin Islands, freezing then-
available funds for administration of the estate and 
implementation of the program.  That caused a huge delay 
solely attributable to the attorney general of the Virgin 
Islands.   
I am pleased to report that just a few days ago, 
the estate and the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general 
have reached a resolution in principle, which I understand 
would involve the attorney general finally stepping aside 
so the program can finally formally proceed.  There are a 
few, I'd say, less contentious matters that still need to 
be ironed out in that regard, but we expect that that 
resolution would be finalized by next week and that we 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 12 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
would notify the U.S.V.I. Probate Court about that sometime 
next week.  If, however, something unexpected occurs, and 
because the need for the program has grown increasingly 
urgent, and with the overwhelming support of claimants' 
counsel, the co-executors in any event intend to seek 
commencement of the program on June 15, absent some 
contrary direction from the U.S.V.I. Probate Court, which 
we do not expect.   
And, indeed, it bears mentioning that during the 
February 4 hearing at the U.S.V.I. Probate Court, the judge 
said, quote, "I think we agreed that everybody believes 
this program is a great program," end quote.  So, again, 
the sole holdup here has been the attorney general of the 
Virgin Islands.  So I am confident in saying that the 
program will formally move forward soon, that it will have 
an overwhelmingly successful participation rate and be a 
great success, which we always expect and that's what 
everyone's been working hard towards. 
Meanwhile, I agree with Ms. Wang -- and, actually, 
counsel for Maxwell has said this in a letter to the Court, 
as well -- that every dollar spent on litigation, which 
again plaintiffs' counsel in some of the other matters 
before your Honor have been driving up through, you know, 
unnecessary motions, unnecessary requests to make discovery 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 13 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
motions, that is money that will never possibly be 
available to fund the program, which we have been trying to 
do since day one.  You may recall, your Honor, that it was 
plaintiffs' counsel, different plaintiffs' counsel, who 
resisted stays of litigation.  So, again, I was surprised 
to hear the comments about cost concerns. 
But we agree with where Ms. Wang is at this now, 
it would be a disservice to claimants and a waste of 
judicial resources during a time when such resources are, 
as evidenced by, you know, this conference call, stretched 
very thin due to the unprecedented situation we find 
ourselves in with the pandemic, for money to be spent on 
litigation.  It was for that reason that when Ms. Wang 
approached us, which also bears mentioning that they 
approached us about this concept of an informal stay, we 
proposed that we do the same stay that we've done in some 
of the other actions before your Honor, which if your Honor 
recalls, those orders -- basically, people can lift them at 
any time if they decide they don't want to participate in 
the program or for whatever reason.  They can go to your 
Honor and request a lift of the stay.  Ms. Wang didn't 
agree to that; and, therefore, we, you know, agreed to what 
was offered, which was this kind of informal stay, followed 
by a -- 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 14 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
THE COURT:  Hold on one second.  Did someone join 
the call? 
MALE:  Hello.  Member of the press here. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Fine. 
I'm sorry, please continue. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  So I was about to wrap up, your 
Honor.  So, in any event, you know, like I said, I'm 
pleased to report that I have confidence the program will 
start soon, matter of weeks, not months, finally.  And I 
agree with the call's concerns, which is that all these 
actions to be stayed for people that intend to participate 
in the program, which as I understand it, is every 
plaintiff in every action that's before your Honor, 
including the ones that we're here talking about now. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So on the deadlines, what 
you're looking for -- correct me if I'm wrong on this -- 
for fact discovery, you want deadline extension from 
July 10 to October 8, is that right? 
MS. WANG:  I believe that's correct.  There's a 
letter -- 
THE COURT:  That's -- oh, I'm sorry, I may be 
looking at the wrong -- no, I think so. Yes. That's not a 
30-days? 
MS. WANG:  I apologize, your Honor.  This is -- 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 15 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
THE COURT:  The letter -- I pulled up the letter 
in, I think it's the same letter that was written in all 
three cases.  And it says in the letter that you're looking 
for -- oh, I'm sorry, you're looking for 90 days.  You're 
looking for 90 days and an extension -- 
MS. WANG:  That's correct. 
THE COURT:  -- on the answer deadline for 30. 
MS. WANG:  Yes, your Honor.  And if I may -- this 
is plaintiffs' counsel, Mariann Wang, again.  The idea was 
for this informal stay of 30 days and essentially to kind 
of reassess at that time; and, therefore, we were building 
in a larger cushion at the back end. 
And just for the record, for purposes of the 
record, I just will have to say that I dispute some of the 
things that Mr. Moskowitz said.  But I don't think it's 
worth going into now.  I think there was a lot of effort on 
the estate's part not to produce any documents or cooperate 
until it decided that it could put four or five attorneys 
on this matter.   
But, in any event, for purposes of what's going on 
right now, that is correct.  The idea was to build in a 
little bit of extra cushion at the back end. 
THE COURT:  So let me see if I understand this.  
What you're saying is kick all the deadlines out by 90 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 16 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
days, discovery deadlines; don't do anything for 30 -- and 
some time has already passed since you wrote the letter, 
perhaps you're not even looking at 30 anymore -- and then 
once those 30 days go by, start up again but at a more 
leisurely pace because you have another 60 days? 
MS. WANG:  No, your Honor.  The idea would be in 
days we would report back to the Court about what the 
best approach -- what the best approach would be -- 
THE COURT:  Let me ask again if someone's joined 
the line.  Has someone joined on the line?  Hello?  Those 
beeps might mean someone left or someone joined. 
Let me just make sure defense counsel is still 
present.  Mr. Moskowitz? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I'm here, your Honor, Bennet 
Moskowitz. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  I haven't set this 
up with the computer dashboard that identifies people and 
lets me know who joined and who dropped.  We're just doing 
this as a straight phone call, so that's why I keep asking 
the questions, to try to figure out who's present in my 
courtroom, so to speak.  If a lawyer who's making an 
argument suddenly gets up and walks out of the courtroom, 
that's something I can see; but on the phone call, I have 
to just make sure that that's not what happened, you know, 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 17 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
through some kind of dropped call or something. 
Okay, so you were saying, counsel?  I'm sorry. 
MS. WANG:  Yes, of course.  So, your Honor, the 
idea was really basically a stay for 30 days and then 
essentially an opportunity to reassess and confer with 
opposing counsel and basically report to the Court about 
the next steps of, you know, whether we are going back 
into, you know, full-on litigation because everything seems 
to be falling apart in the other -- in the other method of 
resolution; or if, you know, it would appear that we can go 
back or we can even enter into a more formal permanent 
stay. 
And to be clear, the reason I didn't like the 
others -- and which -- and my clients were not amenable to 
it is that my understanding is and the way it appeared is 
that those other actions are essentially stays that don't 
allow to pick up as easily.  If your Honor prefers a 
different method of approach, I'm happy to confer with my 
clients and opposing counsel and see if there's, you know, 
a different method of doing this.  But the main thing from 
my clients' perspective is the ability, essentially to, you 
know, step back into litigation full bore if things are 
seeming to not go in the right direction.  I'm very glad to 
hear -- it's the first I'm hearing from Mr. Moskowitz, 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 18 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
although I had asked him earlier about, you know, news on 
the V.I. proceeding -- I'm glad to hear that there is 
progress.  And this is the first I'm hearing of this 
June 15 start time. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  So I am still not quite 
understanding your letter in light of what you're saying, 
because you wrote the letter May 11.  So if I had granted 
it immediately upon its receipt, your informal stay would 
have lasted until June 10.  And then if what you say is it 
would have given you an opportunity to report back shortly 
thereafter -- let's say you would have reported back to me 
by, say, June 12 or maybe June 15, if not June 10, you're 
asking for an extension, based on this letter, to submit a 
joint status report regarding, including, you know, among 
other things, the progress of settlement discussions, to be 
extended from June 1 to August 31.  August 31 is not in and 
around the middle of June.   
Why don't I just kick out the dates by some 
reasonable period of time from now and ask for a status 
report by a certain date?  And if you find that you still 
need more time because, you know, things are logistically 
difficult to get done because of the pandemic or something, 
you can let me know, and I'll kick out the dates 
specifically so that you can have a hiatus and save 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 19 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
resources and still have time on the clock to get discovery 
done if you need it.  But some of these dates aren't quite 
making sense to me, and I'm not sure I'm understanding why 
the 90 is necessary, why we need more time than the hiatus 
time.  
And if the more time is needed because you're 
having problems agreeing on whether depositions can proceed 
by remote means, I'll tell you what I'm telling everyone 
else in the city of New York who's trying to litigate cases 
right now, which is learn how to take depositions by remote 
means.  Everybody is learning, and the providers have gone 
up that learning curve, and things seem to be moving pretty 
well.  I'm not forcing people's hands, but I am strongly 
urging it.  And it seems to be pretty successful.  And if 
you're in that kind of situation where you're trying to 
negotiate protocol for remote depositions, I can give you a 
case cite that I've been passing around.  The parties don't 
even know, I'm sure, that I've been passing it around.  One 
of my colleagues sent around a proposed remote deposition 
protocol that litigants had submitted in a case, didn't 
bless it, didn't endorse it.  There was particular provider 
mentioned, and certainly the Court's not endorsing any 
particular provider or anything, but it showed some 
thought.  And I've been passing this citation onto other 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 20 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
lawyers as something to glance at as maybe giving rise to 
ideas and having a basis for discussion.  I thought it 
showed that some time and effort was put into considering 
the issues that can arise.  So let me give you that 
citation.  It's Compus Productions International v. Charter 
Communication.  It's 18-cv-12296.  It's a case before Judge 
Marrero and Magistrate Judge Moses, and it's Docket 51 in 
that case, 18-cv-12296.  Again, I'm not blessing it; I'm 
just pointing it out as people wrestle with these kinds of 
concepts. 
But so why don't I just extend your deadlines 
somewhat?  It's now already May 22, so I could kick them 
out to, let's say -- or by 45 days or something like that; 
ask for a status report by the middle of June; and you'll 
tell me what's going on.  And the reason for me to kick it 
out is with the understanding that you want to pause 
things, try to preserve resources, and I'm putting another 
days at the end of the schedule to enable you to get 
things done.  And you can, you know, map out a deposition 
schedule if you have to for that time.  And if you run into 
logistical problems, you can get back to me and tell me 
what those logistical problems are.  Or maybe even 60.  
But, you know, what you put out here doesn't seem to quite 
hold together. 
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF     Document 43     Filed 06/01/20     Page 21 of 25

PROCEEDINGS 
MS. WANG:  This is plaintiffs' counsel.  Fair 
enough, your Honor.  That makes perfect sense from our 
perspective. 
THE COURT:  Okay, look, so here's what I'm going 
to do.  I'm going to move out all deadlines on your 
scheduling order by 60 days, with the understanding that if 
for the next, well, until the middle of June when you know 
if this program is starting, anyway, whatever makes sense, 
whether it's 30 days or until June 15, you can discuss that 
between you, for some period of time you're going to hold 
off on incurring costs.  And then, at the end of that point 
in time, maybe by June -- why don't I just say by June 
-- by June 19, which is the end of that week that starts 
June 15 -- by June 19, send me a status report, which is 
either things are going great, we want to stay this longer 
because we really are participating in this program; or 
things look grim, it's taken a downturn in the Virgin 
Islands, and we want to get back on the calendar and we've 
started talking about that; and because of some logistical 
issues, we think we need more time or we think we're okay 
or whatever.  But 60 days on the dates, with an 
understanding that you're going to pause things 
cooperatively and give me a status report by June 19.  
Rational?

MS. WANG:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Defendants' side? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  That is acceptable to us.  Bennet 
Moskowitz.  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  I will issue an order, probably 
just a text order on the docket, that will confirm that for 
you.  I will look at the schedule we have and put firm 
dates on that are 60 days out so you have definite dates 
for various and assorted things.  If some dates have 
already gone by, don't worry about it because they'll have 
kicked out 60, you know, retroactively.  And I am assuming 
that neither of you is going to start jumping up and down, 
saying this week we must now have depositions happening.  I 
assume that you're going to wait until approximately 
June 15 to see if it's really necessary and report by 
June 19. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Bennet Moskowitz here.  We have, 
yes, no intention of that, your Honor, and I just -- 
THE COURT:  I'm sure. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  Not what I want. 
THE COURT:  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  Look, my 
intention is to balance things.  You know, if there's a 
realistic chance of it getting settled, any of these cases 
getting settled, that's great.  And I don't want you

it, I want to keep discovery moving in a rational way, 
keeping costs reasonably under control, keep you talking, 
keep you planning.  That was the concept all along.  And so 
that's the balancing act.  Okay?

handled somewhat differently with different counsel, and so 
be it.  I was thinking I'd try to get you all more or less 
on the same track, but there are always going to be some 
divergences. 
Okay.  Thank you, all. 
MS. WANG:  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  I will talk to at least certain of you 
again in half an hour. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Take care, everybody.  Be 
well. 
(Whereupon, the matter is recessed.)

1At the hearing held on February 4, 2020, while the Court did not allow the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin 
Islands to intervene, the Court did request the Co-Executors and the Attorney General to resolve their differences 
concerning the proposed compensation program. which has garnered the support of all interested parties, including 
claimants' counsel. The Co-Executors now inform that "(b]ecause the need for the Program has grown increasingly 
urgent, and with the support of claimants' counsel and the USVI Attorney General - and because the remaining 
impediments have been resolved and the interested parties have consented to the Protocol."' they and the Attorney 
General have reached an agreement in which the latter will promptly lift previously imposed liens to pay amounts 
owed for the Program and to begin funding the Program's active operations, including payment of compensation 
determinations to eligible claimants. Co-Executors' Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program and 
Presentation of Program Protocol, at 6, June I. 2020.

Your Honor: 
We represent the plaintiffs in the three above-referenced cases.  As 
directed in Your Honor’s Order dated June 22, 2020, we write jointly with counsel 
for Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), to provide a status update.  
These cases were stayed on June 22, 2020 pending the plaintiffs in 
each of these cases attempting to resolve their claims against the Co-Executors 
through the Epstein Victims Compensation Program.  The plaintiffs are currently 
in the process of presenting their claims to the administrators of that Program, and 
the parties remain hopeful that all claims in these matters will be resolved through 
the Program.  Accordingly, all parties believe that these cases should remain stayed 
at this time.  We will notify the Court once the Program has progressed further such 
that either the claims are resolved or the stays should be lifted. 
We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to these matters.  
Very truly yours, 
 /s/ Mariann Meier Wang

Your Honor: 
We represent the plaintiffs in the three above-referenced cases.  As 
directed in Your Honor’s Order dated September 4, 2020, we write jointly with 
counsel for Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), to provide a status update.  
These cases were stayed on June 22, 2020 pending the plaintiffs in 
each of these cases attempting to resolve their claims against the Co-Executors 
through the Epstein Victims Compensation Program.  The plaintiffs in all three 
cases have registered their claims with the administrators of the Program and 
expect soon to submit their complete claims and supporting documents to the 
administrators.  The parties remain hopeful that all claims in these matters will be 
resolved through the Program.  Accordingly, all parties believe that these cases 
should remain stayed at this time.  We will notify the Court once the Program has 
progressed further such that either the claims are resolved or the stays should be 
lifted. 
We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to these matters.  
Very truly yours, 
 /s/ Mariann Meier Wang
