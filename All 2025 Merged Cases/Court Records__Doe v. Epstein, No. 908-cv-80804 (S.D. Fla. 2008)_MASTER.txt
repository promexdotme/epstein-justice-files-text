it's my understanding -- Mr. Goldberger can 
correct the record -- but we have stipulated that 
color copies of the documents that were identified

Done.

we leave.

We're not going to do 
either. 
I'll have copies sent to the court 
reporter and she can attach them to the

is it just going to be comma after comma after 
comma? 
Go ahead, lawyer. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
All right. 
The exhibits, I 
can't prevent you from taking them, but I will 
object and I will be bringing it to the court for 
sanctions. 
You cannot take the exhibits out of 
the room without them being marked. 
I want them 
marked, because you cannot identify in the record 
what was used. 
And with all due respect to 
Mr. Goldberger, I do not -- the way this 
deposition is going, I do not want to rely on 
Counsel from Miami to mark the appropriate 
exhibits. 
I will not do that. 
I cannot prevent 
you from taking them. 
But if you do, I will be 
bringing the matter to the court with appropriate 
sanctions, because that is improper. 
That is 
improper. 
When you use something in a deposition, 
they are to be marked. 
And you have refused to do 
that throughout for what ever reason. 
MR. TEIN: 
You're wrong. 
Finish your 
sentence because you're talking about something 
you have no idea.

Isn't that silly, Ted? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Thirty years of doing this 
and I have never had an argument over this. 
MR. TEIN: 
You've made -- Ted, you are 
obstructionist, you are a liar. 
You have lied and 
misrepresented things, for the record. 
You are 
grandstanding. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
You need to back up. 
MR. TEIN: 
No, no. 
I'm going to finish. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
You can finish, but don't 
hover over me. 
MR. TEIN: 
No one is hovering over you. 
Stop trying to make a lying record. 
Let me say something else. 
Don't you dare threaten me with sanctions, 
after you lied in a letter to my co-counsel about 
the fact 
be quiet. 
Be quiet and let me finish. 
You lied in a letter to my co-counsel, 
Mr. Leopold, in which you said -- it was a 
complete and utter lie -- that you were 
unavailable this morning because you had a 
hearing. 
That was a lie. 
I have never seen a 
lawyer deign to do something like that. 
So you will get the ex -- be quiet.

MR. LEOPOLD: 
Jack, do you want to take

MR. TEIN: 
Let me finish my sentence. 
The 
exhibits are marked. 
We are walking out of here. 
You are someone who misrepresents the 
record. 
It is absolutely atrocious what you do. 
That is not how a lawyer should behave. 
This 
deposition is over. 
You will get your exhibits, 
Mr. Leopold. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
I understand what you're

of issues in this case. 
We're going to have lots 
of reasons to disagree. 
I'm going to take it over now and I'm going 
to make copies and I'm going to give them to 
Ms. Consor. 
If you want to go find some exhibit 
labels and put some exhibit labels on it, be my 
guest. 
But that's what I'm offering to do. 
THE WITNESS: 
Let me say two things, 
because I am happy to always disagree, and with 
you, I have no problem; we could always do it 
professionally. 
I have not problem. 
I want to say two things so the record is 
very clear. 
Since for whatever reason I have not been 
able to look at exhibits, because they have been 
refused to have been shown to me 
MR. TEIN: 
That's a lie. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
-- Jack, if you represent 
that the documents have the appropriate exhibit 
numbers or some identifying markings, 25, 30.000, 
whatever they may be, then you can take them, make 
copies, send me a copy, make sure the court 
reporter gets a copy and then send me a bill for 
my copies, that's fine.

are marked that way because I haven't been able to

look at them. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
They are barcoded, and the 
number that we've made reference to in the 
deposition coincides with the barcoding. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
That's fine. 
Eight by eleven 
color laser copies are fine. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
The State Attorneys Office 
is not going to charge anybody for color copies I 
print out. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
That's fine. 
He's going to 
take them back to his office. 
Secondly 
and I will be more than happy 
to do it, because it sounds like you all know more 
about it than I -- but I'm happy to get affidavits 
from Mr. Pincus, Judge Stern, everybody else about 
what happened with this hearing today, because I 
know very little about it. 
But my representations 
are what they are. 
MR. GOLDBERGER:

that. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
No, no, no. 
I just put it on 
the record. 
I will get an affidavit -- I'm 
assuming it sounds like you need it -- from Mr. 
Pincus. 
I have no clue about what happened and 
why it was canceled. 
All I was told when I was 
out of town yesterday was that the hearing this 
morning was cancelled. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
I'll take your word for 
it. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
If you want an affidavit, 
I'll get it for you. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
It's a personal issue for 
me because I had to disrupt a vacation and if it 
was done just because it wasn't convenient for 
you, then I'm offended by that. 
But if you're 
telling me that it was planned and it didn't 
happen, I'll take your word for it. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I am more than happy to get 
you an affidavit, because I don't know the reason 
why it was canceled other than the fact that I'm 
assuming since my deposition was taken for four 
hours on Monday for preparation for the hearing 
today, for whatever reason it was canceled, I am 
told it is being re-noticed. 
Why it was canceled,

I have no idea, but if your co-counsel wishes an 
affidavit to that effect from Mr. Pincus, I'm more 
than happy to get it. 
But I don't know the reason 
why it was canceled. 
MR. TEIN: 
I don't need it. 
But what I do 
take issue with is regardless of why it was 
canceled, you owed us the courtesy of saying, You 
know what? 
We can start earlier this morning. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I owe you nothing. 
MR. TEIN: 
I don't care. 
Don't interrupt 
me. 
Because Jack canceled his vacation plans 
because of you.

That's all right, that's

hereto as Exhibit A.) As the Court c,;an see, the agent for the Plaintiff who sc::rved the 
Summons and Complaint purports to have served the same on Tommy Robson, who 
is identified as l-laley Robson's father. Said service was purportedly made at 1224 7 
72nd C::iurt Nortl1, Royal Palm B~ach, Florida, located in Palm Beach County. 
3. 
On March 21, 2008, Haley Robson's usual place of abode was not 
12247 72nd Court North, Royal Palm Beach, Florida, in PalmBeac.:h County. R.ath~:r, 
.Haley Robson's usual place of abode on March 2 l, 2008, was an entirely different 
location. Haley Robson did not authori%e anyone, including Tommy Robson, to 
accept service of process on her behalf Therefore, this .service was not proper and 
was ineffective, 
4. 
It is well recognized in Florida that a person's usual place of abode is 
defined ns !'he place where the person js ac.luaJ!y living at the time of service. See 
Shurman v. Atlarllic Mortgage..and fnw:stmenl Corp., 795 So. 2d 952 (Fla. 2001). In 
the Shmmrn opi 1ion, the Supreme Court of Florida also confirmed that "statutes 
governing servicr~ of process are to be strictly construed and enforced." !.Il.. at 954. 
5. 
The:.·e are diff't:rent schools of thought as to the most appropriate way to 
challenge service of process. There is also some confusfon with regard to whether 
filing a motion other than c1 Motion to Quash Service of Process waives one's right

to move to quash service of process. Therefore, Haley Robson files this Motion to 
Quash Service of P:·ocess in lieu of any other type of motion or responsive pleading 
pursuanr to the Fourth DistTict Court of Appea'l's opmion in Barahan v, S1usmgn, 
which holds that the "preferable manner of presenting a defense of insufficiency of 
service of process .. .-is by a Motion to Quash sucl1 allcged.ly insufficient service of 
process rather than oy a Motion to Dismiss the;: Complaint." .igmban v, Sussman, 439 
So. 2d J046, ./047 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983). 
6. 
Haley Robson reserves the right to supplement thi.s motion with evidence 
to support it. 
\VT·IERRFORE, Haley R.obson respectfully moves this Honorable Court for 
the entry of an Otder granting Haley Robson's Motion to Quash the Servic.:e of 
Process.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 
FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, 
IN AND FOR PALM BEACH 
COUNTY, FLORIDA, 
CASE NO. 2008 CA 006596X:XXX MB 
DEFENDANT SARAH KELLEN'S MOTION TO QUASH 
SERVICEOFPROCESSANDSET ASIDE CLERK'S DEFAULT 
Defendant Sarah Kellen, pursuant to Rules l.500(d) and l.140(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of 
Civil Procedure, moves the Court,first, to quash service of process, and second, to set aside the 
clerk's default entered against her on June 6, and as grounds for this relief respectfully states as -
follows: 
Introduction 
The attempt at substituted service on Ms. Kellen did not comply with Florida procedure, and 
must therefore be quashed. This Court, on grounds of insufficient service of process, does not have 
jurisdiction to enter a default. 
Discussion 
A. 
The attempt at substituted service of process was ineffective. 

249 of 316
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 1-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008   Page 49 of 116
Sarah Kellen is a resident of New York. In an effort to effect substituted service on Ms. 
Kellen, a process server left copies of the pertinent summons and complaint with a nonresident 
doorkeeper who works at 301 East 66th Street in New Yorlc, a multiunit apartment building where 
Ms. Kellen maintains a personal residence. This attempt at substituted service did not comply with 
Florida procedme. 
To serve someone in New York in the context of a Florida lawsuit, an "officer authorized to 
serve process in [New York]" is required, under section 48.194, Florida Statutes, to effect service 
"in the same maimer as service within [Florida]." § 48.194(1), Fla. Stat. (2007). To say it another 
way, service must conform to Florida procedure-not New York procedure. 
Under Florida law, service of process can be effected "by leaving the copies [ of the summons 
and complaint] at [ the defendant's] usual place of abode with any person residing therein who is 15 
yeru·s of age or older and informing the person of their contents." § 48.03 l(l)(a), Fla. Stat. (2007) 
( emphasis added). It is well settled that "[s ]tatutes governing service of process should be strictly 
constrned." E.g., York Commc 'ns, Inc. v. Furst Group, Inc., 724 So.2d 678, 679 (Fla. 4th DCA 
1999). 
In construing section 48.194(1)(a), it is clear that the above doorkeeper was not a "person 
residing" in Ms. Kellen's "usual place of abode" for purposes of effecting service. See Schupak v. 
Sutton Hill Assocs., 710 So. 2d 707, 709 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998) ("A fortiori, leaving process with an 
apartment doorman in the apartment lobby is insufficient service."); accord Smith v. FDIC, 711 _So. 
2d 1367, 1368 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998) (per curiarn) (holding that service of process was ineffective 
where summons and complaint were left with a doorkeeper at the defendant's New York City 
apartment building). 

250 of 316
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 1-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008   Page 50 of 116
B. 
This Court has not yet acquired personal jurisdiction over Ms. Kellen. 
Because there has been no effective service bf process, as set forth above, this Court has not 
yet acquired personal jurisdiction over Sarah Kellen. See Shurman v. Atlantic Mortgage & Inv. 
Corp., 795 So. 2d 952, 953 (Fla. 2001) ("It is well settled that the fundamental purpose of service 
[ of process] is 'to give proper notice to the defendant in the case that he is answerable to the claim 
of plaintiff and, therefore, to vest jurisdiction in the court entertaining the controversy."') ( quoting 
State ex rel. Merritt v. Heffernan, 195 So. 145, 147 (Fla. 1940)) (emphasis added). Cf Borden v. 
East-European Ins. Co., 921 So. 2d 587,591 (Fla.2006) (stating that service of process is "necessary 
before a defendant ... may be compelled to answer a claim brought in a court of law"); see also 
Space Coast Credit Union v. The First, F.A., 467 So. 2d 737, 739 (Fla. 5th DCA 1985) (observing 
that "[i]f the court fails to acquire jurisdiction over the defendant in the proper manner, its judgment 
is voicf') ( citations omitted) ( emphasis added). 
For these reasons above, the purported service of process must be quashed, and the clerk's 
default must be set aside as void. 
WHEREFORE, Sarah Kellen respectfully requests an Order quashing the purported service 
of process, and setting aside the clerk's default entered against her on June 6.

FIFTEENTH 
JUDICIAL 
CIRCUIT 
IN 
AND -FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, 
FLORIDA 
CASE No. 50 2008 CA 006596 XXXXMB AB 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR A TWO-WEEK 
ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO RESPOND TO THE COMPLAINT 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.090(b), hereby 
moves this Court for an order enlarging the time to respond to the complaint by 
two weeks, through an including July I 0, 2008. As good cause for this motion, 
Mr. Epstein states as follows: 
I. 
The complaint in this action was filed on March 6, 2008. 
2. 
On May 20, the plaintiff filed an affidavit of service stating that Mr. 
Epstein was served by "residential substitution" on May 16, 2008, 
3. 
On May 28, plaintiff moved for 120 additional days to perfect service 
of process.

From: 5615153148 
Page: 3/7 
Date: 6/26/2008 5:07:21 PM 
4. 
On June 4, (a copy of plaintiff's motion for additional time to serve 
process having not been docketed) Epstein moved for a 20-day enlargement of 
time to respond to the complaint, and plaintiff noticed the motion for hearing. 
5, 
Mr. Pike in my office spoke with Mr. Kuvin and told him that we did 
not oppose plaintiff's motion. 
6. 
Undersigned counsel then spoke with counsel for the plaintiff after his 
hearing on the motion referenced in paragraph 3 above. Our understanding of that 
conversation was that: 
(i) 
plaintiffs counsel would be seeking to re-serve Mr. Epstein 
because the initial service . was insufficient and secured the 
additional 120 days; and 
(ii) 
therefore, there was no need to have a hearing on Epstein's motion 
for enlargement of time. Plaintiffs coW1sel cancelled his notice 
regarding the hearing. 
7. 
On June 24, the undersigned learned that plaintiffs counsel had a 
different understanding of our prior conversation which was confirmed by co-
counsel after the close of business on June 25. 
8. 
Specifically, we learned that plaintiff's counsel believes that service 
upon Mr. Epstein was proper, and that his response to the complaint (factoring in 
the 20 additional days he previously agreed to) was therefore due that very day.

From: 5615153148 
Page: 4/7 
Date: 6/26/2008 5:07:21 PM 
9. 
As a result of the miscommunication between the undersigned and 
plaintiff's counsd, Mr. Epstein seeks additional time to respond to the complaint. 
10. 
Further, because of the pendency of Mr. Epstein's parallel criminal 
case, Mr. Epstein needs an additional two weeks to frame his response to this 
lawsuit. 1 
11. 
Thjs motion is made in good faith, 
12. 
This will be Mr. Epstein's final request for an enlargement of time to 
respond to the cc,rnplaint. 
13. 
Defendant has conferred with counsel for the plaintiff, who opposes 
the relief sought in this motion. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein respectfully requests that this 
Court grant a him a two-week enlargement of time, through and including July 10, 
2008, to respond to the Complaint. 
See State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 2006 CF 09454 AXX, Fifteenth Judicial 
Circuit, Palm Beach County. At the Court's request, undersigned counsel can provide additional 
details on this point, in camera.

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 1-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008   Page 102 of
116
7. Venue is proper in this Court under section 47.011, Florida Statutes, because the causes 
of action brought herein accrued in Palm Beach County, Florida and one or more Defendants 
resides in Palm Beach County, Florida. 
Factual Allegations 
8. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein was an adult male. Epstein is a financier 
and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is a man of 
tremendous wealth, power, and influence. He maintains his principal home in New York and 
also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, Florida. The allegations 
herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
9. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for minor 
girls. He engaged in a plan, scheme, and/or enterprise in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls or coerced or 
attempted to coerce them to engage in prostitution, and then gave them money. In or about 2005, 
Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one of his victims. 
10. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out this scheme/enterprise and 
assaulted girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. 
Thomas. 
11. An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme/enterprise was Sarah Kellen, an assistant 
of Epstein's from New York, New York, and Haley Robson, a Palm Beach Community College 
student from Loxahatchee, Florida. They recruited girls ostensibly to give a wealthy man a 
massage for mone1ary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan/enterprise, Ms. Robson was contacted shortly before or soon after Epstein was at his Palm 
Beach residence. Epstein, Kellen, or someone on their behalf, directed Ms. Robson to bring one

303 of 316
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 1-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008   Page 103 of
116
or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas 
who would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" 
session - and who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if 
allegations of improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's 
plan/enterprise. 
12. Epstein's plan, scheme, and/or enterprise reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon 
arrival at Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's 
assistant, who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone 
number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a 
massage table in addition to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the 
stairway hall and in the bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, 
whereupon Epstein would enter wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay 
down naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would 
perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, including masturbation, touching the girl's 
vagina with a vibrator, or digitally penetrating the girl's vagina, and coerce or attempt to coerce 
the girl to engage in lewd acts and/or prostitution. 
13. Consistent with the foregoing plan, scheme, and/or enterprise, Ms. Robson recruited Jane 
Doe to give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane Doe to 
Epstein's mansion in :=>alm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight 
o:f stairs to the room with the massage table. Ms. Kellen set up the massage table, laid out 
massage oils, told Jane Doe that Epstein would be in shortly, and then left the room. Jane Doe 
was alone in the room when Epstein arrived. Epstein told her to remove her clothes and left the

room. When Epstein returned he was wearing only a towel. He removed his towel and laid down 
on his stomach on the massage table. Epstein again told Jane Doe to remove her clothes. In 
shock, fear and trepidation, Jane Doe complied, removing her clothes except for her panties and 
bra. Shortly after starting to rub Epstein's back, Epstein told Jane Doe to sit on his back. Jane 
Doe, out of fear and trepidation, complied. After a period of time Epstein got up from the table 
and went behind the door. 
For several minutes Jane Doe heard loud noises and moans and 
believes that Epstein was masturbating. Thereafter Epstein, naked, returned to the massage table 
and laid face up on the table. Epstein than told Jane Doe to continue with the massage and told 
her to sit on top of him. Out of fear and trepidation she complied. As Jane Doe rubbed Epstein's 
chest, Epstein began to use a vibrator on Jane Doe's vagina. 
Thereafter Epstein began to 
digitally stimulate and attempt to penetrate Jane Doe's vagina. At this same time, Epstein was 
masturbating. Upon :~eaching orgasm, Epstein got up from the massage table, told Jane Doe to 
write down her name and phone number, and then left the room. 
14. Jane Doe was then able to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs and 
into the kitchen. Epstein, Robson and Kellen were waiting for Jane Doe. Epstein paid Jane Doe 
$300. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane Doe to him. Ms. Robson took 
Jane Doe home. 
15. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane Doe experienced 
confusion, shame, humiliation, and embarrassment, and the assault sent her life into a downward 
spiral.

In accordance with 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441, 1446, and 1332(a)(l), the defendants, 
Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen, and Haley Robson, hereby remove this action 1 from 
Palm Beach County Circuit Court to the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida, and respectfully state as follows: 
Introduction 
Six months ago, this plaintiff filed virtually the identical lawsuit in this 
Court. See Jane Doe #1 v. Epstein, Case No. 08-cv-80069-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed 
Doe v. Epstein et al. , Case No. 50 2008 CA 006596 XXXX MB (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct.

Jan. 24, 2008) (the "First Federal Action"). 
The First Federal Action named 
Jeffrey Epstein as the sole tortfeasor, made the identical operative allegations as 
the instant Amended Complaint, and demanded damages of $50 million. (The 
amount of the demand against Epstein is evidently the product of recent reports in 
the press that Epstein is wealthy.) 
The First Federal Action was quickly followed by a series of substantially 
identical "Jane Doe" lawsuits, all filed by the same attorney in a three-month span. 
Compare Jane Doe #1 v. Epstein, Case No. 08-cv-80069-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed 
Jan. 24, 2008), with Jane Doe #2 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80119-KAM (S.D. Fla. 
filed Feb. 6, 2008) (asserting identical causes of action based on the same operative 
allegations), Jane Doe #3 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80232-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Mar. 
5, 2008) (same), Jane Doe #4 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80380-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed 
Apr. 14, 2008) (same), and Jane Doe #5 v. Epstein, No. 08-80381-CV-KAM (S.D. 
Fla. filed Apr. 14. 2008) (same). 
On February 20, amid these filings, Jane Doe # 1 was deposed in State of 
Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, 502006CF009454AXXXMB (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct., filed 
Jul. 19, 2006 ), a parallel state-court criminal action. During that deposition, she 
made numerous admissions that completely undermined the allegations against 
Epstein that she had pled in her complaint. A copy of her deposition, with names

redacted, is attached hereto (Exhibit A). Two days later, counsel for Jane Doe #1 
filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice in the First Federal Action. 
See Doe #1 v. Epstein, Case No. 08-CV-80069-KAM, DE 9. 
Two weeks later (March 6, 2008), having changed lawyers, Jane Doe # 1 
refiled her complaint in Florida Circuit Court as the instant case, adding two 
nominal defendants: Sarah Kellen, Mr. Epstein's personal secretary, and Haley 
Robson, one of Jane Doe #1 's contemporaries. These defendants have nothing to 
do with the plaintiffs case against Mr. Epstein, except that the presence of Haley 
Robson as a defendant in this new case, because she is a citizen of Florida (Am. 
Compl. ,i 4), would ostensibly prevent complete diversity. 2 
As discussed below, however, Haley Robson was named in the refiled 
lawsuit only to d,;!stroy diversity jurisdiction, and to prevent any application of 18 
U.S.C. § 3509(k), a mandatory stay provision applicable in federal court .3 Haley 
Defendant Kellen is a citizen of New York (Am. Compl. ~ 5), and is therefore a 
nonresident defendant for purposes of diversity jurisdiction and removal. 
Section 3509(k) of Title 18, United States Code, provides as follows: 
If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for 
damage or injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is pending 
which arises out of the same occurrence and in which the child is the 
victim, the civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the 
criminal action and any mention of the civil action during the criminal 
proceeding is prohibited. As used in this subsection, a criminal action is 
pending until its final adjudication in the trial court.

Robson, besides having nothing to do with the substantive allegations of the 
plaintiff's $50,000,000 case, is a community-college student with no assets 
whatever. 
Even if this case purports to identify a new (and strategically nondiverse) 
tortfeasor, the refiled lawsuit is still directed against only one defendant-Jeffrey 
Epstein. Then and now, the operative allegations are the same: Jane Doe alleges 
that Jeffrey Epstein assaulted her "in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida 
Statutes."4 (Am. Compl. , 18.) To sharpen her lawsuit, the plaintiff says she is 
seeking damages in connection with a "conspiracy" (Am. Compl. , 22), a "plan" 
(Am. Compl. , 32), a "scheme" (Am. Compl. , 32), and an "enterprise" (Am. 
Compl. , 32). These theories of liability, however, cannot be supported by the 
allegations in th1;! Amended Complaint. 
Even if everything in the Amended 
Complaint were true, recovery against Haley Robson, under any formulation, is 
impossible under Florida law. 
Focusing on the real parties to this controversy, the instant case could have 
( once again) been brought here in federal court-just like the four other "Jane 
U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added). 
Chapter 800, Florida Statutes, is entitled, "Lewdness; Indecent Exposure."

Doe" lawsuits presently pending against Epstein, filed by this plaintiffs former 
lawyer. 
This case 1s properly removed to federal court, first, because there is 
complete diversity among the real parties-in-interest, second, because the amount 
in controversy exceeds $75,000, and third, because this Notice complies with the 
requirements of28 U.S.C. § 1446. 
Discussion 
A. This case is properly removable because it falls within the original 
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of Florida. 
A state-court case is properly removable when "it could have been brought, 
originally, in a federal district court." Lincoln Prop. Co. v. Roche, 546 U.S. 81, 83 
(2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a)). This case was originally filed in federal 
district court, and it is the same case today. Even though it was reconfigured to 
look like a state-court lawsuit, this action falls squarely within the bounds of the 
diversity-jurisdiction statute. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(l) (establishing that federal 
district courts have original jurisdiction over cases where the amount in 
controversy [is more than $75,000] ... and [ when the controversy] is between 
citizens of different states").

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008   Page 6 of 100
1. The amount in controversy in this action exceeds $75,000. 
This case is a duplicate of the First Federal Lawsuit. In that case, Jane Doe 
pied "damages in excess of $50 million." See Doe v. Epstein, No. 08-80069-KAM 
(S.D. Fla. filed Jan. 24, 2008) (Compl. 1 6). That allegation is now deleted and the 
Amended Complaint substitutes a generic prayer for relief. 5 It is clear, however, 
that Jane Doe still seeks more than $75,000 in damages. 
This case, precisely like the First Federal Action, seeks damages in 
connection with an alleged assault. (Am. Compl. 11 16-19.) 
The Amended 
Complaint alleges that Jane Doe "has suffered and will continue to suffer severe 
and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological, and emotional 
damages." (Am. Compl. 1 19.) These are the identical injuries Jane Doe asserted 
in the First Federal Action, and are no less serious simply because pled under a 
state-court caption. Cf, e.g., Woods v. Southwest Airlines, Co., 523 F. Supp. 2d 
812, 820 (N.D. Ill. 2007) (determining, in the context of diversity jurisdiction, that 
the $75,000 threshold had been satisfied, and "clearly [surpassed]," based on "the 
nature of the injuries alleged" in the complaint). 
The Complaint ~.eeks damages for "[more than] ... $15,000.'' (Am. Compl. ~ 6.) This 
boilerplate is routinely used in Florida pleading practice to trigger application of section 
26.012, Florida Statutes, the statute that establishes the jurisdictional amount required for 
filing in Florida's Circuit Court (as opposed to County Court).

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008   Page 7 of 100
To cement this point, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has said that 
"[w]hen [a] complaint does not claim a specific amount of damages, removal from 
state court is proper if it is facially apparent from the complaint that the amount in 
controversy exceeds the jurisdictional requirement." Williams v. Best Buy Co., 
Inc., 269 F .3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir. 2001 ). This case meets that standard, and 
satisfies the first prong of diversity jurisdiction. 
2. There is complete diversity among the real parties to this 
controversy. 
Diversity jurisdiction reqmres complete diversity. 
Carden v. Arkoma 
Assocs., 494 U.S. 185, 187 (1990) ("Since its enactment, we have interpreted the 
diversity statute to require 'complete diversity' of citizenship." (citing Strawbridge 
v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 267-68 (1806))). See also MacGinnitie v. Hobbs 
Group, LLC, 420 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir. 2005) (stating that "[c]omplete 
diversity requires that no defendant in a diversity action be a citizen of the same 
state as any plaintiff'). As demonstrated below, this case satisfies the statutory 
requirement of complete diversity. 
(a) Plaintiff Jane Doe is a citizen of Florida. (Am. Compl. ~ 1.) 6 
Jane Doe may, in fact, be a citizen of Georgia, not Florida, as she pied in her Amended 
Complaint. See New York Post, Jul. 1, 2008 (reporting that "On his way into court [for 
his state-court guilty plea on June 30], Epstein was served with a copy of a lawsuit by 
Doe, who has since moved to another state."); Jane Doe Depo. at 77, 112 (indicating that

(b) Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 7 
(c) Defendant Sarah Kellen is a citizen of New York. (Am. Compl. ,r 5.) 
3. Defendant Haley Robson was fraudulently joined to defeat diversity. 
"A non-diverse defendant who is fraudulently joined does not defeat 
diversity because his citizenship is excluded from the diversity calculus." Shenkar 
v. Money Warehouse, Inc., No. 07-20634-CIV, 2007 WL 3023531, at* I (S.D. Fla. 
lter twin sister lives with her mother in Georgia); Affidavit of Dawn La Vogue Sandberg, 
at ,i 1 (stating, "I am the mother and natural guardian for Jane Doe# l" with jurat executed 
in Georgia before a Georgia notary), DE 4-2, Jane Doe No. 1 v. Epstein, Case No. 08-
80069-Civ-Marra ( 1/29/08); Intervenor's Complaint, at ,i 2 (filed by "Jane Doe's Mother" 
and stating that "Jane Doe's Mother is a citizen and resident of the State of Georgia."), 
DE 5-2, Jane Doe No. I v. Epstein, Case No. 08-80069-Civ-Marra (1/29/08); Petition for 
Removal of Disability of Non-Age, at ,i,i 1, 2, 7 (filed "on behalf of S.D.G.," alleging that 
''The mother is Da[w]n Lavogue Sandberg, and her address is .... Ga.," and stating that 
"S.D.G. is also the unnamed party in a lawsuit filed by her father on her behalf in the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Case No. 08-80069, which was 
filed without the consent of the mother"), In re Sandberg v. Gonzalez, Case No. 50 2008 
DR 001141 (Palm Beach Co. Family Ct.) (1/31/08). If this turns out to be the case, there 
is complete diversity, regardless of Robson's citizenship. Although the Eleventh Circuit 
has recently indicated that a district court may not conduct jurisdictional discovery under 
such circumstances, another division of this Court has since allowed it. Compare Lowery 
v. Ala. Power Co., 483 F.3d 1184, 1215-16, 1221 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that 
jurisdictional discovery to determine citizenship upon removal is inappropriate), with 
Calixto v. BASF Constr. Chemicals, LLC, slip op., Case No. 07-60077-CIV-ZLOCH, 
2008 WL 1840717, * 1 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 22, 2008) ( ordering that parties "shall engage in 
jurisdictional discovery for the Court to determine the citizenship of BASF and whether it 
has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action"). 
The Amended Complaint erroneously states that Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen of New 
York.

Oct. 15, 2007) (l\1oreno, J.) (citing Riley v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, 
Inc., 292 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir. 2002)); accord, e.g., Tedder v. FMC Corp., 
590 F.2d 115,117 (5th Cir. 1979) (denying motion to remand where two resident 
defendants were joined for the fraudulent purpose of defeating federal jurisdiction). 
ln this case, the plaintiff relies on her original allegations to support three causes of 
action against Haley Robson: civil conspiracy (Am. Compl. ,i,i 20-23); Intentional 
Infliction of Emotional Distress (Am. Compl. ,i,i 23-28); and civil RICO (Am. 
Compl. ,i,i 29-34 ). These allegations, however, do not support these claims, or 
any other theory of liability that would allow recovery against Haley Robson. Cf 
Parks v. The New York Times Co., 308 F.2d 474, 477 (5th Cir. 1962) (observing 
that "determination of fraudulent joinder is to be based on whether there was a real 
intention on colorable grounds to procure a joint judgment") ( emphasis added).8 
(a) Nonresident defendants have a right of removal. 
The removal statute was enacted specifically "to protect defendants." Legg v. 
Wyeth, 428 F.3d 1317, 1325 (11th Cir. 2005). Cf, e.g., Picquet v. Amoco Prod. 
Co., 513 F. Supp. 938,941 (M.D. La. 1981) (explaining that courts developed the 
fraudulent-joinder doctrine to protect "the right [ of removal] granted to 
In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F .2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) ( en bane), the 
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the 
former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981.

[defendants] by ... Congress"). In this case, by reconstituting her original federal

action arising from an alleged sexual assault of a minor "shall be stayed until the 
end of all phases of [any] criminal action") ( emphasis added). In this case, there is 
a parallel federal criminal grand jury action pending in the Southern District of 
Florida, In re Grand Jury, No. FGJ 07-103(WPB) (S.D. Fla.), which arises out of 
the same allegations pled here. 
Thus, in resorting to fraudulent joinder, the 
plaintiff has sought to avoid any application of this otherwise controlling statute. 
Cf Doe v. Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260 MCR/WCS, 2005 WL 517847, at* 1-2 (N.D. 
Fla. Feb. 10, 2005) (staying civil diversity action over plaintiffs' objections on 
grounds that "the language of 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) is clear that a stay is required in

occurrence involving minor victims") ( emphasis added). 
Even outside the context of a mandatory federal statute, "the Supreme Court 
!has] admonished [that] 'the Federal courts should not sanction devices intended to 
prevent a removal to a Federal court where one has that right, and should be 
equally vigilant to protect the right to proceed in the Federal court."' Legg, 428

to overcome it"' (quoting McKinney v. Bd. of Trustees of Maryland Cmty. Coll., 
955 F.2d 924, 928 ( 4th Cir. 1992))). 
To protect a nonresident defendant's right of removal, a federal court will 
"determine the matter of jurisdiction" by examining "the true situation both as to 
parties and causes of action." 
Bernblum v. Travelers' Inc. Co., 9 F. Supp. 34, 35 
(W.D. Mo. 1934) (emphasis added). See also id. (observing that "[t]he federal 
courts will ... strike out the fiction injected into a case by a party to prevent 
removal"). In accordance with these principles, a plaintiff cannot destroy diversity 
jurisdiction simply by conjuring up a nondiverse defendant; there must be at least 
some "possibility that the state law might impose liability on [the nondiverse] 
defendant under the circumstances alleged in the complaint." Florence v. Crescent 
Res., LLC, 484 F.3d 1293, 1299 (11th Cir. 2007) (citations omitted). See also, 
Holloway v. Morrow, No. 07-0839-WS-M, 2008 WL 401305, at *5 (S.D. Ala. Feb.

not merely theoretical'" (quoting Legg v. Wyeth, 428 F .3d 1317, 1325 n.5 (11th 
Cir. 2005))) ( emphasis added). 
In this case, the plaintiffs have tried to whip Jane Doe's original, one-
defendant complaint into a froth that looks non-federal. Cf Owens v. Swan, 962 F. 
Supp. 1436, 1439 (D. Utah 1997) (noting that "although plaintiffs' amended

complaint contains four claims for relief, the first and second claims state only one 
cause of action''') ( emphasis added). Using her original allegations and adding 
nothing, Jane Doe has tried to add claims against Haley Robson for civil 
conspiracy (Am. Compl. ,, 20-23), Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
(Am. Compl. ,, 24-28), and civil RICO (Compl. ,, 29-34) in order to append a 
nondiverse defendant to her Complaint. These claims, however, are untenable 
under Jane Doe's own allegations, and therefore cannot be used to destroy 
diversity jurisdiction. 
(b) There is no possibility that the plaintiff can establish a cause of 
action against Haley Robson under Florida law. 
(i) The conspiracy claim against Robson must fail. 
As a general rule, "[ a ]n actionable conspiracy [ under Florida law] requires 
an actionable underlying tort or wrong." Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 1165 
(Fla. 5th DCA 1984) ( citations omitted) ( emphasis added). 10 
This case is governed by the general rule. Cf Churruca v. Miami Jai-Alai, Inc., 353 
So. 2d 547, 550 (Fla. 1977) (noting that while there is "ordinarily ... no independent tort 
for conspiracy," there is a narrow exception to this rule when "the plaintiff can show 
some peculiar power of coercion possessed by the conspirators by virtue of their 
combination") ( emphasis added). See generally Liappas v. Augoustis, 47 So. 2d 582, 583 
(Fla. 1950) (observing that ·•'instances of conspiracy which is in itself an independent tort 
are rare and should be added to with caution"' (quoting Fleming v. Dane, 22 N.E.2d 
609, 61 I, (Mass. 1939))) (emphasis added). Plainly, this case involves the general rule, 
not the narrow exception, because only one person could have caused Jane Doe's 
injuries. Cf Marlin v. Marlin, 529 So. 2d 1174, 1179 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988) (upholding 
Lewis Tein ",.

Here, Jane Doe cannot assert a cause of action for "violation of Chapter 800, 
Florida Statutes" (Am. Compl. ,r 18) because there is no private right of action 
under that Chapter. See generally Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Plaza Materials 
Corp., 908 So. 2d 360, 374 (Fla. 2005) (observing that "not every statutory 
violation carries a civil remedy" ( citing Villazon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, 
Inc .. 843 So. 2d 842, 852 (Fla. 2003))). See also, e.g., Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. 
Ferre, 636 F. Supp. 970 (S.D. Fla. 1985) (King, C.J.) (holding that violation of 
Florida's criminal extortion statute does not give rise to a civil cause of action for 
damages); Mantooth v. Richards, 557 So. 2d 646, 646 (Fla. 4th DCA 1990) (per 
curiam) (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs claim for parental kidnapping where 
"the mentioned statutes concern only criminal violations and do not afford a civil 
remedy") ( citation omitted) ( emphasis added); Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 
1165 (Fla. 5th DCA 1984) (holding that "[ a ]n act which does not constitute a basis 
for a cause of action against one person cannot be made the basis for a civil action 
for conspiracy"). 
In this case, Jane Doe's claim under Count II (civil conspiracy) fails because 
it derives exclusively from Count I (violation of Chapter 800, Florida Statutes). Cf 
grant of summary judgment against claim for independent conspiracy, noting that 
·"[ w]hen the concerted acts of the defendants do not create a greater harm than if the acts 
were committed by one person alone, then there can be no recovery").

Buchanan v. Miami Herald Pub/ 'g Co., 230 So. 2d 9, 12 (Fla. 1969) (holding that 
where Count I of the complaint had failed to state a cause of action for malicious 
prosecution, there could be no civil-conspiracy claim in Count II "based on the 
allegations of Count I"). Because the statute she expressly pleads as the basis for 
Count I, Chapter 800, Florida Statutes, provides no civil remedy, Jane Doe cannot 
prevail on Count I. 
Therefore, she cannot prevail on her claim for conspiracy 
(Count II) to violate Chapter 800, Florida Statutes (Count I). 
(ii) 
The plaintiff cannot prevail against nondiverse defendant 
Haley Robson on her claim for Intentional Infliction 
of Emotional Distress (IIED). 
Even if the plaintiff, for the sake of argument, can assert an IIED claim 
against Jeffrey Epstein, the plaintiff still does not have a cause of action for IIED 
against Haley Robson. First, the plaintiff cannot recover damages in connection 
with her own illegal conduct; and second, the plaintiffs purported IIED claim fails 
as a matter of law.

1. 
The plaintiff seeks damages in connection with her 
own illegal conduct. 
The plaintiff concedes that she went to Jeffrey Epstein's house "to give 
Epstein a massage for monetary compensation." (Am. Compl. ,r 13.) The plaintiff 
also concedes, in the guise of an allegation, that Haley Robson "brought Jane Doe 
to Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach" to help the plaintiff execute her own plan. 
(Am. Compl. ,r 13.) Yet, the plaintiff's plan was illegal: under Florida law, it is a 
crime "to practice massage" without a license. § 480.047, Fla. Stat. (1997). To say 
it another way, the plaintiff admits that she went to Mr. Epstein's house to commit 
a crtme. 
Based on these allegations, it is clear that the plaintiff seeks damages in 
connection with her own illegal conduct; this is enough to support a finding of 
fraudulent joinder. See Florence v. Crescent Resources, LLC, 484 F.3d 1293, 1298 
n.3 (11th Cir. 2007) ( acknowledging that "under some circumstances, application 
of an affirmative defense can support a finding of fraudulent joinder). 
This 
conclusion is supported by well-established principles. 
Under Florida law, a plaintiff cannot recover damages flowing from her own 
illegal conduct. See Hall v. Hall, 93 Fla. 709, 112 So. 622, 628 (1927) (referring to 
"the universal rule of our law that one in a court of justice cannot complain ... of 
another's wrong whereof he was a partaker") (internal quotation marks and citation

omitted) (emphasis added); Turner v. Anderson, 704 So. 2d 748, (Fla. 4th DCA 
1998) ("[N]o public policy should allow appellant to recover damages as a result of 
engaging in criminal conduct such as occurred in this case."). Cf Ewell v. Daggs, 
108 U.S. 143, 149 (1883) (stating that '"[n]o court will lend its aid to a [plaintiff! 
who founds [a] cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act"') (quoting 
Holman v. Johnson, 98 Eng. Rep. 1120 (K.B. 1775)); see also id. (explaining that 
this policy is '"not for the sake of the defendant, but because [the courts] will not 
lend their aid to such a plaintiff" (quoting Holman, 98 Eng. Rep. 1120)) 
( emphasis added); Balas v. Ruzzo, 703 So. 2d 1076, 1082 (Fla. 5th DCA 1997) 
(Harris, J ., concurring) (remarking in the context of an action brought against an 
alleged prostitution house that "the court should continue its tradition of not 
interceding in civil conflicts involving transactions that are either illegal or are 
against public policy"). 
Based on the foregoing, the plaintiff cannot blame someone else (Haley 
Robson) for the consequences of her own criminal conduct. Cf Feld & Sons, Inc. 
v. Pechner, Dorfrnan, Wolffe, Rounick and Cabot, 458 A.2d 545, 552 (Pa. Super. 
Ct. 1983) (holding that law-firm clients could not recover damages flowing from 
their own criminal acts, even though clients' lawyers had suggested the unlawful 
conduct to begin with). See also Turner v. Anderson, 704 So. 2d 748, 751 (Fla. 4th

DCA 1998) (approving reasoning in Feld & Sons, holding that "no public policy 
should allow [a plaintiff] to recover damages as a result of engaging in criminal 
conduct" where the plaintiff had provided false testimony at an arbitration 
proceeding). 
2. 
The plaintiff's IIED claim fails as a matter of law. 
To state a cause of action for IIED, a complaint must allege four elements: 
11) deliberate or reckless infliction of mental suffering; (2) outrageous conduct; (3) 
the conduct caused the emotional distress; and ( 4) the distress was severe. Metro. 
Life Ins. Co. v. ll1cCarson, 467 So. 2d 277, 278 (Fla. 1985). Whether conduct is 
outrageous enough to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress 
is a question of law, not a question of fact. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Steadman, 968 
So. 2d 592, 595 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007) ( citations omitted). 
In this case, without reaching the question of "outrage," the plaintiff has 
failed to show that Haley Robson's conduct - - allegedly arranging an illegal 
sexual massage that the plaintiff herself agreed to perform - - itself caused the 
plaintiff to suffer any emotional distress. 
Even if the alleged agreement was 
fraudulently induced, the plaintiffs IIED claim flows from Epstein's alleged 
conduct, not the joint conduct of Robson and Doe in planning the massage.

(iii) The plaintiff cannot prevail on her claim for civil remedies 
for criminal practices or racketeering ("civil RICO") pied in 
Count IV. 
A cause of action under section 772.104, Florida Statutes ("Civil Remedies 
for Criminal Practices") requires a showing of direct injury. Even assuming for 
the sake of argument that Jane Doe can establish that the defendants engaged in a 
"pattern of criminal activity," she cannot establish that she was directly injured by 
those activities. 
Section 772.104 allows someone to bring a civil RICO claim only if ''he or 
she has been injured by reason of' any RICO violation. § 772.104, Fla. Stat. 
(2007). Here, the allegations in Count IV, even if they are true, do not add up to a 
civil RICO claim because there is no proximate cause between the purported 
"pattern of criminal activity" and Jane Doe's alleged injuries. 
In a doomed attempt to satisfy the extremely high burden of pleading civil 
RICO under Florida law, the Amended Complaint lists a series of violations rooted 
in Florida's prosti.tution statutes. (Am. Compl. ,r 31.) According to the Amended 
Complaint, the defendants participated in a criminal enterprise ... or conspir[ acy ]" 
(Am. Compl. ,r 30) over an unspecified length of time "to repeatedly find and 
bring [Jeffrey Epstein] underage girls ... in order for Epstein to solicit, coerce, 
entice, compel, or force such girls in acts of prostitution and/or lewdness" (Am. 
Lewis Tein,. .. 
3059 GRAND AVENUE, SUITE 340, (OCONUT GROVE, FLORIDA 33133

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008   Page 20 of 100
Comp!. ,r 32). The alleged "pattern of criminal activity" comprises violations of 
Chapter 796, Florida Statutes-the chapter that proscribes various crimes of 
• 
• 
prostltut10n. 
These allegations do not tie directly into Jane Doe's alleged psychic injuries. 
In contrast to a cognizable RICO claim, this action concerns only an isolated 
occurrence. More important, the alleged injuries in this case are pied to have 
resulted from an alleged sexual assault, an assault "in violation of Chapter 800 of 
the Florida Statutes" (Am. Compl. ,r 18)--not anything having to do with the 
facilitation of prostitution, or more succinctly, the violation of Florida's 
prostitution law. 
Civil RICO claims are extraordinarily difficult to plead successfully. There 
are examples in the case law of RICO claims stemming from a prostitution 
enterprise, but they are vastly different from what plaintiff pleads here. 
They 
involve, for example, prostitutes who sued a house of prostitution (as an 
''enterprise") for inflicting systematic and repetitive abuse on them, over time. See 
Balas v. Ruzzo, 703 So. 2d I 076, I 077 (Fla. 5th DCA 1997) ( offering an example 
of a civil RICO claim against the operators of an alleged "house of prostitution," 
I 3 
The Amended Complaint alleges a "pattern of criminal activity" comprising the 
following criminal violations: §§ 796.03, 796.07(2)([), 796.07(2)(h), 796.045, and 
796.04, Fla. Stat. (Am. Comp!. ,i 31.)

where petitioners alleged that they had "suffered emotional pam, anguish, 
humiliation, insult, indignity, loss of self-esteem, inconvenience, hurt and 
emotional distress" as a result of being forced repeatedly, over time, to "perform 
sexual acts to retain their employment"). Here, even if the Amended Complaint 
can be read to plead that the defendants schemed to solicit other massages from 
other people (see, e.g., Am. Compl. ,-i,-i 9, 11, 12, 32), those activities are not 
alleged in any way to have impacted Jane Doe. Cf, e.g., Palmas Y Bambu, SA. v. 
EI. Dupont De Nemours & Co., Inc., 881 So. 2d 565, 570 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004)

O'Malley v. St. Thomas Univ., Inc., 599 So. 2d 999, 1000 (Fla. 3d DCA 1992))) 
( emphasis added). 
Because the Amended Complaint does not satisfy the direct-injury 
requirement under Florida's RICO law, Jane Doe has failed to allege a cause of 
action against Haley Robson for violation of section 772.103, Florida Statutes.

2. Notice has been given, and state-court papers have been filed. 
In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1446( d), defendants have served this Notice

3. There is unanimity among the defendants. 
In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b) the undersigned are authorized to

Conclusion 
Because this is a civil action between citizens of different states, excluding 
any fraudulently joined parties, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, 
exclusive of interests and costs, this Court has original jurisdiction over this action 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(l).

MR. LEOPOLD: 
Let me just object. 
let me instruct you. 
Anything that 
you have learned through conversations between you 
and me are protected. 
So if you know any of that 
information outside of those discussions, you may 
answer. 
But if the only way you know it is 
through our discussions, do not answer that 
question. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 11111 you know that Mr. Leopold recently 
filed a lawsuit in federal court on your behalf against 
Jeffrey Epstein seeking fifty million dollars? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Same objection. 
If you know the answer to that outside of 
our discussions, you may answer. 
If it is the 
only way that you know the answer is through our 
discussions, do not answer that question.

Okay.

MR. LEOPOLD: 
Lewis, we're not going to do 
that. 
MR. TEIN: 
My name is not Lewis. 
I'm going to finish my question. 
Okay? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Do not answer until you hear 
from me. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
Other than conversations that you have had 
with Mr. Leopold -- I'm not asking about that -- are you 
aware that Mr. Leopold has filed a lawsuit in federal 
court seeking fifty million dollars from Jeffrey Epstein 
on your behalf? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Same objection. 
Anything that you learn through 
conversations between you and me, do not answer. 
Those are protected. 
If you know through any 
other realm of knowledge, you may answer. 
THE WITNESS: 
No. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
You have no idea that Mr. Leopold filed a 
fif~y million-dollar lawsuit on your behalf against 
Jeffrey Epstein?

discussions that you and I had.

you may answer. 
So do not answer that question if 
that is the only basis by which you understand 
that answer. 
THE WITNESS: 
No. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
I 
Q. 
You didn't know that? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Don't answer that question. 
Again, it's attorney/client privilege. 
Any 
information you've learned through conversations 
between you and I are protected. 
If you know it 
through any other realm, you may answer. 
MR. TEIN: 
Are you going to say that for 
every question in the deposition, Mr. Leopold? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
When you ask improper 
questions like that without the proper --

You're going to stop your 
speaking objections right now. 
Okay?

MR. TEIN: 
You need to stop your speaking 
objections.

MR. LEOPOLD: 
Counsel, you just asked me a 
question and I'm going to state it on the 
record --

objections. 
Check your rules. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Excuse me. 
For the record, 
Counsel asked me a question. 
I'll state the 
answer on the record. 
He asked me the question am 
I going to be answering that way throughout the 
deposition. 
So long as there's improper 
foundation and predicate asked by the attorney, I 
will protect my client and I make the record where 
appropriate. 
If counsel wishes to ask an 
appropriate worded question with the proper 
foundation and predicate, I will certainly allow 
the client to answer the question. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Why don't you just state 
attorney/client privilege and just be done with 
it? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I want the record to be 
clear. 
MR. TEIN: 
You want to waste time is what 
you want to do. 
You were supposed to be here this morning 
and you totally broke the deal, the agreement that 
you had with us if your hearing got cancelled. 
But let's move on and maybe you'll stop 
obstructing this deposition. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I think the record is very

clear where we stand thus far. 
Is there a recording taken of this 
deposition? 
THE COURT REPORTER: 
Yes. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Just make sure that's 
Page 12 
preserved. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
Go to Exhibit 20-01 -- well, before you do 
that, .. 
are you aware that a lawyer named Jeffrey 
Hernan filed a lawsuit on your behalf, yes or no? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Objection. 
Any conversations that you and I have had 
regarding that, if that is the only way by which 
you understand how to answer that question, do not 
answer. 
It's attorney/client privilege, as well 
as any conversations you may have had with the 
attorney from Miami. 
That is also attorney/client 
privilege. 
And I'm assuming --
MR. TEIN: 
You're actually wrong about the 
attorney/client privilege. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I'm assuming Counsel is not 
asking you to divulge attorney/client 
MR. TEIN: 
Of course not. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. . .  
are you aware that Jeffrey Herman,

an attorney, filed a fifty-million-dollar lawsuit on your 
behalf against Jeffrey Epstein, yes or no? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Same objection. 
MR. TEIN: 
We've heard the objection 10 
times already. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Counsel, excuse me. 
MR. TEIN: 
Just say attorney/client 
privilege. 
Stop interrupting my questions. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I'm entitled to make an 
objection for the record, which I'm doing, and 
I'll make the same objection. 
And if it calls for 
attorney/client privilege, any conversations you 
and I have had, do not answer the question. 
And I think that it might be appropriate, 
for the record, to ask questions via 
as opposed to 
I think that 
would be more appropriate for this deposition. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
Go ahead. 
Please answer yes or no. 
Yes. 
Thank you. 
In fact, you know that Mr. Herman held a 
press conference after he filed the fifty-million-dollar 
lawsuit on your behalf, don't you?

Q. 
Have you ever seen that picture before?

Yes. 
Q. 
Is that a picture of your father, your 
stepmother and Mr. Herman at the press conference 
regarding your lawsuit? 
A. 
Yes.

matter, don't you?

Objection.

All right.

object.

standing to do so.

in the small confines of this room, to be very 
aggressive with this young lady.

You wrote that to your friend, didn't you? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Objection. 
Asked and 
answered, for the fourth time. 
MR. TEIN: 
You are improperly objecting, 
Mr. Leopold. 
You have no grounds to object. 
And 
that's not an objection. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
It is an objection. 
MR. TEIN: 
Then terminate the deposition if 
you think it's been asked and answered. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Counsel, I am not precluded 
from just making an objection to the form of the 
question. 
As the courts well know, and if you 
practice here in West Palm Beach, many of the 
judges require you to set the objection with 
specificity. 
And I will do that. 
And if you 
don't want me to, you can make the record. 
But I 
will do that. 
MR. TEIN: 
Here's what we'll do, Ted. 
You 
can -- I will allow you to reserve an objection to 
form for every single one of my questions. 
Otherwise, all you're doing is obstructing. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I won't do that. 
MR. TEIN: 
Of course; because you want to 
obstruct. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
All right.

Are you?

And I've already 
answered that a bazillion times.

MR. LEOPOLD: 
Counsel, I've made an 
objection for the record. 
MR. TEIN: 
Stop speaking.

I'm going to make the record. 
You cannot interrupt me when I'm making the 
record. 
Out of professional conduct, you cannot 
do that. 
I'm entitled to make the record. 
I made 
an objection, asked and answered. 
Your demeanor 
is inappropriate. 
You're willing and you are able 
and you're responsible to ask a question in a 
professional manner, and ask the question and once 
you get the answer, to either follow up on it or 
move on, but not continuously browbeat and ask the 
same question over and over because you don't like 
the answer. 
MR. TEIN: 
Calm down, sir. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Trust me, I'm very calm here. 
When I'm not calm, you'll know it. 
I'm very calm. 
So please continue on. 
But I will not 
allow you to continue to harass her in the 
demeanor that you're doing. 
Ask her a question 
and move on.

---
MR. LEOPOLD: 
I think the record is very 
clear. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Let me just clarify 
something. 
When you object to the form of a 
question, you're not instructing the witness not 
to answer the question, are you? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
No. 
And I'm not making that 
objection; only on attorney/client privilege. 
MR. TEIN: 
Will you stop speaking now so I 
can ask my question? 
Are you done? 
Okay. 
I'm going to ask my question. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
Listen, ---
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Hold on. 
Stop. 
I've been doing this for 20 plus years and 
have met a lot of attorneys, but I've never had an 
experience like this where I've --
MR. TEIN: 
Stop your speeches.

put up with it and I don't need to put up with it 
and it's not appropriate. 
And I'm sure 
Mr. Goldberger knows all this, because I know that 
he wouldn't do this. 
So I will not put up with 
it. 
And I think it's highly inappropriate to do 
this with this child sitting here, the way you're 
acting, primarily towards me, and I will not put 
up with it. 
MR. TEIN: 
Will you please stop your speech 
so I can ask questions? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
So long as you act 
professionally, I will do so. 
But if you continue 
to do it this way, I will leave.

Q. 
That was a lie, though, wasn't it? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Objection to the form of the

You're making an

She just answered you she can't tell 
you that. 
MR. TEIN: 
Speaking objection. 
And you 
well know that, Mr. Leopold. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Sh~ can't answer that 
question. 
The way you phrased that question, 
you're purposely making her not be honest in her 
testimony. 
She can't answer a question like that. 
She doesn't remember. 
So then you say, "So you 
were lying." 
That's improper and you know that. 
That's not a proper question.

that would do that to a witnesses or to a person 
that's sitting in this chair is not acting 
professionally. 
You can't ask a question like 
that. 
You can do it, but it's not proper. 
And 
I'm sure you weren't trained that way, certainly 
not ethically. 
MR. TEIN: 
Will you stop?

BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
You asked your co-workers --
MR. LEOPOLD: 
It's vague and ambiguous. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
You asked your co-workers at the 
Quarterdeck Tavern to lie for you, didn't you? 
A. 
No. 
I informed my boss about what was 
going on and he told me that he would help in any way 
that he can. 
Q. 
Okay. 
You got your friend 
to lie 
by switching name tags with you, correct? 
A. 
Incorrect. 
It was a coincidence that same 
night she was not wearing her name tag; she was wearing 
mine. 
But I was also not wearing -- I was wearing my 
name tag. 
Everyone switches name tags. 
It just so 
happens it was a coincidence that same night the people 
came with the papers. 
MR. TEIN: 
Will you put up Exhibit 18-001? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
And mark 18-001 for 
identification purposes to this deposition. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
None of them have been marked 
yet. 
Can we mark them and put them as attachment 
to the depositions? 
Because I think you've shown 
three photos now.

so the record is clear --
MR. TEIN: 
I'm not speaking to you. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Okay. 
Then don't speak to me 
then. 
But I'll speak to Mr. Goldberger, perhaps. 
But at least for the record, can we put on 
the record what the previous two photographs were 
marked for identification? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We will make sure that the 
record is clear at the end of the deposition so 
that there's no ambiguity.

A. 
No. 
I knew --
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Just answer it. 
It calls for 
a yes or no. 
THE WITNESS: 
Okay. 
No. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
Now you can explain the answer that your 
counsel stopped you from explaining. 
A. 
Okay. 
I work at Quarterdeck and people 
were telling me that people were looking for me. 
So yes, 
I was aware that people were searching for me. 
But I had 
no ~dea who they were or what their intentions were. 
But 
I thought they were just people I didn't want to talk to. 
So I just didn't want to talk to them. 
And every time 
they'd come to work I wasn't there. 
And so happens the 
night that they came in me and my friend switched name 
tags. 
No big deal. 
Q. 
That's a lie, isn't it? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Objection. 
Don't answer that 
question. 
That's harassment and I will not allow 
it. 
He could ask the questions and we'll allow a 
jury to make that determination, but not counsel. 
I will not allow her to answer that 
question.

The fact that Counsel doesn't like the 
answer, that's a different query.

I'm not.

And it's not

here.

Fine.

time of asking the same question and then coming 
back and pointing a finger at her and saying, 
"You're a liar" 
MR. TEIN: 
That didn't happen. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
That's fine. 
But I'm not 
going to allow her to answer that question,

explained it.

his head with a migraine.

Now you can explain your answer. 
Q. 
A. 
I know that I have seen all of these and I 
know that this one is mine. 
Can you go down? 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
Just for the record, you're 
pointing to the photo. 
THE WITNESS: 
I'm pointing to --
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
You're pointing to the one where it says 
your age is 18? 
A. 
Q. 
A. 
Correct. 
That's yours, right? 
Correct. 
That's mine from a couple years 
ago that I have not been on, because I don't use that. 
Please keep going down, please. 
And I think that's it, 
because there's no one -- just that one is mine. 
Q. 
So the one you pointed to where it says 
your age is 18, that's yours, correct? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
And when you wrote 18 as your age on your 
MySpace page, that was a lie, wasn't it? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Did you lie about your MySpace page back 
then because you couldn't post on MySpace unless you were 
18?

A. 
Page 70 
Correct. 
There was a rule many years ago 
that you had to be 18 to have a MySpace. 
Q. 
So you lied about your age so you could 
post on MySpace, right? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Let's go back to the top one on this page, 
33--01. 
Are you testifying now under oath that this 
·MySpace page where the headline says, "Twins do have more 
fun," and the location is given as Lox, abbreviation for 
Loxahatchee, and the age is 19, and it says . .  
is it your testimony that you did not post 
that? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Now let's go back to the one that you were 
pointing to before on this page, where it says your age 
is 18 and you lied about your age to post MySpace, okay? 
A. 
Q. 
Uh-huh, yes. 
All right. 
Why did you finally put your 
tree age on your MySpace profile four days before you 
were scheduled to testify before the Grand Jury? 
A. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
MR. LEOPOLD: 
If you don't understand, ask 
him to ask the question again. 
MR. TEIN: 
Don't coach.

I don't know which MySpace 
you're talking about. 
BY MR. TEIN: 
Q. 
The MySpace page that you're just pointing 
to., where it says you were 18. 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And you were lying about your age, right? 
A. 
Oh-huh. 
Q. 
Why did you finally post your true age on 
your MySpace profile 
A. 
Uh 
Q. 
four days before you were scheduled to 
testify before the Grand Jury? 
A. 
I honestly don't know which MySpace, 
because I've had like a bazillion MySpaces, and in that 
year, I had two, that one and another one, and that one's 
been deleted. 
So I don't know which one you're referring 
to. 
Q. 
You remember that you changed your age on 
your MySpace page from 18 to your true age just four days 
before you went and testified in the Grand Jury? 
A. 
No. 
Q. 
You don't remember that. 
A. 
No.

Did one of the detectives tell you before 
you testified in the Grand Jury that you should take your

A. 
Q. 
No. 
Didn't Detective Recarey have to come to 
your house to pick you up to get you to testify in front 
of the Grand Jury?

almost killed him."

________________________________/
DEFENDANTS JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND SARAH KELLEN’S MOTION 
FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO ANSWER OR OTHERWISE 
RESPOND TO COMPLAINT  
Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen move, pursuant to Rule 7.1(A) 
of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida, for an enlargement of time to answer or otherwise respond to the amended 
complaint until ten days after their motion for stay, filed contemporaneously with 
this motion, is decided, and as grounds for this relief respectfully state as follows: 
1. 
This civil action is a private counterpart to a pending federal criminal 
action. 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/25/2008   Page 1 of 6

   CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
3059 GRAND AVENUE, SUITE 340, COCONUT GROVE, FLORIDA 33133 
2. 
The pending criminal action purports to arise from the alleged sexual 
assault of a minor, Jane Doe.   
3. 
Mr. Epstein and Ms. Kellen have filed a motion, contemporaneous 
with the filing of this motion, seeking a stay of this action under 18 U.S.C. § 3509.  
Under that section, when an alleged sexual assault involving a child victim results 
in a “criminal proceeding,” a commonly derived civil suit “shall be stayed until the 
end of all phases of the criminal action.” 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added).   
4. 
If Mr. Epstein and Ms. Kellen’s stay motion is granted, they will not 
be required to respond to the complaint or otherwise litigate this action until the 
pending criminal matter is resolved.   
5. 
The undersigned are authorized to represent that defendant Sarah 
Kellen joins in this motion.   
WHEREFORE, Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully 
request an enlargement of time to answer or otherwise respond to the complaint 
until ten days after their motion for a stay is decided.

__________________________/
ORDER DENYING MOTION TO SEAL
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court on Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen’s
Motion to File Under Seal, filed July 25, 2008.  Defendants seek to file their Motion to Stay
under seal.   The Court has carefully considered the motion and the record and is otherwise fully
advised in the premises.  
As the Court has explained in a related case, Doe v. Epstein, No. 08-80119 (S.D. Fla.
Aug. 4, 2008), the Local Rules for the Southern District of Florida state that “proceedings in the
United States District Court are public and Court filings are matters of public record.”  S.D. Fla.
L.R. 5.4(A).  It is well settled that the media and the public in general possess a common-law
right to inspect and copy judicial records.  See Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S.
589, 597 (1978).  “The right to inspect and copy records is not absolute, however. As with other
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 6   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/06/2008   Page 1 of 2

forms of access, it may interfere with the administration of justice and hence may have to be
curtailed.” Newman v. Graddick, 696 F.2d 796, 803 (11th Cir.1983). This right of access creates
a presumption in favor of openness of court records, which “must be balanced against any
competing interest advanced.”  United States v. Noriega, 752 F. Supp. 1037, 1040 (S.D.
Fla.1990).  For example, courts may look to see whether the records sought are for illegitimate
purposes.  Newman, 696 F.2d at 803.  Likewise, the Court may consider whether “the press has
already been permitted substantial access to the contents of the records.”  Id.  
In his motion to seal, Defendants state that they seek to file this document under seal “to
comply with the confidentiality clause” in the agreement between Defendant Epstein and the U.S.
Attorney cited in his brief.  (Def. Mot. 2.)  The Court is familiar with the U.S. Attorney’s
objections to unsealing any part of the agreement, see In re: Jane Doe, No. 08-80736-CIV (S.D.
Fla. July 11, 2008).  However, as the Court has previously held, the U.S. Attorney’s objections
do not outweigh the public interest in having access to court records.  Further, the details of the
agreement contained in Defendants’ Motion have, in large part, already been unsealed and
released to the public.  The Court finds no justification to keep these documents under seal.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Defendant’s Motion to File
Under Seal is DENIED.  The Clerk shall UNSEAL docket entries 4 and 5 and make them
available for public inspection through CM/ECF at the earliest possible time. 
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 5  day of August, 2008.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

JANE DOE NO. 1,
Plaintiff,
v.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY
ROBSON, and SARAH
KELLEN,
Defendants.
___________________________/
ORDER DENYING MOTION TO STAY
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court on Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen’s
Motion to Stay, filed under seal on July 25, 2008.  The Court has carefully considered the motion
and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (“Defendant”) seeks a stay of this civil action under a federal
statute which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:
If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for
damage or injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is
pending which arises out of the same occurrence and in which the child is
the victim, the civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the
criminal action and any mention of the civil action during the criminal
proceeding is prohibited. As used in this subsection, a criminal action is
pending until its final adjudication in the trial court.
U.S.C. § 3509 (k).  In his motion, Defendants cite a federal case, In re Grand Jury, No. FGJ
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 7   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/06/2008   Page 1 of 5

Defendant attempts to argue that the fact that grand jury subpoenas are still
“outstanding” and “in abeyance” and that the grand jury will not be dismissed until Defendant
completes his obligations under the state plea agreement means that a “criminal action” is
“pending.”  (Def. Mot. 4.)  Defendant misunderstands the purpose of a grand jury.  A grand jury,
as Blackstone writes, is composed of citizens who “inquire, upon their oaths, whether there be
sufficient cause to call upon the party to answer” the charge of criminal activity.  Beavers v.
Henkel, 194 U.S. 73, 84 (1904) (quoting William Blackstone, 4 Commentaries *303).  The grand
jury’s sole purpose is to inquire into whether there is probable cause to bring an individual before
a tribunal to determine his guilt or innocence of an alleged crime.  Id.  The grand jury is simply
an investigative body.  See U.S. v. Alred, 144, F.3d 1405, 1413 (11  Cir. 1998).  A “criminal
th
action” is not instigated by the calling of a grand jury, because a grand jury is convened “to
determine whether a crime has been committed and whether criminal proceedings should be
instituted against any person.”  U.S. v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 344 (1974).   An “action” is
commenced against a person after the grand jury actually finds probable cause to make an
individual answer specific charges and renders a bill of indictment against that individual.  Until
a grand jury’s investigation is complete and there has been a determination by a lawful authority
that probable cause exists, there can be no criminal action.
07-103(WPB) (S.D. Fla.), that arises out of the same occurrence as this civil action and is
pending so that a stay of this civil case is mandated.  The federal “case,” according to Defendant,
involves a “deferred-prosecution” agreement whereby the U.S. Attorney agreed to suspend its
investigation of Defendant while “retaining the right to reactivate the grand jury.”  (Def. Mot. 2.) 
Defendant essentially reasons, because the U.S. Attorney could bring criminal charges against
Defendant, that a criminal action is “pending.”  The Court rejects this definition of a “pending
criminal action.” 
When interpreting the text of a statute, the Court begins with the plain meaning of the
text.  In re Hedrick, 524 F.3d 1175, 1186 (11  Cir. 2008).  If the plain meaning of a statute is
th
clear, the Court should not deviate from that interpretation.  Id.  Pending is defined as “remaining
undecided” and “awaiting decision.”  Blacks Law Dictionary (8  ed. 2004).   Likewise, an
th
“action” is defined as a “criminal judicial proceeding.”  Id.  Because the U.S. Attorney has not
filed an indictment or an information against Defendant, the Court fails to see how there is an
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 7   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/06/2008   Page 2 of 5

In fact, Congress made this intent clear by stating that this broader definition of a
“criminal action” applied only “in this subsection.”
undecided judicial proceeding in federal court against Defendant. 
Defendant argues that this statute should be read to include the definition of “criminal
action” used in 18 U.S.C. § 1595(b)(2), which reads as follows: “In this subsection, a ‘criminal
action’ includes investigation and prosecution and is pending until final adjudication in the trial
court.”  Defendant argues that “Congress specifically intended that the term ‘criminal action’
would be applied extremely broadly” under § 1595, so Congress “took pains to ensure that courts
would give it the broadest possible construction” and defined “criminal action” as including
investigatory stages.  (Def. Reply 9.)  Defendants argue that the Court should borrow this
definition.
The Court disagrees.  The Court believes that Congress’s inclusion of this broader
definition under § 1595 evinces Congressional intent to depart from the normal meaning of the
term “criminal action.”   This addition to the text suggests that Congress knows the plain
meaning of the term “criminal action” and that Congress decided, under § 1595, that the
definition of “criminal action” should be broader.  In contrast, Congress could have made such an
addition to § 3509 had it intended the mandatory stay provision to apply to pre-indictment
investigations, but it did not.  In other words, by not broadening the definition of “criminal
action” § 3509, Congress intended that the term should only have its ordinary meaning: that an
indictment or information has been filed naming a specific defendant.  Instead, it seems clear that
Congress intended that these two statutory provisions should each have a different scope. 
Defendant’s argument of statutory construction fails.
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 7   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/06/2008   Page 3 of 5

The single case cited by Defendant in support of his motion is not on point.  In Doe 1 v.
Francis, No. 5:03CV260/MCR/WCS, 2005 WL 517847 (N.D. Fla. Feb. 10, 2005), the stay was
entered because criminal charges had been filed against the defendant in a state court several
months earlier (i.e., the defendants had been indicted by the state attorney).  See Memorandum in
Support of Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Outcome of Parallel Criminal Proceedings at 3,
Doe 1 v. Francis, No. 5:03CV260/MCR/WCS (N.D. Fla. Dec. 2, 2003).  The Court agrees with
Defendant that a stay under § 3509(k) is mandatory when a criminal action is pending; the Court
simply disagrees that the “deferred-prosecution agreement” constitutes a pending criminal action.
The Court also does not believe a discretionary stay is warranted.  Defendant did not seek
this relief in his motion; including such a request in the reply brief is inappropriate.  Further, the
Court sees no reason to delay this litigation for the next thirty-three months.  After all, Defendant
is in control of his own destiny – it is up to him (and him alone) whether the plea agreement
reached with the State of Florida is breached.  If Defendant does not breach the agreement, then
he should have no concerns regarding his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  The
fact that the U.S. Attorney (or other law enforcement officials) may object to some discovery in
these civil cases is not, in an of itself, a reason to stay the civil action.  Any such issues shall be
resolved as they arise in the course of this litigation.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:
1.  Defendant’s Motion to Stay is DENIED.  
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 7   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/06/2008   Page 4 of 5

2.  Defendant’s Motion for Hearing (DE 2) is DENIED AS MOOT.  
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 5   day of August, 2008.

DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S  
OPPOSED MOTION TO ALIGN RESPONSE DATE  
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein moves, pursuant to S.D. Fla. L.R. 7.1(A), to align 
the deadline for filing his response to the complaint with the deadlines set in Jane 
Doe Nos. 2 through 5 of September 4, 2008, and as grounds for this relief, 
respectfully states as follows: 
1. 
This matter was removed to Federal Court on July 21, 2008.  (DE 1).  
2. 
On July 25, 2008, Mr. Epstein filed a motion to stay this action.  (DE 
& 5). 
3. 
That same day, Mr. Epstein moved for an enlargement of time to 
answer or otherwise respond to the complaint until ten days after the motion for 
stay was decided.  (DE 3).

3059 GRAND AVENUE, SUITE 340, COCONUT GROVE, FLORIDA 33133 
4. 
On August 6, 2008, this Court denied the motion for stay. (DE 7).   
5. 
This Court has not yet ruled upon Mr. Epstein’s motion for an 
enlargement of time.   
6. 
In a series of substantially identical lawsuits brought against Mr. 
Epstein, however, this Court - - upon the denial of motions for stay filed in those 
cases - - granted Mr. Epstein an additional ten days to respond to the complaints 
nunc pro tunc.  Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80119-KAM (S.D. Fla.) 
(DE 33); Jane Doe No. 3 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80232-KAM (S.D. Fla.) (DE 29); 
Jane Doe No. 4 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80380-KAM (S.D. Fla.) (DE 39); and Jane 
Doe No. 5 v. Epstein, No. 08-80381-CV-KAM (S.D. Fla.) (DE 38).   
7. 
Since then, this Court (upon the parties’ stipulation) has extended the 
time to respond to each of the complaints in Jane Doe Nos. 2 through 5 until 
September 4, 2008.  Jane Doe No. 2 at DE 36; Jane Doe No. 3 at DE 31; Jane Doe 
No. 4 at DE 42; Jane Doe No. 5 at DE 40. 
8. 
Mr. Epstein respectfully requests an enlargement of time until 
September 4, 2008, coterminous with the deadlines set in Jane Doe Nos. 2 through 
5, to respond to the plaintiff’s complaint.    
9. 
An enlargement of time will promote judicial economy because it will 
allow Mr. Epstein to submit (and the plaintiff to respond to, and this Court to 
consider) his responses to the nearly identical complaints at one time.

Further, such an enlargement will not prejudice the plaintiff in any 
way given that defendants Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson have yet to be served in 
this action.   
WHEREFORE, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein respectfully requests an order 
aligning the deadline for filing his response to the complaint with the deadlines set

PLAINTIFF’S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO FILE 
CIVIL RICO CASE STATEMENT PURSUANT TO LOCAL RULE 12.1 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves, pursuant to Rule 7.1(A) of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, for an enlargement of time to file a Civil 
RICO Case Statement under Local Rule 12.1 until fifteen days after the Court rules on her 
motion to remand, which will be filed on or about August 18, 2008.   
1. Defendants removed this action to federal court on July 21, 2008.  (DE 1).   
2. Because Plaintiff has pleaded a cause of action under section 772.103, Florida 
Statutes, she is required to file a Civil RICO Case Statement within thirty days of 
removal.  See S.D. Fla. L.R. 12.1.   
3.  Plaintiff believes this action was improperly removed from state court and shall file 
a motion to remand on or about August 18, 2008.  It is Plaintiff’s contention that the 
Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because it does not involve a 
federal question or parties with complete diversity of citizenship. 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2008   Page 1 of 5

4. If this action was improperly removed, Plaintiff should not be required to expend the 
time and expense necessary to create and file a Civil Rico Cast Statement, which 
would not be required in Florida state court.   
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully request the Court grant her motion for an 
enlargement of time to file a Civil RICO Case Statement until fifteen days after the Court rules 
on her motion to remand.

by the court that designated th& person as a sexual predator, as a soxually viol.om predator, or 
by another sexual offimder designation fn the state or jurisdiction in which the order was 
issuw which status that such designation has been removed or demonstrates to the 
de,»srtm®t that such designation, if not imposed by a court, has boon removed by operation of 
law or court order in the state or jurisdiction in which the designation was mado, and providc>d 
such person no longer meats the criteria for registration as a sexual offonde,r under the laws of 
this state. 
(12) The Leaislature finds that sexual offenders, especially those who have committed offoosas 
against minors, often pose a high risk of ongaefne in sexual offooses own after beina retoasod 
from incarceration or commitment and that protection of the public from sexual offenders is a 
paritmount government interest. Sexual offenders haw a reduced expectation of privacy 
bec11r..e of the public's fnterost in public safety and in the offective operation of uuvernment. 
Releasing information concerning sexual offenders to law enforcemef!t aqencios and to persons 
who request such information, and the release of such information to tho public by a law 
enforcement agency or public agoncy, will further the governmental Interests of public safoty. 
The dosignation of a person as a sexual offender is not a sentence or a punishmoot but is simply 
the status of the offender which is the result of a conviction for having committod certain 
crimes. 
(13) Any person who has rea..c;on to belfove that a sexual offender is not complyinti, or has not 
complied, with the requirements of this s«tion and who, with the intent to assist the sexual 
offonder in etudine a law enforcement agency that is seeking to find the sexual offonder to 
question the sexual offender about, or to arrest the sexual offender for, his or her 
noncompliance with the requirements of this section: 
(a) Withholds information from, or does not notify, the law enforcement agency about th& 
sexual offender's noncompliance with the rnquiremonts of this section, and, if known, the 
whereabouts of the sexual offender; . 
(b) Harbors, or attempts to harbor, or as!.ists another person in harboring or attemptine to 
harbor, the sexual offender; or 
{c) Conceals or attempts to conceal, or assists another person in concealing or attempting to

(d) Provides information to the law enforcement agency regarding the soxual offender that tho 
person knows to be false information,

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.:  08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE, a/k/a, 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, 
Defendants. 
________________________________/ 
MOTION TO REMAND 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves the Court to remand this action to state court for lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction and states as follows: 
1. Although Plaintiff Jane Doe, a Florida citizen, sues Haley Robson, also a Florida 
citizen, in this action, Defendants removed the case to federal court on July 21, 
2008, citing diversity of citizenship as the basis for federal subject matter 
jurisdiction.   
2. Defendants claim that Haley Robson, who has described herself as Heidi Fleiss 
(the Hollywood madam),1 has “nothing to do with the plaintiff’s case against Mr. 
See New York Post, Oct. 1, 2007 (reporting “Some of the girls, legal documents indicate, 
were recruited by Haley Robson, now 21, who described herself as ‘like Heidi Fleiss,’ the 
notorious Hollywood madam.”); Palm Beach Post, Aug. 14, 2006 (reporting that 
Defendant “Robson told detectives, ‘I'm like a Heidi Fleiss.’”).  
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 1 of 11

Epstein,” (Notice of Removal, DE 1, p. 3) and that Plaintiff fraudulently joined 
her in this action to prevent complete diversity.2 
3.  As demonstrated in Plaintiff’s amended complaint, however, Defendant Robson 
was a vital part of the scheme to lure underage girls, including Plaintiff, to 
Epstein’s home in order to subject them to sexual abuse and induce them to 
engage in lewd behavior.  Defendant Robson was a key player in this scheme 
because she was paid by Epstein to recruit the underage girls and take them to 
Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion.  (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 11-15, DE 1, pp. 302-
04).  Without Defendant Robson, these girls, including Plaintiff, would not have 
been victimized.   
4. Because the allegations in Plaintiff’s amended complaint support the causes of 
action against Defendant Robson for civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of 
emotional distress, and civil RICO, Robson is a proper defendant in this action.   
5. As Robson is admittedly a citizen of Florida, (Affidavit of Haley Robson, DE 1, 
pp. 230-31) as is Plaintiff Jane Doe,3 (Amended Complaint ¶ 1, DE 1, pp. 301; 
Deposition of Jane Doe, DE 1, pp. 31-32, 5:14-18, 6:6-10) federal diversity 
jurisdiction does not exist in this case.  See 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(1) (providing that 
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff named Robson as a defendant to prevent entry of a 
stay in this matter pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k).  The Court has since denied 
Defendants’ motion, holding a stay of this proceeding is not warranted under either the 
statute or the Court’s discretion.  (Order Denying Motion to Stay, DE 7).   
Although Jane Does testified in deposition that she is a citizen of Florida, Defendants 
question whether she might actually be a citizen of Georgia because her mother lives in 
Georgia.  (Notice of Removal, DE 1, pp. 7-8, n.6).  Defendants fail to point out, however, 
that there is a question of whether Defendant Epstein is actually a citizen of Florida 
because he is now incarcerated in a Florida jail under an eighteen month sentence, to be 
followed by twelve months of community control, during which Epstein agreed he will 
be residing in Palm Beach, Florida.  (Epstein Sentence, attached).   
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 2 of 11

district courts have original jurisdiction over cases in which the matter in 
controversy exceeds $75,000 and is between “citizens of different States”).     
6. Defendants’ removal of this action was, therefore, improper.  Because the Court 
lacks diversity jurisdiction, or any other form of subject matter jurisdiction, over 
this matter, the Court must remand this action to Florida state court.   
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests the Court remand this action to state court and 
requests Defendants be ordered under 28 U.S.C. §1447(c) to pay costs and attorney fees 
incurred as a result of the removal. 
MEMORANDUM OF LEGAL AUTHORITY 
“An action in state court may be removed to federal court when the federal courts 
have diversity or federal question jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). When a 
defendant removes a case to federal court on diversity grounds, a court must remand the 
matter back to state court if any of the properly joined parties in interest are citizens of 
the state in which the suit was filed. See Lincoln Prop. Co. v. Roche, 546 U.S. 81, 126 
S.Ct. 606, 613, 163 L.Ed.2d 415 (2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1441(b)). Such a remand is 
the necessary corollary of a federal district court's diversity jurisdiction, which requires 
complete diversity of citizenship.”  Henderson v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., 454 F.3d 
1278, 1281 (11th Cir. 2006).   
Federal Courts are obligated to construe removal statutes very strictly, and “all 
doubts about jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of remand to state court.” Univ. of 
South Alabama v. American Tobacco Co., 168 F.3d 405, 411 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing 
Burns v. Windsor Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 1092, 1095 (11th Cir. 1994), and Coker v. Amoco Oil 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 3 of 11

Co., 709 F.2d 1433 (11th Cir. 1983)).  “A presumption in favor of remand is necessary 
because if a federal court reaches the merits of a pending motion in a removed case where 
subject matter jurisdiction may be lacking it deprives a state court of its right under the 
Constitution to resolve controversies in its own courts.”  American Tobacco Co., 168 
F.3d at 411.   
Defendants have removed this action even though Plaintiff named Haley Robson, 
a citizen of Florida, as a defendant because they claim Plaintiff’s joinder of Defendant 
Robson was done fraudulently in order to avoid federal jurisdiction.  “In a removal case 
alleging fraudulent joinder, the removing party has the burden of proving that either: (1) 
there is no possibility the plaintiff can establish a cause of action against the resident 
defendant; or (2) the plaintiff has fraudulently pled jurisdictional facts to bring the 
resident defendant into state court.”  Crowe v. Coleman, 113 F.3d 1536, 1538 (11th Cir. 
1989) (citing Cabalceta v. Standard Fruit Co., 883 F.2d 1553, 1561 (11th Cir. 1989)). 
“The burden of the removing party is a ‘heavy one.’”  Id. (quoting B., Inc. v. Miller 
Brewing Co., 663 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981)). 
“To determine whether the case should be remanded, the district court must 
evaluate the factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and must 
resolve any uncertainties about state substantive law in favor of the plaintiff.”  Id. (citing 
B., Inc., 663 F.2d at 549).  The Court may not “weigh the merits of a plaintiff's claim 
beyond determining whether it is an arguable one under state law.”  Id.  “‘If there is even 
a possibility that a state court would find that the complaint states a cause of action 
against any one of the resident defendants, the federal court must find that joinder was 
proper and remand the case to state court.’”  Id. (quoting Coker v. Amoco Oil Co., 709 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 4 of 11

F.2d 1433, 1440-41 (11th Cir. 1983)).  This protects a plaintiff’s right to select the forum 
of his lawsuit and the manner in which to prosecute the suit, and avoids exposing the 
plaintiff to the possibility of prosecuting the suit to conclusion only to learn the federal 
court lacked jurisdiction on removal.  Id. (citing Parks v. The New York Times Co., 308 
F.2d 474, 478 (5th Cir.1962); Cowart Iron Works, Inc. v. Phillips Constr. Co., Inc., 507 
F.Supp. 740, 744 (S.D. Ga. 1981)).        
Here, Defendants argue that removal is proper because Plaintiff cannot state a 
cause of action against Defendant Robson under Florida law.  Viewing the allegations of 
the amended complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, it is clear that there is at 
least a possibility that Plaintiff can recover against Defendant Robson under Florida law 
for each of the counts in the amended complaint—civil conspiracy, intentional infliction 
of emotional distress, and civil RICO.  Joinder of Defendant Robson in this action was 
therefore proper, which requires remand of this action to Florida state court.   
a. 
Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil conspiracy against 
Defendant Robson . 
“The elements of a civil conspiracy are: (a) a conspiracy between two or more 
parties, (b) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means, (c) the doing of 
some overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy, and (d) damage to plaintiff as a result of 
the acts performed pursuant to the conspiracy.”  Walters v. Blankenship, 931 So. 2d 137, 
140 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006) (citing Florida Fern Growers Ass'n, Inc. v. Concerned Citizens 
of Putnam County, 616 So. 2d 562 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993)).  As Defendants point out, there 
muse be an “actionable underlying tort or wrong” for an actionable conspiracy claim.  
Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 1165 (Fla. 5th DCA 1984).   
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 5 of 11

Plaintiff has grounded her conspiracy claim on the tort of sexual assault alleged in 
Count I of her amended complaint.  In this count, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Epstein 
tortiously assaulted her and states that the assault was committed in violation of Chapter 
800 of the Florida Statutes.  (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 17-18, DE 1, pp. 304-05).  Under 
Florida law, sexual assault is an intentional tort.  See Doe v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., 394 
F.3d 891, 917 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Florida law equates sexual battery with an intentional 
tort.”).  This is true regardless of whether Defendant Epstein’s violation of Chapter 800 
of the Florida Statutes also creates a private right of action, which is a matter of first 
impression in Florida.  Thus, Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil 
conspiracy against Defendant Robson.   
b. 
Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for intentional infliction of 
emotional distress against Defendant Robson. 
 “The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) 
The wrongdoer's conduct was intentional or reckless, that is, he intended his behavior 
when he knew or should have known that emotional distress would likely result; (2) the 
conduct was outrageous, that is, as to go beyond all bounds of decency, and to be 
regarded as odious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the conduct 
caused emotion[al] distress; and (4) the emotional distress was severe.”  Gallogly v. 
Rodriguez, 970 So. 2d 470, 471 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007) (citing LeGrande v. Emmanuel, 889 
So. 2d 991, 994-95 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004)).   
Here, Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant Robson used false pretenses to lure her 
(a 14-year old girl) to the mansion of Defendant Epstein and physically took her to 
Epstein so that he could subject her to sexual abuse and lewd behavior.  Defendant 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 6 of 11

Robson recruited Plaintiff, as she had done numerous others, under the belief that 
Plaintiff was economically disadvantaged and would be unlikely to contact authorities 
after being sexually assaulted and abused by Defendant Epstein.  Defendant Robson was 
paid by Defendant Epstein only after the sexual assault and abuse were completed.  And, 
Defendant Robson knew that Plaintiff would be severely emotionally traumatized after 
the abuse.  (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 9, 11, 15, 24-28, DE 1, pp. 302-03, 304, 306).  These 
allegations are enough to demonstrate Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendant Robson because they 
amount to conduct that would be viewed as outrageous by any reasonable person.        
Defendants argue that Plaintiff is barred from recovering for intentional infliction 
of emotional distress under Florida law because she went to Defendant Epstein’s home 
with the intent to give him a massage for monetary compensation when it is a crime (a 
misdemeanor), under section 480.047, Florida Statutes, to practice massage without a 
license.  They claim Plaintiff cannot “recover damages flowing from her own illegal 
conduct.”  (Notice of Removal, DE 1, p. 16).   
First, Plaintiff’s damages do not flow from her conduct in giving Defendant 
Epstein a massage without a license.  Defendants Epstein, Kellen, and Robson engaged in 
a scheme to lure underage girls to Epstein’s mansion in order for Epstein to sexually 
abuse them.  Plaintiff’s damages resulting from Defendants making her a victim to their 
intentional, outrageous, and criminal conduct in no way flow from her decision as a 14-
year old girl to make some extra money by giving a massage.   
Furthermore, it is not a universal rule in Florida that any Plaintiff engaged in any 
criminal action, no matter how trivial, is barred from recovering damages suffered in 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 7 of 11

connection with that conduct.  “The defense of in pari delicto is not woodenly applied in 
every case where illegality appears somewhere in the transaction; since the principle is 
founded on public policy, it may give way to a supervening public policy.”  Kulla v. E.F. 
Hutton & Co., Inc., 426 So. 2d 1055, 1057 n. 1 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).  “‘The fundamental 
purpose of the rule must always be kept in mind, and the realities of the situation must be 
considered. Where, by applying the rule, the public cannot be protected because the 
transaction has been completed, where no serious moral turpitude is involved, where the 
defendant is the one guilty of the greatest moral fault, and where to apply the rule will be 
to permit the defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff, the rule 
should not be applied.’”  Id.  (quoting Goldberg v. Sanglier, 96 Wash.2d 874, 639 P.2d 
1347, 1353-54 (1982)).  The fact that Florida law gives the trial court the discretion to 
apply the doctrine of in pari delicto, considering that all ambiguities must be resolved in 
favor of Plaintiff, does not take away from the fact that Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of 
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendant Robson.   
c. 
Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil RICO against Defendant 
Robson. 
Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not have a cognizable cause of action 
for civil RICO under section 772.104, Florida Statutes, because she was not directly 
injured by the Defendants’ scheme.  In Count IV of the amended complaint, Plaintiff 
alleges that Defendants engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in which Defendant 
Robson found and delivered underage girls to Defendant Epstein in order for Epstein to 
“solicit, induce, coerce, entice, compel or force such girls to engage in acts of prostitution 
and/or lewdness.”  (Amended Complaint ¶ 32, DE 1, p. 307).  She also alleges that she 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 11   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2008   Page 8 of 11

was a victim of Defendants’ scheme because she was one of the underage girls found and 
delivered to Defendant Epstein by Defendant Robson and that she endured Epstein’s 
actions as he tried to get her to engage in, and forced upon her, acts of prostitution and 
lewdness.  (Amended Complaint ¶ 33, DE 1, pp. 307-308).  Plaintiff, who was a victim of 
Defendants’ scheme, was directly harmed by the scheme and it is damages for this harm 
that she seeks in Count IV of the amended complaint.  Cf. Palmas Y Bambu, S.A. v. E.I. 
Dupont De Nemours & Co., Inc., 881 So. 2d 565, 570 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004) (holding 
plaintiff has standing to sue for civil RICO when her injuries flow directly from 
commission of the predicate acts, which means “when the alleged predicate act is mail or 
wire fraud, the plaintiff must have been a target of the scheme to defraud and must have 
relied to his detriment on misrepresentations made in furtherance of that scheme”).  
Because Plaintiff was a target of Defendants’ scheme and was harmed by their actions in 
carrying out the scheme, Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil RICO against 
Defendant Robson.      
CONCLUSION 
Plaintiff has cognizable causes of against Defendant Robson, a Florida citizen, for 
civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil RICO.  Because 
Plaintiff has a possibility of recovering against Defendant Robson under her amended 
complaint, Defendants have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that Robson was 
fraudulently joined in this action.  As the parties lack complete diversity of citizenship, 
the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this matter and should remand this case to 
Florida state court.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE, a/k/a, 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, • 
Defendants. 
PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE 
AND EXPEDITE. CERTAIN.DISCOVERY 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves, pursuant to Rules 26 an:d 34 to Preserve Evidence and Expedite 
the Discovery of this Evidence and states: 
1.. Defendants removed this action to federal court on July 21, 2008. (DE 1). 
2. 
Plaintiff has filed a motion to remand on August 18, 2008. (D.E. 11). 
3. It has come to the attention of Plaintiffs counsel that on July _21; 2008, Defendant 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN filed a Motion with the Florida State Court to return the 
evidence seized at his horne in conjunction with his criminal prosecutiofL (Ex. 1 ). 
4. 
This evidence is relevant and critical to the prosecution of not only the insta:ntclaim, 
but for six (6) other claims filed against Defendant EPSTEIN, including .but not 
limited to the Florida RICO claims filed in State Court 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully request the. Court grant her Motion to Preserve· of 
all of the seized Evidence identified in Ex. A, to Exhibit 1 of this Motion. (Palm Beach Police 
Department Property Receipt) should it be Returned to EPSTEIN by the State Court, and 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 12   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/21/2008   Page 2 of 5
expedite the duplication of this evidence immediately upon its return, in advance of any Rule 26 
conference. 
MEM0RANJ)UM0FLAW 
Pursuant to Rules 26, 30 and 34, of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this court has 
the authority to modify the normal time limitations under the Rules. See AT&T Mobility LLCv. 
Dynamic Cellular Corp., 2008 WL 2139518 (S.D. Fla. 2008); see also Trac/one Wireless, Inc. v. 
King Trading, Inc., 2008 WL 918243 (N.D. Tex. 2008). Additionally, when there is a good faith 
belief that evidence may be lost the Court has the authority to enter an Order preserving such 
evidence. Id at 1. An injunction is not required, nor ate the elements of an injunction necessary 
before entering an Order preserving such evidence. Id at 2. 
Given that Defendant EPSTEIN has plead guilty and is currently serving a year in jail 
based on the charges which form the fourrdation of Plaintiffs (and many other Plaintiffs') claims, 
it is reasonable to assume the State's seized evidence is extremely harmful to Defendant 
EPSTEIN. As a result, without a Protective Order Defendant EPSTEIN has no reasonto keep or 
maintain this negative evidence. 
Plaintiff has put Defendant EPSTEIN on notice that this 
evidence is relevant to the instant action and any destruction could potentially constitute 
spoliation. If this evidence were destroyed Plaintiff would be severely prejudiced. 
CERTIFICATE OF COMPL1ANCE WITH LOCAL RlJLE 7.LA.3 
On August 21,·2008; undersigned counsel conferred with counsel for the Defendants in a 
good faith effort to resolve the issues raised in this motion, and Defendants' counsel advised that 
Defendants oppose this motion.

vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY ROBSON,

Defendants. 
_________________________________/ 
EPSTEIN’S RESPONSE TO 
MOTION TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE [DE 12] 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein hereby responds to the plaintiff Jane Doe’s motion to preserve 
evidence, as follows:   
1. 
The Certificate of Compliance annexed to the plaintiff’s motion states that 
plaintiff’s “counsel conferred with counsel for [Mr. Epstein] . . . and [Epstein’s] counsel advised 
that [Epstein] oppose[s] this motion.”  DE 12 at 2 (emphasis added).  That certification is 
inaccurate.   
2. 
On August 21, 2008, counsel for the plaintiff called Kathryn Meyers, Esq. of the 
Lewis Tein law firm to elicit Epstein’s position on this motion.  Ms. Meyers responded that she 
would confer with Mr. Tein and call them back.  Less than thirty minutes later, however, 
plaintiff’s counsel - - without waiting to hear back from us - - electronically filed the motion, 
incorrectly certifying that we had actually opposed it.   
3. 
Upon receipt of the motion via CM/ECF, Ms. Meyers immediately notified 
plaintiff’s counsel of their error.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not notify the court of the incorrect 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/22/2008   Page 1 of 4

certification, leaving the Court with the impression that Epstein opposed the motion and perhaps 
prompting the Court to order an expedited response. 
4. 
In fact, Epstein has no opposition to the relief requested.   
5. 
It is worth noting that the motion for return of property filed in the State criminal 
matter has not been noticed for a hearing, has not been argued or ruled upon, and no property has 
been returned.    
Respectfully submitted,

---------'----------' 
PLAINTIFF'S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO FILE 
CIVIL RICO CASE STATEMENT PURSUANT TO LOCAL RULE 12.1 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves, pursuant to Rule 7.l(A) of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, for an enlargement of time to file a Civil 
RICO Case Statement under Local Rule 12. I until fifteen days after the Court rules on her 
motion to remand, which will be filed on or about August 18, 2008. 
l. Defendants removed this action to federal court on July 21, 2008. (DE l ). 
2. Because Plaintiff has pleaded a cause of action under section 772.103, Florida 
Statutes, she is reqiiired to file a Civil RICO Case Statement within thirty days of 
removal. See S.D. Fla. L.R. 12.1. 
3. 
Plaintiff believes this action was improperly removed from state court and shall file 
a motion to remand on or about August 18, 2008. It is Plaintiff's contention that the 
Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because it does not involve a 
federal question or. parties with complete diversity of citizenship. 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 16-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/29/2008   Page 4 of 6
4. lfth:s action was improperly removed, Plaintiff should not be required to expend the 
time and expense necessary to create and file a Civil Rico Cast Statement, which 
would not be required in Florida state court. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully request the Court grant her motion for an 
enlargement of time to file a Civil RICO Case Statement until fifteen days after the Comt rules

not communicate to opposing counsel regarding whether said Motion would be

Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully move for a 
mandatory stay of this action under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k), 
Section 1595(b )(1 ), and alternatively, under this Court's discretionary authority to 
stay civil litigation, based on the existence of a pending federal criminal action. 
Introduction 
This lawsuit arises from a pending federal criminal action concernmg, 
among other things, an alleged assault of the plaintiff. According to her complaint, 
the plaintiff, while a minor, was "recruited . . . to give Epstein a massage for 
monetary compensation," and was "paid ... $300." Am. Compl., ,, 13-15. 1 A 
federal statute directly on point provides that when a civil suit alleging damages to 
a minor victim arises out of the same occurrence as a "criminal action," the civil 
suit "shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 
Jane Doe, a/k/a Jane Doe No. I, is the same plaintiff who previously filed an original civil 
action in this Court, grounded upon diversity jurisdiction, through her father, based on the same 
allegations in this complaint. See Jane Doe No. 1, et al. v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 08-80069-
CIV-MARRA (WPB) (S.D. Fla., filed 1/24/08). Shortly after that lawsuit was filed by her 
father, her mother moved for leave to intervene and to stay, alleging that her father's attorney 
had filed the lawsuit without her consent. Id. at DE 4 (1/29/08) (motion to stay), ,r 4 ("Jane 
Doe's Father filed this lawsuit against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein without the knowledge, 
consultation or consent of Jane Doe No. I."). On February 20, Jane Doe No. I was deposed in 
State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, 50 2006 CF009454A XXXMB (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct.), the 
parallel state-court criminal action (referred to infra at 2, as the "Florida Criminal Action'). 
During that deposition, the plaintiff made numerous admissions that completely undermined the 
allegations against Epstein that she had pied in her complaint. Two days later, her lawyer filed a 
notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice in this Court. See Doe No. 1 v. Epstein, Case No. 
08-CV-80069-KAM (DE 9). Less than three weeks later, on March 6, the plaintiff re-filed the 
instant lawsuit in Florida state court.

3509(k) (emphasis added).2 Accordingly, a stay of this case is mandatory until the 
criminal action arising from the same allegations is no longer pending. 
The Pending Federal Criminal Action 
In 2006, a Florida state grand jury indicted Jeffrey Epstein on allegations 
similar to those in the instant action (State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 
2006 CF 09454A, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County) (the "Florida 
Criminal Action"). Shortly thereafter, the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (the "USAO") began a federal grand-jury investigation 
into allegations arising out of the same incidents alleged in the instant action ( Grand 
Jury No. 07-103 (WPB), United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida) ("the Federal Criminal Action"). 
In September 2007, the USAO and Mr. Epstein entered into a highly unusual 
and unprecedented deferred-prosecution agreement (the "Agreement"), in which the 
USAO agreed to defer (not dismiss or close) the Federal Criminal Action on the 
condition that Mr. Epstein continue to comply with numerous obligations, the first of 
The full text of the mandatory-stay provision reads: 
If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for damage or 
injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is pending which arises out 
of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim, the civil action shall 
be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action and any mention of the 
civil action during the criminal proceeding is prohibited. As used in this 
subsection, a criminal action is pending until its final adjudication in the trial 
court. 
U.S.C. § 3509(k).

which was pleading guilty to certain state charges in the Florida Criminal Action. 
The Agreement itself uses the term "deferred'' (rather than "dismissed" or "closed") 
to describe the status of the Federal Criminal Action: 
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prosecution in this 
District, for these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by 
the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following 
conditions and the requirements of this Agreement .... 
Agreement, at 2. 
By no stretch did the USAO finalize, close, complete, dismiss or abandon 
the Federal Criminal Action. 
Indeed, as the lead federal prosecutor recently 
explained, the USAO merely "agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of 
prosecution by the State of Florida ... " 
See In re: Jane Doe, Case No. 08-
80736-CIV-Marra/Johnson (S.D. Fla.) (DE 14), Deel. of AUSA Villafana, 
/09/08, , 5, attached hereto as Exhibit "A" ( emphasis added). 
Under the 
Agreement, the USAO presently retains the continuing right to indict Mr. Epstein -
~ or to unseal "any" already-existing federal "charges" that may already have been 
handed up by the federal grand jury and sealed - - should he breach any of its 
provisions. Agreement, at 2. 
The period of the deferral continues until three months after Mr. Epstein 
completes service of his sentence in the Florida Criminal Action. Id. Indeed, the

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 5 of 45
final three months of the Agreement's term constitute an extended period during 
which the USAO expressly retains the ability to evaluate whether Epstein 
committed any breaches of his numerous obligations under the agreement while he 
was serving his state sentence, and, if it so determines, reserves the right to indict 
( or unseal an existing indictment against) Mr. Epstein - - even after he has 
completed serving his entire state sentence. 
The Agreement further provides that upon Epstein's execution of a plea 
agreement in the State Criminal Case, the Federal Criminal Action "will be 
suspended" and all pending grand-jury subpoenas "will he held in abeyance unless 
and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement." Agreement, at 5 
( emphasis added). The Agreement directs the USAO and Epstein to "maintain 
their evidence, specifically evidence requested by or directly related to the grand 
jury subpoenas that have been issued," and to maintain such evidence "inviolate." 
Id. 
( emphasis added). It also expressly provides that the grand-jury subpoenas 
continue to remain "outstanding" until "the successful completion of the terms of 
this agreement." Id. ( emphasis added). 
Further, it includes a promise not to prosecute movant/defendant Sarah 
Kellen, only if "Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of th[ e] 
agreement." Id.

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 6 of 45
Finally, the Agreement provides that the USAO's declination of prosecution 
for certain enumerated offenses and dismissal of any existing (sealed) charges will 
not occur until 90 days following the completion of his state sentence: 
If the United States Attorney should determine, based on 
reliable evidence, that, during the period of the Agreement, Epstein 
willfully violated any of the conditions of this Agreement, then the 
United States Attorney may, within ninety (90) days following the 
expiration of the term of home confinement discussed below, provide 
Epstein with timely notice specifying the condition(s) of the 
Agreement that he has violated, and shall initiate its prosecution on 
any offense within sixty (60) days' of [sic] giving notice of the 
violation. Any notice provided to Epstein pursuant to this paragraph 
shall be provided within 60 days of the United States learning of facts 
which may provide a basis for a determination of a breach of the 
Agreement. 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of 
this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of 
the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the 
United States Attorney's Office, nor any offenses that arose from the 
Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District, and 
the charges against Epstein, if any, will be dismissed. 
Agreement, at 2. 
Consistent with the Agreement and its position that the Federal Criminal

Discussion 
I. 
Section 3509(k) Imposes a Mandatory Stay. 
The language of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k) is clear and 
mandatory: a parallel "civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the 
criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added). The word "shalf' means 
that the statute's command is mandatory and not subject to a Court's discretion. 
See, e.g., Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230, 241 (2001) (noting Congress' "use of a 
mandatory 'shall' to impose discretionless obligations") ( emphasis added); 
Lexecon Inc. v. Mi/berg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998) 
(explaining that "the mandatory 'shall' ... normally creates an obligation 
impervious to judicial discretion") (emphasis added). Cf Miller v. French, 530 
U.S. 327, 350 (2000) (construing the litigation-stay provision of the Prison 
Litigation Reform Act, holding, "Through the PLRA, Congress clearly intended to 
make operation of the automatic stay mandatory, precluding courts from

exercising their equitable powers to enjoin the stay. And we conclude that this 
provision does not violate separation of powers principles.") ( emphasis added). 
One District Court within the Eleventh Circuit recently construed "the plain 
language of§ 3509(k)" as "requirfingj a stay in a case ... where ... a parallel 
criminal action [is] pending." Doe v. Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 950623, 
at *2 (N.D. Fla. Apr. 20, 2005) (Francis II) ( emphasis added). Accord Doe v. 
Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 517847, at *1-2 (N.D. Fla. Feb. 10, 2005) 
(Francis I) (staying federal civil action in favor of "a criminal case currently 
pending in state court in Bay County, Florida, arising from the same facts and 
involving the same parties as the Instant action," noting that "the language of 18 
U.S.C. § 3509(k) is clear that a stay is required in a case such as this where a 
parallel criminal action is pending which arises from the same occurrence 
involving minor victims") ( emphasis added). There is no contrary opinion from 
any court. 
In determining that the federal stay provision is mandatory, the Francis II 
court expressed that there was apparently no case law supporting, or even 
"discussing the [avoidance] of a stay [under the command of] § 3509(k)." Francis 
II, 2005 WL 950623, at *2. Deferring to the statute as written, the Francis II court 
rejected the plaintiffs' argument that some of the alleged victims had already 
reached their majority.

The court similarly rejected the plaintiffs'

argument that it would be in the victims' best interests to avoid a stay so as to 
counteract the victims' "ongoing and increasing mental harm due to the 'frustrating 
delay in both the criminal case and [the civil] case."' Id. 
II. 
Section 3509(k) Applies to Investigations, Not Just Indictments. 
While there is no unsealed indicted criminal case against Mr. Epstein, the 
government's criminal investigation against him remains open. Section 3509(k) 
clearly applies to stay civil cases during the pendency, not only of indicted 
criminal cases, but also of pre-indictment criminal investigations. 
The term "criminal action" is not expressly defined in § 3509(k). It is 
defined, however, by a closely related statute. Title 18, U.S.C. § 1595 provides a 
civil remedy for "forced labor" and "sex trafficking" violations, but stays such 
actions "during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same 
occurrence in which the claimant is the victim."3 In enacting § 1595, Congress 
The full text of that statute provides: 
§ 1595. Civil remedy 
(a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of section 1589, 
1590, or 1591 of this chapter may bring a civil action against 
the perpetrator in an appropriate district court of the United 
States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys 
fees. 
(b) 
(1) 
Any civil action filed under this section shall be 
stayed during the pendency of any criminal action 
arising out of the same occurrence in which the 
claimant is the victim.

specifically intended that the term "criminal action" would be applied extremely 
broadly. Accordingly, Congress took pains to ensure that courts would give it the 
broadest possible construction and, for that reason, specified in the definition 
provision that "criminal action" also "includes investigation." 
u.s.c. 
§ 1595(b )(2 ). The only reported decision addressing this provision interpreted it 
according to its plain language. See Ara v. Khan, No. CV 07-1251, 2007 WL 
1726456, *2 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 2007) (ordering "all proceedings in this case 
stayed pending the conclusion of the government's criminal investigation of the 
defendants and of any resulting criminal prosecution") ( emphasis added). 
Given that the USAO's Agreement with Epstein indicates that: 
• 
the grand-jury's subpoenas remain "outstanding" (Agreement, at 5); 
• 
the subpoenas are "h[ e ]ld ... in abeyance" (id.); 
• 
the subpoenas are not "withdrawn" (id.); 
• 
the parties must "maintain their evidence" (id.) ( which would be 
entirely unnecessary if the investigation against Epstein were closed); 
U.S.C. § 1595. 
(2) 
In this subsection, a "criminal action" includes 
investigation and prosecution and is pending until 
final adjudication in the trial court. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit routinely relies on Black's Law 
Dictionary for the definition of statutory terms, including in criminal cases. See e.g., United 
States v. Young, 528 F .3d 1294, 1297 n.3 ( 11th Cir. 2008) ( definitions of criminal "complaint" 
and "indictment"); United States v. Brown, 526 F.3d 691, 705 (11th Cir. 2008) (definition of 
"knowingly" in criminal statute).

• 
"any" existing "charges" will not "be dismissed" until after Epstein 
has "timely fulfill[ ed] all the terms and conditions of the Agreement" 
(id. at 2); and 
• 
"prosecution in this District ... shall be deferred" (id.) (but not closed 
or dismissed) - -
then the only reasonable conclusion is that the Federal Criminal Action remains 
"pending." 
The ordinary meaning of the adjective "pending" is "[r]emaining undecided; 
awaiting decision .... " Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004). 4 See also 
White v. Klitzkie, 281 F .3d 920, 928 (9th Cir. 2002) (relying on Black's Law 
Dictionary, in the context of a criminal case, for the definition of "pending" as 
"awaiting decision"); Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 421 (3d Cir. 2000) (relying 
on Black's Law Dictionary for the definition of "pending," expressly because 
"'pending' is not defined in the statute"). Any common-sense reading of the 
Agreement and the USAO's recent sworn construction of it, is consonant with the 
Federal Criminal Action's "remaining undecided" and "awaiting decision." See 
Unified Gov 't of Athens-Clarke County v. Athens Newspapers, LLC, No. 
S07G 1133, _S.E.2d _, 2008 WL 2579238, *3 (Ga. June 30, 2008) (reviewing a

not yet resulted in a prosecution logically "remains undecided," and is therefore 
"pending," until it "is concluded and the file closed'') ( emphasis added). 
III. 
Section 3509(k) Applies Even After a Plaintiff Turns 18. 
The parallel stay provision in § 1595, discussed supra at 8-9, mandates, 
without exception, that any civil action brought under that section for violation of 
§ 1591 (prohibiting transportation of minors for prostitution) "shall be stayed 
during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in 
which the claimant is the victim." 18 U.S.C. § 159l(b)(l). Whether the§ 1595 
plaintiff has turned 18 does not vitiate the efficacy of this mandatory stay. 
An example illustrates why the stay provided in § 3509(k) has the same 
broad scope as the stay provided in § 15 91 (b )(1 ). As discussed above, § 3 5 09(k) 
stays any civil suit for injury to a minor, arising out of the same occurrence as a 
pending criminal action. One type of civil suit falling within § 3509(k)'s ambit is a 
suit seeking redress for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Section 2423(a) - - just 
like § 1591 - - prohibits transportation of minors for prostitution. The elements of 
both statutes are identical. There would simply be no legitimate basis for Congress 
to differentiate between the consequences attached to violating these two sections. 
Thus, just as Congress mandated under § 1595(b )(1) that civil discovery shall be 
stayed when there is an ongoing federal investigation under § 15 91 ( even after the

\ I J, 'II ',.I~, \ I I \\\

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 13 of 45
victim turns 18), the identical treatment should· apply under § 3509(k) to civil 
actions brought for the identical violation of§ 2423(a). 
Logic compels a rule requiring continued application of the§ 3509(k) stay to 
a putative victim who has since turned 18. 
Consider again the example of 
§ 2243(a). Assume that the USAO is investigating a § 2243(a) violator with two 
alleged victims; one who is now 17, and one who has turned 19. Assume further 
that both decide to sue the alleged offender while the USAO is still in the process 
of conducting its criminal investigation. 
Why would Congress prohibit the 
defendant from conducting civil discovery in the 17-year-old's lawsuit, but permit 
him to conduct full discovery in the 19-year-old's lawsuit, including taking the 
depositions of both the 19- and the 17-year-old, the federal investigating agents 
and all the grand-jury witnesses? This could not have been Congress' intent. 
The legislative history to a statute resembling § 1595 is also instructive. 
When Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. § 2255, it provided a civil remedy to any 
"minor ... victim" of enumerated federal sex offenses. See Child Abuse Victims' 
Rights Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-500, 100 Stat. 1783, § 703 (1986). In 2006, 
Congress amended the statute to clarify that the civil cause of action was available 
not just while the victim was a minor, but even after she or he turned 18. See Pub. 
L. 109-248, 120 Stat. 650, § 707 (b)(l)(A) (amending § 2255 to permit suit by 
adults who were victims of enumerated federal offenses when they were minors,

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 14 of 45
by deleting "Any minor who is [ a victim]" and adding "Any person, who, while a 
minor, was [a victim]"). 
Meanwhile, the stay provisions of§ 3509(k) remained 
unchanged. There is no reason to think that Congress would afford prosecutors 
protection for their investigations while the victims were minors, but completely 
eliminate those protections the moment one of the victims turned 18. 
The District Court for the Northern District of Florida confirmed this 
position, and specifically rejected the plaintiffs' contrary argument. See Francis II, 
2005 WL 950623, at *2. The plaintiffs there argued that "the stay should be lifted 
due to the fact that the minor Plaintiffs have now reached the age of majority 
during the pendency of the state criminal case." 
Id. 
The court found this 
argument "unavailing ... given the victims' minor status at the time of the events 
giving rise to the underlying claims." Id. The court specifically held that "because 
the victims were minors at the time of the Defendants' actions alleged in both 
[the civil and criminal] cases, § 3509(k) applies." Id. ( emphasis added). 
The United States Department of Justice has itself emphatically embraced 
the interpretation of§ 3509(k) as applying to stay all civil actions relating to sex 
offenses against minors, pending the completion of a parallel criminal action, 
without regard to whether the plaintiff has turned 18 during her civil lawsuit: 
The subsection should stay all pending civil actions in the wake of a 
criminal prosecution. Notably, in the context of 18 USC § 2255 ("civil 
remedy for personal injuries"), all civil actions are stayed pending the 
Lewis Teinl'i.

completion of a criminal action. See also 18 USC § 3509(k). 
H.R. Rep. 108-264(11), 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003), reprinted at 2003 WL 
22272907, at * 16-17 ("agency view" by the Department of Justice on bill later 
codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595). 
The Department specifically argued to Congress in the clearest terms: "We 
believe that prosecutions should take priority over civil redress and that 
prosecutions should be complete prior to going forward with civil suits." Id. at 17 
( emphasis added). Nowhere did the Department suggest that pending prosecutions 
warrant less protection (i.e., should be "hinder[ ed]") simply because a particular 
civil plaintiff happens to reach his or her 18th birthday. 
Finally, it would be incongruous for the plaintiff to claim that § 3509(k) is 
no longer applicable to her because she is no longer a minor, but, at the very same 
time, claim that she is entitled to file this lawsuit under a fictitious name "to protect 
her identity because the Complaint makes sensitive allegations of sexual assault 
and abuse that she suffered while a minor." Am. Comp!., ,12 ( emphasis added). 
IV. 
A Stay is Mandatory Despite Resulting "Delay" to Civil Lawsuits. 
Inherent in any § 3509(k) stay is delay to the progress ( discovery, trial, 
appeal) of all related civil lawsuits. Congress recognized this in enacting the stay 
provision, which necessarily prioritized the interests of completing a criminal 
investigation and prosecution over the interests of a particular plaintiff in seeking

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 16 of 45
personal pecuniary damages. 
Based on this reasoning, the Francis II court 
specifically refused to provide any relief to plaintiffs "simply because the state 
[ criminal] matter is not progressing as fast as they would hope." The court made 
this determination despite the plaintiffs' complaints about the "frustrating delay" 
and that "the state criminal case 'has languished for almost two years with no end 
in sight,"' finding that this "is a matter to be addressed in state [ criminal] court." 
Id Accordingly, the anticipated delay in this case, attendant to the term of the 
deferred-prosecution agreement, does not change the clear command of§ 3509(k). 
According to her own pleadings, the plaintiff waited three years before filing 
this lawsuit, Am. Comp!. ,-i 9, and so cannot rightfully claim prejudice from 
additional temporary delay. 
V. 
Section 3509 Aside, a Discretionary Stay is Warranted. 
Even, arguendo, were this Court not to apply the mandate of § 3509, a 
discretionary stay should still be entered during the pendency of the Federal 
Criminal Action. SEC v. Healthsouth Corp., 261 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1326 (N.D. 
Ala. 2003) ("No question exists that this court has the power to stay a civil 
proceeding due to an active, parallel criminal investigation."). 
Other federal 
statutes support such a stay -- particularly when the criminal action may be 
adversely affected by the civil litigation. 
For example, under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2 712( e )(1 ), "the court shall stay any action commenced [ against the United 
Lewis Tein 1'1. 
\ll,'P'-1),\11\\\

States] if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability 
of the Government to conduct a related investigation or prosecution of a related 
criminal case." Allowing this lawsuit to progress while Epstein remains subject to 
the Federal Criminal Action will prejudice him irrevocably and irreparably. As 
provided below, there are several adverse effects to allowing this case to proceed 
while the Federal Criminal Action remains pending. 
In this lawsuit, Epstein has a right to defend himself. 
In the Federal 
Criminal Action, Epstein has a right against self-incrimination. Hoffman v. United 
States, 341 U.S. 479,486 (1951) (holding that the privilege applies in "instances 
where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger" of criminal 
liability"). Without a stay, Epstein will be immediately forced to abandon one of 
these rights. 
Should he choose his Fifth Amendment rights, he will expose himself to an 
adverse inference at the summary-judgment stage and at trial. 
See generally, 
Wehling v. Columbia Broad. Sys, 611 F.2d 1026, 1027 (5th Cir. 1980) (observing 
that "invocation of the privilege would be subject to the drawing of an adverse 
inference by the trier of fact"). On the other hand, should Epstein choose his right 
to defend himself in this lawsuit, the USAO will be able to use his responses at 
every stage of the discovery and trial process (e.g., his Answer, responses to 
document requests, responses to requests for admissions, sworn answers to 
LewisTein,·1. 
3059 GRAND AVENUE, SUITE 340, COCONUT GROVE, FLORIDA 33133 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 18 of 45
interrogatories, answers to deposition questions, and trial testimony) to his 
detriment in the Federal Criminal Action. 
In this lawsuit, even before civil discovery begins, under the Initial 
Disclosures required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and S.D. Fla. Local Rule 26.1, Epstein 
"must" disclose the identities of all the witnesses he would call in his defense to 
the Federal Criminal Action (Rule 26(a)(l )(A)(i)), copies of "all documents" he 
"may use to support [his] defenses" (Rule 26(a)(l )(A)(ii)), as well as the identity 
of "any" expert witness he "may use at trial," along with mandatory disclosure of 
"a written report" containing "a complete statement of all opinions the [ expert] will 
express and the basis and reasons for them" (Rule 26(a)(2)(A) and (B)(i)). 
In contrast, in the pending Federal Criminal Action, which is governed 
exclusively by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the USAO would not be 
entitled to compel pre-trial production of any of this information. See Fed. R. Cr. 
P. 16(b)(l)(A), (C), and 16(b)(2); United States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 
1355-56 (11th Cir. 1991) ( explaining act-of-production privilege). 
This could give the USAO a tremendous advantage in prosecuting Epstein in the Federal 
Criminal Action. See Comment, Using Equitable Powers to Coordinate Parallel Civil and 
Criminal Actions, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1023, 1030 (1985) (observing that "the prosecutor may have 
access to detailed civil depositions of the accused's witnesses, while the rules of criminal 
procedure bar the accused from deposing the prosecutor's witnesses").

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 18   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/03/2008   Page 19 of 45
Thus, absent a stay of this civil action, the USAO would receive 
fundamentally unfair access to defense information and highly prejudicial advance 
insight into criminal defense strategy. See Comment, 98 Harv. L. Rev. at 1030 
("To the extent that a prosecutor acquires evidence that was elicited from the 
accused in a parallel civil proceeding, the criminal process becomes less 
adversarial."). 
Without a stay m place, discovery will proceed, including against third 
parties. 
Mr. Epstein will have no alternative but to issue subpoenas seeking 
evidence from state and federal law-enforcement officers. For example, Epstein is 
clearly entitled to discover evidence of prior statements (including inconsistent 
statements) given by witnesses whom law-enforcement has previously interviewed. 
See, e.g., Cox v. Treadway, 75 F.3d 230 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding that district court 
properly admitted testimony of prosecutor about prior inconsistent statements that 
witness made to the prosecutor). Likewise, Epstein may be entitled to discovery of 
relevant evidence that is in the present possession of the grand jury or other law-
enforcement agencies. See, e.g., Simpson v. Hines, 729 F. Supp. 526, 527 (E.D. 
Tex. 1989) ("The grand jury has concluded its deliberations .... The need for 
secrecy of these specific tapes no longer outweighs other concerns."); Golden 
Quality Ice Cream Co., Inc. v. Deerfield Specialty Papers, Inc., 87 F.R.D. 53, 59 
(E.D. Pa. 1980) ("[W]here, as here, the grand jury has completed its work and all

that is sought are those documents turned over to the grand jury by the 
corporations which are defendants in the civil case, the considerations . 
militating against disclosure are beside the point.") ( citing Douglas Oil Co. of 
Calif v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211 (1979)). 
In response to such third-party subpoenas to law-enforcement witnesses, we 
anticipate that it will be the government, not Mr. Epstein, who will object to 
discovery m this civil case, until the final conclusion of the Federal Criminal 
Action.

S.D. OF FLA .• W.P.a: 
TO VICTIM'S EMERGENCY PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT 
OF CRIME VICTIM RIGHTS ACT, 18 U.S.C. § 3771 
I. 
I, A. Marie Villafana, do hereby declare that I am a member in good standing 
of the Bar of the State of Florida. I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley 
School of Law (Boalt Hall) in 1993. After serving as a judicial clerk to the Hon. David F. 
Levi in Sacramento, California, I was admitted to practice in California in 1995. I also am 
admitted to practice in all courts of the states of Minnesota and Florida, the Eig~th, Eleventh, 
and Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District 
of Florida, the District of Minnesota, and the Northern District of California. My bar 
admission status in California and Minnesota is currently inactive. I am currently employed 
as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida and was so 
employed during all of the events described herein.

2. 
I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). 
The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police 
Department ("PBPD") into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had 
used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and 
seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses. 
3. 
Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification 
letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness 
Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three 
clients, T.M., C.W., and S.R. 1 Your Affiant's letter to C.W. was provided by the FBI. (Ex. 
). Your Affiant's letter to T.M. was hand-delivered by myself to T.M. at the time that she 
,..-as interviewed (Ex. 2).2 Both C.W. and T.M. also received letters from the FBI's Victim-
Witness Specialist, which were sent on January I 0, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4 ). S.R. was identified 
via the FBI's investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to speak with investigators. 
S.R.'s status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by 
1Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of "Jane Doe," without identifying which of 
his clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to C. W., T.M., and S .R. 
All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when 
they were fifteen years old. 
2Please nott: that the dates on the U.S. Attorney's Office letters to C. W. and T.M. are not the 
dates that the letteni were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in the 
investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.

federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to S.R. 
on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5). 
4. 
Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBI's Victim-Witness 
Specialist, and your Affiant had contact with C. W. and S.R. Attorney Edwards' other client, 
T.M., was represented by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with T.M. was made through 
that attorney. That attorney was James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, 
the target of the investigation. 3 
5. 
In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida ("the Office") entered into negotiations to resolve the 
investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with 
solicitation of prostitution, in violation ofFlorida Statutes§ 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys 
sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer 
federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic 
preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a 
federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one 
condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is 
the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same 
rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein 
3The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing T.M. or whether 
TM. ever fonnally terminated Mr. Eisenberg's representation.

had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes 
of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein•~ 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an 
Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
which eviclentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is 
the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position 
as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no 
less." 
6. 
An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an 
express confidentiality provision. 
7. 
Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, 
several had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they 
desired a prompl resolution of the matter. 
At the time the agreement was signed in 
September2007, T.M. was openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted 
to interview S.R. in October 2007, at which time she refused to provide any information 
regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be 
consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation. 
8. 
As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution 
to the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, 
shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions 
were discussed. One of those victims was C. W. who at the time was not represented, and she 
was given notice of the agreement. Notice was also provided ofan expected change of plea 
in October 2007. When Epstein's attorneys learned that some of the victims had been

notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their 
involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your Affiant 
knew that the victims' statements had been taken and corroborated with independent 
evidence well before they were informed of the potential for damages, the agents and I 
concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the witnesses' credibility at 
trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement. 
9. 
After C.W. had been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein 
performed his obligations, C.W. contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was attempting 
to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro 
bono counsel to represent C.W. and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was 
able to assist C.W. in avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bono counsel did not 
express to your Affiant that C. W. was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter. 
I 0. 
In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to inform me that 
he represented C.W. and S.R. and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding 
Epstein. I invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to 
consider. Nothing was provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider 
contacting the State Attorney's Office, ifhe so wished. I understand that no contact with that 
office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to T.M., so I advised him that, to my 
knowledge, T.M. was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg.

11. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a 
copy of the proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 
a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. 
Your Affiant and the Palm Beach Police Department 
attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that Epstein· s counsel had given 
us. Although all known victims were not notified, your Affiant specifically called attorney 
Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. Your Affiant believes that 
it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards notified me that he represented T.M., 
and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney Edwards informed 
your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Your 
Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards' clients was present. 
12. 
On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to 
C. W. and S.R. via their attorney, Bradley Edwards (Exs. 6 & 7). A notification was not 
provided to T.M. because the U.S. Attorney's modification limited Epstein's liability to 
victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an indictment. In light ofT.M. 's 
prior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not in good faith include T.M. as a 
victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to 
Epstein's counsel. 
13. 
Furthermore, with respect to the Certification ofEmergency, Attorney Edwards 
did not ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he 
requests in his Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had

already received the Certification of Emergency and Emergency Petition, I received a letter 
from Attorney Edwards that had been sent, via Certified Mail, on July 3, 2008. While that 
letter urges the Attorney General and the United States Attorney to consider "vigorous 
enforcement" of federal laws with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, it contains no demand for 1he 
.relief requested in the Emergency Petition.

foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

JANE DOE NO. 1, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, 
Defendants. 
I 
MOTION TO DISMISS 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure and Rule 7.l(A) of the Local Rules for the Southern District of 
Florida, moves to dismiss Counts I, II and IV of plaintiffs amended complaint1 
against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, and states as follows: 
The time to answer the remaining allegations of the amended complaint is tolled pending the 
Court's ruling on the present motion. See Beaulieu v. Ed. of Trustees of Univ. of W Fla., No. 
3:07cv30/RV/EMT, 2007 WL 2020161, * 2 (N.D. Fla. July 9, 2007) (holding that defendant's 
partial motion to dismiss "automatically extends its time to answer ... until after the court has 
ruled on [its] motion to dismiss"); Finnegan v. Univ. of Rochester Med. Ctr., 180 F.R.D. 247, 
249 (W.D.N.Y. 1998) (concluding "that the filing of a motion that only addresses part of a 
complaint suspends the time to respond to the entire complaint, not just to the claims that are the 
subject of the motion"); Schwartz v. Berry College, Inc., No. Civ.A. 4:96CV338-HLM, 1997 WL 
579166, *l (N.D. Ga. July 3, 1997) (noting that there is significant case law to support the 
position that "when a defendant files a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss, addressing only some of

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
ALLEGATIONS IN PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT 
This action arises out of the alleged assault of the plaintiff. According to the 
allegations in her amended complaint, the plaintiff went to Mr. Epstein's house to 
give him "a massage for monetary compensation" (Am. Compl. ,r 13), where Mr. 
Epstein allegedly assaulted her "in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida 
Statutes."2 (Am. Compl. ,r 18). To sharpen her lawsuit, the plaintiff says she is 
seeking damages in connection with a "conspiracy" (Am. Compl. ,r 22), a "plan" 
(Am. Compl. ,r 32), a "scheme" (Am. Compl. ,r 32) and an "enterprise" (Am. 
Compl. ,r 32) and adds two nominal defendants. 
The plaintiff tries to assert claims for sexual assault (Am. Comp 1. ,r,r 16-19), 
civil conspiracy (Am. Compl. ,r,r 20-23) and civil RICO (Am. Compl. ,r,r 29-34). 
These theories of liability, however, cannot be supported by the allegations in the 
amended complaint. In fact, even if everything in the amended complaint were 
true, recovery against Jeffrey Epstein, for Counts I, II and IV, under any 
formulation, is impossible under Florida law. Accordingly, these counts must be 
dismissed. 
the claims contained in the plaintiffs complaint, the defendant is not required to file an answer 
until the comi rules on the motion to dismiss"). 
Notably, on February 20, 2008, the plaintiff was deposed in State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, 
502006CF009454AXXXMB (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct., filed Jul. 19, 2006). During that deposition, she 
made numerous admissions that completely undermine the allegations that she has pled in her 
complaint against Mr. Epstein. Regardless, for the procedural purposes of this motion only, we 
take her allegations as true.

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
ARGUMENT 
A motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) should be granted when a 
court cannot identify "each of the material elements necessary to sustain a 
recovery under some viable legal theory." Snow v. DirectTV, Inc., 450 F.3d 1314, 
1320 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. For Choice, Inc., 253 
F.3d 678, 684 (11th Cir. 2001)). Moreover, a court should dismiss a complaint 
"when, on the basis of a dispositive issue of law, no construction of the factual 
allegations will support a cause of action." Marshall County Bd. of Educ. v. 
Marshal County Gas Dist., 992 F.2d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir. 1993). "[T]o survive a 
motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must do more than merely state legal conclusions; 
they are required to allege some specific factual bases for those conclusions .... " 
Holt v. Crist, No. 06-14617, 2007 WL 1156938, *2 (11th Cir. Apr. 19, 2007). As 
such, "conclusory allegations, unwa1Tanted deductions of facts or legal conclusions 
masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Snow, 450 F.3d at 1320. 
I. 
Count I Fails to State a Cause of Action For Assault Recognized by 
Florida Law. 
The plaintiff attempts to plead a cause of action against Mr. Epstein for 
"sexual assault" based on a "violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes"3 for 
the "lewd and lascivious acts committed by Epstein upon Jane Doe." (Am. Compl. 
Chapter 800, Florida Statutes, is entitled, "Lewdness; Indecent Exposure." 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 4 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
,T 18.) The plaintiff cannot assert a cause of action for "violation of Chapter 800, 
Florida Statutes" because there is no private right of action under that Chapter. 
See generally Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Plaza Materials Corp., 908 So. 2d 360, 
7 4 (Fla. 2005) ( observing that "not every statutory violation carries a civil 
remedy" (citing Villazon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 843 So. 2d 842, 852 
(Fla. 2003)). See also, e.g., Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Ferre, 636 F. Supp. 970 
(S.D. Fla. 1985) (King, C.J.) (holding that violation of Florida's criminal extortion 
statute does not give rise to a civil cause of action for damages). 
Where a plaintiff brings a civil action pursuant to a criminal statute that 
provides no civil remedy, her complaint is properly dismissed for failure to state a 
cause of action. See Mantooth v. Richards, 557 So. 2d 646, 646 (Fla. 4th DCA 
1990) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs claim for parental kidnapping 
where "the mentioned statutes concern only criminal violations and do not afford 
a civil remedy") ( citation omitted) ( emphasis added). Accordingly, the plaintiffs 
claim for sexual assault against Mr. Epstein, pursuant to a violation of Chapter 
800, Florida Statutes, must be dismissed. 
Should the Court look beyond the plain language of the plaintiffs amended 
complaint and construe Count I as a claim for common-law assault, that claim 
would also fail. As the court explained in Lay v. Kremer, 411 So. 2d 1347, 1349 
(Fla. 1st DCA 1982), an assault is "an intentional, unlawful offer of corporal injmy 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 5 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
to another by force, or force unlawfully directed toward another under such 
circumstances as to create a fear of imminent peril, coupled with the apparent 
present ability to effectuate the attempt." An assault thus requires "an affirmative 
act-a threat to use force, or the actual exertion of force." Sullivan v. At!. Fed. 
Sav. & Loan Assoc., 454 So. 2d 52, 54 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984) (affirming dismissal of 
assault claim where there was no affirmative act). 
In this case, there is no such affirmative act. The plaintiff does not allege that 
Mr. Epstein used force or even threatened to use force. Indeed, the only statements 
that Mr. Epstein is alleged to have said to the plaintiff are "to remove her clothes," 
"to sit on his back" and "to continue giving him a massage." (Am. Compl. ,r 13.) 
These allegations fall far short of an "offer of corporal injury by force." 
Accordingly, because the plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action for 
assault recognized in Florida, Count I against Mr. Epstein must be dismissed. 
II. 
Count II Fails Because Plaintiff Claims No Actionable Underlying Tort 
or Wrong. 
As a general rule, "[a]n actionable conspiracy [under Florida law] requires 
an actionable underlying tort or wrong. Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 1165 
(Fla. 5th DCA 1984). A nan-ow exception to the general rule exists where "the 
plaintiff can show some peculiar power of coercion possessed by the conspirators 
by virtue of their combination." Churruca v. Miami Jai-Alai, Inc., 353 So. 2d 547, 
550 (Fla. 1977). "Where the concerted acts of the defendants do not create a 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 6 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
greater hann than if the acts were committed by one person ... , there can be no 
recovery" under a claim for independent conspiracy. Martin v. Marlin, 529 So. 2d 
1174, 1179 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988). Clearly, this case is governed by the general rule 
because only one person could have caused the plaintiffs injuries. 
Here, the plaintiffs claim under Count II ( civil conspiracy) fails because it 
derives exclusively from Count I (violation of Chapter 800, Florida Statutes). See 
Buchanan v. Miami Herald Publ'g Co., 230 So. 2d 9, 12 (Fla. 1969) (holding that 
where Count I of the complaint had failed to state a cause of action for malicious 
prosecution, there could be no civil conspiracy claim in Count II "based on the 
allegations of Count I"). As noted above, the plaintiff cannot prevail on Count I 
because the statute she expressly pleads as its basis, Chapter 800, Florida Statutes, 
provides no civil remedy. 
Therefore, she cannot prevail on her claim for conspiracy ( Count II) to 
violate Chapter 800, Florida Statutes (Count I), and Count II of the amended 
complaint must be dismissed against Mr. Epstein. 
III. 
Count IV Cannot Stand Because Plaintiff Fails to Claim a Direct Injury 
Resulting from a Violation of a RICO Predicate Act. 
Section 772.104, Florida Statutes ("Civil Remedies for Criminal Practices") 
allows someone to bring a civil RICO claim only if "he or she has been injured by 
reason of' any RICO violation. § 772.104, Fla. Stat. (2007) ( emphasis added). 
The injury must be a direct result of a racketeering activity or RICO predicate act. 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 7 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
See Baisch v. Gallina, 346 F.3d 366, 373 (2d Cir. 2003) ("[A] plaintiff does not 
have standing if he suffered an injury that was indirectly (and hence not 
proximately) caused by the racketeering activity or RICO predicate acts, even 
though the injury was proximately caused by some non-RICO violations 
committed by the defendant.). Thus, an injury allegedly caused by a non-RICO 
violation is insufficient to state a claim for civil RICO. See id. 
Here, the allegations in Count IV, even if they are true, do not add up to a 
civil RICO claim because the plaintiffs alleged injury was not caused by the 
violation of a RICO predicate act. The plaintiff alleges that she was injured "[a]s a 
direct and proximate result of Epstein's assault on Jane Doe," "in violation of 
Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes." (Am. Compl. ,-r,-r 18-19.) Chapter 800 of the 
Florida Statutes is not a RICO predicate act. See§ 772.102(a), Fla. Stat. (2003) 
(listing Florida's RICO predicate acts). By her own admission, the plaintiffs 
alleged injury was caused by a non-RICO violation. As a result, her claim cannot 
stand. 
In a doomed attempt to avoid this fatal flaw in her claim, the plaintiff lists a series 
of violations rooted in Florida's prostitution statutes. (Am. Compl. ,-r 31.) 
According to the amended complaint, the defendants participated in a criminal 
enterprise ... or conspir[ acy ]" (Am. Compl. ,-r 30) over an unspecified length of 
time "to repeatedly find and bring [Jeffrey Epstein] underage girls ... in order for 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 19   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/04/2008   Page 8 of 11
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Epstein to solicit, coerce, entice, compel, or force such girls in acts of prostitution 
and/or lewdness." (Am. Compl. ,r 32). The alleged "pattern of criminal activity" 
comprises violations of Chapter 796, Florida Statutes-the chapter that proscribes 
various crimes of prostitution.4 
These allegations, however, do not tie directly into the plaintiffs alleged 
injuries - her alleged assault "in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes." 
(Am. Compl. ,r 18.) Indeed, the plaintiffs alleged injury has nothing to do with 
the facilitation of prostitution, or more succinctly, the violation of Florida's 
prostitution laws. Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim must fail because there is no 
proximate cause between the purported "pattern of criminal activity" and the 
plaintiffs alleged injuries. 
Because the amended complaint does not satisfy the direct-injury 
requirement under Florida's RICO law, the plaintiff has failed to allege a cause of 
action against Jeffrey Epstein for violation of section 772.103, Fl01ida Statutes. 
Thus, Count IV of the amended complaint must be dismissed. 
Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein respectfully 
requests that Counts I, II and IV of the plaintiffs amended complaint be dismissed. 
The amended complaint alleges a "pattern of criminal activity" comprising the following 
criminal violations: §§ 796.03, 796.07(2)(f), 796.07(2)(h), 796.045, and 796.04, Fla. Stat. (Am. 
Compl. ,r 31.)

OPPOSITION TO REMAND MOTION 
Because this case was properly removed under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a), remand is 
unwarranted. In response to plaintiffs motion under § 1447(c) for remand and attorneys' fees, 
defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully state as follows: 
Introduction 
The plaintiff suggests she is insulated from any fraudulent-joinder challenge so long as 
she has "at least a possibility" of "recover[ing] against Defendant Robson under Florida law for 
each of the counts in the amended complaint." (DE 11 at 5.) However superficially appealing 
from a plaintiffs perspective, this argument ignores the corollary that "[t]he potential for legal 
liability [ under State law] 'must be reasonable, not merely theoretical."' Legg v. Wyeth, 428 
F.3d 1317, 1325 n.5 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Great Plains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir. 2002)) (emphasis added). See also id. at 1325 
(observing that "[t]he removal process was created by Congress to protect defendants," adding 
that "Congress 'did not extend such protection with one hand, and with the other give plaintiffs a 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/05/2008   Page 2 of 14
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
bag of tricks to overcome it.'" (quoting McKinney v. Ed. of Trustees of Maryland Cmty. Coll., 
955 F.2d 924, 928 (4th Cir. 1992))). 
Essentially, the remand motion merely re-states the complaint's allegations against 
Robson. This is not enough to rebut fraudulent joinder. Cf Ghiglione v. Discover Prop. & Cas. 
Co., No. C-06-1276 SC, 2006 WL 1095855, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2006) (denying motion to 
remand where plaintiffs, instead of properly analyzing their alleged cause of action, resorted to 
"quoting from Witkin 's California Procedure a passage that merely repeated the essence of [the 
governing jurisdictional statute]") ( emphasis added). 
Even in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the allegations are insufficient to 
establish a cause of action under Florida law against Haley Robson. 
As a result, after 
discounting this fraudulently joined defendant, there is complete diversity of citizenship, hence, 
original jurisdiction in this Court. 
Discussion 
A. Diversity of Citizenship 
Based on a published newspaper report, our removal petition suggested that Jane Doe, 
despite her allegations of being a citizen of Florida (DE 1 at 62), might actually be a (diverse) 
citizen of Georgia (DE 1 at 7-8 n.6). If so, the case would be removable, regardless of any 
claims against defendant Robson. The plaintiff ignored this point. Instead, the plaintiff claimed 
that "there is a question of whether Defendant Epstein is actually a citizen of Florida because he 
is now incarcerated in a Florida jail." (DE 11 at 2 n.2.) 
This statement, besides being 
nonresponsive, 1 is devoid of merit under binding Eleventh Circuit law, which the plaintiff did not 
Plaintiff seized upon this non sequitur as an opportunity to attach the "Epstein Sentence" (DE 
at 2 n.2), an unmarked composite exhibit comprising, among other things, the tenns,

cite. See Mitchell v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 294 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2002) 
(noting as an undisputed point that someone retains their pre-incarceration domicile for 
purposes of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)) (citations omitted); see also Polakoff v. 
Henderson, 370 F. Supp. 690, 693 (N.D. Ga. 1973), ajf'd, 488 F.2d 977, 978 (5th Cir. 1974) ("A 
prisoner does not acquire a new domicile in the place of his imprisonment, but retains the 
domicile he had prior to incarceration.") ( citation omitted) ( emphasis added), cited with approval 
in Mitchell, 294 F.3d at 1314. 
conditions, and sensitive protocols concerning the fact of Epstein's previously disclosed 
incarceration. See DE 24 in Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:08-CV-80119-KAM (S.D. 
Fla. filed Feb. 6, 2008) (disclosing fact of Epstein's criminal sentence and incarceration); DE 19 
in Jane Doe No. 3 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80232-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Mar. 5, 2008) (same); DE 
in Jane Doe No. 4 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80380-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Apr. 14, 2008) (same); 
DE 28 in Jane Doe No. 5 v. Epstein, No. 08-80381-CV-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Apr. 14, 2008) 
(same). 
Being entirely irrelevant to this proceeding, the above exhibit serves only to 
complement the improper extrajudicial Internet postings by plaintiffs counsel. Compare 
Ricci~Leopold Home Page, http://www.riccilaw.com (click on "Breaking News," then access 
the hyperlink entitled, 03/13/08- Consumer Justice Attorney Ted Leopold Files Case to aid Jane 
Doe in seeking justice against sexual predator Jeffi·ey Epstein and his associates) ( characterizing 
Epstein as a "sexual predator," then using terms like "'vilest"' and "'lurid"' to describe Epstein's 
alleged conduct (quoting "Ted Leopold, managing partner of the Palm Beach Gardens law firm

that such dissemination will interfere with a fair trial and which relates (a) [e]vidence regarding 
the occurrence or transaction involved[;] (b) [t]he character . .. of a party .... [; or] (d) [t]he 
lawyer's opinion as to the merits of the claims .... ") (emphasis added).

B. Fraudulent Joinder 
Even if the plaintiff is a citizen of Florida ( after all), there is still complete diversity given 
that "[a] non-diverse defendant who is fraudulently joined does not defeat diversity." Shenkar v. 
Money Warehouse, Inc., No. 07-20634-CIV, 2007 WL 3023531, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 15, 2007) 
(Moreno, J.) (citing Riley v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 292 F.3d 1334, 1337 
(11th Cir. 2002)); accord, e.g., Tedder v. F.MC. Corp., 590 F.2d 115, 117 (5th Cir. 1979) 
(denying motion to remand where two resident defendants were joined for the fraudulent purpose 
of defeating federal jurisdiction).2 To say it another way, there is no cause of action here against 
Haley Robson, and without Haley Robson, there is complete diversity. 
This plaintiff originally filed this lawsuit in this court. See Doe v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-
80069-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Jan. 24, 2008). After she was deposed in the state criminal case,3 
she dismissed this suit, switched lawyers, and re-filed her claims in state court (DE 1-2 at 62-
70), adding Haley Robson as a nondiverse defendant in an attempt to prevent removal (DE 1-2 at 
62).4 After Ms. Robson moved to quash service of process in state court (DE 1-2 at 92-96), the 
In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en bane), the Eleventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit 
rendered prior to October 1, 1981. 
On February 20, 2008, the plaintiff was deposed in State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, 
502006CF009454 (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct. filed July 19, 2006). During that deposition, she made 
numerous admissions that completely undermined the allegations in her complaint. Two days 
later, she filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice. See Doe v. Epstein, Case No. 
08-CV-80069-KAM, DE 9. 
The plaintiff, apparently to bolster her untenable theories of indirect tort liability, added 
another new defendant, Sarah Kellen. (DE 1-2 at 62.) 
In naming Kellen and Robson as 
defendants, the plaintiff tried to distinguish this case from a series of effectively identical 
lawsuits brought in federal court against Epstein: Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, Case No. 9:08-
CV-80119-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Feb. 6, 2008); Jane Doe No. 3 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80232-
KAM (S.D. Fla. filed Mar. 5, 2008); Jane Doe No. 4 v. Epstein, No. 08-CV-80380-KAM (S.D. 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/05/2008   Page 5 of 14
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
plaintiff then amended her complaint to assert an additional claim against Robson (DE 1-3 at 
101-09), re-using the identical, unmodified general allegations. 
Instead of addressing the fact that Robson has "no assets whatever" (DE 1 at 4) and looks 
every bit the sham defendant, the plaintiff maintains that Robson, a college student, was a "key 
player" in an alleged RICO "scheme" (DE 11 at 2). 
Resorting to unswom, inadmissible, 
improper double-hearsay, the plaintiff proclaims that Robson "has described herself as Heidi 
Fleiss" (DE 11 at 1 ), the "notorious Hollywood madam" (DE 11 at 1 n.1) -
as though 
sensationalism could convert Ms. Robson into an actual defendant. This "argument" has nothing 
to do with the issue of removal, offers incompetent non-evidence in an attempt to prejudice the 
analysis, and fails to establish that the amended complaint contains a single viable cause of 
action against Robson. 
1. The plaintiff has not asserted a cause of action against Robson for civil 
conspiracy. 
The plaintiff, citing to Wright v. Yurko, 446 So. 2d 1162, 1165 (Fla. 5th DCA 1984), 
concedes that "there muse [sic] be an 'actionable underlying tort or wrong' for an actionable 
conspiracy claim." (DE 11 at 5.) Yet, the plaintiff still insists that Epstein's "violation of 
Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes" (DE 1-3 at 105) is an adequate the basis for her civil 
conspiracy claim against Robson (DE 1-3 at 105-06), "regardless of whether Defendant 
Epstein's violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes also creates a private right of action" 
(DE 11 at 6). This makes no sense. 
As we argued in the removal petition, it is not enough to allege that Robson "merely ... 
'conspired to cause ham1"'; again, "[u]nder Florida law, '[a]n actionable conspiracy requires an 
Fla. filed Apr. 14, 2008); Jane Doe No. 5 v. Epstein, No. 08-80381-CV-KAM (S.D. Fla. filed 
Apr. 14, 2008). 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/05/2008   Page 6 of 14
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
actionable underlying tort or wrong."' Posner v. Essex Ins. Co., 178 F.3d 1209, 1217-18 (11th 
Cir. 1999) (quoting Florida Fern Growers Ass'n v. Concerned Citizens, 616 So. 2d 562, 565 
(Fla. 5th DCA 1993)). In an effort to dodge this requirement, the plaintiff cites Doe v. Celebrity 
Cruises, Inc., 394 F.3d 891, 917 (11th Cir. 2004), an admiralty case that has nothing to do with 
Chapter 800, let alone the basic premise (left unaddressed by the plaintiff) that "not every 
statutory violation carries a civil remedy." Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Plaza Materials Co,p., 
908 So. 2d 360, 374 (Fla. 2005) (citing Villazon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 843 So. 2d 
842, 852 (Fla. 2003)). 
In Celebrity Cruises, the Eleventh Circuit distinguished "sexual battery" from "sexual 
assault" under Florida law. Celebrity Cruises, 394 F.3d at 916-17. The court also cited with 
approval the dissenting opinion in Doe v. Evans, 814 So. 2d 370, 380 (Fla. 2002) (Wells, C.J., 
dissenting), where Florida Chief Justice Wells admonished against "the use of broad, indefinite, 
and legally nonspecific language" to establish causes of action under a rubric as expansive as 
"'sexual misconduct."' Evans, 814 So. 2d at 379-81 (Wells, C.J., dissenting). See also id. at 
379 (Wells, C.J., dissenting) (noting that "'sexual misconduct' is a phrase of inherent vagueness 
and has no meaning in Florida tort law," adding that "[t]orts have defined elements") ( emphasis 
added). 
Accordingly, this case serves only to highlight that Florida has never relaxed its 
pleading requirements simply because a plaintiff describes an event as a "sexual assault." To 
plead a legal cause of action, the plaintiff still must allege a real, recognized tort. 
In trying to obfuscate the basis for her civil-conspiracy claim, the plaintiff has only 
confirmed that she is relying on Chapter 800, a statute that does not afford a private right of 
action. Because the statute she expressly pleads provides no civil remedy, the plaintiff cannot 
prevail on her derivative claim for civil conspiracy.

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
2. The plaintiff has not asserted a cause of action against Robson for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
The plaintiff says she agreed to perform an illegal massage "to make some extra money" 
(DE 11 at 7), only to "suffer severe mental anguish and pain" (DE 1-3 at 106) when her illegal 
scheme met with an allegedly superseding illegal scheme. To establish a cause of action for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress, however, it is not sufficient to allege that '"the 
defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that [the defendant] has 
intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that [the defendant's] conduct has been 
characterized by 'malice,' or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive 
damages for another tort."' Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. McCarson, 467 So. 2d 277, 278 (Fla. 1985) 
(quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 (1965)). Rather, "the conduct as a matter of law 
must be so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds 
of decency." Southland Corp. v. Bartsch, 522 So. 2d 1053, 1056 (Fla. 5th DCA 1988). Here, 
when it comes to Robson, the amended complaint fails to meet these standards. 5 
Indeed, the plaintiff does not allege that Robson c01mnitted an assault; or that Robson 
acted forcibly; or that Robson acted coercively. Further, the plaintiff says she undressed, and 
presumably remained in Epstein's home, out of "shock, fear, and trepidation" (DE 1-3 at 104), 
not because of anything allegedly done by Robson. These allegations, to the extent they have to 
do with Robson, do not allege anything that Robson did that is "so extreme in degree as to go 
beyond all possible bounds of decency." Bartsch, 522 So. 2d at 1056. 
The standard for detem1ining IIED "is a matter of law, not a question of fact." Ponton v. 
Scarfone, 468 So. 2d 1009, 1011 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985) (citation omitted). Even when alleged 
This Response, in focusing only on fraudulent joinder, does not address the plaintiffs claims 
against the diverse defendants, Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen.

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
conduct is "condemnable by civilized social standards," it may still "not ascend, or perhaps 
descend, to a level permitting [a court] to say that the benchmarks enunciated [by the Florida 
Supreme Court] ... have been met." Id. 
Further, an IIED claim must be evaluated "as 
objectively as is possible" to detennine whether the conduct "is 'atrocious, and utterly intolerable 
in a civilized community."' Id. (quoting McCarson, 467 So. 2d at 278) ( emphasis added). 
When it comes to Robson, the plaintiff talks about being double-crossed. 
But 111 
emphasizing her own response to Robson's alleged deception (DE 1-3 at 104), and in explaining 
her decision to remain in the massage room (DE 1-3 at 103-04), the plaintiff ignores the basic 
principle that "the subjective response of the person who is the target of the actor's conduct does 
not control the question of whether the tort [of IIED] occurred." Bartsch, 522 So. 2d at 1056 
(citing Ponton, 468 So. 2d at 1011) (emphasis added). Here, the plaintiff alleges, at most, that 
Robson coordinated an openly illegal transaction with her (DE 1-3 at 103 ), but that Robson did 
not tell her everything that might happen while she was engaged in her illegal activities. This 
theory of liability, even in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, is far too attenuated to support 
an IIED claim. 
To start with, the plaintiff acknowledges that she intended "to give Epstein a massage for 
monetary compensation" (DE 1-3 at 103), even though she was unlicensed, untrained, and 
unqualified to perfonn this professional service; the plaintiff also acknowledges that she 
pretended to be 18 (DE 1 at 61). Apart from the fact that plaintiffs conduct is flatly proscribed 
by Florida's criminal code, see Fla. Stat. § 480.047, these allegations, when viewed "as 
objectively as is possible," simply do not implicate Robson, an alleged go-between for plaintiffs 
own criminality, in something "'atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community"' for 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/05/2008   Page 9 of 14
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
purposes of establishing an IIED claim. Ponton, 468 So.2d at 1011 (quoting McCarson, 467 So. 
2d at 278). 
Even if the plaintiff was "shock[ed]" (DE 1-3 at 104) to learn that Robson had engineered 
some sort of misdirection, that is still not enough to support an IIED claim against Robson. 
Again, it is not "' enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even 
criminal, or that [the defendant] has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that [the 
defendant's] conduct has been characterized by 'malice,' or a degree of aggravation which would 
entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort."' McCarson, 467 So. 2d at 278 (quoting 
Restatement (Second) of Torts§ 46 (1965)). 
Here, the amended complaint does not allege that Robson knew an alleged assault 
would take place; besides which, the plaintiff says she was assaulted by someone else (DE 1-3 at 
104--05). See Baker v. Fitzgerald, 573 So. 2d 873, 873 (Fla. 3d DCA 1990) (per curiam) 
("Appellant's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress fails because there was no 
showing of outrageous conduct directed at the appellant herself.") ( emphasis added). Further, 
there is nothing in the record to suggest that Robson knew the plaintiff would remove her 
clothing, or stay in the massage room, out of "shock, fear and trepidation" (DE 1-3 at 104), when 
the plaintiff was never coerced, by Robson, to do anything. Cf Habelow v. Travelers Ins. Co., 
389 So. 2d 218, 220 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980) (affirming dismissal of claim for intentional infliction 
of emotional distress where there were "no allegations ... indicating that [the plaintiff] was 
particularly sensitive or susceptible to emotional distress, or that [the defendant] had any basis to 
know she was" (citing Steiner & Munach, P. A. v. Williams, 334 So. 2d 39 (Fla. 3d DCA 
1976))). 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/05/2008   Page 10 of 14
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CN-MARRA/JOHNSON 
For these reasons, the plaintiff has not stated a cause of action against Robson for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
3. The plaintiff has not asserted a cause of action against Robson for civil 
RICO. 
The plaintiff, again substih1ting superficially framed legal standards for actual analysis, 
says she "was directly harmed by the [defendants'] scheme." (DE 11 at 9.) This bare assertion 
completely ignores the RICO discussion presented in the removal petition (DE 1 at 19-21), but 
more important, refuses to acknowledge that section 772.104 allows someone to bring a civil 
RICO claim only if "she has been injured by reason of" any RICO violation. § 772.104, Fla. 
Stat. (2007) ( emphasis added). 
Here, the plaintiff clearly alleges that she was injured as a result of "a sexual assault ... 
in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes" (DE 1-3 at 105), a statute that has nothing to 
do with, and does not constitute a predicate act in furtherance of, Florida RICO. 
Cf § 
772.104, Fla. Stat. (listing predicate acts for Florida RICO). The plaintiff hardly establishes a 
RICO claim merely by reciting that she "was a victim of Defendants' scheme because she was 
one of the underage girls found and delivered to Defendant Epstein by Defendant Robson and 
that she endured Epstein's actions as he tried to get her to engage in, and forced upon her, acts of 
prostih1tion and lewdness." (DE 11 at 9.) Not just in this passage, but indeed throughout her 
entire amended complaint, the plaintiff uses the term "scheme" as though it were a password for 
gaining access to RICO standing. Cf Newton v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 207 F.3d 444, 447 (8th Cir. 
2000) (observing in the context of indirect and attenuated RICO allegations that "[t]he mere 
recitation of the chain of causation alleged by the plaintiffs is perhaps the best explanation of 
why they do not have standing in this case"). 

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 21   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/05/2008   Page 11 of 14
CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
In sum, the plaintiff has said nothing to rebut what remains obvious: that her entire 
lawsuit, including her RlCO claim, rests on an alleged "sexual assault ... in violation of Chapter 
800 of the Florida Statutes." (DE 1-3 at 105.) Thus, the plaintiff has failed to allege a cause of 
action against Haley Robson. See Baisch v. Gallina, 346 F.3d 366, 373 (2d Cir. 2003) ("[A] 
plaintiff does not have standing if [s]he suffered an injury that was indirectly (and hence not 
proximately) caused by the racketeering activity or RlCO predicate acts, even though the injury 
was proximately caused by some non-RICO violations committed by the defendants.") 
(emphasis added); Hoatson v. New York Archdiocese, No. 05 Civ. 10467, 2007 WL 431098, at 
*12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2007) (dismissing RlCO claim with prejudice where amended complaint 
was "wholly devoid of a single act which constitutes a racketeering activity," even though the 
plaintiff had '"alleged a larger picture"' involving, among other things, allegations of sexual 
abuse) (emphasis added). 
By re-writing Florida's RlCO statute to encompass Chapter 800, the plaintiff once again 
seeks (hypothetical) damages against Haley Robson without any statutory basis. This tactic, 
besides being ineffectual to prevent removal, flouts the fact that "the RlCO statute is complex, 
arcane, and difficult to plead." Id. 
Cf id. at **12-16 (imposing sanctions in response to 
baseless RICO claim brought against the backdrop of sexual-abuse allegations, observing that 
"[t]he immediate link between the filing of the complaint and the press conference [held by the 
plaintiffs counsel] support[ s] the inference that [ there was an] intent[] . . . to injure [ the 
defendants' reputation by bringing a RlCO claim]").

CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Although asserting a RICO claim may be part of the plaintiffs media strategy,6 it is 
without legal merit and cannot operate to prevent removal. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, and the plaintiffs failure to address, let alone rebut, the 
fraudulent-joinder arguments presented in the removal petition, neither remand nor attorneys' 
fees are warranted in this case.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.:  08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE, a/k/a, 
JANE DOE NO. 1, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY 
ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, 
Defendants. 
________________________________/ 
PLAINTIFF’S REPLY TO OPPOSITION TO REMAND 
Plaintiff Jane Doe, a Florida citizen, properly sued Haley Robson, also a Florida 
citizen, in this action.  Contrary to Defendants’ contention, Defendant Robson was not 
fraudulently joined because, when viewing the factual allegations in the light most 
favorable to Plaintiff and resolving issues of Florida substantive law in favor of Plaintiff, 
it is clear that Plaintiff has cognizable causes of action against Defendant Robson for civil 
conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil RICO.  Accordingly, the 
Court should remand this action to Florida state court. 
A. Plaintiff is a Florida citizen 
Plaintiff alleged in her complaint and testified in deposition that she is a Florida 
resident.  (Amended Complaint ¶ 1, DE 1, pp. 301; Deposition of Jane Doe, DE 1, pp. 
31-32, 5:14-18, 6:6-10).  In their notice of removal, Defendants cite a newspaper article 
(from the same newspaper that Defendants chide Plaintiff for citing with regard to 
Defendant Robson describing herself as the Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss) in which it 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/15/2008   Page 1 of 8

is reported that Plaintiff had moved to another state in order to intimate that Plaintiff 
made fraudulent allegations regarding her residency.  (DE 1, p. 7 n.6).  Defendants then 
chide Plaintiff in their opposition to her motion for remand for not taking the bait and 
responding to this baseless allegation.  (DE 21, p. 1).  The only evidence in this case, as 
well as Plaintiff’s allegations, demonstrate that Plaintiff is a Florida citizen.  As 
Defendants have failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate otherwise, there is 
no need for Plaintiff to present additional evidence establishing her status as a Florida 
citizen.         
B.  Plaintiff has alleged cognizable causes of action against Defendant Robson 
The allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint demonstrate that Plaintiff was the victim 
in a despicable scheme orchestrated by Defendant Epstein to find and obtain underage 
girls, lure them to his home, and subject them to sexual abuse or otherwise induce them 
to engage in lewd behavior.  As much as Defendants attempt to downplay the role of 
Defendant Robson by describing her as nothing but a college student with no assets, 
Plaintiff’s complaint demonstrates that Robson was a key player in Epstein’s scheme.  
Defendant Robson was the person that actually trolled for underage girls and induced 
them with promises of money in exchange for massages in order to deliver the girls to 
Epstein’s home and get them into his bedroom.  (Amended Complaint ¶¶ 11-15, DE 1, 
pp. 302-04).  Without Defendant Robson’s role in this scheme, the underage girls, 
including Plaintiff, would not have been subjected to Defendant Epstein’s depravity and 
abuse.   
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/15/2008   Page 2 of 8

1. Civil Conspiracy 
Defendants repeatedly assert that Plaintiff cannot have a cause of action for civil 
conspiracy grounded on the tort of sexual assault because Chapter 800 of the Florida 
Statutes does not create a private cause of action.  As authority for this legal proposition, 
Defendants cite Florida case law that states “not every statutory violation carries a civil 
remedy.”  (DE 21, p. 6) (citing Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Plaza Materials Corp., 908 
So. 2d 360, 374 (Fla. 2005)).  Defendants do not cite case law that states, however, that 
Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes does not create a private cause of action, nor can they 
because this appears to be a matter of first impression in Florida.   
In order to determine whether a private cause of action may be based upon a 
statutory breach, Florida courts look to the intent of the legislature.  Baumstein v. Sunrise 
Community, Inc., 738 So. 2d 420, 421 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999).  Because Florida courts have 
not examined whether the legislature intended for violations of Chapter 800 to provide 
for private causes of action, the Court should view this uncertainty regarding Florida state 
law in favor of Plaintiff.  See Crowe v. Coleman, 113 F.3d 1536, 1538 (11th Cir. 1989) 
(citation omitted). 
Furthermore, the failure of a statute to provide a private cause of action does not 
“preclude the right to bring a common law . . . claim based upon the same allegations.”  
Villazon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 843 So. 2d 842, 852 (Fla. 2003).  In her 
action for sexual assault, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Epstein tortiously assaulted her 
sexually.  (DE 1, p. 104).  Under Florida law, sexual assault is an intentional tort. See 
Doe v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., 394 F.3d 891, 917 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Florida law equates 
sexual battery with an intentional tort.”).  Thus, even if Plaintiff’s civil conspiracy claim 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/15/2008   Page 3 of 8

cannot properly be grounded upon a violation of Chapter 800, it is properly grounded 
upon common law tortious assault.  Plaintiff’s cause of action for civil conspiracy is, 
therefore, cognizable against Defendant Robson under Florida law.                 
2. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
Defendants next assert that Plaintiff has failed to assert a cognizable cause of 
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendant Robson because 
her allegations are not so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go 
beyond all possible bounds of decency.  (DE 21, p. 7).  They attempt to characterize 
Plaintiff as the wrongdoer because she agreed to give a massage in exchange for 
monetary compensation when she was “unlicensed, untrained, and unqualified to perform 
this professional service.”  (DE 21, p. 8).  
Defendants seem to forget that Plaintiff was just a 14-year old girl when she was 
approached by Defendant Robson and induced to agree to provide a massage to a wealthy 
man in exchange for money.  What Plaintiff certainly did not agree to do was to be 
subjected to Defendant Epstein’s perverse scheme to satisfy his depraved sexual desires.  
When read fairly, Plaintiff’s complaint tells the tale of a girl, barely a teenager, who was 
lied to and manipulated by the college-aged Defendant Robson who, for compensation, 
tempted Plaintiff with the promise of money in exchange for easy and harmless work and 
then knowingly delivered Plaintiff into the depraved hands of Defendant Epstein.  
Defendant Epstein then subjected this young girl to the despicable lewd and lascivious 
acts detailed in Plaintiff’s complaint.  It is hard to imagine any conduct that is more 
“outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/15/2008   Page 4 of 8

decency.”  Plaintiff’s cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress must, 
therefore, be recognized as cognizable under Florida law.    
3. Civil RICO 
Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to assert a cognizable cause 
of action for civil RICO against Defendant Robson because Plaintiff was injured only by 
the sexual assault, which is not a predicate act under Florida’s RICO statute.  In her 
complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in 
which Defendant Robson found and delivered underage girls to Defendant Epstein in 
order for Epstein to “solicit, induce, coerce, entice, compel or force such girls to engage 
in acts of prostitution and/or lewdness.” (Amended Complaint ¶ 32, DE 1, p. 307).  She 
also alleges that she was a victim of Defendants’ scheme because she was one of the 
underage girls found and delivered to Defendant Epstein by Defendant Robson and that 
she endured Epstein’s actions as he tried to get her to engage in, and forced upon her, acts 
of prostitution and lewdness. (Amended Complaint ¶ 33, DE 1, pp. 307-308). It is for 
harm suffered as a result of these predicate acts that Plaintiff seeks damages for in Count 
IV of her complaint.  Cf. Palmas Y Bambu, S.A. v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., Inc., 
881 So. 2d 565, 570 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004) (holding plaintiff has standing to sue for civil 
RICO when her injuries flow directly from commission of the predicate acts, which 
means “when the alleged predicate act is mail or wire fraud, the plaintiff must have been 
a target of the scheme to defraud and must have relied to his detriment on 
misrepresentations made in furtherance of that scheme”). Because Plaintiff was a target 
of Defendants’ scheme and was harmed by their actions in carrying out the scheme, 
Plaintiff has a cognizable cause of action for civil RICO against Defendant Robson.     
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 22   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/15/2008   Page 5 of 8

C. Conclusion 
Plaintiff, a Florida citizen, has alleged cognizable causes of action against Defendant 
Robson, also a Florida citizen, for civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional 
distress, and civil RICO. When viewing Plaintiff’s factual allegations in the light most 
favorable to her and resolving issues of Florida substantive law in her favor, it is clear 
that Plaintiff has not fraudulently joined Defendant Robson in this action.  Accordingly, 
the Court should remand this action to Florida state court for lack of jurisdiction.

PLAINTIFF’S UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO FILE 
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT EPSTEIN’S MOTION TO DISMISS 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves, pursuant to Rule 7.1(A) of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, for an enlargement of time to respond to 
Defendant Epstein’s Motion to Dismiss until fifteen days after the Court rules on her motion to 
remand.   
1. Defendants removed this action to federal court on July 21, 2008.  (DE 1).   
2. Plaintiff filed a motion to remand on August 18, 2008.  (DE 11).  It is Plaintiff’s 
contention that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because it 
does not involve a federal question or parties with complete diversity of citizenship. 
3. If this action was improperly removed and is, consequently, remanded to state court 
for lack of jurisdiction, it would be a waste of time and resources for Plaintiff to 
respond to and the Court to consider Defendant Epstein’s motion to dismiss.   
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/18/2008   Page 1 of 4

v.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,

Defendants.
_______________________________________/
OPINION AND ORDER REMANDING CASE TO STATE COURT
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand (DE 11), filed August
18, 2008.  Defendants filed a response (DE 21), and Plaintiff subsequently replied (DE 22).  The
motion is now fully briefed and is ripe for review.  The Court has carefully reviewed all of the
briefs and the entire record and is otherwise advised in the premises.
Background
Plaintiff Jane Doe, a/k/a Jane Doe No. 1, filed a four-count complaint in the Circuit Court
of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, on June 25, 2008,
bringing actions for sexual assault against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”), and civil
conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil remedy for violation of Florida
Statute Section 772.103 against all three Defendants (DE 1).  The facts, as alleged in the
Complaint, are as follows: At all relevant times, Epstein was an adult male. (Am. Compl. ¶ 8). 
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 26   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/03/2008   Page 1 of 8

Epstein engaged in a plan, scheme and/or enterprise in which he gained access to primarily
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls or coerced or
attempted to coerce them to engage in prostitution, and then gave them money. (Am. Compl. ¶
9).  In or about 2005, Plaintiff, then 14 years old, became a victim of this scheme.  (Am. Compl.
¶ 9).  Defendants Sarah Kellen (“Kellen”) and Haley Robson (“Robson”) recruited girls
ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach
mansion. (Am. Compl. ¶11).  Under the plan, Robson was contacted shortly before or soon after
Epstein was at his Palm Beach residence.  Epstein, Kellen, or someone on their behalf, directed
Robson to bring one or more underage girls to the residence. (Am. Compl. ¶11).  Robson
generally sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and
surrounding areas. (Am. Compl. ¶ 11).
Upon arrival at Epstein’s mansion, Robson would introduce each victim to Kellen, who
gathered the girl’s personal information. (Am. Compl. ¶ 12).  Defendant Kellen would then bring
the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 12). 
Kellen would then leave the girl alone in the room, whereupon Epstein would enter wearing only
a towel. (Am. Compl. ¶ 12). Epstein would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the
massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 12).  Epstein would then
perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, including masturbation, touching the girl’s
vagina with a vibrator, or digitally penetrating the girl’s vagina, and coerce or attempt to coerce
the girl to engage in either lewd acts or prostitution, or both.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 12).
Consistent with the foregoing plan, Robson recruited Plaintiff to give Epstein a massage
for monetary compensation. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Robson brought Plaintiff to Epstein’s mansion
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 26   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/03/2008   Page 2 of 8

in Palm Beach. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Plaintiff was introduced to Kellen, who led her up the stairs
to the room with the massage table. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Kellen set up the massage table, laid out
the massage oils, told Plaintiff that Epstein would be in shortly, and then left the room. (Am.
Compl. ¶ 13).  Plaintiff was alone in the room when Epstein arrived. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Epstein
told her to remove her clothes and left the room. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Epstein returned wearing
only a towel. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Epstein removed his towel and laid down on his stomach on
the massage table. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Epstein again told Plaintiff to remove her clothes. (Am.
Compl. ¶ 13).  In shock, fear and trepidation, Plaintiff complied, removing her clothes except for
her panties and bra. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Shortly after starting to rub Epstein’s back, Epstein told
Plaintiff to sit on his back. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Plaintiff, out of fear and trepidation, complied.
(Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  After a period of time, Epstein got up from the table and went behind the
door. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  For several minutes Plaintiff heard loud noises and moans and
believes that Epstein was masturbating. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Thereafter, Epstein, naked, returned
to the massage table and laid face up on the table. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Epstein then told Plaintiff
to continue with the massage and told her to sit on top of him. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Out of fear
and trepidation she complied. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  As Plaintiff rubbed Epstein’s chest, Epstein
began to use a vibrator on Plaintiff’s vagina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 13). Thereafter Epstein began to
digitally stimulate and attempt to penetrate Plaintiff’s vagina. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  At this same
time, Epstein was masturbating. (Am. Compl. ¶ 13).  Upon reaching orgasm, Epstein got up from
the massage table, told Plaintiff to write down her name and phone number, and then left the
room.(Am. Compl. ¶ 13). 
Plaintiff was then able to get dressed, leave the room and go back downstairs and into the
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 26   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/03/2008   Page 3 of 8

kitchen. (Am. Compl. ¶ 14).  Epstein, Robson, and Kellen were waiting for Plaintiff. (Am.
Compl. ¶ 14).  Epstein paid Plaintiff $300. (Am. Compl. ¶ 14).  Epstein paid Robson $200 for
bringing Plaintiff to him. (Am. Compl. ¶ 14).  Robson took Plaintiff home. (Am. Compl. ¶ 14). 
As a result of this encounter, the 14-year-old Plaintiff experienced confusion, shame,
humiliation, and embarrassment, and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral. (Am.
Compl. ¶ 15).
Defendants filed a Notice of Removal with this Court on July 18, 2008. (DE 1). 
Defendants assert that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332: the amount in
controversy exceeds $75,000; Defendant Epstein is a citizen of the U.S. Virgin Islands; and
Defendant Sarah Kellen is a citizen of New York. (Notice of Removal ¶ 2.)  As Plaintiff is a
citizen of Florida, complete diversity exists and this Court’s jurisdiction is alleged to be proper. 
As for Haley Robson, Defendants claim that Robson was fraudulently joined to defeat diversity
jurisdiction. (Notice of Removal. ¶ 3).  Plaintiffs have moved to remand the action, claiming that
Robson was not fraudulently joined to the action.  As such, Plaintiff asserts that complete
diversity does not exist, and this Court does not have jurisdiction over this case.
Standard of Review
A defendant may remove any civil action brought in a state court over which a federal
court would also have original jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. § 1441(a).  However, the burden of
establishing federal jurisdiction under § 1441 rests with the party seeking removal. Carson v.
Dunham, 121 U.S. 421, 425 (1887); Diaz v. Sheppard, 85 F.3d 1502, 1505 (11  Cir. 1996).  The
th
right of removal is strictly construed, as it is considered a federal infringement on a state’s power
to adjudicate disputes in its own courts.  See Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.S. 100,
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 26   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/03/2008   Page 4 of 8

108-09 (1941).  Thus, when the Court’s jurisdiction over a case is doubtful, doubts are resolved
in favor of remand.  See Crowe v. Coleman, 113 F.3d 1536, 1539 (11  Cir. 1997).  
th
Discussion
Fraudulent Joinder
A defendant's statutory "right of removal cannot be defeated by a fraudulent joinder of a
resident defendant having no real connection with the controversy."  Wilson v. Republic Iron &
Steel Co., 257 U.S. 92, 97 (1921).  Thus, courts have established the doctrine of fraudulent
joinder to allow the removal of a case to federal court despite the presence of a non-diverse or
forum-citizen defendant.  The Eleventh Circuit has provided substantial guidance for the district
courts in situations where a party removes a case from state court, alleging fraudulent joinder of
the non-diverse parties:  
In a removal case alleging fraudulent joinder, the removing party has the
burden of proving that either: (1) there is no possibility the plaintiff can
establish a cause of action against the resident defendant; or (2) the plaintiff
has fraudulently pled jurisdictional facts to bring the resident defendant into
state court.  The burden of the removing party is a “heavy one.”
To determine whether the case should be remanded, the district court must
evaluate the factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and
must resolve any uncertainties about state substantive law in favor of the
plaintiff. 
Crowe, 113 F.3d at 1538. In this case, Defendants do not allege that Plaintiff fraudulently pled
jurisdictional facts; instead, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has no cause of action against
Robson. 
The Amended Complaint alleges three causes of action against Robson: civil conspiracy
(Count 2); intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count 3); and civil remedy for violation of
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 26   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/03/2008   Page 5 of 8

Florida Statute Section 772.103 (Count 4).  The Court, in considering the remand motion, must
not weigh the merits of a Plaintiff's claim beyond determining whether any of the alleged causes
of action is an arguable one under state law. See Crowe, 113 F.3d at 1538. “If there is even a
possibility that a state court would find that the complaint states a cause of action against any one
of the resident defendants, the federal court must find that joinder was proper and remand the
case to state court.” Id., quoting Coker v. Amoco Oil Co., 709 F.2d 1433, 1440-41 (11th
Cir.1983). 
The Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals set forth the elements of a civil conspiracy as
follows: “The elements of a civil conspiracy are: (a) a conspiracy between two or more parties,
(b) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means, (c) the doing of some overt act
in pursuance of the conspiracy, and (d) damage to plaintiff as a result of the acts performed
pursuant to the conspiracy.” Walters v. Blankenship, 931 So.2d 137, 140 (Fla. 5DCA 2006),
citing Florida Fern Growers Ass'n, Inc. v. Concerned Citizens of Putnam County, 616 So.2d 562
(Fla. 5th DCA 1993).   Here, Plaintiff has alleged each of the required elements in her Amended
Complaint as follows: (a) a conspiracy between the three Defendants, including Robson (Am.
Compl. ¶ 21); (b) to do an unlawful act, that is, to commit the tort of sexual assault of a minor
(Am. Compl. ¶ 21); (c) Robson committed an overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy, that is,
Robson used false pretenses to lure Plaintiff to Epstein’s home so that Epstein could sexually
assault Plaintiff (Am. Compl. ¶ 22).; and (d) severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including
mental, psychological and emotional damages  (Am. Compl. ¶ 23).  
“Additionally, an actionable conspiracy requires an actionable underlying tort or wrong.”
Raimi v. Furlong, 702 So.2d 1273, 1284 (3d DCA 1997); see, e.g.,  Walters, 931 So.2d at 141.  
Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM   Document 26   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/03/2008   Page 6 of 8

The gist of a civil action for conspiracy is not the conspiracy itself, but the civil
wrong which is done pursuant to the conspiracy and which results in damage to
the plaintiff .... (citations omitted) Thus, a cause of action for civil conspiracy
exists ... only if “the basis for the conspiracy is an independent wrong or tort
which would constitute a cause of action if the wrong were done by one person.”
Rivers v. Dillards Dept. Store, Inc., 698 So.2d 1328 (Fla. 1 DCA 1997), quoting Blatt v. Green,
Rose, Kahn & Piotrkowski, 456 So.2d 949 (Fla. 3d DCA 1984). The alleged underlying wrong or
tort in this case is sexual assault of a 14-year-old minor.  Sexual assault is considered tortious
conduct under Florida law. Malicki v. Doe, 814 So.2d 347, 358 (Fla. 2002); see also Doe v.
Celebrity Cruises, Inc., 394 F.3d 891, 917 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Florida law equates sexual battery
with an intentional tort.”).  At the very least, Plaintiff’s Complaint states a cause of action for the
underlying tort of battery, as a 14-year-old child cannot consent to the alleged vaginal penetration
by Epstein.  Fla. Stat. § 800.04.
Based on the foregoing, the Court cannot say with certainty that “no possibility” exists
that Plaintiff can establish a cause of action against the resident Robson in state court. 
See Crowe, 113 F.3d at 1538.  As such, the Court concludes that Defendants have not met their
“heavy” burden of demonstrating that joinder of the claims against Robson was fraudulent,
justifying denial of the motion to remand. Id.
Conclusion
Accordingly, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:
1. Plaintiff’s Motion to Remand [DE 11] is GRANTED.
2.  This case shall be REMANDED to the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit
in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, case No. 50 2008 CA 006596, for lack of subject matter

3.  The Clerk of this Court is hereby directed to forward a certified copy of this Order to
the Clerk of the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County,
Florida, case No. 50 2008 CA 006596;
