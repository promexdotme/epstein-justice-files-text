A. I work on the Violent Crimes Against Children

matters. 
Q. Have you participated in an investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein and his associates? 
A. Yes.

other law enforcement officers, about this

MS. 
Ladies and gentlemen, some of the 
testimony that you're going to hear today will 
include hearsay. As you know, that means that the 
witness will not be testifying solely from her own 
observations, but that she'll also be reporting 
what others have told her and what she's read in 
reports and documents prepared by others.

As you know, hearsay evidence is admissible in 
these grand jury proceedings, and you're free to 
rely on it in determining whether there is 
probable cause to indict the proposed defendant. 
If, however, you would like to hear the 
testimony of any other witness, you have the right 
to request it, and we will make reasonable efforts 
to bring that witness before you. 
BY MS. 
Q. So, Special Agent 
I placed in front of 
you a stack of exhibits. I want to talk through them 
now one by one. 
We were discussing earlier that you recall 
testifying before this grand jury on June 18, 2019;. is 
that correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. So, I placed in front of you what's marked as 
Grand Jury Exhibit 3. Is that a fair and accurate 
transcript of your testimony on that date? 
A. Yes. 
Q. I've also placed in front of you Grand Jury 
Exhibit 1. Is that a PowerPoint presentation that you 
reviewed with this grand jury on June 18th, 2019? 
A. Yes. 
Q. So picking up where we left off last time, I

want to follow up regarding the presentation. If you 
could turn to page 28 of that presentation. 
Now, Special Agent 
do you recall 
testifying about your interviews with a young woman 
named 
A. Yes. 
Q. And do you recall that there was a question 
from the grand jury about the date on one of the slides 
in this presentation? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Just want to follow up on that. So on this 
page, just to orient ourselves, do you recall 
testifying about phone records of a call between a 
phone number subscribed to 
and 
's cell phone on January 3rd? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Have you reviewed the underlying phone records 
that are excerpted in this slide? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Is the call highlighted on this slide from 
January 3rd, 2005?

Q. Have you confirmed that the underlying records 
are, in fact, from January 3rd, 2005? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Turning to the next slide, on page 29. So the 
header on this slide is January 4, 2005. Is that the 
same date that's on the deposit slip excerpted in that 
slide? 
A. Yes. 
Q. So does the date on this slide accurately 
reflect the date on the deposit slip? 
A. Yes. 
Q. So when you testified that based on the phone 
records we just discussed and this deposit slip, that 
it appears that they were on back-to-back days, was 
that in fact accurate? 
A. Yes. 
Q. All right. So I want to switch gears now and 
ask you, do you recall testifying before this grand 
jury regarding a woman named

Department. 
Q. What is your understanding, based on your 
review of law enforcement reports and your review of 
the case file, of how the Palm Beach Police Department

the residence and went through the trash that was left 
on the curb. 
Q. Is this document from one of those trash 
pulls? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Approximately when was this pulled from the 
trash, based on your review of law enforcement reports?

number of residences. Do you know specifically where 
this was pulled from the trash?

06/29/20 
MS. 
Ladies and gentlemen, let me just give 
you a brief instruction. Some of the testimony that you'll 
hear today will include what's called hearsay. As you know, 
that means that the witness will not be testifying solely 
from her own observations, but that she'll also be reporting 
to you what others have told her and what she's read in 
reports and documents prepared by other people. 
Hearsay evidence is admissible in these grand jury 
proceedings, and you're free to rely on it in determining 
whether there's probable cause to indict the proposed 
defendant. 
If, however, you would like to hear the testimony 
of any other witness, you have the right to request it and 
we will make reasonable efforts to bring that witness before 
you. 
BY MS. 
Q. 
Special Agent 
we placed on the desk in 
front of you a PowerPoint that is Grand Jury Exhibit 2, 
which we're entering into the record. Do you recognize 
this? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
What is it? 
A. 
It's a PowerPoint presentation to assist in 
testifying today.

Did you participate in preparing this exhibit in

1990's? 
A. 
Yes, he did. 
Q. 
And at the time

14? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Did it continue until she was about age 17? 
A. 
Yes, it did. 
Q. 
And during those years, did she regularly go over 
to Epstein's house in Palm Beach and spend time with Maxwell 
and Epstein? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
What happened in the summer of 1997 when 
was 17 and about to turn 18? 
A. 
She moved to New York City. 
Q. 
Why did she move to New York City? 
A. 
She wanted to pursue a career in acting and 
modeling. 
Q. 
We'll talk about that in a moment, but for now I 
want to focus on the years you talked about in Palm Beach 
from ages 14 to 17 when 
would regularly go to 
Epstein's house. In the beginning, in the first few months 
when she went there, what kinds of things did she do when 
she would visit the house when Maxwell and Epstein were 
there? 
A. 
They'd hang out by the pool, he -- they would take 
her to the movies, take her shopping. She described the 
behavior as grooming. 
Q. 
When you say grooming, did she explain what sh,

06/29/20 
meant by that? 
A. 
She meant that they were building a relationship 
with her, giving her things, taking her places. And then 
usually when the grooming happens, an offender will -- once 
they gain that trust, they will make the relationship turn 
sexual. 
Q. 
Now, you testified just a moment ago that 
described to you that she felt at this time period that they 
were grooming her. Is that right? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Is that something that she realized at the time 
when she was 14, or is that something that she's described 
to you now? 
A. 
Something she's described now. She didn't realize 
that at the time. 
Q. 
So we'll talk a little bit more about grooming in 
a moment, but just to give context are you familiar with the 
term grooming based on your experience investigating crimes 
involving a sexual exploitation of minors? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Generally speaking, -- you were touching on this a 
moment ago, but if you just could explain in full. What is 
grooming? 
A. 
Grooming is when someone builds a relationship 
with a child. They find a vulnerability or a need and then.

they work on gaining a child's trust, and then oftentime 
gaining a parent's trust. Once they have that trust, they 
show that in ways that they care about them by giving them 
gifts and promises. And then once that's established, they 
then turn the relationship sexual, oftentimes making sexual 
comments and normalizing the behavior. 
4. 
Now, during these visits that you've been 
describing that 
told you about, did 
say whether 
Epstein ever gave her anything? 
A. 
Yes, she did. 
Q. 
What did he give her? 
A. 
He gave her cash. Sometimes he'd tell her to give 
the cash to her mom because he knew that they needed it. He 
paid for her voice lessons as well. 
Q. 
Now, you were describing how 
has 
characterized these visits now. But based on your 
conversations with her, at the time did she feel that these 
visits were strange at all? 
A. 
She thought they were strange, but Maxwell 
normalized it for her. She was like a cool older sister and 
made comments like this is what grownups do. 
Q. 
You used the phrase cool older sister. Is that a 
phrase that 
used to describe how she felt about 
Maxwell at the time and what Maxwell was like? 
A. 
Yes, those are her words.

A. 
He told her that he was best friends with the 
owner of Victoria Secret. Told her that she would have to 
have photographs taken and that she got to be comfortable in 
her underwear, and not to be a prude. When she asked what 
that meant, he pulled her to his lap and masturbated. 
Q. 
What was her reaction? 
A. 
She felt paralyzed. She froze.

After this incident, did 
encounters with 
Epstein begin to include sexual contact?

separate out some of the different instances of abuse.

Is a court reporter present when a deposition 
takes place? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Now before we talk about Maxwell's deposition 
testimony, I want to talk with you about the lawsuit that 
the testimony was about. 
Have you become aware that in or 
about 2015 an individual named 
filed a
lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell here in the Southern 
District of New York? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And was 
suing Maxwell for defamation? 
A. 
Yes, she was. 
Q. 
Was the lawsuit captioned 
against 
Ghislaine Maxwell with Docket Number 15-CV-7433 here in the 
Southern District of New York? 
A. 
Yes.

Q. 
Generally speaking, in broad strokes, what was the 
lawsuit about? What was the claim that 
was bringing 
against Maxwell? 
A. 
had stated that she had been sexually 
abused by Epstein and Maxwell as a minor. Maxwell came 
forward publically and called her a liar. So 
her for defamation. 
MS. 
So just a small legal instruction on 
this topic. Ladies and gentleman, I instruct you that the 
allegations in the lawsuit are not being presented to you as 
evidence that those incidents occurred. I instruct you that 
you should not consider those allegations for their truth; 
instead, the circumstances of the lawsuit are being 
presented to you so that you can consider the context of the 
case and the circumstances under which Maxwell made 
statements under oath. 
BY MS. 
Q. 
Turning back to the deposition. Did Maxwell's 
deposition take place over two different days? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
On both days did she give testimony in Manhattan? 
A. 
Yes, she did. 
Q. 
Is that where the deposition took place? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And on both days was Maxwell sworn under oath?

A.

the transcript?

Q. 
I imagine the grand juries can't read it from 
their seats so if you could read it with me, I'll read the 
questions and if you could read the answers. 
Question: "Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to 
recruit underage girls for underage massages?" 
And it appears there was an objection from the 
lawyer. 
Question: "If you know." 
A. 
Answer: "I don't know what you are talking about." 
Q. 
Just to be clear with the question and answer, is 
the answer here Maxwell's testimony?

Q. 
Just to be clear, you testified earlier that

Maxwell; is that right? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And 
was a minor when that occurred? 
A. 
Yes.

Question: "List all the people under the age of 18 
that you've interacted with at any of Jeffrey Epstein's 
properties?" 
A. 
Maxwell's answer: "I'm not aware of anybody that I 
interacted with, other than obviously 
who was 1.7
at this point." 
Q. 
Just to be clear, you testified earlier about two 
girls under the age of 18 who interacted with Maxwell at 
Epstein's properties; is that correct?

basket of sex toys in her closet there; is that correct?

read the answers. 
Questions: "Other than yourself, and the blonde 
and brunette that you have identified as having been 
involved in three-way sexual activities, with whom did 
Mr. Epstein have sexual activities?" 
There's an objection from the lawyer. 
A. 
Maxwell's answer: "I wasn't aware that he was 
having sexual activities with anyone when I was with him 
other than myself." 
Q. 
Question: "I want to be sure that I'm clear, is i-
your testimony that in the 1990s and 2000s you were not 
aware that Mr. Epstein was having sexual activities with 
anyone other than yourself and the blonde and brunette on 
those few occasions when they were involved with you?" 
A. 
Maxwell's answer: "That is my testimony. That is 
correct." 
Q. 
Have you reviewed the deposition transcript --
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
-- in full? Now, the excerpt we just read has a 
reference to a blonde and brunette. Are those individuals 
completely different from the individuals we've been talking 
about today? 
A. 
Yes.

earlier that 
and 
told you that Epstein

sexually abused them repeatedly; is that correct? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
And did you also testify earlier that Maxwell was 
occasionally present when Epstein was abusing 
based 
on what she told you? 
A. 
Yes, that's correct. 
Q. 
Turning to the next slide, is this also an excerpt

A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Thank you. Okay. Again, if we could read that 
together I'll take the question if you could take the 
answer. 
Question: "Let's just tie that down. Is it your 
testimony that you've never given anybody a massage?" 
A. 
Maxwell's answer: "I have not given anyone a 
massage." 
Q. 
"You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage; is that 
your testimony?" 
A.

Q. 
Just to be clear, as you testified earlier, is it 
correct that 
told you that Maxwell gave her a 
massage when they were in New Mexico? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Have you told the grand jury everything that you 
know about this case or have you just answered the questions 
that I've asked? 
A. 
I've just answered the questions you've asked. 
Q. 
And when you testified about the documents that 
you reviewed or the conversations that you had with others, 
were you testifying to the exact words used or just the 
substance of the documents or conversations?

And are you willing to return to the grand jury if 
the grand jury has any further questions for you?

United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
07/08/20 
PROCEEDINGS 
(10:05 a.m.) 
MS. 
Let the record reflect that there are 
grand jurors present and that the foreperson is present. 
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is 
and I am an Assistant United States Attorney 
here in the Southern District of New York. 
Can everyone hear me okay? All right. I see 
everybody's heads nodding. Thank you. 
I am here today to present for your consideration 
a proposed superseding indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell 
in six counts. This indictment is virtually identical to 
the indictment that you returned last week charging Maxwell 
in those same six counts except that it corrects two 
clerical errors, or two typographical errors that were 
contained in Counts Five and Six which are the perjury 
charges. 
As a result, I will not be presenting any new 
evidence or new witnesses today. Instead, I will identify 
for you those two clerical errors in the indictment. I will 
point out the portion of the exhibits that you saw last week 
that provide the correct information. Then I will identify 
the corrected portion of the superseding indictment in the 
proposed superseding indictment. 
Before I do that though, I must ask you all the

same preliminary questions that we went over last week. 
First, do any of you believe that you personally know or 
have met the proposed defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell? I see 
no hands. 
Next, have you any heard or read about, or learned 
anything Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein or anyone else 
related to this case, if you could just raise your hand? I 
see a number of hands. Virtually every hand is in the air. 
You can all put your hands down. Thank you. 
As you know, you must make your determination as a 
grand jury based on the evidence presented before you in the 
grand jury, in this room alone. Accordingly, you must set 
aside any other knowledge you may have about this case or 
the people involved in it, and base your decision solely on 
the evidence presented to this grand jury to determine 
whether there is probable cause to believe that the charges 
in the proposed indictment were committed. 
Is there any grand juror here today who cannot 
follow these instructions? I see no hands. Just to be 
sure, is there any grand juror here who would have any 
difficulty setting aside the outside information you may 
have about the defendant or the facts of this case? I see 
no hands. 
Finally, do any of you believe you know me in 
anything other than my professional capacity? I see no

hands. 
Now, as I mentioned, I will not be calling any 
witnesses today. Instead I will present you with the 
exhibits from last week, the transcript of the testimony you 
heard from last week and the proposed superseding 
indictment. I will then walk you through the error that the 
superseding indictment seeks to correct. 
Please keep in mind though that what I say is not 
evidence. Only the testimony of the witnesses and the 
exhibits are evidence. So as I'm walking you through these 
exhibits, your understanding of them and your understanding 
of the evidence controls. I am just trying to provide you 
with an overview. 
With that instruction in mind, I am going to put 
up onto the Elmo what was previously received and marked as 
Grand Jury Exhibit 1. That is the proposed six-count 
indictment that you voted to return last week. A copy of it 
will be available for review when you deliberate. 
You also received what has been marked as Grand 
Jury Exhibit 2, which I will not put up on the Elmo. Thar 
was a PowerPoint presentation containing photographs anc 
excerpts of certain documents that was shown to you during 
the testimony last week. You also heard testimony from FBI 
Special Agent 
Today I am marking, as Grand Jury Exhibit 3, a

copy of the transcript of that testimony. It is up on the 
Elmo now and it will be available for you to review if you 
would like as you deliberate. I will not read it back to 
you now, but you can read through it as you deliberate. 
Finally, I am marking, as Grand Jury Exhibit 4, 
the proposed superseding indictment, which I have now placed 
up on the Elmo. As I mentioned, this proposed superseding 
indictment corrects two clerical errors and is otherwise 
identical to the original indictment, Grand Jury Exhibit 1. 
I'm now going to walk you through the errors that 
we're going to correct starting on Grand Jury Exhibit 1. 
Page 15 contains the beginning of Count Five which charges 
Maxwell with perjury. Paragraph 21 on that page refers to 
the civil case in which Maxwell gave deposition testimony on 
April 22nd, 2016, as 15 Civ. 7344. That is the error we are 
going to correct. 
Similarly, page 16 contains the beginning of Count 
Six which charges another count of perjury. Paragraph 23 on 
that page refers to the civil case in which Maxwell gave 
deposition testimony on July 22nd, 2016, under the sare 
number, 15 Civ. 7344. 
Turning now to Grand Jury Exhibit 2. Slue 22 el 
that exhibit contains the first page of the deposition 
transcript from the testimony that Maxwell gave on 
April 22nd, 2016. As you can see here, the docket number

EFTA00008712

United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
07/08/20 
for that case is in fact 15 Civ. 7433 not 7344. 
Similarly, slide 25 contains the first page of cite 
transcript from the July 22nd, 2016 deposition that Maxwell 
gave. As you can see here, again, the docket number for 
that case is 15 Civ. 7433 not 7344. 
Finally, I will turn to the proposed indictment, 
Grand Jury Exhibit 4. On page 15, you have again the same 
perjury count with one change. Paragraph 21 corrects the 
docket number for the civil case to be 15 Civ. 7433. 
Similarly, on page 16, which contains the second 
perjury count for the July 22nd, 2016 deposition, the docket 
number is corrected to 15 Civ. 7433. There are otherwise no 
changes to the substance of this indictment. 
That is my presentation. Before I leave you to 
deliberate, would anyone like me to read the full proposed 
superseding indictment out loud? I see no hands. 
I must advise you that you must independently find 
probable cause, again, for each count in the superseding 
indictment. The evidence before you in support of the 
charges in the superseding indictment is the same evidence 
that was before you when you considered the indictment last 
week. 
Does anyone have any questions about that 
evidence? I see no hands. 
The legal instructions that you received before

that apply to your consideration of the proposed superseding 
indictment. Would anyone like me to read those instructions 
out loud for you again? I see no hands. 
Does anyone have any questions about the legal 
instructions? I see no hands. 
I will leave you now with the exhibits to 
deliberate. As always, if you have any questions or 
concerns about the proposed indictment, please let me know 
before you vote so that I may answer any questions you may 
have on the law, or bring any additional evidence before you 
to consider. Thank you, all.

Dear Jeffrey: 
I have talked to you and Ghislaine on several occasions to 
say thank you. But, I wanted to express in writing my 
personal and professional gratitude for the very generous 
gift f $20 
for a new scholarship lodge. It is truly 
an extraordinary 
sture. 
Under the charitable contribution act, you are 
permitted use of the lodge for two weeks each 
year, without any negative implications in respect 
to the full tax deductibility of your gift. 
Naturally, we would like you to visit the new 
lodge this summer. So that we might begin to book 
the lodge, I would ask you to consider what two 
weeks you would like reserved for your use. 
Perlman will be giving his concert on August 7, 
1994. I have enclosed the appropriate tax code 
for your file.

Ladies and gentlemen, some of the 
testimony you are going to hear from Detective 
will 
include hearsay. That means he is not going to testify only 
from his own personal observations, he will also be 
testifying about what other people have told him and what he 
has read in documents. 
Hearsay evidence, as you know, is admissible and 
proper in these proceedings, and you are permitted to rely 
on it in determining whether there is probable cause to 
indict the defendant, but if you want to hear testimony from 
other witnesses, or see particular documents, please let me 
know, and I will make my best efforts to bring those before 
you.

Q. 
"When you say grooming, did she explain what she 
meant by that?" 
A. 
"She meant that they were building a relationship

turn sexual."

grooming her, is that right?"

A. 
"Grooming is when someone builds a relationship 
with a child. They will find a vulnerability or a need and 
then they work on gaining that child's trust. And then 
often times gaining a parent's trust. Once they have that 
trust, they show that in ways that they can care about them; 
like giving them gifts and promises. And then once that's 
established, they then turn the relationship sexual; often 
times, making sexual comments and normalizing the behavior."

describing, that 
told you about, did 
say whether 
Epstein ever gave her anything?"

give the cash to her mom because he knew that they needed 
it. He paid for her voice lessons as well."

has 
characterized these visits now, but based on your 
conversations with her, at the time did she feel that these 
visits were strange at all?"

normalized it for her. She was like a cool, older sister

have photographs taken and that she had to be comfortable in 
her underwear and not be a prude. When she was asked what 
she meant by that, he pulled her into his lap and

to that female for about 20 minutes, and Mr. 
could 
not hear the conversation. Maxwell then got back in the car 
and drove back to Epstein's house. Shortly thereafter, 
later that day, that same girl arrived at the house. She 
soon became a regular at the house, and 
learned --

Q. 
Are two such flights reflected on this slide? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
I'd like to ask you to please walk the grand jury 
through those two flight records. 
A. 
On December 11th and December 14th of 2000, you 
can see all the way at the bottom of the page, on the 
left-hand side it's marked 11 and 14; the first flight goes 
from PBI to Teterboro, which is Palm Beach in Florida and 
Teterboro is in New Jersey. On that flight was Epstein, 
Maxwell, and 
among others. The next 
flight, on the 14th, goes from Teterboro to the 
Virgin Islands. On that flight is Epstein, Maxwell, 
among others. 
Q. 
Based on your understanding of 
date of birth, how old was 
on these two flights? 
A. 
Seventeen.

among others. That was from Teterboro to 
Palm Beach. 
Down a little bit further there's another date 
that appears to be January 28th of 2001, although the 8 
seems like it's a little faded, but does appear to be late 
January 2001. On that flight is Jeffrey Epstein, 
Ghislaine Maxwell, and 
among others. 
And the last flight is the 30th of January, also 
2001; this flight's had Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, 
and 
on that flight. 
Q. 
Based on your review of flight records for 
Jeffrey Epstein's private jet have you found multiple 
additional flights in 2001 that 
took with 
Epstein and Maxwell when she was still 17 years old? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Have you reviewed certain phone records from the 
year 2004?

Police Department? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q• 
During that search did the police recover message 
pads from the residence? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Would you please explain to the grand jury what 
message pads are? 
A. 
Sure. So message pads, in this particular 
instance, were pads that Epstein kept next to each of his 
phones in his residence. If someone was to call, whoever 
would answer that phone would jot down a note as to who the 
person was that was calling, who they were asking for, the 
time and date, and their phone numbers, and any specific 
message they wanted to leave. 
Q. 
Have you reviewed the message pads that were 
recovered from Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence in 
2005? 
with 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Do those message pads include several messages 
name and/or phone number on them? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Do those message-pad excerpts date between the 
years 2003 and 2005? 
A. 
Yes.

Yes. 
Q. 
Would you please walk the grand jury through these 
message pad excerpts? 
A. 
Sure. The first one says the message is for 
Mr. Epstein. The date is 3/1/2003. 
3/11? 
Q. 
I'm sorry, I think you said 3/1, did you mean 
A. 
I'm sorry. It's a little faded. 3/11/2003. The 
message is from

little faded here -- but says,

says it's for JE, Jeffrey Epstein; the date is March 16, 
2003; the message is from

Q. 
And just to remind the grand jury, did 
tell you that there were times when she would call to ask to 
massage Epstein so that she could get more money for drugs? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Turning to the next slide. Are these additional 
message pad excerpts seized from Jeffrey Epstein's 
Palm Beach residence in 2005?

A. 
Yes. Photographed was a massage table inside of 
the closet. 
Q. 
Have you told the grand jury everything you know 
about this case, or have you merely answered the questions 
that I've asked you? 
A. 
I've merely answered the questions. 
Q. 
When you testified about conversations you had 
with others, or documents you reviewed, did you testify to 
the exact words or just the substance?

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
x 
x 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
COUNT ONE 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
GM_GLSDN Y_00000346 
EFTA00008874

Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image: 
GM_GLSDNY_00000347 
EFTA00008875

4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
GM_GLSDNY_00000348 
EFTA00008876

massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
GM_GLSDNY_00000349 
EFTA00008877

directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A a multi-story private residence on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
photograph: 
GM_GLSDNY_00000350 
EFTA00008878

b. 
An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
GNI_GLSDNYJMNB51 
EFTA00008879

d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
GM_GLSDNY_00000352 
EFTA00008880

and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
GM_GLSDNY_00000353 
EFTA00008881

an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
8. 
In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

O Interlochen 
February 9, 1994 
Mr. Jeffrey Epstein 
J. Epstein and Company, Inc. 
The Villard House 
457 Madison Avenue 
New York, NY 10022 
Dear Jeffrey: 
I have talked to you and Ghislaine on several occasions to 
say thank you. But, I wanted to express in writing my 
personal and professional gratitude for the very generous 
gift gf $20O.O_00 for a new scholarship lodge. It is truly 
an extraordinarl-ge§ture. 
Under the charitable contribution act, you are 
permitted use of the lodge for two weeks each 
year, without any negative implications in respect 
to the full tax deductibility of your gift. 
Naturally, we would like you to visit the new 
lodge this summer. So that we might begin to book 
the lodge, I would ask you to consider what two 
weeks you would like reserved for your use. 
Perlman will be giving his concert on August 7, 
1994. I have enclosed the appropriate tax code 
for your file.

Enclosed is the envelope we recently found in cleaning the

ms. 
Ladies and gentlemen, let me just give 
you a brief instruction. Some of the testimony that you'll 
hear today will include what's called hearsay. As you know, 
that means that the witness will not be testifying solely 
from her own observations, but that she'll also be reporting 
to you what others have told her and what she's read in 
reports and documents prepared by other people. 
Hearsay evidence is admissible in these grand jury 
proceedings, and you're free to rely on it in determining 
whether there's probable cause to indict the proposed 
defendant. 
If, however, you would like to hear the testimony 
of any other witness, you have the right to request it and 
we will make reasonable efforts to bring that witness before 
you. 
BY MS..: 
Q. 
Special Agent

front of you a PowerPoint that is Grand Jury Exhibit 2, 
which we're entering into the record. Do you recognize 
this?

meant by that? 
A. 
She meant that they were building a relationship 
with her, giving her things, taking her places. And then 
usually when the grooming happens, an offender will -- once 
they gain that trust, they will make the relationship Lurn 
sexual. 
Q. 
Now, you testified just a moment ago that 
described to you that she felt at this time period that they 
were grooming her. Is that right? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Is that something that she realized at the time 
when she was 14, or is that something that she's described 
to you now? 
A. 
Something she's described now. She didn't realize 
that at the time.

a moment, but just to give context are you familiar with the 
term grooming based on your experience investigating crimes 
involving a sexual exploitation of minors?

moment ago, but if you just could explain in full. What is

they work on gaining a child's trust, and then oftentimes 
gaining a parent's trust. Once they have that trust, they 
show that in ways that they care about them by giving them 
gifts and promises. And then once that's established, they 
then turn the relationship sexual, oftentimes making sexual 
comments and normalizing the behavior. 
Q. 
Now, during these visits that you've been 
describing that 
told you about, did 
say whether 
Epstein ever gave her anything? 
A. 
Yes, she did. 
Q. 
What did he give her? 
A. 
He gave her cash. Sometimes he'd tell her to give 
the cash to her mom because he knew that they needed it. He 
paid for her voice lessons as well. 
Q. 
Now, you were describing how 
has 
characterized these visits now. But based on your 
conversations with her, at the time did she feel that these 
visits were strange at all? 
A. 
She thought they were strange, but Maxwell 
normalized it for her. She was like a cool older sister and 
made comments like this is what grownups do. 
Q. 
You used the phrase cool older sister. Is that a 
phrase that 
used to describe how she felt about 
Maxwell at the time and what Maxwell was like? 
A. 
Yes, those are her words.

Generally speaking, in broad strokes, what was the 
lawsuit about? What was the claim that 
was bringing 
against Maxwell? 
A.

abused by Epstein and Maxwell as a minor. Maxwell came 
forward publically and called her a liar. So 
sued 
her for defamation.

So just a small legal instruction on 
this topic. Ladies and gentleman, I instruct you that the 
allegations in the lawsuit are not being presented to you as 
evidence that those incidents occurred. I instruct you that 
you should not consider those allegations for their truth; 
instead, the circumstances of the lawsuit are being 
presented to you so that you can consider the context of the 
case and the circumstances under which Maxwell made 
statements under oath.

GRAND JURY 
EXHIBIT 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
x 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
x 
S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
COUNT ONE 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 16. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
GM_GLSDN Y_00000470 
EFTA00008998

Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
' 3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image: 
GIA_GLSDNYJKENM71 
EFTA00008999

4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
GM_GLSDN Y_00000472 
EFTA00009000

massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
GM_GJ_SDNY_00000473 
EFTA00009001

directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A a multi-story private residence on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan, New. York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
photograph: 
GM_GJ_SDNY_00000474 
EFTA00009002

b. 
An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
GM_GJ_SDNY_00000475 
EFTA00009003

d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
GM_GLSDNY_00000476 
EFTA00009004

and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 16 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
GM_GLSDN Y_00000477 
EFTA00009005

an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
8. 
In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

abuse of minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein, including some of the
