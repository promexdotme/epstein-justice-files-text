5. 
Defendant EPSTEIN is a natural person, who is an adult, and who resides 
and/or does business in Palm Beach County, Florida, and who committed the acts alleged 
within the jurisdiction of Palm Beach County, Florida, within the boundaries of the United 
States District Court in and for the Southern District of Florida. Defendant KELLEN is a 
natural person, who is an adult, believed to reside in the State of New York, but who 
committed the acts alleged within the jurisdiction of Palm Beach County, Florida, within the 
boundaries of the United States District Court in and for the Southern District of Florida. 
6. 
Defendant EPSTEIN is believed to now be incarcerated in the Palm Beach 
County Jail for crimes committed that are related to and/or similar to the claims in this case. 
FACTS 
7. 
Defendant EPSTEIN was, at all times relevant to this action, a part time 
resident of Palm Beach County, Florida. All acts complained of herein occurred at his estate 
residence in the Town of Palm Beach, Florida. 
8. 
Defendant EPSTEIN has a history of enticing young women, who are minors 
(under 18 years of age), and soliciting them to engage in prostitution for his own sexual 
gratification. 
9. 
Defendant EPSTEIN, in agreement with two (2) persons he employed for this 
purpose, HALEY ROBSON and Defendant KELLEN, conspired with these other two, and 
others, to solicit young women of the type Defendant EPSTEIN preferred, blonde, attractive 
in appearance, and younger than 18 years of age, to provide sexual gratification for him by 
engaging in acts of prostitution. 
10. 
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN entered into a criminal conspiracy to 
solicit young women for acts of prostitution, including the Plaintiff, here in Palm Beach 
County.

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/25/2009   Page 3 of 5
11. 
From about June, 2003 until on or about February, 2005, Defendants 
EPSTEIN and KELLEN persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to come to Defendant 
EPSTEIN's home and provide Defendant EPSTEIN with "massages" which escalated into 
sexual encounters between Defendant EPSTEIN and the Plaintiff designed to fulfill his 
unnatural sexual desires for young women or even younger girls who were minors. These 
acts included Defendant EPSTEIN's request that he wanted the encounter to be like a 
"porn video." Defendant EPSTEIN would script lines for the Plaintiff to say, including calling 
out his name and requesting that he perform a certain sexual act "harder,"while he touched 
the Plaintiffs vagina with a vibrator or with his fingers; alternately, he would masturbate in 
the presence of the Plaintiff after demanding her to disrobe and walk in front of him in 
provocative sexual poses. Defendant EPSTEIN would pay the Plaintiff a fee of $200 on 
each occasion after he ejaculated while masturbating in the presence of the Plaintiff. 
12. 
Defendant EPSTEIN touched Plaintiffs vagina, or penetrated Plaintiffs 
vagina, using his fingers and/or a vibrator on multiple occasions, during the time that 
Plaintiff was a minor, causing personal injury to her. 
13. 
In violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422(b),Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN 
knowingly persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to engage in acts of prostitution, when 
the Plaintiff was under the age of 18, approximately on or about the following dates that 
Plaintiff can document based on payments received: 6/16/03, 7/2/03, 4/9/04, 6/7/04, 
7/30/04, 8/30/04, 10/9/04, 10/12/04, 10/30/04 and 11/9/04. In addition, Plaintiff believes that 
there were as many as 10 to 20 other occasions during this time frame that Defendant 
EPSTEIN solicited her and procured her to perform prostitution services, all during the time 
that she was a minor. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/25/2009   Page 4 of 5
14. 
Plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 
§2255(a) for each of the acts of prostitution set forth above for which Defendants solicited 
her, $150,000 for each violation, for a total range of damages between $1.5 million dollars 
to $4.5 million dollars, jointly and severally, and a reasonable attorney's fees and costs, as 
permitted by the statute. 
15. 
Defendant EPSTEIN has made an agreement with the United States 
Attorney's Office to not contest liability for claims brought exclusively pursuant to 18 U .S.C. 
§2255, in exchange for avoiding federal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. §2422(b), which 
provides a sentence of 10 years for each violation of the law. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment in her favor, and a jury trial on all issues 
so triable as of right.

ORDER 
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order Against
Piecemeal Depositions of Jane Doe No.’s 2, 3, 4, and 7 and Motion to Consolidate Cases for
Purposes of Discovery (DE 66 in 08-80119; DE 58 in 08-80232; DE 73 in 08-80380; DE 23 in
08-80993).  The Court has reviewed the motions, responses, replies, and is otherwise fully
advised in the premesis.  It is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order Against Piecemeal Depositions is GRANTED,
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).  As to each of the ten above-styled cases, Defendant is limited
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 6   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2009   Page 3 of 4

to a single deposition of each Plaintiff, during which Defendant may depose the plaintiff as both
a party and a witness to all other cases of a similar nature of which the plaintiff deposed is aware. 
Defendant should not expect to be able to re-depose any plaintiff relative to any new cases that
may be filed.  Therefore, Defendant should examine each plaintiff about the facts relating to all
individuals of whom they are aware, regardless of whether an individual has in fact filed a claim
against Defendant.  In the event additional cases are filed, upon a showing of good cause, the
Court will determine whether Defendant will be permitted to re-depose any of the plaintiffs as
witnesses to the allegations made in those newly filed cases.  
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Consolidate Cases for Purposes of Discovery is GRANTED.  In the
interests of judicial economy and efficiency, cases 08-80119, 08-80232, 08-80380, and 08-80993
are hereby CONSOLIDATED for purposes of discovery only.  
Additionally, the parties in the other six above-styled causes (08-80381, 08-80994,
08-80811, 08-80893 09-80469, 09-80591) are hereby ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE on or
before May 5, 2009 why all of the cases should not be consolidated for discovery purposes.

DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS COURT'S ORDER TO 
SHOW CAUSE AS WHY ALL CASES SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED FOR DISCOVERY 
PURPOSES AND MOTION TO CLARIFY THE COURT'S ORDER DATED APRIL 28, 2009 
Defendant, JEFFERY EPSTEIN, (EPSTEIN), by and through his undersigned 
attorneys, hereby files his Response in Opposition to this Court's Order to Show Cause 
as to Why All Cases Should Not be Consolidated for Purposes of Discovery and Motion 
for Clarification of this Court's Order on general consolidation of discovery (DE 6), and 
states: 
I. 
Response In Opposition 
Defendant has no further objections to consolidating these cases for 
purposes of depositions as outlined in this Court's April 28, 2009 Order. 
However, to consolidate the cases for purposes of all "discovery" including, but 
not limited to, motion practice and related orders thereto will, without question, confuse 
many of the individual discovery issues raised not only by Epstein as to the individual 
Plaintiffs that have brought separate lawsuits against him, but will also confuse the 
individual discovery issues raised by those same individual Plaintiffs as to Epstein. This 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 2 of 5
Page2 
will undoubtedly lead to several motions to clarify certain orders which will seek 
explanation from the court as to how those orders affect Epstein as to each individual 
Plaintiff's discovery requests and vice versa (i.e., how those future orders affect the 
individual Plaintiffs' discovery requests directed to Epstein). 
It is important to note that each related Federal matter before this court has its 
very own distinct set of facts and defenses thereto. As such, the discovery served and 
the responses received are particular and individualized as to both Plaintiff and 
Defendant. 
As such, discovery of "all" cases for general discovery consolidation 
(separate and apart from depositions) will only cloud rulings on discovery and will result 
in more attorney labor and judicial resources, which will inevitably be spent on motions 
for clarification. 
Each Plaintiff and Epstein have served and will in the future serve separate 
requests for production, separate interrogatories, separate requests for admissions, and 
separate motions to compel, responses and replies addressing certain discovery issues. 
Obviously, both Plaintiff and Defendant will base their discovery related arguments on 
the particularized facts of each case, which are separate and distinct from one another. 
Moreover, the Plaintiffs will likely seek to retain different experts to support their 
individual claims. In that regard, how will a general consolidation of discovery impact 
discovery related to those experts' individualized opinions? 
As this court is aware, certain case management orders are in place setting the 
parameters of discovery. It is unclear how Plaintiffs' Motion to Consolidate and the 
Courts Order will handle the potential problems and any other potential discovery 
related issues outlined above. In fact, it appears that Jane Doe, in Case No. 08-CV-

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 3 of 5
Page 3 
80893 (DE 47), has expressed her own reasons for opposing the consolidation all the 
cases for discovery purposes. Obviously, Jane Doe's counsel, like the undersigned, 
anticipates that discovery issues will present themselves if general consolidation occurs 
and does not want it to impact her case. 
In fact, the debates have already begun in 
light of this Court's April 29, 2009 Order and the responses filed addressing same. This 
provides the court with a glimpse of what will occur if general consolidation occurs, in 
particular, how attorney resources and judicial resources will be unnecessarily used. 
In addition, the initial style of each case should be maintained in pleadings and in 
orders in an effort to maintain organization and application of the rulings this court 
espouses for each case. Utilizing a compound multiple-type style will only confuse 
cases that should be kept separate for all discovery purposes. 
II. 
Motion for Clarification of this Court's April 28, 2009 Order 
This Court ruled that cases 08-80119, 08-80232, 08-80380 and 08-80993 are 
consolidated for discovery purposes. 
Epstein not only objects to the court's 
consolidation order but seeks clarification from this Court as to how consolidation of 
general discovery will impact motion practice and orders in the above cases. What does 
the court mean when it says the above cases are consolidated "for purposes of 
discovery only?" How does consolidation operate? The concerns addressing general 
discovery consolidation are set out above and are therefore incorporated herein. 
Likewise, for those reasons, the court should reverse its ruling on consolidation and 
issue a new order maintaining the individuality of each case for discovery purposes. 
In addition, Epstein not only objects to the court's potential consolidation of case 
numbers 08-80381, 08-80994, 08-80811, 08-80893, 09-80469 and 09-80591 for 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 9   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2009   Page 4 of 5
Page4 
general discovery purposes, but respectfully requests that this court clarify how 
consolidation of general discovery will impact motion practice and orders in the above 
cases should this court choose to consolidate same for discovery. Again, how does 
consolidation operate? 
The concerns addressing general discovery consolidation are 
set out above and are therefore incorporated herein. 
In short, the Motions seeking consolidation for discovery purposes only do not 
delineate how consolidation operates. 
As such, the Order granting the Motions to 
Consolidate for discovery purposes only does not provide any additional information 
addressing how consolidation will operate. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court not consolidate case numbers 
08-80381, 08-80994, 08-80811, 08-80893, 09-80469 and 09-80591, that it clarify its 
order as to consolidation of case numbers 08-80119, 08-80232, 08-80380 and 08-
80993 (or the future consolidation of other cases) and that it reverse its April 28, 2009 
ruling on general consolidation in light of the potential problems presented in this 
response, that an order be entered requiring the parties to utilize the style secured by 
the initial case filing and not a compound-case style incorporating all case styles in one 
particular document, and for such other and further relief a;Jtiis Court -~eems just and 
proper.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CIV• 80469 - MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE II, 
Plaintiff, 
V. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
_____________ / 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S UNOPPOSED MOTION TO EXCEED PAGE 
LIMITATION FOR DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS & SUPPORTING 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW DIRECTED TO PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his undersigned counsel, moves 
to exceed the page limitation of 20 pages imposed by Loe. Gen. Rule 7.1. C. 2. (S.D. 
Fla.), in his memorandum of law in support of his motion to dismiss directed to Plaintiff 
JANE DOE ll's Complaint [DE 1], filed March 25, 2009. 
In support of his motion, 
Defendant states: 
1. Local Gen. Rule 7.1 C. 2. provides in part that absent prior permission of the 
court, no party shall file any legal memorandum exceeding 20 pages in length. 
Defendant is in the process of preparing his motion to dismiss and supporting 
memorandum of law directed to Plaintiffs Complaint, (which is due by an extension to 
May 6, 2009), and the legal memorandum will exceed the 20 page limitation. It is clear 
based on the issues raised in Plaintiff's Complaint that in excess of 20 pages is required 
to fully and adequately discuss the issues raised in moving to dismiss Plaintiff's action. 
2. The issues being addressed include but are not limited to constitutional law 
issues and what version of 18 U.S.C.A. §2255 applies to this action, and the meaning of 
§2255 with respect to the cause of action created and the presumptive minimum

Page2 
damages amount imposed. (It is Defendant's position that the 2006 amended version 
does NOT apply to this action; rather, it is the statute in effect during the time of the 
alleged conduct that apply). 
3. Plaintiff's Complaint seeks to multiple the presumptive minimum damages 
amount under 18 U.S.C. §2255 and references the 2006 amended version of the 
statute, which most significantly increased triple-fold the presumptive minimum 
damages amount imposed from $50,000 to $150,000. 
4. A length exceeding 20 pages is required so that Defendant may fully address the 
issues raised in Plaintiff's Complaint and in seeking dismissal thereof. 
Under the 
constitutional guarantees of due process, including a fair and full opportunity to be 
heard, and in the interests of justice so that the Court may render a fully informed 
decision on the issue, Defendant is entitled to an order granting his motion to exceed 
the page limitation. 
(Excluding endnotes, quoting statutory text and Complaint 
allegations, it appears that Defendant's legal memorandum will be approximately 24 to 
pages.) 
5. As certified below herein, Plaintiff's counsel agreed to the request to exceed 20 
pages. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court grant Defendant's 
motion, and enter an order allowing Defendant's legal memorandum in support of 
dismissal of Plaintiff's action to be in excess of 20 pages.

Defendant EPSTEIN was, at all times relevant to this action, a part time resident of 
Palm Beach, Florida. All acts complained of herein occurred at his estate residence in Palm Beach, 
Florida. 
8. 
Defendant EPSTEIN has a history of enticing young women, under the age of consent, 
to private sessions that begin with massages and evolve, through his acts of solicitation by use ofhis 
lavish wealth, into sexual encounters, wherein Defendant EPSTEIN fulfills sexual fantasies by using 
said young women. 
9. 
Defendant EPSTEIN, in agreement with two (2) persons he employed for this 
purpose, HALEY ROBSON and Defendant KELLEN, conspired with these other two Defendants to

younger than the age of legal consent, to provide sexual gratification for him. 
10. 
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN entered into a criminal conspiracy to solicit 
young women for acts of prostitution, including the Plaintiff.

to designed to fulfill his unnatural sexual desires for young women or even younger girls who were 
under the age of consent. These acts included his requests that he wanted the encounter to be like a 
"porn video." Defendant EPSTEIN would script lines for Plaintiff to say, including calling out his 
name and requesting that he perform a certain sexual act "harder,"while he touched the Plaintiff's 
vagina with a vibrator or with his fingers; alternately, he would masturbate in the presence of the 
Plaintiff after demanding her to disrobe and walk in front of him in provocative sexual poses. 
12. 
Defendant EPSTEIN touched Plaintiff's vagina, or penetrated Plaintiff's vagina, using 
his fingers and/or a vibrator on multiple occasions, during the time that Plaintiff was a minor.

injuries, severe emotional distress, mental anguish and distress, humiliation and embarrassment and 
continues to suffer so today.

V. 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CIV- 80469 - MARRA/JOHNSON 
Plaintiff, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
--------------'/ 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S 
COMPLAINT, AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, (hereinafter "Epstein"), by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, moves to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for failure to state a cause 
of action, and for more definite statement. 
Rule 12(b)(6), (e), Fed.R.Civ.P. (2008); 
Local Gen. Rule 7.1 (S.D. Fla. 2008). In support of dismissal, Defendant states: 
At the outset, Defendant gives notice to the Court that issues pertaining to 18 
U.S.C. §2255 in this motion to dismiss are also raised in the case of C.M.A. v. Jeffrey 
Epstein, Case No. 08-CV-80811-MARRA/JOHNSON, in Defendant's Motion to Dismiss 
directed to Plaintiff C.M.A.'s Amended Complaint, Plaintiff C.M.A.'s Response, and 
Defendant's reply to C.M.A.'s response (which has yet to be filed). 
In this action, Plaintiff's Complaint attempts to allege a cause of action pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. §2255 -
Civil Remedies for Personal Injuries. 
Significantly, Plaintiff 
previously a filed lawsuit on July 10, 2008, based on the same facts as alleged herein in 
the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit In and For Palm Beach County, State of Florida, Case No. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 2 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 2 
2008CA020614 MBAF, Jane Doe II v. Jeffrey Epstein, and Sarah Kellen, (hereinafter 
"state action"). 
In attempting to allege a claim under 18 U.S.C. §2255, Plaintiff 
improperly relies on the §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 2006. As discussed 
more fully below herein, the statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct 
applies. 
Dismissal is required on several grounds: (1) Plaintiff previously filed a state action 
approximately 1 0 months ago against the same defendant involving the same alleged 
facts; (2) Plaintiff improperly relies on 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 
2006, rather than the version of the statute in effect during the time of the alleged 
conduct; (3) Plaintiff improperly asserts that the presumptive damages minimum under 
§2255 is subject to multiplication on a per violation basis; (4) Plaintiff has failed to allege 
a cause of action under 18 U.S.C. §2255 as she has failed to sufficiently allege facts 
constituting a predicate act; (5) Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action of 
conspiracy to violate §2255. 
Supporting Memorandum of Law 
I. Court is required to dismiss Plaintiff's action as there is already pending 
a previously filed state action arising from the same factual allegations. 
Exceptional circumstances merit the dismissal of this action as Plaintiff first filed 
a lawsuit on July 10, 2008, in the in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit In and For Palm Beach 
County, State of Florida, Case No. 50 2008CA020614 MBAF, Jane Doe II v. Jeffrey 
Epstein, and Sarah Kellen, based on the same factual allegations that she asserts in the 
instant case. Attached here to as Exhibit A is Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint filed 
in the state action. A comparison of the complaint allegations of fact in the state and 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 3 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 3 
federal actions reveals that they are almost identical. Based on the same allegations, in 
the state action, Plaintiff attempts to assert claims based on state law for Sexual Battery 
(Count I) and Civil Conspiracy (Count II); in this action, Plaintiff is attempting to assert a 
cause of action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, which applicable version provides -
PART I--CRIMES 
CHAPTER 110--SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND OTHER ABUSE OF CHILDREN 
§ 2255. Civil remedy for personal injuries 
(a) Any minor who is a victim of a violation of section 2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 
2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers personal 
injury as a result of such violation may sue in any appropriate United States District 
Court and shall recover the actual damages such minor sustains and the cost of the 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as described in the preceding 
sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than $50,000 in 
value. 
{b) Any action commenced under this section shall be barred unless the complaint is 
filed within six years after the right of action first accrues or in the case of a person 
under a legal 
disability, 
not 
later than 
three 
years 
after the 
disability.

1783-75, and amended Pub.L. 99-591, Title I,§ 101(b) [Title VII,§ 703(a)], Oct. 30,

(Emphasis added). 
Plaintiff is likely to argue that the jurisdiction of the federal court over §2255 claims 
is exclusive. However, unlike other Congressional enactments, there is no language in 
the statute which expressly states that jurisdiction of such cause of action lies 
exclusively with the federal courts. Furthermore, there is a presumption of concurrent 
jurisdiction of state courts. See generally, Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Donnelly, 494 
U.S. 820,823, 110 S.Ct. 1566, 1568-69 (1990). "Under our 'system of dual sovereignty, 
we have consistently held that state courts have inherent authority, and are thus 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 4 of 29

Page 4 
presumptively competent to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the United 
States."' 
Id, and cases cited therein. 
Significantly, in order to give federal courts 
exclusive jurisdiction over a federal cause of action, Congress must, in an exercise of its 
powers under the Supremacy Clause, affirmatively divest state courts of their 
presumptively concurrent jurisdiction. ]Q. 
§2255, unlike other federal statutes, does not unequivocally state that the 
jurisdiction of the federal court is exclusive or that it takes away the presumptive 
jurisdiction of the state courts. See e.g., 28 U.S.C. §1338(a)(" ... Such jurisdiction shall 
be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent, plant variety protection and copyright 
cases.") As phrased, the statute uses the term "may" which under a plain meaning 
analysis is permissive as opposed to mandatory. The omission of any such exclusive 
jurisdictional provision is strong evidence of Congress' intent. Yellow Freight, supra. 
The fact that the statute is completely silent on the role of the state courts in such a 
cause of action still does not overcome the presumption of concurrent jurisdiction. ld. 1 
Because concurrent jurisdiction exists over this federal claim, the six factor analysis 
as discussed in American Bankers Ins. Co. v. First State Ins. Co., 891 F.2d 882, 884 
(11th Cir. 1990), applies in determining whether the exceptional circumstances exist 
requiring dismissal of the federal action in favor of the first filed action. As explained in 
by the Eleventh Circuit in American Bankers Ins. Co., because EPSTEIN is seeking 
dismissal of this action in deference to a pending state court action, "it is governed by 
See 45 U.S.C. §56, pertaining to liability for injuries to railroad employees, as an example of a 
federal statute which expressly states that "jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under 
this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several states." 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 5 of 29

Page 5 
the principles articulated in Colorado River Water Conserv. Dist. v. United States, 424 
U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976) and Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. 
Mercury Constr., 460 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)." 
The six factors considered are (1) whether one of the courts has assumed 
jurisdiction over property; (2) the inconvenience of the federal forum; (3) the potential for 
piecemeal litigation; (4) the order in which the forums obtained jurisdiction; (5) whether 
state or federal law will be applied; and (6) the adequacy of the state court to protect the 
parties' rights. 
"The test for determining when exceptional circumstances exist, 
therefore, involves the careful balancing of six factors. The weight to be given any one 
factor may vary greatly depending on the case; however, the balance is "heavily 
weighted" in favor of the federal court exercising jurisdiction. Id. at 16, 103 S.Ct. at 937." 
American Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida v. First State Ins. Co., 891 F.2d 882, 884 (11th 
Cir. 1990). The list of factors is neither exhaustive, nor is it a mechanical checklist. See 
AM.JUR. FED. COURTS, § 1114. 
In the instant case, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth factors are implicated. 
Clearly, more than a "potential" for piecemeal litigation exists if Plaintiff were allowed to 
proceed in two separate forums alleging the identical facts against the identical parties. 
Discovery and rulings thereon would involve the same set of facts, yet could result in 
inconsistent and varying rulings thereon. Should the cases proceed separately to trial, 
factual findings and judgments rendered in one could be inconsistent with the other. 
Appeals would proceed separately and in a piecemeal fashion. The piecemeal effect 
would be both excessive and deleterious if these cases were to proceed in parallel 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 6 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 6 
fashion. The state court obtained jurisdiction over the action first as Plaintiff chose to 
first file in state court. See Exhibit A hereto. Defendant has already filed his answer 
and affirmative defenses and discovery is ongoing in the state action. As to the fifth 
factor, state law will be applied to Plaintiff's attempted state law claims for sexual battery 
and conspiracy, while federal substantive law will apply to the 18 U.S.C. §2255 claim. 
Finally, the state court is perfectly capable and able to protect the rights of the parties. 
In fact, there are currently before the 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach County, 
Florida, additional cases against EPSTEIN based on similar allegations of sexual 
exploitation and abuse. 
In the Jane Doe II state action, an Order was entered 
reassigning the state action to a Division in which other Jane Doe cases against 
EPSTEIN had been filed. See "Clerk's Notice Of Reassignment," dated April 10, 2009, 
and attached hereto as Exhibit B. 
The state court is well aware of the underlying 
factual allegations which are identical in both cases and which form the basis of the 
state and federal' claims which Plaintiff is attempting to pursue. 
Accordingly, in balancing these factors, Defendant is entitled to dismissal of the 
federal court action. Plaintiff should not be allowed to pursue parallel actions in state 
and federal court based o the identical underlying factual allegations. Her claims should 
be brought in one forum - state court - so that Defendant is not forced to defend himself 
in two separate forums. 
II. 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect prior to the 2006 amendments applies to this action. 
A. The statute in effect during the time the alleged conduct occurred is 18 U.S.C. 
§2255 (2005) - the version in effect prior to the 2006 amendment, eff. Jul. 27, 2006,

(quoted above). See endnote 1 hereto, Complaint ,111, 13.1 It is an axiom of law that 
"retroactivity is not favored in the law." Bowen, 488 U.S., at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471 
(1988). As eloquently stated in Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1497, 
511 U.S. 244, 265-66 (1994): 
. . . the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our 
jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. 
Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an 
opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled 
expectations should not be lightly disrupted.FN,s For that reason, the "principle that the 
legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when 
the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 855, 
110 S.Ct., at 1586 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in 
both commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people 
confidence about the legal consequences of their actions. 
FN18. See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 191, 112 S.Ct. 1105, 
1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation presents problems of 
unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation, 
because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled 
transactions"); [Further citations omitted]. 
It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity principle finds expression in 
several provisions of our Constitution. The Ex Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits 
retroactive application of penal legislation_FN19 Article I,§ 10, cl. 1, prohibits States from 
passing another type of retroactive legislation, laws "impairing the Obligation of 
Contracts." The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the Legislature (and other 
government actors) from depriving private persons of vested property rights except for 
a "public use" and upon payment of "just compensation." The prohibitions on "Bills of 
Attainder'' in Art. I, §§ 9-10, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons 
and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e.g., United States v. 
Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 456-462, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 1719-1722, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965). The 
Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be 
compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification sufficient to validate a statute's 
prospective application under the Clause "may not suffice" to warrant its retroactive 
application. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2893, 
L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). 
FN19. Article I contains two Ex Post Facto Clauses, one directed to Congress (§ 9, 
cl. 3), the other to the States (§ 10, cl. 1 ). We have construed the Clauses as 
applicable only to penal legislation. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390-391, 1 L. Ed. 
648 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.).

These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular concerns. 
The Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations 
suddenly and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures 
poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of 
retribution against unpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall observed in his 
opinion for **1498 the Court in Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 
L.Ed.2d 17 (1981), the Ex Post Facto Clause not only ensures that individuals have 
"fair warning" about the effect of criminal statutes, but also "restricts governmental 
power by restraining arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation." Id., at 28-29, 101 
S.Ct., at 963-964 (citations omitted). FN20 
FN20. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 513-514, 109 S.Ct. 706, 
732, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) ("Legislatures are primarily policymaking bodies that 
promulgate rules to govern future conduct. The constitutional prohibitions against 
the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder reflect a valid concern 
about the use of the political process to punish or characterize past conduct of 
private citizens. It is the judicial system, rather than the legislative process, that is 
best equipped to identify past wrongdoers and to fashion remedies that will create 
the conditions that presumably would have existed had no wrong been committed") 
(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); James v. United 
States, 366 U.S. 213, 247, n. 3, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1052, n. 3, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) 
(retroactive punitive measures may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous 
conduct generally but to impose by legislation a penalty against specific persons or 
classes of persons"). 
As discussed more fully below herein, these well entrenched constitutional 
protections and presumptions against retroactive application of legislation establish that 
U.S.C. §2255 (2005) in effect at the time of the alleged conduct applies to the instant 
action, and not the amended version as claimed by Plaintiff. 
B. Not only is there no clear express intent stating that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, but applying the current version of the statute, as amended in 2006, would 
be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution as it 
would be applied to events occurring before its enactment and would increase the 
penalty or punishment for the alleged crime. U.S. Const. Art. 1, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1.

(Calder) (1798). 
The United States Constitution provides that "[n]o Bill of Attainder or ex post 
facto Law shall be passed" by Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3. A law 
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it" 'appli[es] to events occurring before its 
enactment ... [and] disadvantage[s] the offender affected by it' by altering the 
definition of criminal conduct or increasing the punishment for the crime." Lynce 
v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997) (quoting Weaver 
v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981)). 
U.S. v. Siegel,153 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11
th Cir. 1998). 
In improperly attempting to multiply the presumptive minimum actual damages 
amount, Plaintiff's Complaint alleges a time period "from about June, 2003 until on or 
about February, 2005." See endnote 1. 
In paragraph 14 of her Complaint, Plaintiff 
references the 2006 amended version of §2255 which raised the presumptive actual 
damages amount from $50,000 to $150,000; Plaintiff also improperly claims that she is 
entitled to "$150,000 for each violation, for a total range of damages between $1.5 
million dollars to $4.5 million dollars, jointly and severally, .... " '1114. 
§2255 is contained in Title 18 of the United States Codes - "Crimes and Criminal 
Procedure, Part I. Crimes, Chap. 110. Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of 
Children." 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005), is entitled Civil remedy for personal injuries, and 
imposes a presumptive minimum of damages in the amount of $50,000, should Plaintiff 
prove any violation of the specified criminal statutes and that she suffered personal 
injury with actual damages sustained. 
Thus, the effect of the 2006 amendments, 
effective July 27, 2006, would be to triple the amount of the statutory minimum 
previously in effect during the time of the alleged acts. If one were to take Plaintiff's 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 10 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 10 
position, and multiply the increased damages amount on a per violation/incident basis, 
the result would be an increase in damages by 30 to 90 times more! Clearly, the result 
is punitive in nature. 
No case has yet decided the specific issue before this Court - whether application 
of the 2006 version of §2255, which increased the statutorily presumed minimum 
damages from $50,000 to $150,000, regardless of the actual amount of damages 
sustained, is prohibited from application under the Ex Post Fact Clause to the specified 
criminal acts occurring prior to the statutes effective date of July 27, 2006. The statute, 
as amended in 2006, contains no language stating that the application is to be 
retroactive. Thus, there is no manifest intent that the statute is to apply retroactively, 
and, accordingly, the statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct is to apply. 
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, supra, at 1493, ("A statement that a statute will become 
effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to 
conduct that occurred at an earlier date."). 
This statute was enacted as part of the Federal Criminal Statutes targeting sexual 
predators and sex crimes against children. H.R 3494, "Child Protection and Sexual 
Predator Punishment Act of 1998;" House Report No. 105-557, 11, 1998 U.S.C.A.N. 
678, 679 (1998). Quoting from the "Background and Need For Legislation" portion of 
the House Report No. 105-557, 11-16, H.R 3494, of which 18 U.S.C. §2255 is included, 
is described as "the most comprehensive package of new crimes and increased 
penalties ever developed in response to crimes against children, particularly assaults 
facilitated by computers." 
Further showing that §2255 was enacted as a criminal

Page 11 
penalty or punishment, "Title II - Punishing Sexual Predators," Sec. 206, from House 
Report No. 105-557, 5-6, specifically includes reference to the remedy created under 
§2255 as an additional means of punishing sexual predators, along with other penalties 
and punishments. Senatorial Comments in amending §2255 in 2006 confirm that the 
creation of the presumptive minimum damage amount is meant as an additional penalty 
against those who sexually exploit or abuse children. 2006 WL 2034118, 152 Cong. 
Rec. S8012-02. Senator Kerry refers to the statutorily imposed damage amount as 
"penalties." Id. 
The cases of U.S. v. Siegel, supra (11 th Cir. 1998), and U.S. v. Edwards, supra 
(3d Cir. 1998), also support Defendant's position that application of the current version 
of 18 U.S.C. §2255 would be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. In Siegel, 
the Eleventh Circuit found that the Ex Post Facto Clause barred application of the 
Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA) to the defendant whose criminal 
conduct occurred before the effective date of the statute, 18 U.S.C. §3664(f)(1 )(A), even 
though the guilty plea and sentencing proceeding occurred after the effective date of the 
statute. On July 19, 1996, the defendant Siegel pleaded guilty to various charges under 
U.S.C. §371 and §1956(a)(1)(A), (conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank 
fraud, and laundering of money instruments; and money laundering). 
He was 
sentenced on March 7, 1997. As part of his sentence, Siegel was ordered to pay 
$1,207,000.00 in restitution under the MVRA which became effective on April 24, 1996. 
Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1229-1236. The 1996 amendments to MVRA 
required that the district court must order restitution in the full amount of the victim's loss 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 12 of 29

Page 12 
without consideration of the defendant's ability to pay. Prior to the enactment of the 
MVRA and under the former 18 U.S.C. §3664(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection 
Act of 1982 (VWPA), Pub.I. No. 97-291, 96 Stat. 1248, the court was required to 
consider, among other factors, the defendant's ability to pay in determining the amount 
of restitution. 
When the MVRA was enacted in 1996, Congress stated that the amendments to 
the VWPA "shall, to the extent constitutionally permissible, be effective for sentencing 
proceedings in cases in which the defendant is convicted on or after the date of 
enactment of this Act [Apr. 24, 1996]." Siegel, supra at 1258. The alleged crimes 
occurred between February, 1988 to May, 1990. The Court agreed with the defendant's 
position that 1996 MVRA "should not be applied in reviewing the validity of the court's 
restitution order because to do so would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United 
States Constitution. See U.S. Const. art I, §9, cl. 3." 
The Ex Post Facto analysis made by the Eleventh Circuit in Siegel is applicable 
to this action. In resolving the issue in favor of the defendant, the Court first considered 
whether a restitution order is a punishment. Id, at 1259. In determining that restitution 
was a punishment, the Court noted that §3663A(a)(1) of Title 18 expressly describes 
restitution as a "penalty." In addition, the Court also noted that "[a]lthough not in the 
context of an ex post facto determination, ... restitution is a 'criminal penalty meant to 
have strong deterrent and rehabilitative effect.' United States v. Twitty, 107 F.3d 1482, 
1493 n. 12 (11th Cir.1997)." Second, the Court considered "whether the imposition of 
restitution under the MVRA is an increased penalty as prohibited by the Ex Post Facto 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 13 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 13 
Clause." Id, at 1259. 
In determining that the application of the 1996 MVRA would 
indeed run afoul of the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, the Court agreed with the 
majority of the Circuits that restitution under the 1996 MVRA was an increased penalty.
"The effect of the MVRA can be detrimental to a defendant. Previously, after 
considering the defendant's financial condition, the court had the discretion to order 
restitution in an amount less than the loss sustained by the victim. Under the MVRA, 
however, the court must order restitution to each victim in the full amount." kL at 1260. 
See also U.S. v. Edwards, 162 F.2d 87 (3
rd Circuit 1998). 
In the instant case, in answering the first question, it is clear that that imposition of 
a minimum amount of damages, regardless of the amount of actual damages suffered 
by a minor victim, is meant to be a penalty or punishment. See statutory text and 
House Bill Reports, cited above herein, consistently referring to the presumptive 
minimum damages amount under §2255 as "punishment" or "penalties." According to 
the Ex Post Facto doctrine, although §2255 is labeled a "civil remedy," such label is not 
dispositive; "if the effect of the statute is to impose punishment that is criminal in nature, 
the ex post facto clause is implicated." 
See generally, Roman Catholic Bishop of 
Oakland v. Superior Court, 28 Cal.Rptr.3d 355, at 360, citing Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 
U.S. 346, 360-61 (1997). The effect of applying the 2006 version of §2255 would be to 
triple the amount of the presumptive minimum damages to a minor who proves the 
The Eleventh Circuit, in holding that "the MVRA cannot be applied to a person whose criminal 
conduct occurred prior to April 24, 1996," was "persuaded by the majority of districts on this 
issue." "Restitution is a criminal penalty carrying with it characteristics of criminal punishment." 
Siegel, supra at 1260. The Eleventh Circuit is in agreement with the Second, Third, Eighth, 
Ninth, and D.C. Circuits. See U.S. v. Futrell, 209 F.3d 1286, 1289-90 (11
th Cir. 2000).

Page 14 
elements of her §2255 claim, or to increase to it 30 to 90 times more if one were to 
agree with Plaintiff's position. The fact that a plaintiff proceeding under §2255 has to 
prove a violation of a criminal statute and suffer personal injury to recover damages 
thereunder, further supports that the imposition of a minimum amount, regardless of a 
victim's actual damages sustained, is meant and was enacted as additional punishment 
or penalty for violation of criminal sexual exploitation and abuse of minors. 
Accordingly, this Court is required to apply the statute in effect at the time of the 
alleged criminal acts. Not only is there no language in the 2006 statute stating that it is 
to apply retroactively, but further, such application of the 2006 version of 18 U.S.C. 
§2255 to acts that occurred prior to its effective date would have a detrimental and 
punitive effect on Defendant by tripling (or increasing by 30 or 90 times under Plaintiff's 
interpretation) the presumptive minimum of damages available to a plaintiff, regardless 
of the actual damages suffered. 
C. As discussed above, 18 U.S.C. §2255 was enacted as part of the criminal 
statutory scheme to punish and penalize those who sexually exploit and abuse minors, 
and thus, the Ex Post Fact Clause prohibits a retroactive application of the 2006 
amended version. Even under the analysis provided by the United States Supreme 
Court in Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (1994), pertaining 
to civil statutes, not only is there no express intent by Congress to apply the new statute 
to past conduct, but also, the clear effect of retroactive application of the statute would 
be to increase the potential liability for past conduct from a minimum of $50,000 to 
$150,000, and thus in violation of the constitutional prohibitions against such 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 15 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 15 
application. As noted, 18 U.S.C. §2255 is entitled "Civil remedy for personal injuries." 
Notwithstanding this label, the statute was enacted as part of the criminal statutory 
scheme to punish those who sexually exploit and abuse minors. 
Regardless of the 
actual damages suffered or proven by a minor, as long as a minor proves violation of a 
specified statutory criminal act under §2255 and personal injury, the defendant is held 
liable for the statutory imposed minimum. 
As explained by the Landgraf court, supra at 280, and at 1505,3 
When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's 
first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's 
proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial 
default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the 
court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., 
whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's 
liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already 
completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption 
teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a 
result. 
Here, there is no clear expression of intent regarding the 2006 Act's application to 
conduct occurring well before its enactment. Clearly, however, as discussed in part B 
herein, the presumptive minimum amount of damages of $150,000 was enacted as an 
punishment or penalty upon those who sexually exploit and abuse minors. 
See 
discussion of House Bill Reports and Congressional background above herein. The 
amount triples the previous amount for which a defendant might be found liable, 
regardless of the amount of actual damages a plaintiff has suffered and proven. The new 
In Landgraf, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals 
and refused to apply new provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to conduct occurring before 
the effective date of the Act. The Court determined that statutory text in question, §102, was 
subject to the presumption against statutory retroactivity. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 16 of 29

Page 16 
statute imposes a substantial increase in the monetary liability for past conduct. (As 
discussed below, Plaintiff also proposes that the minimum damage amount is to apply 
on a per violation basis; the absurdity of such position is further magnified when one 
considers that the presumptive damages amount was tripled to $150,000). 
As stated in Landgraf, "the extent of a party's liability, in the civil context as well as 
the criminal, is an important legal consequence that cannot be ignored." Courts have 
consistently refused to apply a statute which substantially increases a party's liability to 
conduct occurring before the statute's enactment. Landgraf, supra at 284-85. Even if 
plaintiff were to argue that retroactive application of the new statute "would vindicate its 
purpose more fully," even that consideration is not enough to rebut the presumption 
against retroactivity. Id, at 285-86. "The presumption against statutory retroactivity is 
founded upon sound considerations of general policy and practice, and accords with 
long held and widely shared expectations about the usual operation of legislation." Id. 
Accordingly, this Court is required to apply the statute in effect at the time of the 
alleged conduct. 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005). 
Ill. Standard - Motion To Dismiss, More Definite Statement, Pleading, & Motion to Strike 
As established by the Supreme Court in Bell Atlantic Corp. V. Twombly, 127 
S.Ct. 1955 (2007), a motion to dismiss should be granted if the plaintiff does not plead 
"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausib\e on its face." Id, at 1974. 
Although the complaint need not provide detailed factual allegations, the basis for relief 
in the complaint must state "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic 
recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Id, at 1965. Further, "(f]actual 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 17 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 17 
allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the 
assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)." Id. 
On a motion to dismiss, the well pleaded allegations of plaintiff's complaint are taken as 
true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. M.T.V. v. DeKalb County 
Sch. Dist.. 446 F.3d 1153. 1156 (11th Cir.2006). 
In discussing Twombly, the Eleventh Circuit in Watts v. Fla. International Univ., 
495 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11 th Cir. 2007), noted - "The Supreme Court's most recent 
formulation of the pleading specificity standard is that 'stating such a claim requires a 
complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest' the required element." 
In order to sufficiently allege the claim, the complaint is required to identify "facts that 
are suggestive enough to render [the element] plausible." Watts, 495 F.3d at 1296 
(quoting Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1965). 
Pursuant to Rule 12(e), a party may move for more definite statement of a 
pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed where the pleading "is so vague or 
ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably frame a response." The motion is required 
to point out the defects and the desired details. Id. As to the general rules and form of 
pleading, Rules 8 and 10, a claim for relief must contain "a short plain statement of the 
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief;" Rule 8(a)(3); and may contain 
alternative claims within a count or as many separate claims. Rule 10(d)(2) and (3). 
A. 18 U.S.C. §2255(a) does not allow the Plaintiff to multiple the presumptive 
minimum damages amount on a per incident or per violation basis. 
In attempting to allege a §2255 claim, Plaintiff alleges that she is entitled to a 
multiplication of the presumptive minimum damages amount based on the number of 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 18 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 18 
incidents. 
See endnote 1, Complaint, ,i,i13-14. 
Under the plain meaning of the 
statutory text, §2255 does not allow for a multiplication of the presumptive "actual 
damages" by the number of incidents or violations alleged. No where in the statutory 
text is there any reference to the "civil remedy" afforded against a defendant by this 
statute as being on a "per violation" or "per incident" basis. 18 U.S.C. 2255(a) creates a 
"civil remedy" for "a minor who is a victim of a violation of section 2241(c), 2242, 2243, 
2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers 
personal injury as a result of such violation .... " The presumptive minimum damages 
amount speaks in terms of "actual damages." See 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005), quoted 
above in part I; Smith v. Husband, 428 F.Supp.2d 432 (E.D. Va. 2006); Smith v. 
Husband, 376 F.Supp.2d 603 (E.D. Va. 2006); Doe v. Liberatore, 478 F.Supp.2d 742, 
754 (M.D. Pa. 2007); and the recent cases in front of this court on Defendant's Motions 
to Dismiss and For More Definite Statement - Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, 2009 WL 383332 
(S.D. Fla. Feb. 12, 2009); Doe No. 3 v. Epstein, 2009 WL 383330 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 12,

v. Epstein, 2009 WL 383383 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 12, 2009). 
There is no reported case supporting Plaintiff's tortured and nonsensical 
interpretation of §2255. In all of these cases (cited above), each of the Plaintiffs brought 
a single count or cause of action attempting to allege numerous violations of the 
"predicate acts" specifically identified in §2255; in none of the cases did the Court award 
the presumptive amount of damages based on a per incident or per violation basis. "18 
U.S.C. §2255 gives victims of sexual conduct who are minors a private right of action."

Martinez v. White, 492 F.Supp.2d 1186, 1188 (N.D. Cal. 2007), (emphasis added). 18 
U.S.C.A. §2255 "merely provides a cause of action for damages in 'any appropriate 
United States District Court."' Id, at 1189. In Tilton v. Playboy Entertainment Group, 
Inc., 554 F.3d 1371 (11 th Cir. Jan. 15, 2009), the District Court granted plaintiff "the 
minimum 'actual damages' prescribed by §2255(a)," wherein plaintiff alleged that 
defendants had violated three of the statutory predicate acts; there was no multiplying of 
the award. 
It is well settled that in interpreting a statute, the court's inquiry begins with the 
plain and unambiguous language of the statutory text. CBS, Inc. v. Prime Time 24 
Venture, 245 F.3d 1217 (11 th Cir. 2001); U.S. v. Castroneves, 2009 WL 528251, *3 
(S.D. Fla. 2009), citing Reeves v. Astrue, 526 F.3d 732, 734 (11 th Cir. 2008); and Smith 
v. Husband, 376 F.Supp.2d at 610 ("When interpreting a statute, [a court's] inquiry 
beg ins with the text."). "The Court must first look to the plain meaning of the words, and 
scrutinize the statute's 'language, structure, and purpose."' Id. In addition, in construing 
a statute, a court is to presume that the legislature said what it means and means what 
it said, and not add language or give some absurd or strained interpretation. As stated 
in 
CBS, Inc., supra at 1228 - "Those who ask courts to give effect to perceived 
legislative intent by interpreting statutory language contrary to its plain and 
unambiguous meaning are in effect asking courts to alter that language, and '[c]ourts 
have no authority to alter statutory language .... We cannot add to the terms of [the] 
provision what Congress left out.' Merritt, 120 F.3d at 1187." See also Dodd v. U.S., 
125 S.Ct. 2478 (2005); 73 Am.Jur.2d Statutes §124. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 20 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 20 
As quoted above, Title 18 of the U.S.C. is entitled "Crimes and Criminal 
Procedure." §2255 is contained in "Part I. Crimes, Chap. 110. Sexual Exploitation and 
Other Abuse of Children." 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2003), is entitled Civil remedy for personal 
injuries. 
Reading the entire statute in context, no where is there any language 
indicating that presumptive minimum damages amount is to be multiplied on a "per 
violation" or "per incident basis." Under the statutory rules of construction, had the 
legislature intended to include a multiplier with respect to the damages amount, the 
statute would have included such language. Had Congress wanted to create such a 
remedy as Plaintiff attempts to bring, it could have easily included language of "such 
damages shall be multiplied on a per violation" or "per incident" basis in subsection (a). 
By its own terms, the statute provides for the recovery of "actual damages the 
minor sustains and the cost of the suit, including attorney's fees." The next sentence 
expressly states - "Any minor as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed 
to have sustained damages of no less than $50,000 in value." 
(Even the 2006 
amended version provides - "Any person as described in the preceding sentence shall 
be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than $150,000 in value.") There is 
absolutely no language that allows for a plaintiff to multiply the specified or presumptive 
damages recoverable on a "per violation" or "per incident" basis. The Plaintiff's position 
on §2255 puts a strained interpretation with an absurd result 
In Martinez v. White, supra, the defendants sought to dismiss plaintiffs' 18 U.S.C. 
§2255 action based on forum non conveniens. The Northern District of California Court, 
relying on the rules of statutory construction, rejected plaintiffs' argument that Congress 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 21 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 21 
had intended to abrogate the forum non conveniens doctrine in a §2255 action; the 
District Court noted that the statute does not contain a mandatory venue provision. Had 
Congress wanted to get rid of the forum non-conveniens doctrine, it would have said so 
in the statute. Also, in Smith v. Husband, 428 F.Supp. 432; and 376 F.Supp.2d 603, the 
plaintiff invoked "the accompanying civil remedy for these criminal violations, stating that 
she has sustained and continues to sustain physical and mental damages, humiliation, 
and embarrassment as a result of Defendant's criminal acts." 
In other words, she 
brought a single cause of action, based on allegations of multiple violations of the §2255 
predicate acts. Furthermore, the court refused to add a venue interpretation that simply 
was not written into the statutory text. See other §2255 cases cited herein. 
For an example of a statute wherein the legislature included the language "for 
each violation" in assessing a "civil penalty," see 18 U.S.C. §216, entitled "Penalties and 
injunctions," of Chapter 11 - "Bribery, Graft, and Conflict of Interests," also contained in 
Title 18 - "Crimes and Criminal Procedure." Subsection (b) of §216 gives the United 
States Attorney General the power to bring a "civil action ... against any person who 
engages in conduct constituting an offense under" specified sections of the bribery, 
graft, and conflicts of interest statutes. The statute further provides in relevant part that 
"upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited conduct, which 
ever amount is greater." As noted, 18 U.S.C. §2255 does not include such language.

Page 22 
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to allege a cause of action under §2255, as the 
statute does not allow for the multiplication of the presumptive damages amount on a 
per incident or per violation basis. Plaintiff Complaint is required to be dismissed. 
B. 
Also requiring dismissal Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege any 
requisite §2255 predicate act. 
Also requiring dismissal of Plaintiff's purported §2255 claim is Plaintiff's failure to 
sufficiently allege any violation of a requisite predicate act as specifically identified in 
subsection (a). Relevant to Plaintiff's complaint, 18 U.S.C. 2255(a) creates a cause of 
action for "a minor who is a victim of a violation of section 2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 
2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers personal 
injury as a result of such violation .... " See cases cited above herein. The referenced 
statutes are criminal statues all contained in Title 18. In paragraph 13 and 15, Plaintiff 
makes reference by citation only to "18 U.S.C. §2422(b)." 
See endnote 2 for the 
complete statutory text. 2 See also this Court's recent orders on motions to dismiss in 
other actions filed against EPSTEIN by "Jane Does," Case Nos: 08-CV-80119-
MARRA/JOHNSON; 08-CV-80232-MARRA-JOHNSON; and 08-CV-80380-MARRA-
JOHNSON; requiring sufficient allegations of predicate acts. 
A reading of §2422(b) shows that no where in Plaintiff Complaint are there any 
allegations setting forth the requisite elements of the cited predicate act. 
See Smith v. 
Husband, 376 F.Supp.2d, and 428 Supp.2d, supra; and Gray v. Darby, 2009 WL 
805435 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 25, 2005), requiring allegations/evidence to establish predicate 
act under 18 U.S.C. §2255 to state cause of action. There are no allegations what so 
ever regarding EPSTEIN "using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 23 of 29

Page 23 
commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States 
knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained 
the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person 
can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, .... " 
Plaintiff appears to be relying solely on an "agreement with the United States 
Attorney's Office to not contest liability for claims brought exclusively pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. §2255, in exchange for avoiding federal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. §2422(b)." 
Complaint, 1115. As noted above herein, Plaintiff already has additional claims against 
EPSTEIN pending in state court. See Exhibit A hereto. Even taking Plaintiff's allegation 
in paragraph 15 as true, Plaintiff is not proceeding exclusively under §2255. 
Accordingly, under the standard of pleading as established in Twombly, supra, Plaintiff 
has failed to sufficiently allege the requisite elements of a §2255 claim, thus requiring 
dismissal for failure to state a cause of action. 
C. In the alternative, pursuant to constitutional law principles of statutory 
interpretation, 18 U.S.C. §2255 is required to be interpreted as creating a 
single "civil remedy" or cause of action on behalf of a minor plaintiff 
against a defendant. The "civil remedy" afforded is not on a "per violation" 
or "per incident" basis. 
As set forth above, it is Defendant's position that the text of 18 U.S.C. §2255 
does not allow a Plaintiff to pursue the damages afforded under the statute on a "per 
violation" or "per incident" basis. 
In the alternative, if one were to assume that the 
language of §2255 were vague or ambiguous, under the constitutional based 
protections of due process, judicial restraint, and the rule of lenity applied in construing 
a statute, Defendant's position as to the meaning of the statute would prevail over 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 24 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 24 
Plaintiff's view. 
See United States v. Santos, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 2025 (2008). 
As 
summarized by the United States Supreme Court in Santos, supra, at 2025: 
... The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in 
favor of the defendants subjected to them. See United States v. Gradwell, 
243 U.S. 476, 485, 37 S.Ct. 407, 61 L.Ed. 857 (1917); McBoyle v. United 
States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931); United States v. 
Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347-349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). This 
venerable rule not only vindicates the fundamental principle that no citizen 
should be held accountable for a violation of a statute whose commands are 
uncertain, or subjected to punishment that is not clearly prescribed. It also 
places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce Congress to 
speak more clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law in Congress's 
stead .... 
In Santos, the Court was faced with the interpretation of the term "proceeds" in 
the federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. §1956. "The federal money-laundering 
statute prohibits a number of activities involving criminal 'proceeds."' Id, at 2023. Noting 
that the term "proceeds" was not defined in the statute, the Supreme Court stated the 
well settled principle that "when a term is undefined, we give it its ordinary meaning." Id, 
at 2024. 
Under the ordinary meaning principle, the government's position was that 
proceeds meant "receipts," while the defendant's position was that proceeds meant 
"profits." The Supreme Court recognized that under either of the proffered "ordinary 
meanings," the provisions of the federal money-laundering statute were still coherent, 
not redundant, and the statute was not rendered "utterly absurd." 
Under such a 
situation, citing to a long line of cases and the established rule of lenity, "the tie must go 
to the defendant." Id, at 2025. See portion of Court's opinion quoted above. "Because 
the 'profits' definition of 'proceeds' is always more defendant friendly that the 'receipts' 
definition, the rule of lenity dictates that it should be adopted." Id. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 25 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 25 
Plaintiff's position would subject Defendant EPSTEIN to a punishment that is not 
clearly prescribed - an unwritten multiplier of the "actual damages" or the presumptive 
minimum damages. The rule of lenity requires that Defendant's interpretation of the 
remedy afforded under §2255 be adopted. As noted above, Plaintiff's interpretation 
would allow Plaintiff to multiply her recovery without any regard to what the actual 
damages are. 
In addition, under the Due Process Clause's basic principle of fair warning -
... a criminal statute must give fair warning of the conduct that it makes a 
crime .... As was said in United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 
S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989, 
'The constitutional requirement of definiteness is violated by a criminal 
statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that 
his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute. The underlying 
principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct 
which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.' 
Thus we have struck down a [state] criminal statute under the Due Process 
Clause where it was not 'sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject 
to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.' 
Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 
L.Ed. 322. We have recognized in such cases that 'a statute which either 
forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common 
intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its 
application violates the first essential of due process of law,' ibid., and that 
'No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to 
the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the 
State commands or forbids.' Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 
S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888. 
Thus, applying these well-entrenched constitutional principles of statutory 
interpretation and application, Plaintiff's cause of action attempting to multiply the 
presumptive amount of damages is required to be dismissed for failure to state a cause 
of action. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 26 of 29
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 26 
D. Plaintiff's action is also required to be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action 
sounding in conspiracy under §2255. 
Finally, Plaintiff's entire action is subject to dismissal to the extent that she is 
attempting to allege a conspiracy to violate §2255 for the same reasons she has failed 
to state a cause of action against EPSTEIN individually as discussed above herein. 
See Complaint,i,i9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. 
Conclusion 
Plaintiff improperly relies on the 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, eff, July 27, 
2006, in her attempt to plead a cause of action. The statue in effect during the time of 
the alleged conduct applies. 
Plaintiff has also improperly sought to multiply the 
presumptive minimum damages amount imposed on a per incident or per violation 
basis. Not only is there nothing in the statute which would allow for such interpretation, 
but such interpretation is in violation of well established constitutional principles. Finally, 
Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action under §2255 either individually against 
EPSTEIN or as a conspiracy. There are absolutely no underlying factual allegations 
setting forth the elements of the predicate act relied upon. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiff's 
entire action.

In paragraph 11 of her Complaint, Jane Doe II alleges that - "From about June, 2003 
until about February, 2005, Defendants, EPSTEIN and KELLEN persuaded, induced, or 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 13   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/06/2009   Page 28 of 29

Page 28 
enticed Plaintiff to come to Defendant EPSTEIN's home and provide Defendant 
EPSTEIN with 'massages' .... " 
In paragraph 13, Jane Doe II alleges - "In violation of §2422(b), Defendants 
EPSTEIN and KELLEN knowingly persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to engage 
in acts of prostitution, when the Plainitff was undr the age of 18, approximately on or 
about the following dates that Plaintiff can document based on payments received: 
6/16/03, 7/2/03, 4/9/04, 6/7/04, 7/30/04, 8/30/04, 10/9/04, 10/12/04 and 11/9/04. In 
addition, Plaintiff believes that there were as many as 10 to 20 other occasions during 
this time frame that Defendant EPSTEIN solicited her and procured her to perform 
prostitution services, all during the time that she was a minor." 
In paragraph 14, Plaintiff alleges - "Plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury in 
accordance with 18 U.S.C. §2255(a) for each of the acts of prostitution set forth above 
which Defendants solicited her, $150,000 for each violation, for a total range of 
damages between $1.5 million dollars and $4.5 million dollars, jointly and severally, and 
a reasonable attorney's fees and costs, as permitted by the statute."

CASE NO.: 08-CV-80811-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Plaintiff, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN and SARAH 
KELLEN, 
Defendants, 
I 
--------------
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's Motion To Stay And Or Continue Action For Time Certain Based On 
Parallel Civil And Criminal Proceedings With Incorporated Memorandum Of Law 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter "EPSTEIN") by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, hereby moves this Court for the entry of an order staying or continuing 
this action for a time certain (i.e., until late 2010 when the NP A expires), pursuant to the 
application of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the fact that a parallel 
proceeding is ongoing and being investigated. In support of his motion, EPSTEIN states: 
I. 
Introduction 
At the outset, EPSTEIN notes this Court's prior Order, dated December 16, 2008, 
(Document 28), in which this Court denied a motion for stay brought by Defendant's prior 
counsel. In that instance, Defendant's counsel requested a mandatory stay under 18 U.S.C.A. 
§3509(k) which the court denied. In denying the request for the stay, this Court stated that a 
discretionary stay was not appropriate at the time the order was entered but also stated, in part, 
that "Any such issues shall be resolved as they arise in the course of litigation.". As discussed 
herein, "special circumstances" now exist which, in the "interests of justice," merit the entry of a 
stay of this civil action until the criminal matter in the 15th Judicial Circuit is "closed" in 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 2 of 24

C.M.A. v. Epstein, et al. 
Page2 
accordance with the United States Attorney's Office ("USAO") Non-Prosecution Agreement 
("NP A") and until the NP A expires. 
Moreover, EPSTEIN was indicted by a grand jury in or around July 2006. See Exhibit 
"A". The Non-Prosecution Agreement is part of the record in connection with that indictment, 
which is signed by the State Attorney of the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, 
Florida ("SAO"). In fact, the NPA acknowledges the investigation performed by the SAO. 
Further, the USAO was present at the Plea hearing whereby the NPA was made part of the 
record. Thus, there is no question that a parallel criminal matter exists in that the SAO's case 
remains open and the NP A lives along side it, which places EPSTEIN under great scrutiny by the 
USAO. The NPA actually places an affirmative duty upon EPSTEIN to undertake discussions 
with the SAO to ensure compliance with the NP A. That check and balance, therefore, remains in 
the hands of the SAO, which has a parallel criminal proceeding. Here, the threat of prosecution 
is real, substantial, and present should the USAO determine that EPSTEIN somehow violated the 
NP A. As discussed below, because the NPA fails to define what constitutes a breach, the USAO 
has apparently taken it upon itself to determine whether a breach has occurred and whether to 
seek criminal prosecution. In fact, the USAO has already attempted to claim violations of the 
NPA due to, among other things, EPSTEIN defending the civil actions against him. Clearly, it is 
NOT simply EPSTEIN's choice as to whether he violates the NPA - that discretion apparently 
lies with the USAO. For this reason alone, a stay is required until the NP A expires. 
The difference between this Motion and the prior motion to stay is solely due to the 
ripeness of the issues discussed herein.

II. 
THENPA 
By its terms, the NPA took effect on June 30, 2008 and expires by those same terms in 
late 2010 so long as EPSTEIN complies with the terms and conditions - violations of which 
remain undefined. The NP A, which remains under seal, outlines various obligations on the part 
of EPSTEIN including, but not limited to, pleading guilty to the Indictment and Information 
before the 15th Judicial Circuit, recommendations for his sentencing before the 15th Judicial 
Circuit, waiver of challenges to the Information filed by the SAO, waiver of right to appeal his 
conviction, agreement not be afforded benefits for gain time, and the agreement to not prosecute 
others listed thereon so long as EPSTEIN does not breach and fulfills the requirements of the 
NPA. 
What the NP A does not outline or define is what constitutes a breach or what act or 
omission constitutes a breach thereof. Therefore, the USAO apparently believes it has the 
discretion to make that unwritten and undefined determination, which places an unreasonable 
burden upon EPSTEIN in defending the civil claims in that he has no idea what the USAO will 
define as a breach in the event he does not assert his 5th Amendment Rights. As an example, the 
.... 
, 
USAO has already claimed that EPSTEIN violated the NP A by: 
1. 
investigating the Plaintiffs (by and though his attorneys) whom brought civil suits 
against him for purposes of defending those civil actions; 
2. 
contesting damages in this action and in the other civil actions; 
3. 
making statements to the press about this Plaintiff or other Plaintiffs by and 
though his attorneys; and

using the word 'jail" instead of "imprisonment" in the plea agreement with SA's 
office. 
See Exhibit "B" Goldberger Affidavit - EPSTEIN's criminal counsel. 
These allegations are silly, unfounded and alleged violations which are not defined as 
violations under the NPA but arrived at by the USAO. Thus, EPSTEIN is left with "Morton's 
Fork" in his side - the undesirable choice of taking the 5th Amendment and having a judgment 
(summary or otherwise) entered against him in the civil action or the undesirable choice of 
subjecting himself to discovery in the civil action before the NP A expires and, thus, face the 
possibility of criminal prosecution by the USAO based upon some illusory breach deemed by the 
USAO by way of information obtained through civil discovery proceedings. This is inherently 
unfair, the danger is clear, and the playing field is not level in light of the NP A language or lack 
thereof. 
As a result, the threat of criminal prosecution against EPSTEIN by the USAO continues 
presently and through late 2010. 
III. 
Justice Requires The Entry of A Stay Because Defendant Is Being 
Forced To Choose Between Waiving His 5th Amendment Privilege Or Risk 
Losing This Civil Case And Forfeiting Other Constitutional Guarantees Of 
Due Process And Effective Assistance Of Counsel 
Once the NP A expires, EPSTEIN fully intends to testify to all relevant and non-
objectionable inquiries made to him in discovery be it a deposition, in interrogatories or in 
production requests. (Emphasis Added) However, the current circumstances are such that by 
testifying or responding to discovery, EPSTEIN will be required to waive his constitutional 
privileges, thereby subjecting himself to criminal prosecution and scrutiny by the USAO as a

Page 5 
result of matters alleged in this civil action ( and others before this Court and in the State of 
Florida 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach County). 
The special circumstances of this action are such that a stay or continuance for a time 
certain is NOT prejudicial and is required to be entered so that: 
(1) EPSTEIN is not required to waive his Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination under the United States Constitution resulting in severe prejudice to EPSTEIN in 
pending criminal matters; and 
(2) EPSTEIN is not forced to choose between waiving his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination or losing the civil case. 
Here, in asserting his Fifth Amendment Privilege, the Plaintiff is afforded an opportunity 
rarely given - that is, to put on only her evidence without any counterevidence from Defendant 
resulting in a judgment of liability against EPSTEIN. This is inherently unfair and precisely the 
special circumstances where "in the interests of justice" a stay is required. Ventura v. Brosky, 
2006 WL 3392207 (S.D. Fla. 2006), citing. United States v. Lot 5, Fox Grove, 23 F.3d 359 (11 th 
Cir. 1994). In Ventura, a stay was entered where a Defendant was confronted with issue of 
waiving his 5th Amendment Privilege or to loose a civil case by way of motion for summary 
judgment. Id. Here, EPSTEIN is not requesting a mandatory stay. EPSTEIN only asks that this 
court recognize that "special circumstances" exists in this matter and enter a stay in the "interests 
of justice" and only for a specified period of time (i.e., after the NPA expires). See also 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 755 F.Supp. 1018, 1019 (S.D. Fla. 1990)(Defendant was 
in precarious position while being subject to criminal investigation and reasoning that 
compelling Defendant to speak by ordering an accounting of alleged illicit funds would directly

impinge his right against self-incrimination). The court found it appropriate to grant the request 
for stay. (Emphasis Added). 
Citing to U.S. v. Lot 5, Fox Grove, supra, the Southern District Court, Florida, in 
Ventura v. Brosky. 2006 WL 3392207 (S.D. Fla. 2006), stated-
The Eleventh Circuit has also created a test for these circumstances, stating that 
where there exists a concurrent civil and criminal proceeding, a court must stay 
a civil proceeding pending resolution of a related criminal prosecution when 
"special circumstances" so require in the "interests of justice." 
(Bold emphasis added). See also United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, 12 & n. 27, 90 S.Ct. 763, 
769-70 & n.27 (1970). The Ventura Court went on to state that "situations where a defendant in 
both criminal and civil proceedings must choose whether to waive his privilege against self-
incrimination or to lose the civil case in summary or default judgment proceedings have met this 
test's burden and warrant a stay." Id. The Ventura court granted the stay. Here, the l 5th Judicial 
Circuit action lives along with the NP A. 
In making a decision to enter such a stay, the court may consider the following factors: 
(1) 
the interests of the Plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously with litigation, or any 
aspect of it, and the potential prejudice of Plaintiff to the delay; 
(2) 
the burden which any particular aspect of the proceedings may impose on the 
defendant; 
(3) 
the convenience of the court in the management of its cases, and the efficient use 
of judicial resources; 
( 4) 
the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation; and 
(5) 
the interest of the public in the pending civil and criminal litigation.

C.M.A. v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 7 
See U.S. v. Pinnacle Quest International, 2008 WL 4274498 (N.D. Fla. 2008). 
First, in applying the above factors, the Plaintiff in the instant matter will not be 
prejudiced simply by claiming a delay in time. 
Second, the burden is far greater on the 
EPSTEIN if he is forced to waive his 5th Amendment Privilege or remain silent and have a 
judgment entered against him or choose to testify and face criminal prosecution. Third, efficient 
use of judicial resources would be rendered upon a stay by way of preventing an appeal if such a 
stay is not entered. The Court has broad discretion to enter such a stay. Fourth, the interests of 
the individuals outlined in the NPA will be served because EPSTEIN's fulfillment of NPA 
alleged obligations is determinative upon whether the USAO prosecutes those individuals or 
whether the claims will be dropped upon the expiration of the NP A. Finally, the interest of the 
public in the pending civil and criminal cases will not be prejudiced as EPSTEIN is already 
serving his term whereby a plea was entered in the 15 Judicial Circuit action. 
a. 
Application of the 5th Amendment 
Next, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination "permits a person not to 
answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or 
informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings." Edwin v. 
Price, 778 F.2d 668,669 (11 th Cir. 1985), citing Lefkowitz v. Turley. 414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.C. 
316,322 (1973). See also Ohio v. Reiner, 532 U.S. 17, 21, 121 S.Ct. 1252 (2001)(The Fifth 
Amendment privilege is also available to those who claim innocence. 
One of the Fifth 
Amendment's "basic functions ... is to protect innocent men ... 'who otherwise might be 
ensnared by ambiguous circumstances."); Malloy v. Hogan, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1495 (1964)(the 
Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause applies to the states through the Due Process 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 8 of 24

Page 8 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment - "[i]t would be incongruous to have different standards 
determine the validity of a claim of privilege based on the same feared prosecution, depending 
on whether the claim was asserted in state or federal court."); Kastigar v. U.S., 406 U.S. 441, 
444-45, 92 S.Ct. 1653 (1972)(The Fifth Amendment privilege "can be asserted in any 
proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory; and it 
protects against any disclosures which the witness reasonably believes could be used in a 
criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used. This Court has been 
zealous to safeguard the values which underlie the privilege." (Emphasis added)). 
The United States Supreme Court made it clear that the scope of the Fifth Amendment 
Privilege includes the circumstances as here "the act of producing documents in response to a 
subpoena (or production request) has a compelled testimonial aspect." United States v. Hubbell, 
530 U.S. 27, 36, 120 S.Ct. 2037, 2043 (2000); see also Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 
(1976); McCormick on Evidence, Title 6, Chap. 13. The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 
§138 (6th Ed.). The privilege against self-incrimination may be asserted during discovery when a 
litigant has "reasonable grounds to believe that the response would furnish a link in the chain of 
evidence needed to prove a crime against a litigant." A witness, including a civil defendant, is 
entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege whenever there is a realistic possibility that the 
answer to a question could be used in anyway to convict the witness of a crime or could aid in 
the development of other incriminating evidence that can be used at trial. Id; Pillsbury Company 
v. Conboy, 495 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 608 (1983). 
Certainly, if the USAO decides to prosecute EPSTEIN for an alleged violation of the 
NP A, it would undoubtedly be able to use information obtained during discovery against him or 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 9 of 24

C.M.A. v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 9 
use that information to aid in the development of other evidence against him at a criminal trial. 
The USAO is already claiming violations of the NPA based upon EPSTEIN defending the civil 
actions and, at the same time, while EPSTEIN asserts the 5th Amendment. Imagine, because that 
is all we can do based on the lack of wording in the NP A, what violations the USAO will assert 
if EPSTEIN is forced to waive his 5th Amendment privilege to defend himself in this and the 
other civil actions. 
The Fifth Amendment provides, in relevant part, that "No person ... shall be compelled 
in any Criminal Case to be a witness against himself." Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 
486, 71 S.Ct. 814 (1951), citing Feldman v. United States, 1944, 322 U.S. 487, 489, 64 S.Ct. 
1082, 1083, 88 L.Ed. 1408." The Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination is 
"accorded liberal construction in favor of the right it was intended to secure." "The immediate 
and potential evils of compulsory self-disclosure transcend any difficulties that the exercise of 
the privilege may impose on society in the detection and prosecution of a crime." Id., at 490; 
and In re Keller Financial Svcs. of Fla., Inc., 259 B.R. 391, 399 (M.D. Fla. 2000). The privilege 
not only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a criminal 
statute but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed 
to prosecute the claimant for a crime. Id, citing Blau v. United States, 1950, 340 U.S. 159, 71 
S.Ct. 223. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination "permits a person not to 
answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or 
informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings." Edwin v. 
Price, 778 F.2d at 669, citing Lefkowitz v. Turley. 414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.C. 316,322 (1973). As 
EPSTEIN is here, "the claimant must be 'confronted by substantial and 'real,' and not merely

trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination."' See generally. United States v. Apfelbaum, 445 
U.S. 115, 128, 100 S.Ct. 948, 956, 63 L.Ed.2d 250 (1980)). See also, United States v. Neff. 615 
F.2d 1235, 1239 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 925, 100 S.Ct. 3018, 65 L.Ed.2d 1117 
(l 980)(1nformation is protected by the privilege not only if it would support a criminal 
conviction, but even if "the responses would merely 'provide a lead or clue' to evidence having a 
tendency to incriminate."). EPSTEIN falls under each of the above category of cases. 
The United States Supreme Court has made clear that the scope of the Fifth Amendment 
Privilege also encompasses the circumstance where "the act of producing documents in response 
to a subpoena (or production request) has a compelled testimonial aspect." United States v. 
Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 36, 120 S.Ct. 2037, 2043 (2000); see also Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 
391 (1976). In explaining the application of the privilege, the Supreme Court stated: 
We have held that "the act of production" itself may implicitly communicate 
"statements of fact." By "producing documents in compliance with a subpoena, 
the witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, 
and were authentic." Moreover, as was true in this case, when the custodian of 
documents responds to a subpoena, he may be compelled to take the witness stand 
and answer questions designed to determine whether he has produced everything 
demanded by the subpoena. The answers to those questions, as well as the act of 
production itself, may certainly communicate information about the existence, 
custody, and authenticity of the documents. Whether the constitutional privilege 
protects the answers to such questions, or protects the act of production itself, is a 
question that is distinct from the question whether the unprotected contents of the 
documents themselves are incriminating. 
"The issue presented in those cases was whether the act of producing subpoenaed 
documents, not itself the making of a statement, might nonetheless have some 
protected testimonial aspects. The Court concluded that the act of production could 
constitute protected testimonial communication because it might entail implicit 
statements of fact: by producing documents in compliance with a subpoena, the 
witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, and 
were authentic. United States v. Doe. 465 U.S .. at 613. and n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1237; 
Fisher, 425 U.S.. at 409-410. 96 S.Ct. 1569; id., at 428. 432. 96 S.Ct. 1569 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 11 of 24

(concurring opinions). See Braswell v. United States, [487 U.S.,] at 104, 108 S.Ct. 
2284; [ id.,] at 122, 108 S.Ct. 2284 (dissenting opinion). Thus, the Court made 
clear that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to acts 
that imply assertions of fact." ... An examination of the Court's application of these 
principles in other cases indicates the Court's recognition that, in order to be 
testimonial, an accused's communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate 
a factual assertion or disclose information. Only then is a person compelled to be a 
'witness' against himself." Doe v. United States, 487 U.S., at 209-210, 108 S.Ct. 
2341 (footnote omitted). 
Finally, the phrase "in any criminal case" in the text of the Fifth Amendment might 
have been read to limit its coverage to compelled testimony that is used against the 
defendant in the trial itself. It has, however, long been settled that its protection 
encompasses compelled statements that lead to the discovery of incriminating 
evidence even though the statements themselves are not incriminating and are not 
introduced into evidence. Thus, a half century ago we held that a trial judge had 
erroneously rejected a defendant's claim of privilege on the ground that his answer 
to the pending question would not itself constitute evidence of the charged offense. 
As we explained: 
"The privilege afforded not only extends to answers that would in themselves 
support a conviction under a federal criminal statute but likewise embraces those 
which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the 
claimant for a federal crime." Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 
S.Ct. 814, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). 
Compelled testimony that communicates information that may "lead to 
incriminating evidence" is privileged even if the information itself is not 
inculpatory. Doe v. United States, 487 U.S. 201, 208, n. 6, 108 S.Ct. 2341, 101 
L.Ed.2d 184 (1988). 
It's the Fifth Amendment's protection against the 
prosecutor's use of incriminating information derived directly or indirectly from 
the compelled testimony of the respondent that is of primary relevance in this case. 
The privilege against self-incrimination may be asserted during discovery when a litigant 
has "reasonable grounds to believe that the response would furnish a link in the chain of 
evidence needed to prove a crime against a litigant." A witness, including a civil defendant, is 
entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege whenever there is a realistic possibility that the 
answer to a question could be used in anyway to convict the witness of a crime or could aid in

the development of other incriminating evidence that can be used at trial. Id; Pillsbury Company 
v. Conboy, 495 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 608 (1983). 
See also, Hubbell, supra, as to what is 
encompassed by the phrase "in any criminal case" contained in the Fifth Amendment. 
As noted, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is broad. Hoffman; 
In re Keller Financial Svcs., supra. To deny a witness the right to invoke the privilege, the judge 
must be perfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the 
witness is mistaken, and that the answers cannot possibly have such tendency to incriminate. IQ, 
at 488, 399. Recognizing the breadth and magnitude of this constitutional privilege, the United 
States Supreme Court in discussing how a court is to analyze the application of the privilege 
stated-
... It is for the court to say whether his silence is justified, Rogers v. United States, 
1951, 340 U.S. 367, 71 S.Ct. 438, and to require him to answer if 'it clearly appears 
to the court that he is mistaken.' Temple v. Commonwealth, 1880, 75 Va. 892, 899. 
However, if the witness, upon interposing his claim, were required to prove the 
hazard in the sense in which a claim is usually required to be established in court, he 
would be compelled to surrender the very protection which the privilege is designed 
to guarantee. To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications 
of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the 
question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because 
injurious disclosure could result. The trial judge in appraising the claim 'must be 
governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the 
facts actually in evidence.' 
Hoffman, supra at 486-487. 
Hoffman and its progeny establish that "in view of the liberal construction of the 
provision [protecting against self-incrimination], after a witness has asserted the privilege, he 
should be compelled to provide the requested information only if it "clearly appears" to the court 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 13 of 24

Page 13 
that the witness was mistaken in his invocation of the privilege." (Emphasis added). In re Keller 
Financial Svcs., supra at 399, citing Hoffman, at 486. 
In the instant case, the privilege applies as Defendant EPSTEIN "has reasonable cause to 
apprehend danger from a direct answer." The risk of incrimination resulting from being subject 
to discovery or to testify in his own defense while the NPA exists is "substantial and real" and 
"not trifling or imaginary haphazards of communication." See generally, In re Keller Financial 
Svcs., supra at 400. Based on the nature of Plaintiffs claims, along with the ongoing scrutiny 
of the USAO in the criminal matters, EPSTEIN has "reasonable grounds to believe that his 
responses to the discovery would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prove a crime 
against him. Finally, in order to preserve the privilege, the privilege must be asserted or one 
risks the loss or waiver of this liberty ensuring protection. See generally. U.S. v. White, 846 
F.2d 678, 690 (11 th Cir. 1988)("First, it ignores the settled principle which requires a witness to 
assert his Fifth Amendment rights. A witness who testifies at any proceeding, instead of asserting 
his Fifth Amendment rights, loses the privilege .... A civil deponent cannot choose to answer 
questions with the expectation of later asserting the Fifth Amendment."). 
Also applicable in upholding the assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege is the 
guarantee of effective assistance of counsel by the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
See Yarborough v. Gentry, 124 S.Ct. 1, 540 U.S. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003)(Sixth Amendment 
guarantees criminal defendants effective assistance of counsel.), on remand 381 F.3d 1219. The 
United States Constitutional guarantees are applicable to the states through the Fourteenth 
Amendment. Obviously, EPSTEIN's assertion of his constitutional privileges and protections is 
on the advice of counsel. Again, EPSTEIN continues to face criminal prosecution by the USAO 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 14 of 24

Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2009

C.M.A. v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 14 
until the expiration of the NP A; under the constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of 
counsel, he is entitled to follow the recommended advice of his criminal defense attorney. See 
Goldberger Affidavit attached hereto. 
EPSTEIN' s invocation of his constitutional protections of the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendments must be upheld for the reasons set forth herein; otherwise such constitutional 
protections would be rendered meaningless. Already and recently, Defendant EPSTEIN in his 
Response and Objections to discovery, attached hereto as Exhibit "C", has been required to 
assert, on advice of counsel, his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, along 
with his constitutional rights afforded under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United 
States Constitution. Thus, EPSTEIN' s entitlement to a stay is ripe for determination. 
Based upon the foregoing, a stay is warranted in this action as the Defendant is being 
forced to choose between the assertion of his Fifth Amendment right or losing this case by 
judgment (summary or otherwise) or waiver of his 5th Amendment right and face potential 
criminal prosecution.

AFFIDAVIT OF JACK A. GOLDBERGER, ESQUIRE 
STATE OF FLORIDA 
) SS 
COUNTY OF PALM BEACH 
) 
BEFORE 
ME, 
the 
undersigned 
authority, 
personally 
appeared 
having personal knowledge and being duly sworn, deposes and says: 
1. 
I, Jack A. Goldberger, have personal knowledge of the matters set 
forth herein. I am an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Florida since 
1978. I am a partner with the law firm of Atterbury Goldberger & Weiss, P.A., 
located at One Clearlake Centre, Suite 1400, 250 Australian Avenue South, West 
Palm Beach, FL 33401. 
2. 
My practice includes and specializes in the defense of criminal 
matters. I am board certified in criminal law. I have been and currently am the 
criminal defense attorney for JEFFREY EPSTEIN. 
3. 
I represented Mr. EPSTEIN in the negotiation of and entering into a 
Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) for 
the Federal Southern District of Florida. The terms and conditions of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement also entailed the entering of a Plea Agreement with the 
State Attorney's Office, Palm Beach County, State of Florida. 
(The Non-
Prosecution Agreement shall hereinafter be referred to as the "NPA"). 
4. 
By its terms, the NPA took effect on June 30, 2008. Also, pursuant 
to the terms of the NPA, any criminal prosecution against EPSTEIN is deferred 
as long as the terms and conditions of the NPA are fulfilled by EPSTEIN. 
( 1 ~ti 
EXHIBIT-1:'_

Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM 
Document 51-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2009 
Page 2 of 3 
5. 
The criminal matters against EPSTEIN remain ongoing until the 
NPA expires by its terms in late 2010, and as long as the USAO determines 
EPSTEIN has complied with those terms and conditions. The threat of criminal 
prosecution against EPSTEIN by USAO in the Southern District of Florida 
continues presently and through late 2010. 
6. 
Pursuant to the terms of the NPA, the USAO possesses the right to 
declare that the agreement has been breached, give EPSTEIN's counsel notice, 
and attempt to move forward with a prosecution. As of the date of this Affidavit, 
the USAO has taken the position on a number of occasions that it might consider 
the following actions by EPSTEIN to be a breach of the NPA. 
• 
Investigation by EPSTEIN (by and through his attorneys) of this Plaintiff 
and the other Plaintiffs in other pending civil cases for purposes of 
defending the civil actions; 
• 
EPSTEIN's contesting damages in this action and other civil actions. 
• 
EPSTEIN or his legal representatives making statements to the press 
about this Plaintiff or the other Plaintiffs. 
• 
Using the word "jail" instead of "imprisonment" in the plea agreement with 
the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office. 
7. 
EPSTEIN, through counsel, submitted a Freedom of Information 
Act request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for documents relating to 
this and the other cases; the FBI denied the request stating the materials are at 
this time exempt from disclosure because they are in an investigative file, i.e. the 
matter is still an ongoing criminal investigation.

DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S RESPONSE & OBJECTIONS 
TO PLAINTIFF'S FIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his undersigned attorneys, 
hereby responds to Plaintiff's First Request For Production To Defendant, served 
January 8, 2009 and states: 
Request No. 1: 
Any and all evidence required to be maintained by Epstein 
and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, specifically evidence 
requested by or directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that have been issued in 
connection with the investigation referenced in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, and 
including certain computer equipment. 
Response: 
Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the production 
request as well as his U.S. constitutional privileges. I intend to produce all relevant 
documents regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled me that at the 
present time I cannot select, authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this

lawsuit and I must accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to 
effective representation. Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under the 
Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United States 
Constitution. 
Drawing an adverse inference under these circumstances would 
unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my constitutional rights, would 
unreasonable, and would therefore violate the Constitution. In addition to and without 
waiving his constitutional privileges, the information sought is privileged and 
confidential, and inadmissible pursuant to the terms of the deferred prosecution 
agreement, Fed. Rule of Evidence 410 and 408, and §90.410, Fla. Stat. Further, the 
request may include information subject to work product or an attorney-client privilege. 
Request No. 2: 
Any and all documents reflecting or relating to the identity of, 
the scheduling of, and/or the payment of any female compensated by or on behalf of 
Epstein for providing any service to Epstein that required, contemplated, or included in 
the provisions of such service, any physical contact between Epstein and the female, 
any act or prostitution, any illicit sexual conduct, the exposure of breast, buttocks or 
genitalia, or any commercial sex act as defined in 18 U.S.C. §1591(c)(1). 
Response: Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the production 
request as well as his U.S. constitutional privileges. I intend to produce all relevant 
documents regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled me that at the 
present time I cannot select, authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this

Further 
Defendants objects to the production as overly broad and seeking information that is 
neither relevant to the subject matter of the pending action nor does it appear to be 
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Plaintiff in 
this instance has alleged in her complaint that she was sexually abused by the 
Defendant on one occasion sometime in the year 2004. The documents requested 
herein have no time period provided, and therefore the information sought is grossly 
overbroad. 
Request No. 3: 
Any and all documents reflecting or relating to the identity of 
and/or the nature and extent of any other person's participation in the communication 
with and/or the scheduling of and/or the payment of any person who participated in any 
conduct described in Request #2. 
Response: Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the production 
request as well as his U.S. constitutional privileges. I intend to produce all relevant

ORDER REQUESTING THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE ITS POSITION
REGARDING DEFENDANT EPSTEIN’S MOTION TO STAY/CONTINUE THE CIVIL
CASES PENDING AGAINST HIM
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon the motions filed in several cases by Defendant
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009   Page 3 of 4

Jeffrey Epstein to Stay and/or Continue the Action for Time Certain Based on Parallel Civil and
Criminal Proceedings.  See, e.g., docket entry 51 in C.M.A. v. Epstein and Kellen, case no. 08-
80811 (attached).  Epstein moves for a stay until the expiration of the Non-Prosecution
Agreement (“NPA”) with the United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) because, he claims, the
USAO has taken the position that he is violating the NPA by defending the civil actions filed
against him.  Therefore, he argues that he cannot defend the civil actions without subjecting
himself to criminal prosecution.  
While the Court recognizes that the United States is not a party to these actions and is not
obligated to comment on this matter, the position of the United States would greatly assist the
Court in resolving the merits of these motions to continue/stay the case. Accordingly, the Court
requests that the United States provide its position on the matter.  The Court would appreciate the
governments position within 15 days if possible.  If the United States is unwilling to state its
position, the Court would also appreciate being so advised.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 14  day of May, 2009

Reply to Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S, Motion to Dismiss, and would show in support:
1.

PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION 
TO DEFENDANT EPSTEIN’S  MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff, JANE DOE II, through counsel, opposes Defendant’s RICHARD EPSTEIN’s
Motion to Dismiss. Defendant’s argument for a dismissal is premised on the following: 1)
Plaintiff is not permitted to file a claim under Florida law in a State of Florida court and then
file a federal claim in a federal court; 2) the remedies amendment to 18 U.S.C.§2255 are
not retroactive based on the dates Defendant EPSTEIN is alleged to have violated the
statute; 3)
damages under §2255 cannot be obtained on a per incident basis, but must
be lumped together into a single recovery despite multiple violations occurring in temporally
distinct time frames, and therefore being different incidents; 4) Plaintiff has failed to state a
cause of action under §2255 because she has failed to “allege facts constituting a predicate
act”; and 5) Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for conspiracy to violate §2255.
I.
LEGAL STANDARD  
Defendant’s motion to dismiss must be denied unless it appears beyond doubt that
the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of her claims that would entitle her to relief.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 1 of 20

1On a Motion to Dismiss, the Court is of course confined to the four corners of
the Complaint, and it is completely improper for the Defendant to attach as Exhibits
copies of a Complaint from a different proceeding, a fact that is not alleged anywhere in
the Complaint at issue before this Court. Nevertheless because the Defendant’s
argument on this issue is meritless, Plaintiff addresses it on the merits. 
Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).  The Court must accept all of plaintiff’s factual
allegations as true.  Schuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 (1974).  Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a complaint need only be “a short and plain statement
of the claim,” and as long as the pleadings “give defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff’s
claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,” notice pleading has been satisfied.  Conley v.
Gibson, 355 U.S. at 47. For a claim to state a cause of action however, facts, not labels and
conclusions must be asserted. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)      
II.
ARGUMENT
Point 1.
Plaintiff has every right to proceed in State court for a Florida
common law claim, and in this Court for a federal claim.
Defendant EPSTEIN’s argument on this point is frivolous. Plaintiff’s claims in State
court are based on the common law of Florida, while the federal claims are based on a
federal statutory remedy.1 There are different facts that prove each claim and different
elements to the claims. Defendant seems to be arguing that the Plaintiff forfeits a right to a
federal remedy when she invokes a parallel, but independent and wholly distinct right to a
State remedy. That is simply not supported by any case or reasonable interpretation of any
case. The lynchpin of Defendant’s argument is that concurrent jurisdiction is available to hear
all claims in one forum; that is simply not the case, since the state claims are vastly different
than the federal statutory remedy. If the State claims had been filed in this Court, this Court
would not be obligated to exercise concurrent jurisdiction. It is well established that the
exercise of supplemental jurisdiction is discretionary with the court, and is properly rejected
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 2 of 20

In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966), a jury’s verdict
against a union based on State law claims was reversed, in part, because    the federal
law claim failed. The Court noted that: “It has consistently been recognized that
pendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff's right. Its justification lies
in considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants; if these are
not present a federal court should hesitate to exercise jurisdiction over state claims,
even though bound to apply state law to them, Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.
64.Needless decisions of state law [by a federal court] should be avoided both as a
matter of comity and to promote justice between the parties, by procuring for them a
surer-footed reading of applicable law.”  
under many circumstances.2 
U.S.C. §1367, “supplemental jurisdiction,” provides that: 
©) The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
a claim under subsection (a) if--
   (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,
    (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which
the district court has original jurisdiction,
  (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original
jurisdiction, or
  (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for
declining jurisdiction.
Courts routinely “are obligated to raise and decide issues of subject matter jurisdiction
sua sponte any time it appears subject matter jurisdiction is absent.” Carias v. Lenox
Financial Mortgage Corporation, 2008 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 20345 *1  (N.D. Cal. March 5,
2008). In Carias, after granting summary judgment on the sole federal claim, the Court
remanded the State claims to state court, stating: “The Court declines to exercise pendent
jurisdiction over the state law claims and remands the action to state court. The Court finds
that the issues of economy, convenience, fairness and comity collectively weigh in favor of
remand. See Harrell, 934 F.2d at 205. Comity weighs especially strong, given that  the
remaining claims are pure state law claims with no connection to federal law. Economy
also weighs in favor of remand as state courts are better equipped to efficiently handle state
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 3 of 20

law claims.” Id. at *5-6 (emphasis added). In Daimler Chrysler Corporation v. Charlotte Cuno,
547 U.S. 332, 351-52 (2006) the Supreme Court stated:
Gibbs held that federal-question jurisdiction over a claim may authorize a
federal court to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims that may be viewed
as part of the same case because they "derive from a common nucleus of
operative fact" as the federal claim.  383 U.S., at 725, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L.
Ed. 2d 218. Plaintiffs assume that Gibbs stands for the proposition that
federal jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently related to a claim within
Article III to be part of the same case, regardless of the nature of the
deficiency that would keep the former claims out of federal court if presented
on their own.
Our general approach to the application of Gibbs, however, has been
markedly more cautious. For example, as a matter of statutory construction
of the pertinent jurisdictional provisions, we refused to extend  Gibbs to allow
claims to be asserted against nondiverse parties when jurisdiction was based
on diversity, see Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 98
S. Ct. 2396, 57 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1978), and we refused to extend Gibbs to
authorize supplemental jurisdiction over claims that do not satisfy statutory
amount-in-controversy requirements, see Finley v. United States, 490 U.S.
545, 109 S. Ct. 2003, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1989). As the Court explained just
last Term, "we have not . . . applied Gibbs' expansive interpretive approach
to other aspects of the jurisdictional statutes." Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah
Servs., 545 U.S. 546, 553, 125 S. Ct. 2611, 162 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2005)
(applying 28 U.S.C. § 1367, enacted in 1990, to allow a federal court in a
diversity action to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional diverse
plaintiffs whose claims failed to meet the amount-in-controversy threshold).
What we have never done is apply the rationale of Gibbs to permit a
federal court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction  over a claim that
does not itself satisfy those elements of the Article III inquiry, such as
constitutional standing, that "serve to identify those disputes which are
appropriately resolved through the judicial process." Whitmore, 495 U.S., at
155, 158, 110 S. Ct. 1717, 109 L. Ed. 2d 135. 
(Emphasis added)
Defendant’s argument that the Court should abstain from deciding the purely
federal issues in this case because there is an independent action under State law is absurd.
For this argument the Defendant relies on the Colorado River abstention doctrine, clearly
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 4 of 20

3The federal claims that are the subject matter of this action are not necessarily
parallel, although the incidents that gave rise to both the federal and state claims arise
from the same series of events. A Florida appellate court, for example, has refused to
apply principles of res judicata to bar State discrimination claims after the plaintiff lost
federal discrimination claims. Andujar v. National Property & Casualty Underwriters, 659
So. 2d 1214 (Fla. 4th DCA 1995) (adverse judgment against plaintiff in federal court for
federal discrimination claims did not bar subsequent action under state discrimination
laws). Here, although some of the elements for some of the claims may be similar, they
are sufficiently different that application of Andujar would preclude res judicata. To
determine whether a case is parallel, courts have looked to whether the same issues
are being litigated. Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. American Mut. Reins. Co., 600 F.2d 1228,
1229, n. 1 (7th Cir. 1979); the issues in the State court and in this Court are not the
same.    
4The Supreme Court said that Congressional direction is the “[m]ost important
factor.” Id. at 819. 
inapplicable to this case. Only in “exceptional” circumstances, to promote conservation of
judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation, would a federal court be
authorized to dismiss federal parallel3 claims that are initiated in state court. Colorado River
Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976). However, for the
Colorado River doctrine to even apply, there must be clear Congressional direction that
would preclude a federal court’s “virtually unflagging obligation ...to exercise federal
jurisdiction.” Id. at 817. In that case, the Supreme Court found that clear Congressional
direction from the McCarran Amendment, which the Court read to counsel against
“piecemeal litigation” concerning issues of water rights in a river system, favored abstention
Id. at 819. Even with this clear Congressional direction, if other factors had not favored
abstention, it may not have been ordered. Id. at 820.
Defendant EPSTEIN does not offer any evidence of any Congressional direction that
would direct this Court to abstain for claims under 18 U.S.C. §2255.4 Further, the Colorado
River doctrine only applies when federal courts are presented with “difficult questions of state

5Colorado River has been applied where the plaintiff is pursuing federal civil
rights  claims in state and federal courts, at the same time, which is not the case here.
See for example: Atchinson v. Nelson, 460 F. Supp. 1102 (D. Wyo. 1978).
law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends
the result in the case at bar.” Id. at 814 (emphasis added).5 Plaintiff in this case is not asking
this Court to adjudicate any claims under State law, nor do the claims presented “policy
problems of substantial public import.” This case involves claims against an individual
brought by another individual. 
Just how narrow the circumstances under which abstention is appropriate under the
Colorado River doctrine, was demonstrated in the subsequent decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co., 437 U.S. 655 (1979). In Will, the
Supreme Court further narrowed the contours of when a federal court may abstain when
there is a parallel state action. In that case, a bare majority of one held upheld the District
Court’s decision to abstain, however, Justice Blackmun, in casting the deciding vote, did so
because he was of the opinion that the remedy sought (mandamus) was premature, since
the Appellate Court which had reversed the District Court,  should have simply directed it to
reconsider the issue in light of the very limited circumstances under which abstention is
appropriate under the Colorado River doctrine. Id. at 668.  
While the Will case recognizes that Colorado River abstention is a matter generally
left to the sound discretion of the District Court, the Eleventh Circuit has abolished its
application for claims predicated on 42 U.S.C.§1983. Alacare, Inc. v.Bagiano, 785 F. 2d 963
(11th Cir. 1986);See also: Tovar v. Billmeyer, 609 F. 2d 1291 (9th Cir. 1979) (rejecting
application of abstention in Section 1983 cases). Defendant cites no cases where the
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 6 of 20

6Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant EPSTEIN’s agreement is between the
United States and he; however, the Plaintiff and the other victims of his sexual
predation may be considered third party beneficiaries to the agreement.
Colorado River doctrine has been applied to a federal claim under §2255. The cases cited
by Defendant EPSTEIN do not support a decision by this  Court to abstain over what is a
purely federal claim. In American Bankers Ins. Co. v. First State Ins. Co., 891 F.2d 882 (11th
Cir. 1990), the District Court dismissed a purely state law claim for equitable subrogation
because there had been an earlier claim for declaratory relief in State Court; the Eleventh
Circuit reversed, concluding 
...that no exceptional circumstances require dismissal of this case in
deference to the pending state court proceeding. If it were simply a question
of judicial economy, this litigation probably should proceed in the New York
court. A federal court cannot properly decline to exercise its statutory
jurisdiction, however, simply because judicial economy might be served by
deferring to a state court. Federal courts have a ‘virtually unflagging
obligation’ to exercise the jurisdiction given them.’  Colorado River, 424 U.S.
at 816, 96 S. Ct. at 1246. The interest in preserving federal jurisdiction
mandates that this action not be dismissed.
891 F.2d at 886.
Finally, Plaintiff has pled that Defendant EPSTEIN has made an agreement with the
United States Attorney’s Office to not contest the jurisdiction of this Court in exchange for
a avoiding prosecution under federal law for solicitation of minors for prostitution.  Complaint,
¶15. Defendant EPSTEIN appears to be violating the agreement in contesting the jurisdiction
of this Court; at a minimum, at this stage of the pleadings he should be estopped from
contesting jurisdiction, since the allegations of ¶15 must be accepted as true.6  
Point 2.
The retroactivity of the amendments to §2255 is not appropriately
addressed in a motion to dismiss; but if the Court is so inclined to
consider it, there are insufficient facts pled in the Complaint to
render the 2006 amendments inapplicable to the case at bar.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 7 of 20

7Plaintiff alleges that Defendant EPSTEIN, or others working on his behalf,
solicited the Plaintiff for prostitution, while she was a minor, on “6/16/03, 7/2/03, 4/9/04,
6/7/04, 7/30/04, 8/30/04, 10/9/04, 10/12/04, 10/30/04 and 11/9/04. In addition, Plaintiff
believes that there were as many as 10 to 20 other occasions during this time frame
that Defendant EPSTEIN solicited her and procured her to perform prostitution
services, all during the time that she was a minor.”  
The only issue properly before the Court is whether the Complaint states a cause of
action. ¶14 of the Complaint claims that the Plaintiff is entitled to the sum of $150,000 for
each event wherein Defendant EPSTEIN solicited the Plaintiff for prostitution. Each event
is set forth in the Complaint in ¶13.7 There are two related issues before the Court: 1) the
amount of minimum damages recoverable, $50,000, or $150,000; and, 2) whether the
Plaintiff can recover the minimum amount of damages for each temporally distinct event, or
whether she is restricted to a single recovery of the minimum damages recoverable under
the statute. 
For the first issue, it is Plaintiff’s position that the matter cannot be decided on a
motion to dismiss, because what Defendant EPSTEIN is asking the Court to do is to declare,
prematurely, that when the Court instructs the jury, it instruct them that the minimum
recovery for the Plaintiff, if she proves the allegations, is either $50,000 (for the entire set of
events, Defendant EPSTEIN’s position) or $150,000 for each event (Plaintiff’s position); this
issue cannot be settled on a motion to dismiss, but is better reserved for the charging
conference at trial. On the second issue, as will be addressed later, under the plain language
of the statute, since Defendant EPSTEIN can be criminally prosecuted for each temporally
distinct event where he solicited this minor for prostitution, he can be subjected to the civil
remedy for damages for each such event, under either version of the statute. This second
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 8 of 20

8Defendant EPSTEIN also cites to United States v. Siegel, 153 F.3d 1256 (11th 
Cir. 1998), wherein, based on a defendant’s inability to pay restitution mandated by a
penal statute, the Court reversed a restitution order. An amendment to the statute
removed from consideration the defendant’s ability to pay restitution; the Court said
such an amendment could not be applied retroactively because the provision amounted
to a punishment under a penal statute, and would violate the ex post facto provision in
the U. S. Constitution, This case is clearly distinguished our case: the statute here is a
civil, not a penal remedy; the amendment to the statute modifies the minimal exposure
of the Defendant, but does not, as in the Siegel case, dispense with a substantive
defense to a restitution claim. United States v. Whiting, 165 F.3d 631 (8th Cir. 1999),
where a conviction for possession of child pornography was upheld, despite the fact
that the conduct of the defendant was arguably not specifically proscribed by statute at
the time the images were possessed; the Court held the legislative amendment was a
mere clarification of the prior legislation and not an ex post facto law.   
Justice Scalia cited the statement of purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, to
hold that, for example, the amendments specifically designed to overrule Patterson v.
McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132, 109 S. Ct. 2363, should be
issue would be better addressed on a summary judgment motion, and again, has nothing
to do with whether Plaintiff has pled a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ.
P.         
Plaintiff agrees with the general proposition that a new law that creates new
substantive rights, absent Congressional direction to the contrary, does not have retroactive
effect, but this is not a new law. §2255 was amended in 2006, to, inter alia, provide an
enhanced minimum recovery for damages caused by sexual predators such as Defendant
EPSTEIN. However, the change in the civil remedies available of a statute is a procedural,
not a substantive change in the law, and procedural changes to a statute are routinely
applied retroactively.8 Where substantive changes in a law are made by Congress, a slim
majority of the Supreme Court has declined retroactive application, even where the law was
ostensibly enacted to overrule a Court precedent that had itself, in the view of Congress,
overruled earlier Court precedents. Rivers v. Roadway Express, 511 U.S. 298, 308 (1994).9
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 9 of 20

applied prospectively only, based on a statutorily expressed Congressional intent to do
so:   “The statute that was actually enacted in 1991 contains no comparable language.
Instead of a reference to ‘restoring’ pre-existing rights, its statement of purposes
describes the Act's function as ‘expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in
order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.’ 1991 Act, § 3(4), 105
Stat. 1071 (emphasis added).”
Similarly, in the companion case of  Landgraf v. Usi Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 275, n. 28
 (1994), the Court declined to retroactively apply substantive changes to Title VII cases, but
noted that  
While we have strictly construed the Ex Post Facto Clause to prohibit
application of new statutes creating or increasing punishments after the fact,
we have upheld intervening procedural changes even if application of the new
rule operated to a defendant's disadvantage in the particular case. See, e. g.,
Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U.S. 282, 293-294, 53 L. Ed. 2d 344, 97 S. Ct. 2290
(1977); see also Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 111 L. Ed. 2d 30, 110
S. Ct. 2715 (1990); Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167, 70 L. Ed. 216, 46 S. Ct. 68
(1925).
The question becomes then is an increase in the minimum guaranteed damages of
a civil remedy statute a substantive or a procedural change? A careful reading of Landsgraf
compels a finding that it is a procedural change only that must be given retroactive
application. Although the Landsgraf Court declined to give retroactive application to the
change most analogous to the one at issue here, it did so because it found the newly created
right to compensatory damages, previously not available under Title VII, and made available
by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, was in effect the creation of a new statute:
The provision of § 102(a)(1) authorizing the recovery of compensatory
damages is not easily classified. It does not  make unlawful conduct that was
lawful when it occurred; as we have noted, supra, 511 U.S. at 252-255, § 102
only reaches discriminatory conduct already prohibited by Title VII. Concerns
about a lack of fair notice are further muted by the fact that such
discrimination was in many cases (although not this one) already subject to
monetary liability in the form of backpay. Nor could anyone seriously contend
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 10 of 20
--- --- ---------------

that the compensatory damages provisions smack of a "retributive" or other
suspect legislative purpose. Section 102 reflects Congress' desire to afford
victims of discrimination more complete redress for violations of rules
established more than a generation ago in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At
least with respect to its compensatory damages provisions, then, § 102 is not
in a category in which objections to retroactive application on grounds of
fairness have their greatest force.
Nonetheless, the new compensatory damages provision would operate
"retrospectively" if it were applied to conduct occurring before November 21,
1991. Unlike certain other forms of relief, compensatory damages are
quintessentially backward looking. Compensatory damages may be intended
less to sanction wrongdoers than to make victims whole, but they do so by a
mechanism that affects the liabilities of defendants. They do not
"compensate" by distributing funds from the public coffers, but by requiring
particular employers to pay for harms they caused. The introduction of a right
to compensatory damages is also the type of legal change that would have
an impact on private parties' planning. In this case, the event to which the new
damages provision relates is the discriminatory conduct of respondents' agent
John Williams; if applied here, that provision would attach an important new
legal burden to that conduct. The new damages remedy in § 102, we
conclude, is the kind of provision that does not apply to events antedating its
enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent.
In cases like this one, in which prior law afforded no relief, § 102 can be
seen as creating a new cause of action, and its impact on parties' rights
is especially pronounced. Section 102 confers a new right to monetary relief
on persons like petitioner who were victims of a hostile work environment but
were not constructively discharged, and the novel prospect of damages
liability for their employers. Because Title VII previously authorized recovery
of backpay in some cases, and because compensatory damages under §
102(a) are in addition to any backpay recoverable, the new provision also
resembles a statute increasing the amount of damages available under a
preestablished cause of action. Even under that view, however, the provision
would, if applied in cases arising   before the Act's effective date, undoubtedly
impose on employers found liable a "new disability" in respect to past events.
See Society for Propagation of the Gospel, 22 F. Cas. at 767. The extent of
a party's liability, in the civil context as well as the criminal, is an important
legal  consequence that cannot be ignored. Neither in Bradley itself, nor in
any case before or since in which Congress had not clearly spoken, have we
read a statute substantially increasing the monetary liability of a private party
to apply to conduct occurring before the statute's enactment. See Winfree v.
Northern Pacific R. Co., 227 U.S. 296, 301, 57 L. Ed. 518, 33 S. Ct. 273
(1913) (statute creating new federal cause of action for wrongful death
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 11 of 20

inapplicable to case arising before enactment in absence of "explicit words"
or "clear implication"); United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States
ex rel. Struthers Wells  Co., 209 U.S. 306, 314-315 (1908) (construing statute
restricting subcontractors' rights to recover  damages from prime contractors
as prospective in absence of "clear, strong and imperative" language from
Congress favoring retroactivity).
Id. at 281-86 [footnotes omitted].
Here, we have an increase in the potential damages remedy, but it was a damages
remedy that already existed at the time of Defendant EPSTEIN’s commission of the acts
against the minor. Hence, here, unlike Landsgraf, there was an existing civil remedy prior to
Defendant EPSTEIN’s commission of the acts against the minor Plaintiff, and there
continues to be such a remedy. Similar to our fact situation here, in Bradley v. School Bd.
of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 40 L. Ed. 2d 476, 94 S. Ct. 2006 (1974), a unanimous Court
applied an intervening statute authorizing an award of attorney's fees for parties seeking to
end school segregation, to a case pending on appeal at the time the statute was enacted.
Noting that the statute created an "additional basis or source for the Board's potential
obligation to pay attorneys' fees," 416 U.S. at 721, the Court found that the statute’s
retroactive application did not adversely affect the settled expectations of the parties. It is
difficult to imagine, particularly when the Court is contemplating a motion to dismiss, that
Defendant EPSTEIN had a “settled expectation” that if and when he was caught for
solicitation of minors for prostitution he would be liable for only a minimum of $50,000; it is
highly probable that he never believed he would be caught and he never knew of or
contemplated the civil penalties he would face under §2255. It is highly unlikely that
Defendant EPSTEIN made those calculations when he committed the crimes against this
or any other minor. Hence the rationale usually advanced for prospective application of
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 12 of 20

Although outside the pleadings and not appropriate for consideration on a
Motion to Dismiss, Defendant EPSTEIN has refused to answer any substantive
questions in the only two (2) depositions he has given in all these cases, including in
the State court case involving this Plaintiff. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not been able to
ascertain whether Defendant EPSTEIN had settled expectations about the limits of his
civil liability under §2255. 
11“At no time within the last generation has an employer had a vested right to
engage in or to permit sexual harassment; ‘there is no such thing as a vested right to do
wrong.’ Freeborn v. Smith, 69 U.S. 160, 2 Wall. 160, 175, 17 L. Ed. 922 (1865). See
also 2 N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 41.04, p. 349 (4th rev. ed.
1986) (procedural and remedial statutes that do not take away vested rights are
presumed to apply to pending actions). Section 102 of the Act expands the remedies
available for acts of intentional discrimination, but does not alter the scope of the
employee's basic right to be free from discrimination or the employer's corresponding
legal duty. There is nothing unjust about holding an employer responsible for injuries
caused by conduct that has been illegal for almost 30 years.” Id. at 297. Similarly in this
case, soliciting minors for acts of prostitution, has been unlawful and the civil remedy
associated therewith has long preceded the acts in question. 
statutory enactments is simply not present here, and the record is devoid of any factual
material that would support such a conclusion.10 As Justice Blackmun said in dissent in
Landsgraf, there is no vested right to break the law.11
Bottom line is, a motion to dismiss a claim is not the correct procedural mechanism
to determine the retroactivity of a statute. Landsgraf was decided after a trial on the merits
of the claim, wherein the trial court determined that although the sexual harassment was
serious, the employer, upon learning of it, had taken prompt remedial measures to correct
it, and the plaintiff did not have sufficient cause to warrant quitting her job. Id. at 247-48.
Rivers v. Roadway Express, 511 U.S. 298 (1994) was decided after a trial on the merits as
well, wherein the Court dismissed the 1981 claims based on the holding in Patterson, supra,
and exonerated the Defendant on the Title VII claims in a bench trial. On appeal, the plaintiff
sought relief under the 1991 Civil Rights Act amendments, which overruled Patterson. These
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 13 of 20

cases where in a much different procedural posture than the present case, and the law that
is applicable, including the raise of the minimum cap to $150,000, was in place well before
this suit was filed. Further, well before this suit was filed Defendant EPSTEIN entered into
a deferred prosecution agreement wherein he agreed to not contest the jurisdiction of this
Court and liability for claims under §2255, and Plaintiff has so alleged in ¶15 of the
Complaint. Plaintiff did not allege that Defendant EPSTEIN made this agreement with a
specification that his damages would be limited to a single claim of a minimum recovery
under the former statute, which was amended in 2006.    
Point 3.
U.S.C. §2255 permits a claim for each temporally distinct event.
(a) In general. Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a
violation of section 2241©), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260,
2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title [18 USCS § 2241©), 2242, 2243, 2251,
2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423] and who suffers personal
injury as a result of such violation, regardless of whether the injury occurred
while such person was a minor, may sue in any appropriate United States
District Court and shall recover the actual damages such person sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any person as
described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained
damages of no less than $ 150,000 in value.
The statute makes reference to “a violation” and “such violation,” both references
being in the singular. The statute does not say that if there are multiple violations, the
Plaintiff is limited to a single recovery for all. Such a construction would to the plain language
of the statute and common sense. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant EPSTEIN violated the
statute on 10 confirmed occasions and up to 20 additional occasions. Each date for each
violation is different. There is no language in the statute that prohibits the Plaintiff from suing
for each violation, and the dicta set forth in Tilton v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 554
F. 3d 1371 (11th Cir. 2009), vaguely noting that the District Court awarded the Plaintiff “the
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 14 of 20

minimum ‘actual damages’”, Id. at 1379, but there is no suggestion in this Opinion that the
Plaintiff was so limited, no reference to whether Plaintiff sought the relief being sought here
or that the events she complained of occurred on multiple occasions. In fact, it appears clear
from the Opinion that the pro se Defendant that Plaintiff prevailed against by default was
sued for a singular violation of recording the Plaintiff’s sexually oriented performance at a
Spring Break gathering. There is no indication that the conduct that was recorded by the
defaulted Defendant occurred on multiple occasions, as here.            
Point 4.
The Eleventh Circuit has foreclosed Defendant EPSTEIN’s
argument that for a violation of 18 U.S.C. 2422(b) to occur, he must
travel in interstate commerce; moreover, he has waived his right
to contest the jurisdiction of the Court according to the allegations
of the Complaint.  
In United States v. Yost, 479 F.3d 815 (11th Cir. 2007), a defendant was convicted of
two counts of attempting to induce persons he believed were minors (they were government
agents posing as minors) to commit acts of prostitution under 18 U.S.C. §2422(b); he sought
to void his convictions on appeal because he didn’t get to the meeting place. The Court
rejected the argument, holding: 
We are not convinced by Yost's argument that his failure to arrive at the
meeting place precludes a finding of a substantial step. Although this is the
first time we have been confronted with an attempt conviction under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2422(b) where travel is not involved, two other circuits have examined the
issue and determined travel is not necessary to sustain such a conviction. In
United States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d 637, 639-40 (6th Cir. 2000), the Sixth Circuit
affirmed a conviction under Section 2422(b) where the defendant sent e-mails
proposing oral sex and attempted to set up meetings with minor females,
albeit unsuccessfully. Similarly, in United States v. Thomas, 410 F.3d 1235,
1246 (10th Cir. 2005), the Tenth Circuit affirmed a Section 2422(b) attempt
conviction, despite a lack of evidence of travel. The Tenth Circuit stated:
“Thomas crossed the line from 'harmless banter' to inducement the moment
he began making arrangements to meet [the minor], notwithstanding the lack
of evidence that he traveled to the supposed meeting place." Id. Viewing the
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 15 of 20

12Ms. Kellen has been served in accordance with New York law after seeking to
avoid service with the assistance of a doorman at her building. She has thus far failed
to respond to the Complaint, and Plaintiff intends to move for a default against her next
week.   
totality of Yost's actions, we likewise conclude Yost crossed the line from
mere "talk" to inducement. In addition to his online chats with Lynn, Yost
called Lynn on the telephone, posted pictures of his genitalia online, and
made arrangements to meet her. Despite a lack of evidence of travel, the
totality of Yost's actions convinces us that a reasonable jury could have found
Yost committed a substantial step.
Id. at 820.
As a practical matter, although not pled, the manner in which Defendant EPSTEIN
solicited Plaintiff to commit acts of prostitution as alleged was by telephone, by use of one
of his surrogate “assistants,” in this case Defendant SARAH KELLEN.12 Plaintiff would
receive a phone call on her cell phone (with a 561 exchange) from the cell phone of
Defendant KELLEN, who used a cell phone with a New York exchange (917 area code). In
United States v. Drury, 396 F.3d 1303 (11th Cir. 2005), the Court had to determine whether
a murder for hire conviction, where the defendant made calls from a Georgia land line to a
federal agent posing as a hit man on a cell phone that routed calls through Jacksonville, was
sufficient to establish use of interstate commerce for commission of the crime in question.
The Court affirmed the conviction, even where there was no intent to use an instrumentality
of interstate commerce, since the Defendant believed he was calling a number in Georgia.
In this case, the facts will demonstrate that for 99 per cent of the solicitations for
prostitution, Plaintiff was called by Defendant KELLER, who used her cell phone with a 917
exchange, a New York exchange, and presumably set up the event after being instructed by
Defendant EPSTEIN when and at what time the Plaintiff should appear at his home for the
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 16 of 20

“(b) Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or
foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the
United States knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has
not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for
which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be
fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years or for life.” (Emphasis
added).
sexual services he paid the Plaintiff for. Defendant KELLER resides and is believed to have
resided in New York at all times relevant to this suit, although she was present at Defendant
EPSTEIN’s home on some of the occasions when the Plaintiff appeared after being
summoned there. However, since she used a cellular phone, that is clearly a facility of
interstate commerce as contemplated by 18 U.S.C. 2422(b), which encompasses conduct
where “any facility or means of interstate commerce” is used.13 The Eleventh Circuit has
recognized that “[t]he telephone system is clearly a ‘facility of interstate . . . commerce.’”
United States v. Covington, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 8263 (11th Cir. April 22, 2009).
Defendant EPSTEIN is alleged in the Complaint to have waived the right to contest
the jurisdiction of this Court for claims under §2255, he should therefore be estopped from
asserting the failure to allege predicate acts, particularly when he has refused to answer any
questions based on his claimed right against self incrimination. However, if the Court is of
the view that these predicate facts must be alleged despite the agreement, then Plaintiff
requests leave to do so.        
Point 5.
Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to establish a conspiracy to
violate §2255.
A civil conspiracy is an agreement by two or more persons, to do an unlawful act
or a lawful act by unlawful means, the doing of an overt act in furtherance of the
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 17 of 20

conspiracy, resulting in damage to the Plaintiff. Walters v. Blankenship, 931 So. 2d 137
(Fla. 5th DCA 2006); Blatt v. Green, Horn, et al., 456 So. 2d 949 (Fla. 3rd DCA 1984).
To support her claim of a civil conspiracy, Plaintiff has pled the following:
9.
Defendant EPSTEIN, in agreement with two (2) persons he
employed for this purpose, HALEY ROBSON and Defendant KELLEN,
conspired with these other two, and others, to solicit young women of the type
Defendant EPSTEIN preferred, blonde, attractive in appearance, and younger
than 18 years of age, to provide sexual gratification for him by engaging in
acts of prostitution.
10.
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN entered into a criminal
conspiracy to solicit young women for acts of prostitution, including the
Plaintiff, here in Palm Beach County.

EPSTEIN and KELLEN persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to come
to Defendant EPSTEIN’s home and provide Defendant EPSTEIN with
“massages” which escalated into sexual encounters between Defendant
EPSTEIN and the Plaintiff designed to fulfill his unnatural sexual desires for
young women or even younger girls who were minors. These acts included
Defendant EPSTEIN’s  request that  he wanted the encounter to be like a
“porn video.” Defendant EPSTEIN would script lines for the Plaintiff to say,
including calling out his name and requesting that he perform a certain sexual
act “harder,”while he touched the Plaintiff’s vagina  with a vibrator or with his
fingers; alternately, he would masturbate in the presence of the Plaintiff after
demanding her to disrobe and walk in front of him in provocative sexual
poses. Defendant EPSTEIN would pay the Plaintiff a fee of $200 on each
occasion  after he ejaculated while masturbating in the presence of the
Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff has pled the elements of a civil conspiracy to violate §2255.
CONCLUSION
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss must be denied. Plaintiff’s Complaint states a cause
of action pursuant to §2255. The Colorado River doctrine for abstention is not remotely
applicable to this case, which is grounded on a purely federal statutory cause of action. It is
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 20   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2009   Page 18 of 20

inappropriate for the Defendant to seek to limit his minimum statutory exposure on a Motion
to Dismiss, where there is no factual record or legislative history to determine the retroactivity
of an enhanced damages provision to a cause of action that existed at the time of the
wrongful acts. §2255 claims permit a Plaintiff to assert multiple claims for multiple violations
that occur in temporally distinct time frames, no differently than any claim, whether based
on tort or statutory law, that encompasses multiple events that occur at different times.
Defendant EPSTEIN has waived the right to contest the issue of whether his conduct
impacted interstate commerce; but Plaintiff is prepared to allege, if the Court deems it
necessary, how his employee and co-conspirator, Defendant KELLEN, used an
instrumentality of interstate commerce, her cell phone, to solicit the Plaintiff, then a minor,
on behalf of Defendant EPSTEIN who solicited her sexual services for money. Finally,
Plaintiff has pled all necessary elements to establish a civil conspiracy to violate §2255. For
these reasons, Defendant EPSTEIN’s Motion to Dismiss must be denied; however, if the
Court determines otherwise, Plaintiff respectfully requests leave to amend.

UNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO COURT’S ORDER
REQUESTING POSITION ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STAY [DE 99]
Comes now the United States, by and through the undersigned Assistant United States
Attorney, and files this response to the Court’s Order requesting the position of the United
States on Defendant Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion to Stay Proceedings [DE 99].  For the reasons
set forth below, it is the United States’ position that a stay of the proceedings is not necessary
and was not contemplated by the Non-Prosecution Agreement between the United States and
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein.  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 3 of 17

ISSUE PRESENTED
The United States is not a party to these lawsuits and, accordingly, is not fully aware
of the scope of the proceedings, the range of arguments presented by counsel, and any
correspondence or oral communications between the parties in these civil suits.  Based on
the information presented by the Court and a review of Defendant Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion
to Stay and/or Continue Action for Time Certain Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal
Proceedings with Incorporated Memorandum of Law (Court File No. 08-CV-80811-
MARRA/JOHNSON DE 51-1), and responses thereto filed by various plaintiffs in their suits,
the undersigned understands that the Court has requested the position of the United States
on the following issue: 
Are there “special circumstances” that require the imposition of a stay of the
civil proceedings in the “interests of justice” until the “expiration” of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement [“NPA”] between the United States and Epstein?
By filing this response, the United States does not make itself a party to this litigation
and takes no position with respect to the outcome of any of the civil suits; nor does the
United States take any position regarding Defendant Epstein’s performance of his obligations
pursuant to the NPA.  The United States also declines to comment on Defendant Epstein’s
representations regarding past allegations of violations of the NPA by Epstein.  The United
States files this response solely as amicus curiae at the Court’s request and does not waive
any procedural or statutory bars to suit.

I. 
STANDARD FOR IMPOSING A DISCRETIONARY STAY
A. 
The Defendant Must Show that the Assertion of His Fifth
Amendment Privilege Against Self-Incrimination Would
Automatically Result in the Entry of Summary Judgment Against
Him.
“The decision whether or not to stay civil litigation in deference to parallel criminal
proceedings is discretionary. . . . A movant must carry a heavy burden to succeed in such an
endeavor.”  Microfinancial, Inc. v. Premier Holidays Internat’l, Inc., 385 F.3d 72, 77 (1st
Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).  When a defendant facing possible criminal liability invokes
his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination in connection with civil
litigation, a court can stay discovery or the entire civil case.  Diaz v. Jenne, 2007 WL 624286
*1 (S.D. Fl. Feb. 23, 2007) (Cooke, J.).  “However, ‘the Constitution does not require a stay
of civil proceedings pending the outcome of related criminal proceedings.  Forcing an
individual to risk non-criminal disadvantage by remaining silent for fear of self incrimination
in a parallel criminal proceeding does not rise to the level of an unconstitutional
infringement.’”  Id. (quoting Shell Oil Co. v. Altina Assocs., Inc., 866 F. Supp. 536, 540
(M.D. Fl. 1994)).  
As this Court has previously explained:
The law regarding stays of civil actions is well-settled in the Eleventh Circuit.
In United States v. Lot 5, Fox Grove, Alachua County, Fla, 23 F.3d 359, 363-
(11th Cir. 1994) (“Lot 5"), the Court articulated the following principles of
law with respect to a stay of a civil action pending resolution of a related
criminal action:

1It appears from a brief review of some of Epstein’s discovery responses that Epstein has
made a blanket assertion of the privilege.  For example, Epstein has asserted his Fifth Amendment
privilege in response to a plaintiff’s request to produce the NPA and the United States’ list of
identified victims although these documents were provided to Epstein by the United States.

proceeding pending resolution of a related criminal prosecution
only when “special circumstances” so require in the “interests
of justice.”  The court may deny a stay so long as the privilege’s
invocation does not compel an adverse judgment against the
claimant.
. . .
[T]he standard set by the Eleventh Circuit as to when a stay should be granted
to prevent unconstitutional infringement is more narrow.  The law in the
Eleventh Circuit requires consideration of whether, as a result of invoking the
privilege, the defendant faces certain loss of the civil proceeding on summary
judgment if the civil proceeding were to continue.  Lot 5, 23 F.3d at 364;
Pervis v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 901 F.2d 944 (11th Cir. 1990).
Under this standard, Movants must show that invocation of the privilege in the
instant matter will result in certain loss by automatic summary judgment.
United States v. Two Parcels of Real Property, 92 F.3d 1123, 1129 (11th Cir.
1996); Pervis, 901 F.2d at 946-47.  This must be an actual adverse judgment,
and not “merely the loss of the defendant’s most ‘effective defense.’”
Securities & Exchange Comm. v. Incendy, 936 F. Supp. at 955 (S.D. Fl. 1996);
Shell Oil Co., 866 F. Supp. at 540-41.
Court-Appointed Receiver of Lancer Mgt. Group LLC v. Lauer, 2009 WL 800144 (S.D. Fl.
Mar. 25, 2009) (Marra, J.).  
Thus, before reaching the relative benefit and prejudice to each of the parties caused
by staying the cases, the Court must determine whether, if defendant Epstein were to invoke
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination1 and the Court were to allow an adverse
inference to be drawn therefrom, an adverse judgment against Epstein would be
automatically compelled.  The United States respectfully submits that it would not.

From a review of the Complaints filed by the plaintiffs in these cases, it appears that
some have filed claims based upon Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, some have
filed claims based upon common law torts, and some have filed a combination of the two.
Under general principles of tort law, a plaintiff is required to prove:  (1) that the defendant
committed a bad act; (2) that the plaintiff suffered damages; and (3) that the damages were
caused by the defendant’s bad act.  To succeed on a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a plaintiff
must show:  (1) that the plaintiff is a person who, while a minor, was a victim of an
enumerated offense committed by the defendant; (2) that the person suffered personal injury
as a result of that violation; and (3) the amount of damages she sustained.  
Epstein’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege could result in the drawing of
a negative inference only as to the first element under both of these claims.  Therefore, to
succeed on summary judgment (or at trial), the plaintiffs would still have to prove that they
suffered personal injury/damages as a result of the defendant’s bad act.  Cf. In re Financial
Federated Title & Trust, Inc., 252 B.R. 834, 838 (S.D. Fl. Bank. Ct. 2000) (Stay not
warranted in bankruptcy proceeding where criminal indictment was pending because
negative inference related only to defendant’s receipt of allegedly fraudulent transfers, but
“Trustee must still carry the burden of proving all of the elements of his complaint for
fraudulent transfers . . . includ[ing] fraudulent intent, insolvency, and financial condition at
the time of the transfers to the Defendants.”).
While Epstein may believe that his arguments and proof as to the first element are his
“most effective defense,” that alone is insufficient to warrant the imposition of a stay of the
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 7 of 17

2The United States notes that it is not aware of the identities of all of the plaintiffs in the civil
suits.  To the extent that any are not “identified victims” under the NPA, this contractual provision
would not apply.

litigation.  There are two other items for the Court to consider in deciding this issue.  First,
pursuant to the terms of the NPA, as to those victims identified by the United States, Epstein
has already made a concession that they are victims of an enumerated offense committed by
Epstein.  Thus, this inference is drawn not due to his invocation of the right against self-
incrimination but due to his entry into a contractual agreement with the United States for
which the identified victims are third-party beneficiaries.2  Second, in Lot 5, the Eleventh
Circuit pointed out the wealth of evidence other than the defendant’s testimony that could
be used to defeat a liability claim.  See Lot 5, 23 F.3d at 364 (“Thus, Claimant’s assertion that
only her own testimony could vindicate her is groundless; other participants to the illegal acts
that gave rise to the forfeiture were available to testify at trial.  Claimant’s failure to indicate
with precision why she did not use other parties’ testimony to substantiate her defense was
fatal.”).  For example, Epstein could mount a defense using effective cross-examination,
telephone records, travel records, documents within the possession of the plaintiffs or third
parties, and/or the testimony of third parties to rebut the plaintiffs’ proof.

B. 
Additional Factors to Consider in Balancing the Prejudice to the
Parties
If the Court is persuaded that the negative inference drawn from Epstein’s assertion
of his Fifth Amendment privilege would result in an automatic grant of summary judgment
in favor of the plaintiffs, then the Court must engage in a balancing of equities in determining
whether there are “special circumstances” warranting the imposition of a stay “‘to prevent
a party from suffering substantial and irreparable prejudice.’”  Securites and Exchange
Comm’n v. Incendy, 936 F. Supp. 952, 956 (S.D. Fl. 1996) (quoting S.E.C. v. First Financial
Group of Texas, Inc., 659 F.2d 660, 668 (5th Cir. 1981) (add’l citations omitted).  
Examples of “special circumstances” provided by the Supreme Court in
[United States v. Kordel] are: (1) if the Government brought the civil action
solely to obtain evidence for its criminal prosecution, (2) if the Government
failed to advise the defendant in the civil proceeding that it contemplates his
criminal prosecution; (3) if the defendant is without counsel or reasonably
fears prejudice from adverse pretrial publicity or other unfair injury; or (4) any
other special circumstances indicating unconstitutionality or even impropriety.
Incendy at 956 (citing United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, 11 (1970)).  See also Securities
and Exchange Comm’n v. Wright, 261 Fed. Appx. 259, 263 (11th Cir. 2008) (“[N]o ‘special
circumstances’ existed in this case warranting a stay, as there is no record evidence
suggesting the Government had brought the civil case solely to obtain evidence for the
criminal prosecution or that the criminal case against [defendant] was unconstitutional or
inappropriately instituted.”).  
No “special circumstances” exist here.  First, unlike Wright and Incendy, the United
States Government is not a party to the civil litigation.  Each suit is brought on behalf of an
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 9 of 17

-10-
individual plaintiff represented by private counsel.  Some of those plaintiffs are adverse to
the United States and have filed suit against the Government based upon its handling of the
criminal case against Epstein.  (See In re Jane Doe Litigation, Court File No. 08-80736-Civ-
Marra.)  There has been no allegation, and certainly no showing, that the civil litigation is
a ruse to obtain discovery on behalf of the criminal investigation.  
As some of the plaintiffs have mentioned, one purpose of the NPA was to place the
identified victims in the same position where they would have been if Epstein had been
convicted after trial of an offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  (See, e.g., Court File No.
08-CV-80119 DE 49-2.)  If Epstein had proceeded to trial and been convicted, those victims
would have been entitled to restitution and to file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and
would have been entitled to the same sorts of discovery that they now seek.  None of the
plaintiffs has contacted the United States about passing on materials gathered through
discovery to any criminal investigators or about seeking discovery that would be relevant
only to the criminal proceedings, rather than to their individual cases.  If Epstein has
legitimate concerns that the civil discovery process is being abused in some way, he can ask
the Court for a protective order limiting the scope of discovery or its distribution.
Furthermore, if at some time in the future, Epstein were the subject of a criminal indictment
and he alleged that the evidence to be used against him was gathered improperly, he could
file a motion to suppress or to dismiss the indictment in that criminal action.  See, e.g., United
States, ex. rel. Westrick v. Second Chance, 2007 WL 1020808 *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2007)
(Defendant in civil False Claims Act suit moved to stay civil action pending criminal
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 10 of 17

3With respect to the other “special circumstances” mentioned in Incendy, the government
obviously advised Epstein of the potential for criminal charges, and that knowledge led to the
negotiation of the NPA.  Epstein also has a number of attorneys listed on the Service List for the
civil cases and has retained a similarly large number of attorneys to handle the criminal investigation
and negotiation of the NPA.  Epstein alleges a fear of adverse publicity, but as the plaintiffs have
pointed out, during the course of the state and federal criminal investigations, Epstein’s personal
publicist distributed stories to the press impugning the credibility of the victims and other witnesses
and averring that the victims’ allegations of abuse were made solely to extract money from the
defendant.  In the context of some of the civil suits currently pending, Epstein has asked the Court
-11-
investigation where no indictment had been returned.  The district court denied the motion,
noting that while “allowing civil discovery to proceed may afford the government [who was
the real party in interest in the civil case] the opportunity to gain evidence that it may not be
entitled to under the more restrictive criminal discovery rules, if and when discovery
becomes necessary, protective orders and other remedial measures may be taken.”) (citations
omitted).
By entering into the NPA, with its explicit discussion of 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein
acknowledged that the United States was trying to protect the victims’ rights to restitution
and that civil claims would likely follow.  Epstein did not bargain for a stay of those
proceedings.  Instead, both parties received benefits and gave consideration for the bargain
that was struck – while Epstein is faced with answering discovery requests that he would not
face during criminal proceedings, he also is entitled to the identification of and extensive
discovery from the victims, which he would not have received in the criminal case.  Based
upon a review of the discovery requests he has promulgated thus far, it appears that Epstein
is taking full advantage of this benefit and if a criminal case were ever filed, he would, no
doubt, seek to use that information in his defense.3
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 11 of 17

to unseal the victims’ names so that he may make use similar press efforts to impugn their
credibility.
-12-
Unlike Wright and Incendy, Epstein also has not been criminally indicted.  In some
districts, this alone is virtually dispositive.  See, e.g., Sterling Nat’l Bank v. A-1 Hotels
Internat’l, 175 F. Supp. 2d 573, 576-77 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“district courts in this Circuit
‘generally grant the extraordinary remedy of a stay only after the defendant seeking a stay
has been indicted.’” (quoting Citibank, N.A. v. Hakim, 1993 WL 481335 *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.
18, 1993) (add’l citations omitted).  As one court explained:
the consensus that a party seeking a stay bears a heavier burden when he has
not yet been indicted derives logically from the balancing test set out by the
courts of appeals that have considered the question.  When a defendant has
been indicted, his situation is particularly dangerous, and takes a certain
priority, for the risk to his liberty, the importance of safeguarding his
constitutional rights, and even the strain on his resources and attention that
makes defending satellite civil litigation particularly difficult, all weigh in
favor of his interest.  Moreover, if the potential prejudice to the defendant is
particularly high post-indictment, the prejudice to the plaintiff of staying
proceedings is somewhat reduced, since the criminal litigation has reached a
crisis that will lead to a reasonably speedy resolution.  Furthermore, at that
stage in the criminal proceeding, the contours of the indictment will provide
the Court with a reasonable basis for determining the extent of the threat to the
defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights, and the likely extent and timing of the
criminal litigation.
Pre-indictment, these factors must be balanced significantly differently.
Though many of the same risks to the civil defendant are present, the dangers
are at least somewhat more remote, and it is inherently unclear to the Court
just how much the unindicted defendant really has to fear.  Conversely, the
delay imposed on the plaintiff is potentially indefinite.  There is no telling how
complicated the government’s investigation may be, whether the allegations
of the particular civil plaintiff are merely the tip of an iceberg that will result
in a lengthy and open-ended investigation, what priority the government
assigns to the investigation, whether it will result in charges that will have to
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 12 of 17

4Epstein points to provisions requiring him to maintain certain evidence “inviolate” as proof
that the grand jury investigation is still active.  These provisions are meant only to insure that easily
destroyed evidence identified through the investigation, such as computer equipment, that is still in
Epstein’s control, will still be available to investigators if Epstein does, in fact, breach the NPA.
Epstein is well aware that litigation concerning those matters have been removed from the Court’s
docket, at the insistence of the United States, because it fully halted its investigation in accordance
with the terms of the NPA.
-13-
be litigated, or how time-consuming the resulting criminal case will be.  Under
these circumstances, the likelihood that a civil party can make the necessary
showing to obtain the “extraordinary” remedy of a stay is inevitably much
reduced.  
Sterling Nat’l Bank, 175 F. Supp. 2d at 577 (internal citations omitted).
The First Circuit has noted that the decision whether to grant a stay “is highly nuanced
. . . [and] involves competing interests.  Balancing these interests is a situation-specific task,
and an inquiring court must take a careful look at the idiosyncratic circumstances of the case
before it.”  Microfinancial, supra, 385 F.3d at 78.  Epstein’s case is more idiosyncratic than
most.
As the Court aptly noted in its Order denying Epstein’s first motion to stay the civil
proceedings, Epstein has not been indicted and there are no criminal proceedings pending
against him.4  The resurrection of criminal proceedings against Epstein lies entirely within
Epstein’s own hands, by performing or not performing under the terms of the NPA.  This tips
the balance of equities even further in favor of the plaintiffs.  Epstein makes allegations that
the U.S. Attorney’s Office has unfettered discretion in determining breaches of the NPA, but
this is no different than in any contractual setting.  If one party believes that there has been
a breach, it may seek the remedy set forth in the contract.  If the other party believes that
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 13 of 17

5The United States also notes that this finite termination to Epstein’s exposure to potential
criminal consequences is illusory.  The NPA addresses only certain victims identified during the
course of the government’s investigation.  To the extent that any of the plaintiffs who have already
filed suit against Epstein do not fall within that group, the NPA does not address potential charges
based upon crimes committed against them.  The NPA also does not bind any other state or federal
prosecutor from pursuing charges for criminal acts committed within their jurisdiction(s).  The
federal statute of limitations for offenses against children is ten years or the life of the child,
-14-
there has been no breach, it has a remedy at law or equity.  In this situation, Epstein would
be entitled to seek dismissal of the indictment.  See United States v. Beeks, 167 Fed. Appx
777 (11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Diaz, 138 Fed. Appx. 965 (9th Cir. 2005); United
States v. Davis, 393 F.3d 540 (5th Cir. 2004).
Epstein argues that because he is seeking a finite period of delay – until the time that
he asserts that the NPA “expires” – and that, thereafter, he will promptly provide full and
complete responses to all discovery, the harm to the plaintiffs is de minimis.  With all respect,
this overlooks a number of obvious issues.  First, if a stay is imposed until Epstein’s
proposed “expiration date,” it affords Epstein one of two incentives: (a) to delay any intended
breach until a time when he believes that the United States has no remedy and then to breach
the agreement with impunity (i.e, to use the NPA as a shield and a sword); or (b) to delay the
civil litigation as long as possible (until shortly before the “expiration” of the NPA), and
then, after criminal charges have been filed, to seek a mandatory stay of the civil cases until
the criminal case is resolved.  Thus, contrary to the assertions of Epstein, the delay is not
limited but, instead, is “potentially indefinite,” as Sterling Bank warns.  If the U.S. Attorney’s
Office were to proceed criminally, the litigation would likely be very lengthy, and would
result in an even greater delay to the plaintiffs.5
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 14 of 17

whichever is longer.  18 U.S.C. § 3283.  Thus, for Epstein (or any other person accused of sexually
abusing children) to “wait out” any chance of criminal liability, the court would have to stay civil
litigation until all of the plaintiffs have died.
-15-
The factors to consider include: “(i) the interests of the civil plaintiff in proceeding
expeditiously with the civil litigation, including the avoidance of any prejudice to the
plaintiff should a delay transpire; (ii) the hardship to the defendant, including the burden
placed upon him should the cases go forward in tandem; (iii) the convenience of both the
civil and criminal courts; (iv) the interests of third parties; . . . (v) the public interest[;] . . .
(vi) the good faith of the litigants (or the absence of it) and (vii) the status of the cases.”
Microfinancial, 385 F.3d at 78 (citations omitted).
In considering those factors, the United States respectfully recommends to the Court
that all of the factors weigh against a stay.  In making its decision, the Court should consider
that, unlike all of the cases cited herein, Epstein seeks to stay not one suit involving a single
plaintiff, but more than a dozen suits filed by individual plaintiffs.  Each of those plaintiffs,
in turn, impliedly asserts that she is a “crime victim” with the “right to full and timely
restitution” and the “right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.”  18 U.S.C. §
3771(a)(6) & (7).  As noted above, one of the purposes of the NPA was to provide these
rights to victims identified in the Government’s investigation.  Thus, this factor weighs more
heavily for the plaintiffs than in the average civil dispute as it embodies both the plaintiffs’
and the public’s interests.  The victims who were identified in the government investigation,
by and large, were without financial assets and had significant counseling needs that could
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 24   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 15 of 17

-16-
be remedied through obtaining restitution from Epstein.  In addition to those needs, they have
legitimate concerns about memories fading, witnesses becoming unavailable, and dissipation
of Epstein’s assets while the matter is stayed.  On the other hand, while the potential harm
to the defendant normally weighs in the defendant’s favor, in this case, Epstein has
significant control over whether the criminal investigation remains in abeyance and whether
criminal charges are ever filed.
CONCLUSION
In accordance with the Court’s Order, the United States hereby submits that it is not
aware of any “special circumstances” that warrant staying all of the civil cases pending the
“expiration” of the NPA.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NO. 101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102’s  REPLY IN 
SUPPORT OF MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY AND RESPONSE IN 
OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO COMPEL AND/OR IDENTIFY JANE DOE NO. 
101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102 IN THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENAS FOR PURPOSES 
OF DISCOVERY1 
Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 (together, “Plaintiffs”), by and 
through their undersigned attorneys, hereby file their Reply in Support of Motion to 
Proceed Anonymously and Response in Opposition to Motion to Compel and/or Identify 
Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 in Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of 
Discovery, and, as grounds, state as follows: 
1. 
Exposure of Plaintiffs to the public disclosure of their identity and the 
resultant shame and humiliation accompanying their sexual exploitation is wholly 
unnecessary and premature, and may cause further damage.  Plaintiffs respectfully assert 
that this Court should first decide the threshold issues of retroactivity and calculation of 
damages.  Plaintiffs, and all other victims of Defendant who have filed an action against 
Defendant in federal court, will have to litigate these two following threshold issues 
being reviewed by the Court in the C.M.A. action against Defendant (Case No. 08-CV-
80811-MARRA/ JOHNSON):  1) whether the most recent version of the statute, which 
provides for a minimum recovery of $150,000 (instead of the previous minimum of 
Plaintiffs respectfully file this Reply in the consolidated action, as the issue at hand pertains to discovery 
issues.   
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 4 of 17

$50,000) applies to cases arising from incidents predating the 2006 amendment to the 
statute; and 2) whether the applicable minimum amount is recoverable per incident and/or 
per count, or per victim.  Defendant has attempted to force settlements on any victims as 
possible without considering the possibility that the minimum amount recoverable under 
U.S.C. § 2255 is $150,000 per count and/or per incident.  Much of this Court’s 
caseload will be alleviated once the Court resolves these issues related to the minimum 
recovery; at that point, many of Defendant’s victims will likely agree to settle for the 
minimum statutory damages to which they are entitled, thus obviating Defendant’s 
specified need to destroy his victims’ anonymity and expose them to further harm and 
humiliation.   
2. 
This Court has discretion to deny Defendant’s Motion to Compel and/or 
Identify Plaintiffs in Third Party Subpoenas for Purposes of Discovery.  See Doe v. 
Stegall, 653 F.2d 180, 184 (5th Cir. Aug. 10, 1981)2 (“Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) vests in the 
trial court discretion over litigants’ requests for protection from ‘annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense’ in the discovery process.”) 
(internal quotation omitted).  As more fully discussed in Plaintiffs’ Response to 
Defendant’s Motion to Stay, which is adopted and incorporated herein, Defendant waived 
his right to contest liability in actions filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  Thus, third 
party discovery is relevant only if Plaintiffs seek recovery of damages in excess of the 
statutory minimum.  Additionally, if and when the parties are ready to proceed with 
discovery from non-party sources, the Court can put numerous measures in place to 
maximize Plaintiffs’ anonymity.  At the outset, Defendant can obtain records from 
In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this circuit adopted as 
binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 5 of 17

various non-party sources through Plaintiffs’ counsel, who can demonstrate and certify 
that they have obtained the very records being sought, or through an independent special 
master, who could be given releases by Plaintiffs to obtain such records on behalf of 
Defendant to eliminate any question of authenticity or completeness.  If Defendant 
nevertheless insists on conducting his own third-party discovery (needlessly increasing 
the cost of litigating these actions and causing unnecessary delay), subpoenas seeking 
documents from sources such as health care providers or employers should not disclose 
the type of action or identify Defendant.  Because of the highly-publicized nature of 
Defendant’s crimes as well as his designation as a sexual offender, the mere mention of 
Defendant’s name in any subpoena or deposition notice will automatically expose the 
subject Plaintiff as one of Defendant’s victims and may result in unnecessary public 
humiliation.  Similarly, records custodian depositions do not require the disclosure of the 
nature of the action and/or the identity of the defendant in the action.3   
3. 
Defendant’s only purpose in opposing Plaintiffs’ motions is harassment.  
Defendant’s intentions are clear.  He seeks to destroy these young women by outing them 
as being among his many victims, a pattern of behavior consistent with his status as a 
designated sex offender.  Defendant openly admits to his desire to reveal the victims’ 
names in newspapers so that individuals in their community can come forward to assault 
their credibility and tarnish their reputations (and, as a result, their dignity).  See 
Defendant’s Response in Opposition to Motion to Proceed Anonymously (DE# 5) at ¶ 6 
(“[O]nce the Plaintiff is identified, other individuals come forward in the discovery phase 
with information which often directly contradicts allegations as to the events and 
Depending upon claims of Plaintiffs, certain documents will be relevant.  At this point, however, 
Plaintiffs do not waive their privilege to prevent the release of each of their names under the doctor-patient 
relationship.   
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 6 of 17

damages.  For instance, witnesses may testify that Plaintiff was paid by others for similar 
sexual acts she claims Mr. Epstein forced upon her or that she willingly participated in 
certain acts(s) that would negate or lessen her damages”).  Each of Defendant’s victims 
whom undersigned counsel represents continues to experience trauma and humiliation 
associated with sexual abuse.  See Ellen Bass & Laura Davis, The Courage to Heal: A 
Guide for Women Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse 3 (4th ed. 2008) (“The long-term 
effects of child sexual abuse can be so pervasive that it’s sometimes hard to pinpoint 
exactly how the abuse affected you.  It can permeate everything:  your sense of self, 
intimate relationships, sexuality, parenting, working, even your sanity.”)4  The U.S. 
Supreme Court in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 597 (1977), discussed the grave 
nature of the crimes at issue in the cases against Defendant, stating: 
[Rape] is highly reprehensible, both in a moral sense and in its almost total 
contempt for the personal integrity and autonomy of the female victim ... Short of 
homicide, it is the “ultimate violation of self.”  
Defendant committed crimes constituting the “ultimate violation of self” against minors.  
Because of the disdainful nature of these types of crimes, courts, including the Eleventh 
Circuit, “have carved out a limited number of exceptions to the general requirement of 
disclosure, which permit plaintiffs to proceed anonymously.”  Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. 
for Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 685 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted).  “The 
Although some Plaintiffs no longer live in the Palm Beach area, this should not undermine Plaintiffs’ 
need for anonymity.  As the Court in Doe No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 197 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (internal 
citation omitted), points out, “[I]t is now possible to ‘determine whether a given individual is a party to a 
lawsuit in federal court anywhere in the country by the simplest of computer searches, to access the docket 
sheet of any such case electronically, and … that entire case files will be accessible over the Internet.”  
Given the ease with which the public could access court files in these cases, it is reasonable that Plaintiffs’ 
fears extend beyond ostracism in the Palm Beach community.  The Palm Beach Post is available online all 
over the world.  In addition, many of Plaintiffs’ family members remain in the Palm Beach area and remain 
unaware of their daughter/granddaughter/niece’s involvement in Defendant’s sordid child sex exploitation 
enterprise.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs are exposed to harassment through social networking sites such as 
Facebook and MySpace as well as other forms of online harrassment. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 7 of 17

ultimate test for permitting a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is whether the plaintiff has 
a substantial privacy right which outweighs the customary and constitutionally-embedded 
presumption of openness in judicial proceedings.”  Id. (internal quotation and citation 
omitted).   
4. 
Cases regarding sexual assault are the paradigmatic examples of the type 
of highly sensitive and personal matter that warrant a grant of anonymity.  See Doe No. 2 
v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 195-98 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (adult plaintiff, who, many years later, 
alleged that he was sexually abused by rabbi at private Jewish school when he was a 
child, was entitled to proceed anonymously because he feared retaliation and ostracism 
from his community); Doe v. Evans, 202 F.R.D. 173, 176 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (sexual assault 
victim granted use of pseudonym); Doe v. Smith, 105 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) 
(victim of assault, molestation, and sexual abuse granted anonymity because victim 
otherwise psychologically and emotionally unable to proceed with action); Roe v. Borup, 
500 F. Supp. 127, 130 (E.D. Wis. 1980) (“It is beyond argument that [a suit involving 
charges of sexual abuse of a child] is a highly sensitive issue”; thus, plaintiffs were 
entitled to use fictitious names in prosecuting the suit); see also Doe v. Blue Cross & 
Blue Shield United of Wis., 112 F.3d 869, 872 (7th Cir. 1997) (“[F]ictitious names are 
allowed when necessary to protect the privacy of children, rape victims, and other 
particularly vulnerable parties or witnesses.”).  The intensely personal nature of sexual 
exploitation creates an unusual case, and, in such a case, the general policy of full 
disclosure should give way to a policy of protecting privacy in a very private matter.  
This protection is especially necessary when the Court is dealing with young women who 
recently were sexually abused as minors.   
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 8 of 17

5. 
Defendant is using the threat of publicity to attempt to intimidate victims 
to cause them not to file suit or to settle their claims for the absolute minimum in order 
for them to avoid being held up to public ridicule and hostility.  His intention to attack the 
victims is at the heart of the protection afforded by numerous rape shield statutes, of 
which Defendant and his counsel are surely aware.  In 1994, Congress amended the 
Federal Rules of Evidence to promote the strong social policy of protecting a victim’s 
privacy and encouraging victims of crime to come forward.  “The reason for extending 
Rule 412 to civil cases is equally obvious.  The need to protect alleged victims against 
invasions of privacy, potential embarrassment, and unwarranted sexual stereotyping, and 
the wish to encourage victims to come forward when they have been sexually molested 
do not disappear because the context has shifted from a criminal prosecution to a claim 
for damages or injunctive relief.”  Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory committee’s note.  Rule 
412 now provides that, in civil trials in federal court involving alleged sexual misconduct, 
evidence that the victim engaged in other sexual behavior or evidence offered to prove 
any alleged victim's sexual predisposition can be admitted only in unusual circumstances, 
none of which apply to Plaintiffs’ cases.  Fed. R. Evid. 412 (a), (b).  “The rule aims to 
safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and 
sexual stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details and 
the infusion of sexual innuendo into the factfinding process.  By affording victims 
protection in most instances, the rule also encourages victims of sexual misconduct to 
institute and to participate in legal proceedings against alleged offenders.”  Fed. R. Evid. 
412 advisory committee’s note; see also Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145, 149-50 (1991) 
(Rape shield statutes represent the valid legislative determination that victims of rape and 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 9 of 17

attempted rape “deserve heightened protection against surprise, harassment, and 
unnecessary invasions of privacy.”); United States v. Elbert, 561 F.3d 771, 776-77 (8th 
Cir. 2009) (evidence that child plaintiffs had previously engaged in prostitution was 
rightfully excluded in federal sex trafficking suit); Stephens v. Miller, 13 F.3d 998, 1010 
(7th Cir. 1994) (Cummings, C.J., dissenting) (“The Indiana rape shield statute furthers 
laudable and pragmatic goals.  It protects victims from needless exposure of their sexual 
past conduct; [and] ensures that the focus of rape trials remains the guilt or innocence of 
the accused rather than the sexual history of the complainant.”); United States  v. Kasto, 
584 F.2d 268, 271-72 n.3 (8th Cir. 1978) (“[U]nchastity of a victim has no relevance 
whatsoever to [the victim’s] credibility as a witness.  Such a proposition would 
‘necessarily imply the absurd (corollary) that the extramarital sexual history of a female 
witness would be admissible to impeach her credibility in any case in which she 
testified.’”) (internal citation omitted).  Procedural protections such as the rape shield 
statutes reduce the embarrassment and anguish of trial, encouraging victims to report 
sexual offenses and offendors.  “Without the protection provided by rape shield statutes, 
victims may find trial an ordeal not worth enduring.”  Stephens, 13 F.3d at 1010 
(Cummings, C.J., dissenting) (quoting 124 Cong. Rec. H11944 (1978) (statement of Rep. 
Elizabeth Holtzman)); see Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory committee’s note (“Too often in 
this country victims of rape are humiliated and harassed when they report and prosecute 
the rape. … [R]ape trials become inquisitions into the victim’s morality, not trials of the 
defendant's innocence or guilt ….”).  Indeed, “many [victims] find the trial almost as 
degrading as the rape itself.”  Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory committee’s note.   
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 10 of 17

6. 
In addition, Congress enacted the Child Victims’ and Child Witnesses’ 
Rights Act (18 U.S.C. § 3509) in an effort to provide protection for victims who, while 
minors, were victims of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, or who have 
witnessed a crime committed upon another.  One of the primary protections provided by 
the statute is the restriction on the disclosure of the name of, or other information 
concerning, the victim.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d)(3) (2008).  Further, pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. § 3509(d)(2), “[a]ll papers to be filed in court that disclose the name of or any 
other information concerning a child shall be filed under seal without necessity of 
obtaining a court order.”  
7. 
Indeed, numerous states, including Florida and New York, have enacted 
laws to protect the anonymity of sexual assault victims.  See Fla. Stat. §§ 794.024, 
794.026 (2008); N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b (McKinney 2009).  In 1994, the Florida 
Legislature passed The Crime Victims Protection Act.  The legislative stated purpose for 
passage of the Act was “to protect the identity of victims of sexual crimes.”  Fla. AGO 
2003-56, 2003 WL 22971082 (Dec. 15, 2003) (“[T]he Legislature intended to make the 
identity of a victim of a sexual crime confidential in a court record or proceeding.”)   
Under Florida Section 794.024 of the Florida Statutes, court records that identify the 
name and/or address of a victim of a sexual crime are presumed to be confidential and 
exempt from public access.  Id.  That statute further imposes criminal and civil liability 
for the disclosure or communication of information identifying the victim of a sexual 
crime.  Fla. AGO 2003-56, 2003 WL 22971082 (citing Fla. Stat. §§ 794.024, 794.026 
(2008)).  Similarly, upon approving New York’s rape shield law, then Governor Mario 
Cuomo stated, “[S]exual assault victims have unfortunately had to endure a terrible 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 25   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/29/2009   Page 11 of 17

invasion of their physical privacy.  They have a right to expect that this violation will not 
be compounded by a further invasion of their privacy.”  1991 N.Y. Sess. Laws page nos. 
2211-12, quoted in Kolko, 242 F.R.D. at 196 (internal citations omitted).   
8. 
Finally, Defendant should be estopped from outing his victims.  Plaintiffs 
attempted to utilize the process established by the Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) 
with the reasonable expectation that a specific purpose of the NPA was to allow 
Defendant’s victims to maintain anonymity, only to be subjected to deliberate and 
unreasonable delays and Defendant’s failure to engage in meaningful, good faith 
settlement discussions.  This left Plaintiffs no choice but to file suit.  Under these 
circumstances, Defendant should be estopped from seeking to lift anonymity.   
9. 
Many of Defendant’s victims are awaiting this Court’s decision regarding 
whether they will be allowed to proceed anonymously before making the difficult 
decision as to whether to pursue their claims against Defendant.  All of Defendant’s 
victims and any future victims of sexual exploitation must know that they can protect 
what remains of their personal dignity when appealing to the Federal Courts for justice. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully move this Court to grant Plaintiffs’ Motion 
to Proceed Anonymously and to deny Defendant’s Motion to Compel and/or Identify 
Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 in Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of 
Discovery.

LEAVE TO FILE UNDER SEAL RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO 
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STAY OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TO UNSEAL 
THE NONPROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
Pursuant to Rule 5.4 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida, Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 (together, 
the “Plaintiffs”) by and through their undersigned attorneys, hereby file this Motion For 
Leave to File Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102’s Response in 
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay and/or Continue Action for Time Certain 
Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings With Incorporated Memorandum of 
Law Under Seal, and, as grounds, state as follows: 
1.

Undersigned counsel recognize that this Court has previously unsealed 
documents referring to the NPA.  We seek to comply with the Protective Order for this 
new and independent filing in an abundance of caution, until directed otherwise by the 
Court.

If this Court denies Plaintiffs’ instant motion, Plaintiffs seek appropriate 
disclosure of the NPA pursuant to this Court’s recent order in Case No. 08-80736-CIV-
MARRA/JOHNSON (DE #36) denying Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2’s 
motion to unseal the NPA.  As stated in that Order, the NPA has not been filed with the 
Court.  Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 would then have “a specific 
tangible need to be relieved of the restrictions” of the Protective Order because 
consideration of the terms of the NPA is necessary for this Court to resolve Defendant’s 
Motion to Stay.   
WHEREFORE,  
1. 
Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to enter an Order granting 
Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 the right to file under seal their 
Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay and/or Continue Action for Time 
Certain Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings With Incorporated 
Memorandum of Law.   
2. 
In the alternative, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to unseal the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement in order to allow Plaintiffs to concretely respond to 
Defendant’s Motion to Stay.    
3. 
Finally, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to grant such other and 
further relief to which this Court finds the Plaintiff otherwise entitled.

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 1 of 11
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 09-CIV- 80469 - MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE 11, 
Plaintiff, 
V. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
---------------'/ 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S REPLY TO & MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF'S 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
attorneys, replies to and moves to strike Point 4 of Plaintiff's Memorandum Of Law In 
Opposition To Defendant Epstein's Motion To Dismiss, dated May 22, 2009, ("MOL"). 
Accordingly, Defendant states: 
I. Legal Standard (pp. 1-2 of Plaintiff's MOL) 
Plaintiff's reliance on Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957), as the Rule 
12(b)(6) pleading standard is misplaced. 
As discussed in Defendant's motion to 
dismiss, (pp. 16 - 17), the standard as detailed in Bell Atlantic Corp. V. Twombly, 127 
S.Ct. 1955 (2007), is now the applicable standard, not Conley. Although the complaint 
need not provide detailed factual allegations, the basis for relief in the complaint must 
state "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a 
cause of action will not do." Twombly, at 1965. Further, "[f]actual allegations must be 
enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all 
the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)." Id. The United States 
Supreme Court very recently made clear in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, No. 07-1015 (U.S. May 18, 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 2 of 11
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 2 
2009)(slip copy op. at 20), that Twombly expounded the pleading standard for "all civil 
actions" and not just pleadings made in the context of an antitrust dispute. Significantly, 
the Supreme Court in Twombly abrogated the often cited observation from Conley that 
"a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears 
beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which 
would entitle him to relief." Id, (abrogating and quoting Conley, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 
S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). The Supreme Court rejected the notion that "a 
wholly conclusory statement of claim [can] survive a motion to dismiss whenever the 
pleadings le[ave] open the possibility that a plaintiff might later establish some 'set of 
[undisclosed] facts' to support recovery." Id. 
See also Berry v. Budget Rent A Car 
Systems, Inc., 497 F.Supp.2d 1361, 1364 (S.D. Fla. 2007)(" ... pursuant to Twombly, to 
survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must now contain factual allegations which are 
'enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. on the assumption that all 
the allegations in the complaint are true.""). 
II. ARGUMENT 
Point 1. There is already pending a previously filed state action arising from the 
same factual allegations requiring dismissal of the federal action. (MOL, pp. 2 -
Z1 
First and foremost, contrary to Plaintiff's assertion that Defendant's argument 
regarding jurisdiction is "frivolous" is without basis. As discussed in Defendant's motion, 
Plaintiff chose to file a prior action based on the identical underlying facts in state court. 
It makes no sense for two actions - involving the same parties. witnesses, evidence, 
etc., to proceed separately in two separate forums. 
Plaintiff cites to no case law to 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 3 of 11
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 3 
counter and does not appear to directly dispute Defendant's position that the state court 
would have concurrent jurisdiction over the claim brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255. 
Secondly, Plaintiff's assertion, (MOL, p.2, fn. 1 ), that it is somehow improper to 
attach a copy of this same Plaintiff's Complaint from the state court proceeding in 
support of Defendant's motion is ridiculous. 
It is completely proper and in essence 
required of any party to give notice to a court of a related pending proceeding. (See for 
example, Loe. Gen. Rule 3.8 (S.D. Fla. 2009). 1 
The fact that there does exists a 
previously filed action by Plaintiff against Defendant is directly relevant to this Court's 
decision of whether or not to exercise jurisdiction over the §2255 claim when there 
exists a previously filed proceeding in which the claim might also be brought. Needless 
to say, whether or not a Court exercises jurisdiction over a matter is a critical issue. 
Finally, Plaintiff completely mischaracterizes what she herself alleged in 
paragraph 15 of her Complaint. In her MOL, p. 7, Plaintiff falsely asserts that in par. 15 
she "pied that Defendant made an agreement with the United States Attorney's Office to 
not contest the jurisdiction of this Court in exchange for avoiding prosecution under 
federal law for solicitation of minors for prostitution." What is actually alleged in par. 15 
is the following: "Defendant EPSTEIN has made an agreement with the United 
States Attorney's Office to not contest liability for claims brought exclusively 
See also Bray & Gillespie Management LLC v. Lexington Ins. Co., 2008 WL 4826115, 1 (M.D. 
Fla. 2008) - "[t]he Court 'may take notice of proceedings in other courts, both within and without 
the federal judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue.' St. 
Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. FDIC, 605 F.2d 1169, 1172 (10th Cir.1979); accord Coney v. 
Smith, 738 F.2d 1199, 1200 (11th Cir.1984). Counsel should be given notice of and an 
opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice. Fed.R.Civ.P. 201(e).'' Here, 
Plaintiff filed the state court action and is, thusly, well of aware of its existence and details.

Page 4 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, in exchange for avoiding federal prosecution under 
U.S.C. §2422(b), which provides a sentence of 10 years for each violation of the 
Jaw." (See also p. 14 of MOL, where Plaintiff again misrepresents what is actually 
alleged in her Complaint). Not only does Plaintiff misrepresent what is alleged in her 
complaint, but she also ignores the fact that she chose to bring claims (in the first filed 
state court action) in addition to the 18 U.S.C. §2255 claim. Thus, there is no violation 
of the alleged agreement and EPSTEIN has not agreed to not contest liability (or 
jurisdiction); Plaintiff did not choose to proceed exclusively under §2255. 
Accordingly, it is well within this Court's discretion to require that Plaintiff bring 
her §2255 claim in the previously filed state court action. 
Point 2. The issue of the applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 is properly raised 
at this time as Plaintiff alleged in her complaint that the 2006 version applies to 
conduct that occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment. (pp. 7 - 13, 
Plaintiff's MOL}. 
Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, what version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 is appropriately 
raised in Defendant's motion to dismiss. Plaintiff's complaint attempts to allege a cause 
of action based on the 2006 amended version of the statute. 
As discussed in 
Defendant's motion, it is Defendant's position that Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of 
action thereunder as she is improperly bringing her claim under the 2006 amended 
version instead of the statute in effect at the time of the complained of conduct, the 
2005 version. Related to the issue of what version of §2255 applies to this action is 
Plaintiff's improper attempt to multiply the presumptive minimum of actual damages, 
($50,000 under the 2005 statute; $150,000 under the 2006 amended version), based on 
the number of incidents alleged, notwithstanding that the plain language of the statute 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 5 of 11
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 5 
does not provide for a multiplier and speaks in terms of "personal injury" suffered and 
"actual damages." 
Supporting the fact that Defendant properly raised these issues in his motion to 
dismiss are the allegations set forth in Plaintiff's complaint. In paragraph 11, Jane Doe 
II alleges that -
"From about June, 2003 until about February, 2005, Defendants, 
EPSTEIN and KELLEN persuaded, induced, or enticed Plaintiff to come to Defendant 
EPSTEIN's home and provide Defendant EPSTEIN with 'massages' .... " In paragraph 
13, Plaintiff further alleges -
"In violation of §2422(b), Defendants EPSTEIN and 
KELLEN knowingly persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to engage in acts of 
prostitution, when the Plainitff was undr the age of 18, approximately on or about the 
following dates that Plaintiff can document based on payments received: 6/16/03, 
7/2/03, 4/9/04, 6/7/04, 7/30/04, 8/30/04, 10/9/04, 10/12/04 and 11/9/04 ..... " 
In 
paragraph 14, Plaintiff alleges -
"Plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury in 
accordance with 18 U.S.C. §2255(a) for each of the acts of prostitution set forth above 
which Defendants solicited her, $150,000 for each violation, for a total range of 
damages between $1.5 million dollars and $4.5 million dollars, jointly and severally, and 
a reasonable attorney's fees and costs, as permitted by the statute." 
Plaintiff chooses to analyze whether the statute in effect at the time of the alleged 
conduct or the amended statute applies under a procedural versus substantive analysis. 
Plaintiff, in short, argues that "the change in the civil remedies available of a statute is a 
procedural, not a substantive change in the law, and procedural changes to a statute 
are routinely applied retroactively." (MOL, p. 9). Clearly , the change to the statute was 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 6 of 11
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 6 
not a procedural one. As discussed more fully in Defendant's motion to dismiss, the 
statutory scheme enacted and amended under "Masha's Law" is consitently referred to 
as criminal penalties and punishments directed at those who sexually exploit and abuse 
minors. 
Also, Plaintiff ignores the axiom that courts generally apply the statute in effect 
at the time of the underlying conduct unless there is a clear statement that an 
amendment is to apply retroactively to prior conduct. See, e.g., Hughes Aircraft Co. v. 
U.S. ex rel Schumer, 520 U.S. 939, 952 (1997)("Given the absence of a clear statutory 
expression of congressional intent to apply the 1986 amendment to conduct competed 
before its enactment, we ... hold that, under the relevant 1982 version of the [statute], 
the District court was obliged to dismiss the action."). There is absolutely no expression 
of any intent that the amended version of the statute is to apply retroactively. This lack 
of clear of expression can be contrasted with those statutory enactments or 
amendments where such intent is clearly expressed by including language to the effect 
that the amendment applies in proceedings "commenced on or after the date of 
enactment." See generally, Tello v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 410 F.3d 1275, 1282-
1283 (11 th Cir. 2005). 
In Tello v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 410 F.3d 1275, 1283 (11 th Cir. 2005), this 
Circuit discussed in detail the presumption against retroactivity where there is no clear 
expression that a statute is to apply retroactively in the text. In amending §2255, there 
does not exist any statement by Congress of its unambiguous intention that the statute 
apply retroactively to pre-enactment conduct. 
The Tello Court's analysis is worth 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 7 of 11
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 7 
quoting as it confirms and supports that an amendment to a statute, such as in the 
instant case - increasing the penalty or liability for damages by at least triple fold, or 
under Plaintiff's analysis, by 90 times from $50,000 to $4.5 million! - and with no 
expression that it is to apply retroactively - will not be interpreted to apply retroactively. 
Congress may prescribe the temporal reach of a statute by stating that it 
applies to pre-enactment conduct, the first step in the Landgraf analysis, or a 
statute may be silent regarding temporal reach, in which case courts 
apply the judicial presumption against retroactivity. This presumption and 
analysis, however, are unwarranted when Congress states its unambiguous 
intention that the statute apply retroactively to pre-enactment conduct, in 
language comparable to§ 1658(b), that the new or amended statute applies to 
proceedings commenced on or after enactment. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 259-
60, 114 S.Ct. at 1494 (stating that, if had Congress intended retroactive 
application, then "it surely would have used language comparable to ... 'shall 
apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment' 
") (citation omitted); accord INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 318-19 & n. 43, 121 
S.Ct. 2271, 2289-90 & n. 43, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (collecting examples of 
unambiguous temporal statutory language providing that the statute applies to 
actions filed "on or after" the date of enactment, which includes violative 
conduct that occurred prior to the effective date of the statute); Martin v. Hadix, 
527 U.S. 343, 354, 119 S.Ct. 1998, 2004, 144 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999) (stating that" 
'new provisions shall apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after 
the date of enactment,' " referenced in Landgraf, "unambiguously addresses the 
temporal reach of the statute" (citation omitted)); Undh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 
320, 329 n. 4, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 2064 n. 4, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997) (recognizing 
from Landgraf that statutory language such as, " '[This Act] shall apply to a// 
proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment of this Act,' 
" "might possibly have qualified as a clear statement for retroactive effect" 
(quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 260, 114 S.Ct. at 1494)); Rivers v. Roadway 
Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 307-08, 114 S.Ct. 1510, 1517, 128 L.Ed.2d 274 
(1994) (noting that the subject statute omitted a provision in the bill that the 
amendment" 'shall apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after' " a 
fixed date and describing the bill as containing "express retroactivity 
provisions"). .. . 
Unlike other statutory enactments or amendments (cited above) where Congress 
unambiguously expressed its intent regarding retroactive application, there is no 
expression with respect to Masha's Law, the 2006 amended version of §2255. An 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 8 of 11
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 8 
example where Congress expressed its intent regarding retroactivity was when it 
enacted an expanded sex-offender registry ("SORNA") meant to bolster tracking of 
convicted sex offenders, like Masha's Law, also enacted as part of the Adam Walsh Act. 
See Pub.L. 109-248 §§1-155, 120 Stat. 587, 590-611 (2006). Congress recognized that 
applying expanded version of SORNA to past offenders would raise retroactivity 
concerns, and therefore, expressly addressed the concern -
The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the 
requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before July 27, 2006 
or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction, and to prescribe rules for the 
registration of any such sex offenders. 42 U.S.C. §16913(d). 
As the Supreme Court and this Circuit have long observed, "where Congress 
includes particular language in one section of a statute but it omits it in another section 
of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and 
purposefully in disparate inclusion or exclusion." U.S. v. Jordan, 915 F.2d 622, 628 
(11 th Cir. 1990), quoting Rodriguez v. U.S., 480 U.S. 522, 525 (1987). In this case, 
there is no basis for departing from this well established rule. 
The only evidence 
regarding §2255, as amended 2006, is that Congress did not intend it to apply 
retroactively, and, accordingly, the 2005 version of the statute applies. 
Accordingly, under well established legal principles, the statute in effect at the time 
of the alleged conduct applies, not the amended version. 
Point 3. 18 U.S.C. §2255 does not allow Plaintiff assert multiple claims against a 
Defendant in an effort to multiply the presumptive actual damages minimum. 
(pp. 14-15, Plaintiff's MOL). 
Plaintiff cites to no case law in support of its nonsensical view that §2255 allows 
them to multiply the presumptive damages amount on a per incident basis. 
As 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 9 of 11
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 9 
discussed in Part 111, A. of Defendant's motion to dismiss, unlike other statutes, there is 
absolutely no language in the statute that suggest that the presumptive damages 
amount is subject to multiplication on a per violation/incident basis. The statute on its 
face speaks in terms of "actual damages" and "personal injury suffered." 
The recent case of United States v. Berdeal, 595 F.Supp.2d 1326 (S.D. Fla. 
2009), further supports Defendant's argument that the "rule of lenity," (Part. II1.C. of 
Defendant's motion), requires that the Court resolve the statutory interpretation conflict 
in favor of Defendant. 
Assuming for the sake of argument that Plaintiff's multiple 
causes of action, leading to a multiplication of the statutory damages amount, is a 
reasonable interpretation, like Defendant's reasonable interpretation, under the "rule of 
lenity," any ambiguity is resolved in favor of the least draconian measure. In Berdeal, 
applying the rule of lenity, the Court sided with the Defendants' interpretation of the 
Lacey Act which makes illegal the possession of snook caught in specified jurisdictions. 
The snook had been caught in Nicaraguan waters. The defendants filed a motion to 
dismiss asserting the statute did not encompass snook caught in foreign waters. The 
United States disagreed. Both sides presented reasonable interpretations regarding the 
reach of the statute. In dismissing the indictment, the Court determined that the rule of 
lenity required it to accept defendants' interpretation. 
Point 4. Point 4 is required to be stricken as Plaintiff attempts to argue facts not 
alleged in the Complaint. and misrepresents what is alleged in the Complaint. 
Point 4 of Plaintiff's MOL, p. 15-17, is required to be stricken as it not only argues 
facts outside of the four corners of the complaint, but it continues to misrepresent what 
is actually alleged in paragraph 15 of Plaintiff's complaint. See discussion under "Point 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 31   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/01/2009   Page 10 of 11
Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 10 
1" above herein. 
Rather than address the deficiencies of her Complaint, Plaintiff 
attempts to argue the merits of her case by asserting what the evidence may (or may 
not) show. If Plaintiff is seeking to reallege her claims, she should do so by proper 
procedure requesting she be allowed to amend. The discussion in Point 4 addresses 
none of the arguments in Defendant's motion to dismiss and should be stricken. Rule 
12(f), Fed.R.Civ.P. (2009). Defendant stands on its position that Plaintiff has failed to 
sufficiently plead the requisite predicate acts as set forth in his motion to dismiss. 
Point 5. 
Plaintiff has failed to plead the requisite predicate acts or any 
conspiracy to commit such acts. (MOL, pp 17-18). 
Finally, Plaintiff has failed to allege under the Twombly standard of pleading 
sufficient facts to allege the underlying predicate acts required by §2255. See Part Ill. B 
and C of Defendant's motion. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court grant his motion to dismiss 
and strike.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NO. 101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102's 
REPLY TO DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS 
JANE DOE NO. 101 AND JANE DOE NO. 102'S MOTION FOR A NO-
CONTACT ORDER 
Plaintiffs, JANE DOE No. 101 and JANE DOE No. 102 (together, the 
"Plaintiffs"), by and through undersigned counsel, hereby reply to Defendant Jeffrey 
Epstein's Response to Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102's Motion for a 
No-Contact Order(" Response") as follows: 
1. 
Plaintiffs have not, and will not, engage in any name-calling. For 
purposes of Plaintiffs Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102's Motion for a No-
Contact Order ("Motion"), it does not matter whether "many of the alleged victims ... 
were or are admitted prostitutes, dancers at strip clubs ... or have criminal records or 
warrants for their arrests ... ," Def. 's Resp. 4, or whether they were living in a monastery 
or planning on becoming nuns, lawyers, or judges. This matter is quite simple: The 
allegations are that, when these victims were minors, Defendant sexually exploited, 
abused, molested, and/or battered them. Regardless of the victims' character or 
Defendant's character, it is obvious that Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, a 55-year-old 
designated sexual offender and convicted felon, should have no contact with his victims. 
2. 
Defendant makes much ado that one victim allegedly telephoned Jack 
Goldberger's office to complain that Mr. Goldberger was holding up the matter. Def.'s 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 32   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2009   Page 5 of 11
Resp. 5. We have no reason to doubt the truth of that statement by defense counsel. 
Unsurprisingly, a 21-year-old homeless, ill, and desperate victim who had waited for 
settlement funds for seven weeks regretfully may have called Mr. Goldberger's office; 
but whether she did so has nothing to do with Plaintiffs' Motion. Likewise, if Defendant 
attempts to telephone undersigned counsel to complain or have any other contact with 
undersigned counsel, undersigned counsel will handle the matter as professionally as Jack 
Goldberger did~by refusing to speak to the opposing party. 
3. 
The troublesome part of Defendant's position is his counsel's statement in 
the attached correspondence that, pursuant to Rule 4-4.2 of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct, "parties to a matter may communicate directly with each other .... " In this 
case, Plaintiffs' counsel are concerned that Defendant or his agents may assert that 
alleged right, and we vehemently disagree that they should have that prerogative in these 
Plaintiffs' cases. No legal justification exists for Defendant or his agents to have any 
direct communications with victims whom Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, sexually 
exploited, abused, molested, and/or battered. 
In his Response, see Def. 's Resp. 4, and in his letter, counsel for Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, professes that "it is not Mr. Epstein's intention to have any direct contact 
with [our] clients." This statement poses two significant problems. First, it leaves the 
door open for Defendant's investigator(s) or other agent(s) to contact the victims. Such 
contact would not be direct and would not be inconsistent with his professed intention to 
refrain from direct contact with his victims. See, e.g., Cook v. All State Home Mortgage, 
Inc., No. 08-3564, 2009 WL 1391527, at *1 (6th Cir. May 15, 2009) (intimidation of 
plaintiffs-loan officers with contentious relationship with defendant-mortgage company 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 32   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2009   Page 6 of 11
through threatening phone calls by defendant's employees considered indirect contact in 
violation of no-contact order in civil suit claiming violation of Fair Labor Standards Act); 
Commonwealth v. Butler, 661 N.E. 2d 666, 666-67 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996) (defendant's 
anonymous delivery of flowers to victim considered indirect contact in violation of no-
contact order). Second, Defendant's counsel does not state that Defendant will not have 
any contact with his victims. He merely states Defendant's intentions. Unfortunately, 
the last five months is replete with other incidents in which Defendant, through his 
counsel, has stated his intentions and thereafter changed his mind. Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, feels free-and actually is free-to change his mind and his stated intentions. 
His victims deserve more than that. Because they are traumatized and fearful, they 
require for their security a firm, unambiguous commitment that Defendant will not 
directly or indirectly contact either of them; considering the situation, any secure 
commitment is attainable only via a Court order. Plaintiffs cannot emotionally afford to 
be in a position in which Defendant can unilaterally change his mind. 
4. 
In the event that Defendant wants to be present at the deposition of a 
Plaintiff or at a Court hearing where a Plaintiff is to attend, the Court can easily resolve 
such situations at that time. Meanwhile, the sole purpose of Defendant's refusal to agree 
to not contact these Plaintiffs is to leave them intimidated and in fear of being in the 
presence of the man who has sexually exploited, abused, molested, and/or battered them. 
One would think that, instead, Defendant would have voluntarily agreed with Plaintiffs' 
prior request to have no contact directly or indirectly, including through his agents, and 
would want to demonstrate to the Court that he will not contact his victims; his refusal to 
stay away from them is nothing short of disturbing. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 32   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/04/2009   Page 7 of 11
5. 
Although not requested, if Defendant's counsel seeks some type of 
reciprocity, Plaintiffs' counsel would agree in writing, and would not oppose a Court 
order prohibiting Plaintiffs from contacting Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein. It is obvious to 
undersigned counsel that there should be absolutely no contact between the parties to 
these lawsuits. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request this Court to enter an Order prohibiting 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and/or his agents from directly or indirectly contacting them.

DECLARATION OF GILBERT KLIMAN, M. D. 
RE: EXPECTATION OF HARM FROM DISCLOSING THE PLAINTIFFS' IDENTITIES 
IN DOES V JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
1. I, Gilbert W. Kliman, M.D., of2105 Divisadero Street, San Francisco, California, 
CA. Physicians License 055912, declare the following under penalty of perjury: 
2. I have been retained by plaintiffs' law firm, Mermelstein & Horowitz, to give expert 
testimony. If called as a witness, I would testify truthfully and competently concerning 
my psychiatric findings about each of the plaintiffs' alleged experiences of sexual abuse, 
and the enduring effects that I find each of the young women have suffered as a direct 
result of the sexual acts perpetrated by the defendant. 
3. I have been asked to respond to the Defense motion, which requests that some of the 
plaintiffs, who are now adults, should be publicly named. It is my opinion that 
involuntary public disclosure will result in the plaintiffs experiencing revictimization, 
albeit by a justice system that is designed to protect them. If their identities are released, 
the victims will be at-risk of having their personal lives scrutinized by friends, extended 
family, spouses, children, fellow students, employers and fellow employees, the media 
and general public. This type of exposure humiliates many victims and represents another 
betrayal of trust. Public exposure places the plaintiffs at further risk of stigmatization, 
shame and retraumatization. 
4. Due to traumatization the plaintiffs are arrested in their development, and even those 
who are now legally adults are arrested in part to adolescent aspects of psychology. 
5. The plaintiffs do not hold their heads high with pride for having been sexually 
controlled by Mr. Epstein. They hold their heads low with shame. The internal life of a 
typical adolescent, into late adolescence and early adult years in the best of 
circumstances, usually involves generous proportions of self-consciousness, shame, self-
absorption and self-doubt and self-blame about sexual acts. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 2 of 5
6. Clinically harmful levels of shame, self-consciousness, self-doubt and self-blame are 
even more prominent among victims of molestations than among the general population. 
7. Molested teenagers are particularly vulnerable to wrongful manipulations and special 
clinical harms from the experiences of shame and humiliation. In fact, shame and efforts 
to cope with it played an underlying role in the harm to each plaintiff. Each was lured 
into Mr. Epstein's sexual lair with the promise of overcoming bodily and sexual shame 
by earning money and bettering their lot in life. The defendant capitalized on their sexual 
naivete, insecurities and effort to better themselves, and he worked hard to overcome 
their shame at his enlistment of them in his selfish gratifications. 
8. The defendant who wishes to make their identities public is one whom the criminal 
justice system has already determined is a person who has already committed a crime of 
child molestation. That surely means he has already exploited and manipulated the girls' 
state of adolescent sexuality, including their embarrassment, awkwardness and bodily 
self-consciousness. He perverted their nascent and developing moral structures by posing 
as a generous, avuncular mentor who could coach them about their bodies, sex and love. 
The exploitation of adolescent bodies, sex and love is - from a psychoanalytic point of 
view - an influence on the developing moral conscience of the children, as well as on 
their sexual urges. Now the ravaging of their internal and private moral conscience is 
intended by the perpetrator to be made a public ravaging. 
9. Among sexual trauma victims, the insidious and destructive persistence of shame, 
humiliation and associated self-blame is well-documented (Finkelhor and Brown, 1985). 
Stigmatization, as experienced by a sexual trauma victim, has especially painful and 
pathologic consequences. Shame lingers and becomes integrated within the adolescent 
victim's malleable emerging identity, character structure and self image. Moral clarity is 
distorted. Perceptions of self-blame and guilt are magnified. The impact of shame lends 
to cultivating a self image of being "spoiled goods." 
10. Stigmatization following sexual trauma results in long-term risks that can negatively 
shape multiple facets of adult development: sexual, emotional, interpersonal and 
vocational. Stigmatization, which is generally to be avoided among psychiatric patients, 
increases risks among those - as in our plaintiffs as a group - who experience clinical 
depression and self-destructive behaviors: drug use, criminal activity, even prostitution. 
Stigmatization following abuse is associated with delinquency due to increased anger 
and affiliation with deviant peers (Feiring et al., 2007). 
11. Shame and guilt are important dimensions of both complex and single event, 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms of shame are associated with feelings of 
helplessness and powerlessness, which each of the plaintiffs endorsed experiencing in 
relation to Mr. Epstein. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 3 of 5
12. The DSM-IV-TR recognizes both powerlessness and helplessness as requisite parts of 
the traumatic experience in Criterion A for the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder 
trauma (Martin Seligman, recent Past President of the American Psychological 
Association, coined relevant terms of "learned helplessness and "Loss of Personal Locus 
of Control." See Seligman, M.P. l 97 5: Helplessness, Depression, Development and 
Death. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco). The teenaged girls suffered the loss of personal 
locus of control to a much more experienced, sexually aggressive, powerful and 
dominant, manipulative perpetrator. 
13. Releasing names of the plaintiffs to the public will reenact experiences of 
powerlessness and helplessness in the face of a boundary violation. Repetition and 
reenactment represent central features of Criterion B in the DSM-IV -TR diagnosis of 
posttraumatic stress disorder trauma. In effect, release of their identity and public 
intrusion into their personal life represents a reenactment of the shame of sexual 
traumatization. Repetition and reenactment are central pathologies that afflict sexual 
trauma survivors. 
14. Victims of sexual abuse often rely upon some form of dissociation, splitting or denial, 
as a defensive means to manage overwhelming affects associated with the sexual trauma. 
Each of the plaintiff girls has employed some variation of this defense, both during the 
massages and then subsequently following disclosure of the abuse. Primitive, 
maladaptive responses of this nature will become additionally reinforced as a result of 
public disclosure. 
15. Another aspect of the plaintiffs' experience, which is recognized by DSM-IV -TR, is 
that the trauma was associated with human design factors (such as cruel intention to do 
harm, rape, torture). Trauma of this origin has a tendency to produce more "severe or 
long lasting" posttraumatic stress disorder than natural events (DSM IV TR p. 464). A 
policy of deliberate revelation of the names of the victims would reinforce the sense of 
design, pattern and policy of human intentions. 
16. Negative expectations about significant activities are noted in DSM-IV-TR, as part of 
Criterion C. Symptoms of foreshortened future are characteristic of a traumatized 
individual's clinical course (C4). They expect revictimization. They expect bad outcomes 
(C7) in their social, educational, vocational, relational plans. They are hypervigilant 
(Criterion D4) for further trauma, and this affects lifestyle choices and future planning. 
Hypervigilance is part of the arousal set of criteria. Public disclosure of the victims' 
identity will aggravate existing symptoms of hypervigilance. 
17. The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic category of "chronic" is justified for each of the 
plaintiffs. Scientific literature shows that the prognostic consequences of PTSD and 
residual effects may last for decades (U.S. Dept. of Health, 2005; Issues in Child Abuse 
Prevention Number 9 Autumn] 998: Long-term Effects of Child Sexual Abuse, Paul E 
Mullen and Jillian Fleming). The lasting impact upon character, identity and moral 
development will probably affect long-term influences upon adult development. It is 
more probable than not that stigmatization associated with public disclosure of the 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 4 of 5
plaintiffs' identities will intensify the scope, nature and severity of the chronic symptom 
course. 
18. In addition to PTSD, shame and humiliation themselves have also been associated 
with causing clinical depression. Coexisting PTSD and clinical depression places the 
plaintiffs at increased risk for re-victimization and high risk sexual behaviors (e.g., 
sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy, rape) (Nelson, 2002), and at greater 
risk to victimize others (Filipas and Ullman, 2006; Desai, Centers for Disease Control, 
2002) who are in their control. Studies have also shown that chronic symptoms of PTSD, 
in association with a single episode of Major Depressive Disorder, can produce lifetime 
adjustment difficulties, which include suicidality (Oquendo et al, 2005; Dube et al, CDC, 
2001; Rohde, J. Am. Acad. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 2005). The plaintiffs will be 
additionally vulnerable to these clinical outcomes, if they suffer the stigmatization and 
humiliation associated with public disclosure of their identities. 
19. Alternative hypothesis: I have applied the evidence shown from examination and 
testing of the plaintiffs and relevant observations and information from other 
professionals while testing an alternative hypothesis: that no harm would result from 
public disclosure of the plaintiffs' identities. During the evaluations with the six 
plaintiffs, I used generally acceptable criteria for establishing whether a DSM-IV-TR 
disorder occurred. I established that there were provable and diagnosable injuries, 
primarily posttraumatic stress disorder and comorbid depression. Based upon these 
diagnostic signs, it is more probable than not, that exposing the plaintiffs identity to the 
public is not a trivial concern or one without substantial clinical repercussions. I believe 
that most child, adolescent and adult psychiatrists would share the opinion that additional 
psychiatric injury will result from such exposure. 
20. However, consider for the sake of argument, that my diagnostic conclusions are 
incorrect, notwithstanding having fulfilled standard psychiatric evaluation procedures of 
taking a history from multiple sources, videotaping and transcribing my initial interview, 
and reviewing available medical and legal documents. Even if this was the case, and my 
diagnostic conclusions were faulty, I believe that multiple experts, even those who may 
now propose publication of the victims' names, would still come to a conclusion that the 
plaintiffs suffered sexual abuse, and in some cases, multiple acts of ongoing abuse, at the 
hands of Jeffery Epstein. Even without developing a subsequent disorder, there is much 
clinical evidence and scientific literature showing likelihood of substantial psychiatric 
harm to these sexually abused plaintiffs. 
21. To form these conclusions, I have used my extensive experience in forming these 
opinions. That experience is both as a treating child psychiatrist and separately as a 
forensic psychiatrist. I have treated hundreds of minor patients, as well as additionally 
evaluated hundreds of children and adolescents who have suffered sexual abuse. I have 
made long term followups of many of the children and have treated many adults who 
have been molested as adolescents. It is my opinion, with a reasonably high degree of 
medical certainty that the defense motion to allow public disclosure of the plaintiffs' 
identities is clinically and ethically a wrongful plan. The act of revealing their identities 
against their wishes places the plaintiffs at risk, in the best of circumstances, of suffering 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 5 of 5
an aggravation of existing diagnostic concerns. It is more probable than not that releasing 
personal identities will foster an exacerbation and magnification of symptoms lending to 
increased risk of revictimization and retraumatization. 
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the 
foregoing statements are true and correct, and that this declaration was executed at San 
Francisco, California on June 4, 2009.

professional publications include books and peer-reviewed medical journal articles on mass 
disasters, most recently concerning the Attack on America. 
He was extensively interviewed in 1997 by CBS Dallas TV regarding psychiatric testimony 
concerning eleven altar boys, testimony which had resulted in a record-making jury verdict 
against the Archdiocese of Dallas. In April, 1998, Dr. Kliman was interviewed by Channel Four 
anchorwoman, Linda Yee, concerning his Salvation Army project providing the Cornerstone 
form of psychoanalytic psychotherapy for homeless preschoolers and toddlers,. The Cornerstone 
project itself was viewed on the Channel II Five O'Clock News. KGO TV interviewed Dr. 
Kliman concerning a forensic testimony, with a focus on a Stanford football player who had 
allegedly become a child molester. During the Lewinsky-Clinton matter, Kliman was 
interviewed by Channel 12/20 concerning psychoanalytic views of leaders having exceptional 
sexual access to partners and the risk of a position of power overcoming the judgments of such 
leaders. 
During 2001 following the World Trade Building terrorism, Dr. Kliman was 
interviewed by Channel II News and appeared on five occasions thereafter through 2003 
concerning the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In May 2003, he was discussant with U.N. Secretary 
General Olaru Otonu, featured on Dhubai Business TV concerning the plight of children in war. 
In 2004, together with the International Psychoanalytic Association, Dr. Kliman helped organize, 
establish and supervise a therapeutic preschool project in Buenos Aires. 
"Cornerstone 
Argentina" is now in its second year of treating severely disturbed and impoverished 
preschoolers, with his continuing collaboration. 
Following the hurricane disasters of 2005 he collaborated with Mercy Corps and the Children's 
Psychological Health Center to produce a mental health resource. The result, "My Katrina and 
Rita Story", a guided activity resource of families who had to deal with the hurricanes. Mercy 
Corps is distributing copies to 20,000 families. 
In 2005, RE DISTURBED PRESCHOOLERS Dr. Kliman helped organize, establish and 
supervise a therapeutic project in Piedmont California, at the nonprofit Ann Martin Center. 
In 2007, RE HOMELESS CHILDREN: Dr. Kliman helped establish a Reflective Network 
Therapy service for homeless preschoolers in Seattle. He provided four days of training in that 
method for the Family Service Center of King County (located in Seattle), and created an 
organizational link between The Family Services Center and The Children's Psychological 
Health Center, Inc. of San Francisco in order to continue serving homeless children in Seattle. 
In 2008, Dr. Kliman activated the Reflective Network Therapy services for preschoolers m 
Seattle. He supervises there in person and by phone and video. 
In 2008, RE DISASTER SERVICES: Following the Sichuan Earthquake Disaster of May 12, 
2008, Dr. Kliman established a link between Children's Psychological Health Center, Inc., 
Mercy Corps, and The China America Psychoanalytic Alliance. 
He created mental health 
resources (see Publications) which were licensed for mass distribution in China by Mercy Corps. 
In 2008, Dr. Kliman helped found a new non-profit organization called Teach with Africa and is 
a member of its Board of Directors.

PROFESSIONAL COMMENDATIONS: 
A letter of commendation regarding clinical work in the classroom within a public school 
system: 
December 3, 2001 
To Whom It May Concern: 
This is to report that the San Mateo County Office of Education, Special Education programs, 
has benefited from the services of The Children's Psychological Health Center, specifically its 
Cornerstone Therapeutic School Project. 
We have worked together for the past six years. Under the leadership of Gilbert Kliman, MD., 
the Center has trained members of our teaching and school psychology staff to carry out a 
mental health service on our premises. We now have a collaborative project in its sixth year for 
our special education preschool children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) and 
for those with Serious Emotional Disorders (SED) which interfere with their education. As an 
alternative to sending children to a private nonpublic special education school for extremely 
intensive mental health services at significant cost, this project has created and provides just 
such intensive service within a public preschool special class program at 65 Tower Road, San 
Mateo. 
To my knowledge, among the 30 children served so far under the collaborative project, we are 
seeing cognitive, social and human gains which have decreased the gap between these children 
and their typically developing peers. Several families and children are thriving with less 
intensive special education service or returned to regular education class. Not only has the 
family and child suffering been reduced, the burden to taxpayers is also reduced. The children 
have been able to remain in the community, and some who were functioning as severely autistic 
and retarded now appear to be developing within a somewhat normal range. We are pleased 
with the quality of special education services our County provides for preschoolers with PDD or 
SED. We are also gratified with the research results provided by The Children's Psychological 
Health Center. 
We recommend the Cornerstone project to other school systems, so that they consider it an 
important opportunity should they be able to collaborate similarly with The Children's 
Psychological Health Center. At California's common cost of $15,000 to $40,000 or more a 
year, for a special education child who needs full time special education services and auxiliary 
intensive help, the savings for even one child's 12-year career of intensive services in special 
education can be substantial. The savings from one of the successes we have seen may equal the 
costs of the entire Cornerstone project with the 30 children helped so far. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 16 of 23
We have not yet seen any failures. The agency is showing measurable cognitive gains for our 
collaborative work which, according to their research, averages 20 to 28 points in independent 
WPPSI testing of the children in the Cornerstone program. The techniques are far more 
economical to use than we have found with the Lovaas method, which we also implement for 
some students. We have also seen the techniques transmitted to special education teachers as 
well as inexperienced therapists. 
I invite you to visit our project in action. 
Sincerely, 
JAYS. PARNES, Ed.D.

MAJOR FEDERAL COURT FORENSIC ACTIVITIES: 
EVALUATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS HEARD IN FEDERAL COURT, HANNIBAL 
MISSOURI, November 15, 2001 
Under Dr. Kliman's leadership, a Children's Psychological Health Center team of five clinicians 
and two administrative staff has been at work since May 2, 2001 conducting a behavioral audit 
regarding the psychiatric conditions and the residential treatment of over 100 children (mostly 
ages 13 to 17) at Heartland Christian Academy, as requested by the Academy's general counsel. 
2001: Doe vs. Three Springs Treatment Center, Nashville, TN. 
2004: Does vs. L.K. Baliredy et al (An international child trafficking matter). Five days of 
deposition. 
2004 Doe vs. State of New Mexico and Arthur Brokup. 
MAJOR STATE COURT CASES: 
Some cases of public health significance, concerning allegedly traumatized minors in care of 
governmental or institutional agencies: 
Does vs. OK Boys Ranch and State of Washington: 44 children in care at a state-licensed 
rehabilitation and foster care-related center were allegedly allowed to abuse each other while 
staff and therapists did not report harmful activities of which they knew, Dr. Kliman opined. The 
plaintiff children have to date all received settlements in four phases of this litigation over a nine 
year period, with Dr. Kliman as the principal expert. 
York vs. ChaparralNictor Treatment Facility. Orange County Superior Court. An eleven year 
old child severely and chronically molested by a residential treatment staff member was 
evaluated and an opinion given by Dr. Kliman concerning harm and how to rehabilitate the child 
as much as possible. Implications for standards of residential care are contained within the case. 
Carlson vs. Ray-Lara Foster Home. Orange County Superior Court. Dr. Kliman evaluated and 
testified concerning a twelve year old boy who was allegedly molested by a foster father and had 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34-2   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 17 of 23
to rescue himself. The foster father's partner was negligent, Dr. Kliman opined. The judge 
agreed and awarded the child compensation for psychological damages. 
Does vs. Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Dr. Kliman was the lead psychiatric witness. The case 
settled after six days of his deposition testimony. 
Does vs. Salesian Order Western Region. Dr. Kliman was the lead psychiatric witness. The case 
settled after nine days of his deposition testimony and two days of trial. 
Does v South Dakota School for the Deaf. Multiple boys were molested by an older student. The 
state school administration was allegedly negligent and major psychological damages were 
claimed. Dr. Kliman served as the principal plaintiffs' expert on administrative liability issues 
and psychological damages. The case settled with major compensation for the plaintiffs during 
the time of jury deliberations. 
CHILD PSYCHIATRIC EXPERT TESTIMONY: 
Dr. Kliman helped set legal precedents for the inclusion of psychiatric testimony in matters 
concerning wrongful death of a parent and loss of parental services, in both New York State and 
California. He has testified in over 275 cases including over 100 trials. A Federal Rule 26 list is 
available on request and on www.expertchildpsychiatry.com. His courtroom and deposition 
testimony experience includes cases of institutional negligence of children leading to 
psychological trauma, negligent foster care, loss of parental services due to wrongful deaths, 
psychological trauma as part of personal injury of adults and children, childhood molestation, 
sexual harassment, termination of parental rights, and disputed custody. Since 2000 about 30% 
of his forensic work has been requested by defense, about 70% by plaintiffs, with the defense 
tasks increasing markedly in recent years. 
Dr. Kliman's evaluations and testimony regarding 16 children negligently cared for and abused 
at The Kiwanis' OK Boys' Ranch, Olympia, WA, helped lead to settlements and awards, 
totalling $25,000,000. Responding to disclosures in that case, many improvements have occurred 
in the publicly funded and licensed institutional care of children throughout the State of 
Washington, according to newspaper accounts. 
Dr. Kliman's evaluations and opinions, together with that of The Children's Psychological 
Trauma Center team led by Robert Wynne MFCC, led to record-making $8,000,000 loss of 
parental and other services compensation for 17 bereaved subsistence-economy Alaskan Inupiat 
Native Americans (Smith vs. Ryan Airlines, Anchorage, 1997). 
Principal expert regarding institutional negligence and psychological damages in Does vs. 
Rudolph Kos and the Diocese of Dallas, Dallas 1997. The Catholic Church of Dallas was held 
liable for institutional negligence, testimony concerning the need for major psychiatric treatment 
planning was accepted by the jury, and $119,000,000--including punitive damages against the 
Church--was awarded to the 11 plaintiffs, by unanimous decision.

OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND RECOGNITION: 
In response to the mental health needs of families following recent massive firestorms, United 
Way printed and distributed 10,000 copies of "My Fire Story -- a Guided Activity Workbook for 
Children, Families and Teachers," co-authored with Edward Oklan, M.D. Copies can be obtained 
from Family Development Press, 1010 Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, Kentfield, CA 94960. The 
State of Iowa purchased rights to reproduce 10,000 copies of "My Book about The Attack on 
America - a Guided Activity Workbook for Children, Families and Teachers", published in 2001. 
During 1996 - 2002 Sophie Murvis Foundation, The Windholz Foundation, The Atkinson, 
Cadence Corporation, Irving Harris Foundation and The Stullsaft Foundations have recently 
awarded grants to Dr. Kliman as principal investigator for his Cornerstone Therapeutic Nursery 
project, serving seriously disturbed preschoolers in the San Mateo Office of Education. 
Presentations on The Cornerstone Therapeutic Nursery Project have been made by Dr. Kliman 
during 1997 through 2002 at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute and the Seattle Institute 
for Psychoanalysis. 
Three documentary videotapes concerning Dr. Kliman's psychotherapies of disturbed children 
treated by him using this method in a therapeutic special education class are now available for 
scientific and educational purposes, parental permission having been gained. Such use requires a 
confidentiality agreement. 
Tape I: The Cornerstone Method. 
Tape II: Treatment of an Autistic Boy 
Tape III: Unique Features of The Cornerstone Method 
As a pilot application of his techniques for preschoolers, Dr. Kliman opened a Cornerstone 
Therapeutic Nursery at the Salvation Army Shelter for homeless families in January 1998, 
serving seven homeless families with preschool children. He is supervising the project weekly as 
Medical Director of The Children's Psychological Trauma Center. Unedited videotapes of that 
project are available to scientists and educators with a confidentiality agreement. The Wright 
Institute has provided a psychology intern to conduct the treatment under Dr. Kliman's training 
and supervision. The California School of Professional Psychology has assigned a doctoral thesis 
candidate to Dr. Kliman's supervision to study the I.Q. rise phenomenon previously documented 
in Cornerstone therapies. 
Peer-reviewed publications of Dr. Kliman's work with foster children appear in Zelman, A: 
Interventions with High Risk Children, Jason Aronson 1997 (Chapter by Kliman on Controlled 
Assessment of The Personal Life History Book Method for Foster Children). Results of Dr. 
Kliman's Cornerstone Method are also reported extensively in that book, focusing on the I.Q. rise 
phenomenon.

symptoms. He has impulse dyscontrol, attentional deficits, and expressive language 
difficulties from which he can be seen to be recovering. Two excerpted tapes have been 
created to illustrate features of the child's pathology, and of the response to interpretive 
aspects of treatment. Gilbert Kliman, M.D. is the psychoanalyst, and the treatment is 
conducted three times a week, with parent guidance every two weeks. The videographer

Scientific and Educational Video Archives under Dr. Kliman's supervision: 
With parental permission, The Children's Psychological Health Center, under Dr. Kliman's 
leadership, is collecting unedited treatment documents of a special method of treatment in a real 
life space, called "The Cornerstone therapeutic preschool method." Now totaling over 200 video 
archive hours, eight different California therapists working with various educator teams have 
recorded their Cornerstone therapeutic preschool method work, Beginning in 1995, this archive 
started with Gilbert Kliman, M.D. working for a year as daily in-classroom therapist in a public 
special education school. He was assisted by Leanne Runyan and Gail Hernandez as the teachers 
at the San Mateo Early Childhood Education Center, a preschool special education facility of 
The County of San Mateo. A second team under his supervision included work at The San 
Francisco Unified School District (Vanessa Vigilante and Esther Kronenberg). Third and fourth 
teams were at The Salvation Army Gateway Shelter (Vanessa Vigilante as therapist and Lynda 
Byrd as teacher, Deanna Reardon as therapist and Lynda Byrd as teacher). A fourth was at The 
Cadence Cornerstone Site at Mt. Pleasant School, San Jose (Karita Hummer, therapist and Kathy 
Krall, teacher). Fifth team therapy was provided by Jane Christmas. The sixth team therapists 
was Dr. Miquela Diaz Hope, the seventh Molly Franklin, MFT. All have been extensively 
videotaped carrying out the method. An eighth team was assembled in late 2002, when Linda 
Hirshfeld Ph.D. joined as Fellow in Cornerstone Therapy. In 2001 Mike McDonald, Ed.D. 
became Special Education Director of Cornerstone School. All the treatments are have been 
under principal supervision of Dr. Kliman with additional supervision by Mali Mann, M.D., 
Myrna Frankel, Ed.D., and Jan Baeuerlen, M.D. 
Linda Hirshfeld, Ph.D. of the Ann Martin 
Center is conducting the archival work for her Cornerstone Services. 
A professional researcher/ training confidentiality agreement is required to study this archive.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES 2-7’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO 
COMPEL AND/OR IDENTIFY PLAINTIFFS IN THE STYLE OF THIS CASE AND 
MOTION TO IDENTIFY JANE DOE IN THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENAS FOR 
PURPOSES OF DISCOVERY, OR ALTERNATIVELY, MOTION TO DISMISS  
“SUA SPONTE”, WITH INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiffs, JANE DOES 2-7, hereby serve their Response to Defendant’s Motion to 
Compel and/or Identify Plaintiffs in the Style of this Case and Motion to Identify Jane Doe in 
Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of Discovery, or Alternatively, Motion to Dismiss “Sua 
Sponte”, With Incorporated Memorandum of Law, and state as follows:   
1. 
The lawsuits filed by JANE DOES 2-7 involve private, intimate facts pertaining 
to their own childhood sexual abuse and exploitation by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 3 of 15

2. 
Jane Does 2-7 filed their suits under a pseudonym1 to prevent public disclosure of 
the private, highly sensitive and intimate facts pertaining to their sexual assaults, and the public 
association of their identities with Defendant Epstein and these assaults. 
3. 
Dr. Gilbert Kliman,2 a well-known forensic psychiatrist with an expertise in the 
field of child trauma, has met with and evaluated each of Jane Does 2-7 and opined that public 
disclosure of their real names would create a substantial risk to them of further psychological 
harm. See Exhibit “A”, Declaration of Gilbert Kliman, M.D.  
4. 
Dr. Kliman opines as follows: 
Releasing names of the plaintiffs to the public will reenact experiences of 
powerlessness and helplessness in the face of a boundary violation. Repetition and 
reenactment represent central features of Criterion B in the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis 
of posttraumatic stress disorder trauma. In effect, release of their identity and 
public intrusion into their personal life represents a reenactment of the shame of 
sexual traumatization. Repetition and reenactment are central pathologies that 
afflict sexual trauma survivors. 
Victims of sexual abuse often rely upon some form of dissociation, splitting or 
denial, as a defensive means to manage overwhelming affects associated with the 
sexual trauma. Each of the plaintiff girls has employed some variation of this 
defense, both during the massages and then subsequently following disclosure of 
the abuse. Primitive, maladaptive responses of this nature will become 
additionally reinforced as a result of public disclosure.  
Another aspect of the plaintiffs’ experience, which is recognized by DSM-IV-TR, 
is that the trauma was associated with human design factors (such as cruel 
intention to do harm, rape, torture). Trauma of this origin has a tendency to 
produce more “severe or long lasting” posttraumatic stress disorder than natural 
events (DSM IV TR p. 464). A policy of deliberate revelation of the names of the 
victims would reinforce the sense of design, pattern and policy of human 
intentions.  
It is my opinion, with a reasonably high degree of medical certainty that the 
defense motion to allow public disclosure of the plaintiffs’ identity is clinically 
Defendant and his counsel are aware of the real names of Jane Does 2-7. 
A copy of the curriculum vitae of Dr. Gilbert Kliman is attached hereto as Exhibit “B”. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 4 of 15

and ethically a wrongful plan. The act of revealing their identity against their 
wishes places the plaintiffs at risk, in the best of circumstances, of suffering an 
aggravation of existing diagnostic concerns. It is more probable than not that 
releasing personal identities will foster an exacerbation and magnification of 
symptoms lending to increased risk of revictimization and retraumatization.  
See Exhibit “A”, ¶¶ 13-15, 21 
5. 
Given the private nature of the allegations in this lawsuit and the serious risk of 
harm to the mental health of Jane Does 2-7 if a public disclosure of their identities were required, 
Jane Does 2-7 should be permitted to continue using a pseudonym in this lawsuit.   
6. 
Notably, in one of the  cases consolidated for purposes of discovery, Jane Doe v. 
Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 08-80893, this Court recognized the harm likely to result from public 
disclosure of the victims’ identities in these cases, and allowed the Plaintiff in that case to 
“proceed in this action under the pseudonym ‘Jane Doe’ ”, by Order dated October 6, 2008.   
7. 
Jeffrey Epstein sets forth no facts to support his bare contention that Jane Does 2-
use of a pseudonym in these proceedings interferes with his “constitutional due process right.” 
See Motion to Compel, p. 3.  Defendant and his counsel know the identities of these Plaintiffs.  
8. 
Defendant also requests the Court’s permission to use the real names of Jane Does 
2-7 in various third-party subpoenas for discovery purposes.  Defendant does not identify any of 
the entities or persons to whom he intends to send subpoenas.  An order granting the relief 
requested without limitations would essentially nullify Jane Does 2-7’s right to proceed 
anonymously.  Jane Does 2-7 therefore object to the issuance of third-party subpoenas, and 
submit that Defendant can obtain the discovery he seeks by alternative means that will preserve 
the confidentiality of the Jane Does 2-7’s identities.   
9. 
If this Court were to permit third party subpoenas or records custodian  
depositions using the existing captions and identifying Jane Does 2-7 in the body of the 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 5 of 15

subpoena by their names, due to publicity surrounding the Defendant’s crimes, then Jane Does 2-
would effectively be revealed as abuse victims in these cases against Defendant Epstein.  Any 
subpoenas or notices to third parties therefore should not disclose the type of action or the 
Defendant’s identity.  There are alternatives which would preserve Jane Does 2-7’s anonymity 
and be more efficient and cost-effective at the same time.  For instance, Defendant can obtain 
records from various non-party sources through Plaintiffs’ counsel, who can certify that they 
have obtained the records through authorizations signed by Jane Does 2-7.  Another means to 
obtain non-party records concerning Plaintiffs is the appointment of a special master, who would 
verify authenticity and completeness of the records.    
10. 
Finally, Jeffrey Epstein’s request that this Court order a “sua sponte” dismissal is 
illogical.  Sua sponte means “[w]ithout prompting or suggestion; on its own motion.” Black's 
Law Dictionary 1437 (7th ed.1999). Thus, the definition of sua sponte does not fit these 
circumstances, because the Court is being prompted by Epstein’s Motion. Velchez v. Carnival 
Corp., 331 F.3d 1207 (11th Cir. 2003).  In any event, there is no basis or authority to support a 
dismissal of these cases.  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 respectfully request that (i) this Court deny 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel and/or Identify Plaintiffs in the Style of this Case and Motion to 
Identify Jane Doe in Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of Discovery, or Alternatively, Motion 
to Dismiss “Sua Sponte”, in its entirety; (ii) Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 be permitted to continue 
using their pseudonyms in this litigation; (iii) this Court order that records from non-parties 
relating to Jane Does 2-7, including medical and employment records, only be obtained through 
Plaintiffs’ counsel by means of signed authorizations that do not include the caption or identify 
Epstein as the party seeking records, or alternatively, appoint a special master to obtain the 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 6 of 15
-

records, who would verify authenticity and completeness of the records; and (iv) all other relief 
this Court deems just and appropriate. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
I. 
PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES 2-7 SHOULD BE PERMITTED  
TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY IN THIS CASE DUE TO THE  
SENSITIVE, PRIVATE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING FACTS  
AND THE RISK OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM TO THE PLAINTIFFS 
Federal courts permit a party to proceed under a pseudonym when special circumstances 
warrant anonymity. See, e.g., Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 685-87 
(11th Cir.2001); Does I thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1068-69 (9th 
Cir.2000); James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233, 238-39 (4th Cir.1993); EW v. New York Blood Center, 
213 F.R.D. 108, 110-12 (E.D.N.Y.2003); Javier v. Garcia-Botello, 211 F.R.D. 194, 196 
(W.D.N.Y.2002); Doe v. Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d 40, 43-44 (E.D.N.Y.1999); Doe v. United Servs. 
Life Ins. Co., 123 F.R.D. 437, 439 (S.D.N.Y.1988). Sexual assault victims are a paradigmatic 
example of those entitled to a grant of anonymity. See Doe No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193 (E.D. 
N.Y. 2006); Doe v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wisc., 112 F.3d 869, 872 (7th Cir.1997) 
(“fictitious names are allowed when necessary to protect the privacy of ... rape victims, and other 
particularly vulnerable parties or witnesses”); see also Doe v. City of Chicago, 360 F.3d 667, 669 
(7th Cir. 2004). 
The decision whether to allow a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is within the court's 
discretion. See Aware Woman Ctr., 253 F.3d at 684; Javier, 211 F.R.D. at 195; EW, 213 F.R.D. 
at 110.  As set forth above, this Court exercised its direction in one of the consolidated cases, 
Jane Doe v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 08-80893, to allow a plaintiff to proceed under the 
pseudonym “Jane Doe” in an Order dated October 6, 2008.   
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 7 of 15

Courts will permit a party to proceed under a pseudonym where “the party's need for 
anonymity outweighs prejudice to the opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the 
party's identity.” Does I Thru XXIII, 214 F.3d at 1068; see Javier, 211 F.R.D. at 195; EW, 213 
F.R.D. at 111;  As set forth herein, the balancing test in this case weighs in favor of permitted 
plaintiff to continue to proceed anonymously:   
In undertaking this balance, courts have considered such facts as 
(1) whether the plaintiff is suing the government or a private 
person; (2) whether the plaintiff would be compelled to disclose 
intimate information; (3) whether plaintiff would be compelled to 
his or her intention in engage in illegal conduct, thereby risking 
criminal prosecution; (4) whether the plaintiff would risk injury if 
identified; (5) whether the party defending against a suit brought 
under a pseudonym would thereby be prejudiced; (6) the ages of 
the parties whose identity is to be suppressed; (7) the extent to 
which the identity of the litigant has been kept confidential; (8) 
whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues presented 
or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing 
the litigants’ identities; and (9) the public interest in guaranteeing 
open access to proceedings without denying litigants access to the 
justice system.  
Doe v. Del Rio, 241 F.R.D. 154, 157 (S.D. N.Y. 2006) 
The public has a strong interest in protecting the identities of sexual assault victims so 
that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes. See Doe v. Evans, 202 F.R.D. 
173, 176 (E.D.Pa.2001) (granting anonymity to sexual assault victim); Doe No. 2 v. Kolko, 242 
F.R.D. 193 (E.D. N.Y. 2006).  That is particularly true in these consolidated cases where there 
are numerous victims with similar claims. Although these cases have gained considerable media 
attention, there appears to be little public interest in knowing the specific identity of each of the 
victims. 
With regard to the second factor, courts have granted anonymity to protect against 
disclosure of a wide range of issues involving matters of the utmost intimacy, including sexual 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 8 of 15

assault. See, e.g., Aware Woman Ctr., 253 F.3d at 685 (abortion); EW, 213 F.R.D. at 111 
(infection with hepatitis B); Doe v. Evans, 202 F.R.D. 173, 176 (E.D.Pa.2001) (sexual assault 
victim); Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d at 42 (sexual assault victim); WGA v. Priority Pharmacy, Inc., 184 
F.R.D. 616, 617 (E.D.Mo.1999) (status as AIDS patient); Doe v. United Servs. Life Ins. Co., 123 
F.R.D. 437, 439 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (sexual orientation); see also Blue Cross, 112 F.3d at 872 
(recognizing rape victims as entitled to anonymity). It cannot be reasonably denied that a 
person’s sexual history – especially during their childhood – is an intimate fact.  When the 
childhood sexual history includes criminal sexual contact by an adult, the facts are even more 
intimate and personal.  In the electronic age in which we live, these concerns are heightened.  As 
federal courts have recognized in this context, it is now possible to “determine whether a given 
individual is a party to a lawsuit in federal court anywhere in the country by the simplest of 
computer searches, to access the docket sheet of any such case electronically, and ... that entire 
case files will be accessible over the Internet.” Doe v. City of New York, 201 F.R.D. 100, 102 
(S.D.N.Y.2001) (denying anonymity where any injury was purely reputational and case did not 
involve private or intimate matter); see EW, 213 F.R.D. at 112-13.
As Dr. Kliman explains in his Declaration, disclosure of Jane Does 2-7’s identities will 
place these Plaintiffs “at-risk of having their personal lives scrutinized by friends, extended 
family, spouses, children, fellow students, employers and fellow employees, the media and 
general public. This type of exposure humiliates many victims and represents another betrayal of 
trust. Public exposure places the plaintiff’s at further risk of stigmatization, shame and 
retraumatization.” See Exhibit “A” at ¶ 3.  Dr. Kliman also finds it of no consequence that some 
of the plaintiffs are now legally adults in that “[d]ue to traumatization the plaintiffs are arrested 
in their development, and even those who are now legally adult are arrested in part to adolescent 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 9 of 15
--

aspects of psychology.” Id. at ¶ 4 
The policy of protecting victims of sexual misconduct from undue embarrassment and 
disclosure of their private affairs is firmly established in Fed.R.Evid. 412.  The protections of 
Rule 412 are designed to “encourage victims of sexual misconduct to institute and participate in 
legal proceedings against alleged offenders.” (Committee Notes to 1994 Amendment).  
Likewise, many states in this country, including Florida and New York, have similarly enacted 
laws to protect the anonymity of sexual assault victims. See Fla. Stat. §§794.024, 794.026 
(2008); N.Y. Civil Rights Law § 50-b (McKinney 2009). In 1994, the Florida Legislature passed 
The Crime Victims Protections Act.  The legislative stated purpose for the Act was “to protect 
the identity of victims of sexual crimes.”  Fla. AGO, 2003-56, 2003 WL 22971082 (Dec. 15, 
2003).  Under §794.024, Florida Statutes, court records that identify the name and/or address of a 
victim of a sexual crime are presumed to be confidential and exempt from public access. Id.  
Similarly, upon approving New York's rape shield law, then Governor Mario Cuomo stated, 
“sexual assault victims have unfortunately had to endure a terrible invasion of their physical 
privacy. They have a right to expect that this violation will not be compounded by a further 
invasion of their privacy.” 1991 McKinney's Sessions Laws of N.Y., at 2211-2212 (quoted in 
Deborah S. v. Diorio, 153 Misc.2d 708, 583 N.Y.S.2d 872 (N.Y.City Civ.Ct.1992)); see also 
Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 597, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977) (“Short of homicide, 
[rape] is the ultimate violation of self”). 
As to the fourth factor of risk injury, Dr. Kliman has evaluated Jane Does 2-7,  and has 
concluded that the childhood sexual abuse at issue has caused features of post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD), including shame, guilt, helplessness, and powerlessness.  See Exhibit “A” at ¶¶ 
4-7.  Dr. Kliman further states, “it is more probable than not that releasing personal identities 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 10 of 15

will foster an exacerbation and magnification of symptoms lending to increased risk of 
revictimization and retraumatization.”  Id. at ¶ 21.  Thus, this is not a case analogous to those 
cited by defendant in which the plaintiffs were merely at risk of “personal embarrassment.”  
Instead, there is a genuine and immediate risk of psychological harm. 
None of the cases cited by Defendant where courts denied a plaintiff’s request for 
anonymity involved victims of childhood sexual assault or evidence of emotional or 
psychological harm that would result from disclosure of the plaintiff's identity. See Doe v. Hartz, 
F.Supp.2d 1027 (N.D.Iowa 1999); Doe v. Shakur, 164 F.R.D. 359 (E.D.N.Y.1996); Doe v. 
Bell Atlantic Bus. Sys. Servs., 162 F.R.D. 418 (D.Mass.1995); Doe v. Univ. of Rhode Island, 28 
Fed.R.Serv.3d 366, 1993 WL 667341 (D.R.I. Dec. 28, 1993). 
As to the factor of prejudice, the Defendant does not identify how his ability to conduct 
discovery or impeach Jane Does 2-7’s credibility has been or will be impaired if these Plaintiffs 
are permitted to proceed under a pseudonym. See EW, 213 F.R.D. at 112, Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d 
at 44-45. Other than the need to make redactions and take measures not to disclose these 
Plaintiffs' identities, Defendant will not be hampered or inconvenienced merely by Plaintiffs' 
anonymity in court papers.  As set forth above, Defendant already knows their true identities. See 
Aware Woman Center, 253 F.3d at 687 (no prejudice where plaintiff offered to disclose her name 
to defendant); EW, 213 F.R.D. at 112; Smith, 105 F.Supp.2d at 44-45.   
II. 
DEFENDANT SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO USE 
THE REAL NAMES OF JANE DOES 2-7 IN THIRD-PARTY 
SUBPEONAS EXCEPT FOR THOSE ISSUED TO PERSONS WHOM 
PLAINTIFFS HAVE ALREADY DISCLOSED THEIR SEXUAL ABUSE 
As for the use of Jane Does 2-7’s real names in subpoenas issued to non-parties, a party 
may obtain discovery of any non-privileged matter that is relevant to a claim or defense of any 
party. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1).  However, a district court may limit discovery “for good cause 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 11 of 15

shown” by making “any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense,” including that the 
discovery not be had or that it be had only by a method other than that selected by the party 
seeking discovery. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c).  Jane Does 2-7 have articulated a specific and substantial 
harm from disclosure of their identities.   
If this Court were to permit Defendant to issue third-party subpoenas containing Jane 
Doe 2-7’s real names, the identity of the Defendant, and/or facts pertaining to the nature of the 
case to whomever Defendant wants, it would be akin to requiring these Plaintiffs to use their real 
name in the pleadings.  Instead, Jane Does 2-7 propose to voluntarily execute authorizations 
(which would not contain the case names or the identity of the Defendant) to allow Defendant to 
obtain education, employment, and medical records to be used for purposes of this litigation 
only.3  Alternatively, Defendant can obtain the records through a special master, who would 
verify authenticity and completeness of the records.   Either of these approaches would not only 
place Jane Does 2-7 at less risk of psychological harm, but would also be more cost-effective and 
efficient. 
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 respectfully request that Defendant’s 
Motion to Compel and/or Identify Plaintiffs in the Style of this Case and Motion to Identify Jane 
Doe in Third-Party Subpoenas for Purposes of Discovery, or Alternatively, Motion to Dismiss 
“Sua Sponte” be denied in its entirety, and that Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 be permitted to continue 
using their pseudonyms in this litigation.  Additionally, to avoid public disclosure of the 
Plaintiff’s identities in non-party records discovery, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 request that such 
Defendant and Plaintiff have previously agreed that education records can be obtained in this 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 34   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 12 of 15

discovery be obtained either through Plaintiffs’ counsel by means of written authorizations, or by 
the appointment of a special master.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES’  2- 7 NOTICE OF JOINDER IN PLAINTIFFS’  
JANE DOES 101 AND 102’S MOTION FOR NO-CONTACT ORDER  
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 join in Plaintiffs Jane Does 101 and 102’s Motion for No-
Contact Order, filed May 22, 2009, and state as follows:   
1. 
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 incorporate and adopt the facts set forth in the pending 
Motion for No-Contact Order.  Additionally, Plaintiffs offer additional facts in support of the 
Motion for a No-Contact Order, as set forth below.   
2. 
Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 were all identified on the 
victims list provided to Defendant Epstein’s counsel in connection with the Non-prosecution 
Agreement, and each has been identified as victims to Defendant Epstein in their pending 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 35   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 3 of 7

actions.  In June 2008, Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Pucillo ordered Defendant Epstein “not 
to have any contact, direct or indirect,” with any of his victims.  Judge Pucillo clarified that 
forbidden “indirect” contact included, but was not limited to, text messages, emails, telephone 
calls, or messages through third parties.  As detailed herein, Jane Does 4 and 7 have been 
contacted on multiple occasions by at least one person representing that she is cooperating with 
and communicating on behalf of Defendant Epstein.  In these contacts, the Plaintiffs/victims 
were threatened and harassed. 
3. 
As with other Plaintiffs, Jane Does 4 and 7 were first introduced to Defendant 
Epstein by Hayley Robson, who was a high school friend.1 
4. 
Robson had had contact with these Plaintiffs on several occasions in which she 
represented to Plaintiffs Jane Doe 4 and 7 that she is cooperating with Defendant Epstein’s 
attorneys and that she is being financially supported by Defendant Epstein.  Moreover, Robson 
has told these Plaintiffs specifically that she is communicating on behalf of Defendant Epstein.   
5. 
During these contacts, Robson made disparaging comments to the Plaintiffs and 
also sent disturbing text messages to Jane Doe No. 4.  In one text, Robson specifically stated, “I 
just met with my lawyer today and I’m finally done with the Epstein case. LOL. I knew you were 
suing Jeffrey all along and I’ve learned so much about you in the meantime. LOL.” Jane Doe 4 
understood this to mean that Robson had exchanged private information about Jane Doe 4 with 
Defendant Epstein and his attorneys.  Since February, 2009, Jane Doe 4 has continued to receive 
text messages from Robson that are sometimes harassing and other times seek information about 
Jane Doe 4’s private life, her lawsuit against Defendant Epstein, and/or her lawyer’s strategy.  
Ms. Robson was  named in at least one civil case against Mr. Epstein as a co-defendant.  See 
Jane Doe v. Epstein, case no. 50-2008-CA-0065996, Palm Beach County Circuit Court. Ms. 
Robson brought multiple underage girls to Epstein in addition to Jane Does 4 and 7.  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 35   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009   Page 4 of 7

6. 
On one occasion, Robson approached Jane Doe 7 and disclosed that she was 
cooperating with Defendant Epstein’s defense, and that she (Robson) agreed that she would 
testify against Jane Doe 7 and the other plaintiffs to make sure that none of the Plaintiffs ever 
received any money from Defendant Epstein, making clear that her testimony would not be 
truthful to achieve this end.  She also made disparaging comments to Jane Doe 7, accusing her of 
ruining Defendant Epstein’s reputation.  
7. 
The very possibility of any contact with Epstein or his agents, including Robson, 
causes anxiety and distress particularly to Jane Doe 4 and 7, as well as the other Plaintiffs.  A no-
contact order should prevent further harassment of the Plaintiffs by Epstein and his agents, 
including, but not limited to, Hayley Robson.   
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7, respectfully join Plaintiffs Jane Does 101 and 
102 in moving this Court to enter an order granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a No Contact Order 
prohibiting the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, from any contact or communication with Plaintiffs, 
either directly or indirectly, except through Plaintiffs’ attorneys of record for the duration of the 
Order.

1As discussed at the hearing this morning before the Court, Plaintiff in this case
is withdrawing the contention raised in the original memorandum, that Defendant
EPSTEIN may not contest this Court’s jurisdiction based on the Non Prosecution
Agreement (“NPA”). Although the State Court action is not a part of this Complaint, and
is not alleged in the four (4) corners of it, it is a fact that cannot be contested since
Plaintiff has filed a State Court action.

PLAINTIFF’S AMENDED1 MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION 
TO DEFENDANT EPSTEIN’S  MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff, JANE DOE II, through counsel, opposes Defendant’s RICHARD EPSTEIN’s
Motion to Dismiss. Defendant’s argument for a dismissal is premised on the following: 1)
Plaintiff is not permitted to file a claim under Florida law in a State of Florida court and then
file a federal claim in a federal court; 2) the remedies amendment to 18 U.S.C.§2255 are
not retroactive based on the dates Defendant EPSTEIN is alleged to have violated the
statute; 3)
damages under §2255 cannot be obtained on a per incident basis, but must
be lumped together into a single recovery despite multiple violations occurring in temporally
distinct time frames, and therefore being different incidents; 4) Plaintiff has failed to state a
cause of action under §2255 because she has failed to “allege facts constituting a predicate
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 1 of 19

2On a Motion to Dismiss, the Court is of course confined to the four corners of
the Complaint, and it is completely improper for the Defendant to attach as Exhibits
copies of a Complaint from a different proceeding, a fact that is not alleged anywhere in
the Complaint at issue before this Court. Nevertheless because the Defendant’s
argument on this issue is meritless, Plaintiff addresses it on the merits. 
act”; and 5) Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for conspiracy to violate §2255.
I.
LEGAL STANDARD  
Defendant’s motion to dismiss must be denied unless it appears beyond doubt that
the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of her claims that would entitle her to relief.
Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).  The Court must accept all of plaintiff’s factual
allegations as true.  Schuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 (1974).  Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a complaint need only be “a short and plain statement
of the claim,” and as long as the pleadings “give defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff’s
claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,” notice pleading has been satisfied.  Conley v.
Gibson, 355 U.S. at 47. For a claim to state a cause of action however, facts, not labels and
conclusions must be asserted. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)      
II.
ARGUMENT
Point 1.
Plaintiff has every right to proceed in State court for a Florida
common law claim, and in this Court for a federal claim.
Defendant EPSTEIN’s argument on this point is frivolous. Plaintiff’s claims in State
court are based on the common law of Florida, while the federal claims are based on a
federal statutory remedy.2 There are different facts that prove each claim and different
elements to the claims. Defendant seems to be arguing that the Plaintiff forfeits a right to a
federal remedy when she invokes a parallel, but independent and wholly distinct right to a
State remedy. That is simply not supported by any case or reasonable interpretation of any
case. The lynchpin of Defendant’s argument is that concurrent jurisdiction is available to hear
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 2 of 19

In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966), a jury’s verdict
against a union based on State law claims was reversed, in part, because    the federal
law claim failed. The Court noted that: “It has consistently been recognized that
pendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff's right. Its justification lies
in considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants; if these are
not present a federal court should hesitate to exercise jurisdiction over state claims,
even though bound to apply state law to them, Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.
64.Needless decisions of state law [by a federal court] should be avoided both as a
matter of comity and to promote justice between the parties, by procuring for them a
surer-footed reading of applicable law.”  
all claims in one forum; that is simply not the case, since the state claims are vastly different
than the federal statutory remedy. If the State claims had been filed in this Court, this Court
would not be obligated to exercise concurrent jurisdiction. It is well established that the
exercise of supplemental jurisdiction is discretionary with the court, and is properly rejected
under many circumstances.3 
U.S.C. §1367, “supplemental jurisdiction,” provides that: 
©) The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
a claim under subsection (a) if--
   (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,
    (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which
the district court has original jurisdiction,
  (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original
jurisdiction, or
  (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for
declining jurisdiction.
Courts routinely “are obligated to raise and decide issues of subject matter jurisdiction
sua sponte any time it appears subject matter jurisdiction is absent.” Carias v. Lenox
Financial Mortgage Corporation, 2008 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 20345 *1  (N.D. Cal. March 5,
2008). In Carias, after granting summary judgment on the sole federal claim, the Court
remanded the State claims to state court, stating: “The Court declines to exercise pendent
jurisdiction over the state law claims and remands the action to state court. The Court finds
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 3 of 19

that the issues of economy, convenience, fairness and comity collectively weigh in favor of
remand. See Harrell, 934 F.2d at 205. Comity weighs especially strong, given that  the
remaining claims are pure state law claims with no connection to federal law. Economy
also weighs in favor of remand as state courts are better equipped to efficiently handle state
law claims.” Id. at *5-6 (emphasis added). In Daimler Chrysler Corporation v. Charlotte Cuno,
547 U.S. 332, 351-52 (2006) the Supreme Court stated:
Gibbs held that federal-question jurisdiction over a claim may authorize a
federal court to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims that may be viewed
as part of the same case because they "derive from a common nucleus of
operative fact" as the federal claim.  383 U.S., at 725, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L.
Ed. 2d 218. Plaintiffs assume that Gibbs stands for the proposition that
federal jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently related to a claim within
Article III to be part of the same case, regardless of the nature of the
deficiency that would keep the former claims out of federal court if presented
on their own.
Our general approach to the application of Gibbs, however, has been
markedly more cautious. For example, as a matter of statutory construction
of the pertinent jurisdictional provisions, we refused to extend  Gibbs to allow
claims to be asserted against nondiverse parties when jurisdiction was based
on diversity, see Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 98
S. Ct. 2396, 57 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1978), and we refused to extend Gibbs to
authorize supplemental jurisdiction over claims that do not satisfy statutory
amount-in-controversy requirements, see Finley v. United States, 490 U.S.
545, 109 S. Ct. 2003, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1989). As the Court explained just
last Term, "we have not . . . applied Gibbs' expansive interpretive approach
to other aspects of the jurisdictional statutes." Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah
Servs., 545 U.S. 546, 553, 125 S. Ct. 2611, 162 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2005)
(applying 28 U.S.C. § 1367, enacted in 1990, to allow a federal court in a
diversity action to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional diverse
plaintiffs whose claims failed to meet the amount-in-controversy threshold).
What we have never done is apply the rationale of Gibbs to permit a
federal court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction  over a claim that
does not itself satisfy those elements of the Article III inquiry, such as
constitutional standing, that "serve to identify those disputes which are
appropriately resolved through the judicial process." Whitmore, 495 U.S., at
155, 158, 110 S. Ct. 1717, 109 L. Ed. 2d 135. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 4 of 19

4The federal claims that are the subject matter of this action are not necessarily
parallel to the State law claims, although the incidents that gave rise to both the federal
and state claims arise from the same series of events. A Florida appellate court, for
example, has refused to apply principles of res judicata to bar State discrimination
claims after the plaintiff lost federal discrimination claims. Andujar v. National Property
& Casualty Underwriters, 659 So. 2d 1214 (Fla. 4th DCA 1995) (adverse judgment
against plaintiff in federal court for federal discrimination claims did not bar subsequent
action under state discrimination laws). Here, although some of the elements for some
of the claims may be similar, they are sufficiently different that application of Andujar
would preclude res judicata. To determine whether a case is parallel, courts have
looked to whether the same issues are being litigated. Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. American
Mut. Reins. Co., 600 F.2d 1228, 1229, n. 1 (7th Cir. 1979); the issues in the State court
and in this Court are not the same.    
(Emphasis added)
Defendant’s argument that the Court should abstain from deciding the purely
federal issues in this case because there is an independent action under State law is absurd.
For this argument the Defendant relies on the Colorado River abstention doctrine, clearly
inapplicable to this case. Only in “exceptional” circumstances, to promote conservation of
judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation, would a federal court be
authorized to dismiss federal parallel4 claims because of the pendency of state law claims
that are initiated in state court. Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States,
424 U.S. 800 (1976). However, for the Colorado River doctrine to even apply, there must be
clear Congressional direction that would preclude a federal court’s “virtually unflagging
obligation ...to exercise federal jurisdiction.” Id. at 817. In that case, the Supreme Court
found that clear Congressional direction from the McCarran Amendment, which the Court
read to counsel against “piecemeal litigation” concerning issues of water rights in a river
system, favored abstention Id. at 819. Even with this clear Congressional direction, if other
factors had not favored abstention, it may not have been ordered. Id. at 820.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 5 of 19

5The Supreme Court said that Congressional direction is the “[m]ost important
factor.” Id. at 819. 
6Colorado River has been applied where the plaintiff is pursuing federal civil
rights  claims in state and federal courts, at the same time, which is not the case here.
See for example: Atchinson v. Nelson, 460 F. Supp. 1102 (D. Wyo. 1978).
Defendant EPSTEIN does not offer any evidence of any Congressional direction that
would direct this Court to abstain from hearing claims under 18 U.S.C. §2255.5 Further, the
Colorado River doctrine only applies when federal courts are presented with “difficult
questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose
importance transcends the result in the case at bar.” Id. at 814 (emphasis added).6 Plaintiff
in this case is not asking this Court to adjudicate any claims under State law, nor do the
claims present “policy problems of substantial public import.” This case involves claims
against an individual brought by another individual. 
Just how narrow the circumstances under which abstention is appropriate under the
Colorado River doctrine, was demonstrated in the subsequent decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co., 437 U.S. 655 (1979). In Will, the
Supreme Court further narrowed the contours of when a federal court may abstain when
there is a parallel state action. In that case, a bare majority of one held upheld the District
Court’s decision to abstain, however, Justice Blackmun, in casting the deciding vote, did so
because he was of the opinion that the remedy sought (mandamus) was premature, since
the Appellate Court which had reversed the District Court,  should have simply directed it to
reconsider the issue in light of the very limited circumstances under which abstention is
appropriate under the Colorado River doctrine. Id. at 668.  
While the Will case recognizes that Colorado River abstention is a matter generally
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 6 of 19

left to the sound discretion of the District Court, the Eleventh Circuit has abolished its
application for claims predicated on 42 U.S.C.§1983. Alacare, Inc. v.Bagiano, 785 F. 2d 963
(11th Cir. 1986);See also: Tovar v. Billmeyer, 609 F. 2d 1291 (9th Cir. 1979) (rejecting
application of abstention in Section 1983 cases). Defendant cites no cases where the
Colorado River doctrine has been applied to a federal claim under §2255. The cases cited
by Defendant EPSTEIN do not support a decision by this  Court to abstain over what is a
purely federal claim. In American Bankers Ins. Co. v. First State Ins. Co., 891 F.2d 882 (11th
Cir. 1990), the District Court dismissed a purely state law claim for equitable subrogation
because there had been an earlier claim for declaratory relief in State Court; the Eleventh
Circuit reversed, concluding 
...that no exceptional circumstances require dismissal of this case in
deference to the pending state court proceeding. If it were simply a question
of judicial economy, this litigation probably should proceed in the New York
court. A federal court cannot properly decline to exercise its statutory
jurisdiction, however, simply because judicial economy might be served by
deferring to a state court. Federal courts have a ‘virtually unflagging
obligation’ to exercise the jurisdiction given them.’  Colorado River, 424 U.S.
at 816, 96 S. Ct. at 1246. The interest in preserving federal jurisdiction
mandates that this action not be dismissed.
891 F.2d at 886.
Point 2.
The retroactivity of the amendments to §2255 is not appropriately
addressed in a motion to dismiss; but if the Court is so inclined to
consider it, there are insufficient facts pled in the Complaint to
render the 2006 amendments inapplicable to the case at bar.
The only issue properly before the Court is whether the Complaint states a cause of
action. ¶14 of the Complaint claims that the Plaintiff is entitled to the sum of $150,000 for
each event wherein Defendant EPSTEIN solicited the Plaintiff for prostitution. Each event
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 7 of 19

7Plaintiff alleges that Defendant EPSTEIN, or others working on his behalf,
solicited the Plaintiff for prostitution, while she was a minor, on “6/16/03, 7/2/03, 4/9/04,
6/7/04, 7/30/04, 8/30/04, 10/9/04, 10/12/04, 10/30/04 and 11/9/04. In addition, Plaintiff
believes that there were as many as 10 to 20 other occasions during this time frame
that Defendant EPSTEIN solicited her and procured her to perform prostitution
services, all during the time that she was a minor.”  
is set forth in the Complaint in ¶13.7 There are two related issues before the Court: 1) the
amount of minimum damages recoverable, $50,000, or $150,000; and, 2) whether the
Plaintiff can recover the minimum amount of damages for each temporally distinct event, or
whether she is restricted to a single recovery of the minimum damages recoverable under
the statute. 
For the first issue, it is Plaintiff’s position that the matter cannot be decided on a
motion to dismiss, because what Defendant EPSTEIN is asking the Court to do is to declare,
prematurely, that when the Court instructs the jury, it instruct them that the minimum
recovery for the Plaintiff, if she proves the allegations, is either $50,000 (for the entire set of
events, Defendant EPSTEIN’s position) or $150,000 for each event (Plaintiff’s position); this
issue cannot be settled on a motion to dismiss, but is better reserved for the charging
conference at trial. On the second issue, as will be addressed later, under the plain language
of the statute, since Defendant EPSTEIN can be criminally prosecuted for each temporally
distinct event where he solicited this minor for prostitution, he can be subjected to the civil
remedy for damages for each such event, under either version of the statute. This second
issue would be better addressed on a summary judgment motion, and again, has nothing
to do with whether Plaintiff has pled a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ.
P.         
Plaintiff agrees with the general proposition that a new law that creates new

8Defendant EPSTEIN also cites to United States v. Siegel, 153 F.3d 1256 (11th 
Cir. 1998), wherein, based on a defendant’s inability to pay restitution mandated by a
penal statute, the Court reversed a restitution order. An amendment to the statute
removed from consideration the defendant’s ability to pay restitution; the Court said
such an amendment could not be applied retroactively because the provision amounted
to a punishment under a penal statute, and would violate the ex post facto provision in
the U. S. Constitution, This case is clearly distinguished from our case: the statute here
is a civil, not a penal remedy; the amendment to the statute modifies the minimal
exposure of the Defendant if the Plaintiff otherwise proves her claim, but does not, as in
the Siegel case, dispense with a substantive defense to restitution, as occurred in
Siegel. See: United States v. Whiting, 165 F.3d 631 (8th Cir. 1999), where a conviction
for possession of child pornography was upheld, despite the fact that the conduct of the
defendant was arguably not specifically proscribed by statute at the time the images
were possessed; the Court held the legislative amendment was a mere clarification of
the prior legislation and not an ex post facto law.   
Justice Scalia cited the statement of purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, to
hold that, for example, the amendments specifically designed to overrule Patterson v.
McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132, 109 S. Ct. 2363, should be
applied prospectively only, based on a statutorily expressed Congressional intent to do
so:   “The statute that was actually enacted in 1991 contains no comparable language.
Instead of a reference to ‘restoring’ pre-existing rights, its statement of purposes
describes the Act's function as ‘expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in
order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.’ 1991 Act, § 3(4), 105
Stat. 1071 (emphasis added).”
substantive rights, absent Congressional direction to the contrary, does not have retroactive
effect, but this is not a new law. §2255 was amended in 2006, to, inter alia, provide an
enhanced minimum recovery for damages caused by sexual predators such as Defendant
EPSTEIN. However, the change in the civil remedies available is a procedural, not a
substantive change in the law, and procedural changes to a statute are routinely applied
retroactively.8 Where substantive changes in a law are made by Congress, a slim majority
of the Supreme Court has declined retroactive application, even where the law was
ostensibly enacted to overrule a Court precedent that had itself, in the view of Congress,
overruled earlier Court precedents. Rivers v. Roadway Express, 511 U.S. 298, 308 (1994).9
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 9 of 19

Similarly, in the companion case of  Landgraf v. Usi Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 275, n. 28
 (1994), the Court declined to retroactively apply substantive changes to Title VII cases, but
noted that  
While we have strictly construed the Ex Post Facto Clause to prohibit
application of new statutes creating or increasing punishments after the fact,
we have upheld intervening procedural changes even if application of the new
rule operated to a defendant's disadvantage in the particular case. See, e. g.,
Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U.S. 282, 293-294, 53 L. Ed. 2d 344, 97 S. Ct. 2290
(1977); see also Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 111 L. Ed. 2d 30, 110
S. Ct. 2715 (1990); Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167, 70 L. Ed. 216, 46 S. Ct. 68
(1925).
The question becomes then is an increase in the minimum guaranteed damages of
a civil remedy statute a substantive or a procedural change? A careful reading of Landsgraf
compels a finding that it is a procedural change only that must be given retroactive
application. Although the Landsgraf Court declined to give retroactive application to the
change most analogous to the one at issue here, it did so because it found the newly created
right to compensatory damages, previously not available under Title VII, and made available
by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, was in effect the creation of a new statute:
The provision of § 102(a)(1) authorizing the recovery of compensatory
damages is not easily classified. It does not  make unlawful conduct that was
lawful when it occurred; as we have noted, supra, 511 U.S. at 252-255, § 102
only reaches discriminatory conduct already prohibited by Title VII. Concerns
about a lack of fair notice are further muted by the fact that such
discrimination was in many cases (although not this one) already subject to
monetary liability in the form of backpay. Nor could anyone seriously contend
that the compensatory damages provisions smack of a "retributive" or other
suspect legislative purpose. Section 102 reflects Congress' desire to afford
victims of discrimination more complete redress for violations of rules
established more than a generation ago in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At
least with respect to its compensatory damages provisions, then, § 102 is not
in a category in which objections to retroactive application on grounds of
fairness have their greatest force.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 10 of 19
--- --- ---------------

Nonetheless, the new compensatory damages provision would operate
"retrospectively" if it were applied to conduct occurring before November 21,
1991. Unlike certain other forms of relief, compensatory damages are
quintessentially backward looking. Compensatory damages may be intended
less to sanction wrongdoers than to make victims whole, but they do so by a
mechanism that affects the liabilities of defendants. They do not
"compensate" by distributing funds from the public coffers, but by requiring
particular employers to pay for harms they caused. The introduction of a right
to compensatory damages is also the type of legal change that would have
an impact on private parties' planning. In this case, the event to which the new
damages provision relates is the discriminatory conduct of respondents' agent
John Williams; if applied here, that provision would attach an important new
legal burden to that conduct. The new damages remedy in § 102, we
conclude, is the kind of provision that does not apply to events antedating its
enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent.
In cases like this one, in which prior law afforded no relief, § 102 can be
seen as creating a new cause of action, and its impact on parties' rights
is especially pronounced. Section 102 confers a new right to monetary relief
on persons like petitioner who were victims of a hostile work environment but
were not constructively discharged, and the novel prospect of damages
liability for their employers. Because Title VII previously authorized recovery
of backpay in some cases, and because compensatory damages under §
102(a) are in addition to any backpay recoverable, the new provision also
resembles a statute increasing the amount of damages available under a
preestablished cause of action. Even under that view, however, the provision
would, if applied in cases arising   before the Act's effective date, undoubtedly
impose on employers found liable a "new disability" in respect to past events.
See Society for Propagation of the Gospel, 22 F. Cas. at 767. The extent of
a party's liability, in the civil context as well as the criminal, is an important
legal  consequence that cannot be ignored. Neither in Bradley itself, nor in
any case before or since in which Congress had not clearly spoken, have we
read a statute substantially increasing the monetary liability of a private party
to apply to conduct occurring before the statute's enactment. See Winfree v.
Northern Pacific R. Co., 227 U.S. 296, 301, 57 L. Ed. 518, 33 S. Ct. 273
(1913) (statute creating new federal cause of action for wrongful death
inapplicable to case arising before enactment in absence of "explicit words"
or "clear implication"); United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States
ex rel. Struthers Wells  Co., 209 U.S. 306, 314-315 (1908) (construing statute
restricting subcontractors' rights to recover  damages from prime contractors
as prospective in absence of "clear, strong and imperative" language from
Congress favoring retroactivity).

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 11 of 19

Although outside the pleadings and not appropriate for consideration on a
Motion to Dismiss, Defendant EPSTEIN has refused to answer any substantive
questions in the only two (2) depositions he has given in all these cases, including in
the State court case involving this Plaintiff. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not been able to
Here, we have an increase in the proscribed minimum recovery, if the claim is
otherwise proven, but it was a damages remedy that already existed at the time of Defendant
EPSTEIN’s commission of the acts against the minor. Hence, here, unlike Landsgraf, there
was an existing civil remedy prior to Defendant EPSTEIN’s commission of the acts against
the minor Plaintiff, and there continues to be such a remedy. Similar to our fact situation
here, in Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 40 L. Ed. 2d 476, 94 S. Ct. 2006
(1974), where a unanimous Court applied an intervening statute authorizing an award of
attorney's fees for parties seeking to end school segregation, to a case pending on appeal
at the time the statute was enacted. Noting that the statute created an "additional basis or
source for the Board's potential obligation to pay attorneys' fees," 416 U.S. at 721, the Court
found that the statute’s retroactive application did not adversely affect the settled
expectations of the parties. It is difficult to imagine, particularly when the Court is
contemplating a motion to dismiss, that Defendant EPSTEIN had a “settled expectation” that
if and when he was caught for solicitation of minors for prostitution he would be liable for only
a minimum of $50,000; it is highly probable that he never believed he would be caught and
he never knew of or contemplated the civil penalties he would face under §2255. It is highly
unlikely that Defendant EPSTEIN made those calculations when he committed the crimes
against this or any other minor. Hence the rationale usually advanced for prospective
application of statutory enactments is simply not present here, and the record is devoid of
any factual material that would support such a conclusion.10 As Justice Blackmun said in
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 12 of 19

ascertain whether Defendant EPSTEIN had settled expectations about the limits of his
civil liability under §2255. 
11“At no time within the last generation has an employer had a vested right to
engage in or to permit sexual harassment; ‘there is no such thing as a vested right to do
wrong.’ Freeborn v. Smith, 69 U.S. 160, 2 Wall. 160, 175, 17 L. Ed. 922 (1865). See
also 2 N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 41.04, p. 349 (4th rev. ed.
1986) (procedural and remedial statutes that do not take away vested rights are
presumed to apply to pending actions). Section 102 of the Act expands the remedies
available for acts of intentional discrimination, but does not alter the scope of the
employee's basic right to be free from discrimination or the employer's corresponding
legal duty. There is nothing unjust about holding an employer responsible for injuries
caused by conduct that has been illegal for almost 30 years.” Id. at 297. Similarly in this
case, soliciting minors for acts of prostitution, has been unlawful and the civil remedy
associated therewith has long preceded the acts in question. 
dissent in Landsgraf, there is no vested right to break the law.11
Bottom line is, a motion to dismiss a claim is not the correct procedural mechanism
to determine the retroactivity of a statute. Landsgraf was decided after a trial on the merits
of the claim, wherein the trial court determined that although the sexual harassment was
serious, the employer, upon learning of it, had taken prompt remedial measures to correct
it, and the plaintiff did not have sufficient cause to warrant quitting her job. Id. at 247-48.
Rivers v. Roadway Express, 511 U.S. 298 (1994) was decided after a trial on the merits as
well, wherein the Court dismissed the 1981 claims based on the holding in Patterson, supra,
and exonerated the Defendant on the Title VII claims in a bench trial. On appeal, the plaintiff
sought relief under the 1991 Civil Rights Act amendments, which overruled Patterson. These
cases where in a much different procedural posture than the present case, and the law that
is applicable, including the raise of the minimum cap to $150,000, was in place well before
this suit was filed.    
Point 3.
U.S.C. §2255 permits a claim for each temporally distinct event.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 13 of 19

(a) In general. Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a
violation of section 2241©), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260,
2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title [18 USCS § 2241©), 2242, 2243, 2251,
2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423] and who suffers personal
injury as a result of such violation, regardless of whether the injury occurred
while such person was a minor, may sue in any appropriate United States
District Court and shall recover the actual damages such person sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any person as
described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained
damages of no less than $ 150,000 in value.
The statute makes reference to “a violation” and “such violation,” both references
being in the singular. The statute does not say that if there are multiple violations, the
Plaintiff is limited to a single recovery for all the violations that occur. Such a construction
would due violence to the plain language of the statute and common sense. For example,
if a person such as Defendant EPSTEIN engages in videotaping a sex act with a minor on
Monday, and follows suit on Wednesday, there are potentially two separate crimes, and
potentially two separate torts which give rise to two separate claims upon which recovery
may be had. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant EPSTEIN violated the statute on 10
confirmed occasions and up to 20 additional occasions. Each date for each violation is
different. There is no language in the statute that prohibits the Plaintiff from suing for each
violation, and the dicta set forth in Tilton v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 554 F. 3d
1371 (11th Cir. 2009), vaguely noting that the District Court awarded the Plaintiff “the
minimum ‘actual damages’”, Id. at 1379, does not support Defendant’s claim that the Plaintiff
is entitled to a single lump sum recovery for each temporally distinct violation. There is no
suggestion in this Opinion that the Plaintiff was so limited, no reference to whether Plaintiff
sought the relief being sought here or that the events complained of in Tilton occurred on
multiple occasions. In fact, it appears clear from the Opinion that the pro se Defendant that
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 14 of 19

the Plaintiff prevailed against (by default) was sued for a singular violation of recording the
Plaintiff’s sexually oriented performance at a Spring Break gathering. There is no indication
that the conduct that was recorded by the defaulted Defendant occurred on multiple
occasions.            
Point 4.
The Eleventh Circuit has foreclosed Defendant EPSTEIN’s
argument that for a violation of 18 U.S.C. 2422(b) to occur, he must
travel in interstate commerce.
In United States v. Yost, 479 F.3d 815 (11th Cir. 2007), a defendant was convicted of
two counts of attempting to induce persons he believed were minors (they were government
agents posing as minors) to commit acts of prostitution under 18 U.S.C. §2422(b); he sought
to void his convictions on appeal because he didn’t get to the meeting place. The Court
rejected the argument, holding: 
We are not convinced by Yost's argument that his failure to arrive at the
meeting place precludes a finding of a substantial step. Although this is the
first time we have been confronted with an attempt conviction under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2422(b) where travel is not involved, two other circuits have examined the
issue and determined travel is not necessary to sustain such a conviction. In
United States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d 637, 639-40 (6th Cir. 2000), the Sixth Circuit
affirmed a conviction under Section 2422(b) where the defendant sent e-mails
proposing oral sex and attempted to set up meetings with minor females,
albeit unsuccessfully. Similarly, in United States v. Thomas, 410 F.3d 1235,
1246 (10th Cir. 2005), the Tenth Circuit affirmed a Section 2422(b) attempt
conviction, despite a lack of evidence of travel. The Tenth Circuit stated:
“Thomas crossed the line from 'harmless banter' to inducement the moment
he began making arrangements to meet [the minor], notwithstanding the lack
of evidence that he traveled to the supposed meeting place." Id. Viewing the
totality of Yost's actions, we likewise conclude Yost crossed the line from
mere "talk" to inducement. In addition to his online chats with Lynn, Yost
called Lynn on the telephone, posted pictures of his genitalia online, and
made arrangements to meet her. Despite a lack of evidence of travel, the
totality of Yost's actions convinces us that a reasonable jury could have found
Yost committed a substantial step.
Id. at 820.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 15 of 19

12Ms. Kellen has been served in accordance with New York law after seeking to
avoid service with the assistance of a doorman at her building. She has thus far failed
to respond to the Complaint, and Plaintiff is filing a Motion for Default against her today. 
As a practical matter, although not pled, the manner in which Defendant EPSTEIN
solicited Plaintiff to commit acts of prostitution as alleged was by telephone, by use of one
of his surrogate “assistants,” in this case Defendant SARAH KELLEN.12 Plaintiff would
receive a phone call on her cell phone (with a 561 exchange) from the cell phone of
Defendant KELLEN, who used a cell phone with a New York exchange (917 area code). In
United States v. Drury, 396 F.3d 1303 (11th Cir. 2005), the Court had to determine whether
a murder for hire conviction, where the defendant made calls from a Georgia land line to a
federal agent posing as a hit man on a cell phone that routed calls through Jacksonville, was
sufficient to establish use of interstate commerce for commission of the crime in question.
The Court affirmed the conviction, even where there was no intent to use an instrumentality
of interstate commerce, since the Defendant believed he was calling a number in Georgia.
In this case, the facts will demonstrate that for 99 per cent of the solicitations for
prostitution, Plaintiff was called by Defendant KELLER, who used her cell phone with a 917
exchange, a New York exchange, and presumably set up the event after being instructed by
Defendant EPSTEIN when and at what time the Plaintiff should appear at his home for the
sexual services he paid the Plaintiff for. Defendant KELLER resides and is believed to have
resided in New York at all times relevant to this suit, although she was present at Defendant
EPSTEIN’s home on some of the occasions when the Plaintiff appeared after being
summoned there. However, since she used a cellular phone, that is clearly a facility of
interstate commerce as contemplated by 18 U.S.C. 2422(b), which encompasses conduct
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 16 of 19

“(b) Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or
foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the
United States knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has
not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for
which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be
fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years or for life.” (Emphasis
added).
where “any facility or means of interstate commerce” is used.13 The Eleventh Circuit has
recognized that “[t]he telephone system is clearly a ‘facility of interstate . . . commerce.’”
United States v. Covington, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 8263 (11th Cir. April 22, 2009).
Point 5.
Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to establish a conspiracy to
violate §2255.
A civil conspiracy is an agreement by two or more persons, to do an unlawful act
or a lawful act by unlawful means, the doing of an overt act in furtherance of the
conspiracy, resulting in damage to the Plaintiff. Walters v. Blankenship, 931 So. 2d 137
(Fla. 5th DCA 2006); Blatt v. Green, Horn, et al., 456 So. 2d 949 (Fla. 3rd DCA 1984).
To support her claim of a civil conspiracy, Plaintiff has pled the following:
9.
Defendant EPSTEIN, in agreement with two (2) persons he
employed for this purpose, HALEY ROBSON and Defendant KELLEN,
conspired with these other two, and others, to solicit young women of the type
Defendant EPSTEIN preferred, blonde, attractive in appearance, and younger
than 18 years of age, to provide sexual gratification for him by engaging in
acts of prostitution.
10.
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN entered into a criminal
conspiracy to solicit young women for acts of prostitution, including the
Plaintiff, here in Palm Beach County.

EPSTEIN and KELLEN persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to come

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 17 of 19

EPSTEIN and the Plaintiff designed to fulfill his unnatural sexual desires for
young women or even younger girls who were minors. These acts included
Defendant EPSTEIN’s  request that  he wanted the encounter to be like a
“porn video.” Defendant EPSTEIN would script lines for the Plaintiff to say,
including calling out his name and requesting that he perform a certain sexual
act “harder,”while he touched the Plaintiff’s vagina  with a vibrator or with his
fingers; alternately, he would masturbate in the presence of the Plaintiff after
demanding her to disrobe and walk in front of him in provocative sexual
poses. Defendant EPSTEIN would pay the Plaintiff a fee of $200 on each
occasion  after he ejaculated while masturbating in the presence of the
Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff has pled the elements of a civil conspiracy to violate §2255.
CONCLUSION
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss must be denied. Plaintiff’s Complaint states a cause
of action pursuant to §2255. The Colorado River doctrine for abstention is not remotely
applicable to this case, which is grounded on a purely federal statutory cause of action, and
does not involve the type of policy concerns present there (water rights). It is inappropriate
for the Defendant to seek to limit his minimum statutory exposure on a Motion to Dismiss,
where there is no factual record or legislative history to determine the retroactivity of an
enhanced damages provision to a cause of action and a civil remedy that existed at the time
of the wrongful acts. §2255 claims permit a Plaintiff to assert multiple claims for multiple
violations that occur in temporally distinct time frames, no differently than any claim, whether
based on tort or statutory law, that encompasses multiple events that occur at different
times. On the interstate commerce issue, Plaintiff is prepared to allege, if the Court deems
it necessary, how his employee and co-conspirator, Defendant KELLEN, used an
instrumentality of interstate commerce, her cell phone, to solicit the Plaintiff, then a minor,
on behalf of Defendant EPSTEIN who solicited her sexual services for money. Finally,
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 36   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/12/2009   Page 18 of 19

Plaintiff has pled all necessary elements to establish a civil conspiracy to violate §2255. For
these reasons, Defendant EPSTEIN’s Motion to Dismiss must be denied; however, if the
Court determines otherwise, Plaintiff respectfully requests leave to amend.

days after the date on which the request for 
waiver of service was sent, or 90 days after that 
date if the defendant was addressed outside any 
judicial district of the United States.

waiver, and no proof of service shall be required. 
(5) The costs to be imposed on a defendant under 
paragraph (2) for failure to comply with a request to 
waive service of a summons shall include the costs 
subsequently lincun·ed in effecting service under

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO. 08-CV-80119-Marra/Johnson
JANE DOE No. 2
Plaintiff,
vs.
SARAH KELLEN,
Defendant.
_____________________________/
MOTION TO SET ASIDE ORDER OF DEFAULT
Defendant Sarah Kellen, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 55(c), hereby moves
to set aside the Order of Default entered on June 17, 2009 (DE 39).  There is good cause to set aside
the default, because plaintiff did not make proper service under New York law.  Alternatively, even
if proper service was made, the time for a responsive pleading has not expired.
Plaintiff did not execute proper service under New York law.  Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 4 states in pertinent part that a party may be served “by following state law for serving a
summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court
is located or where service is made.”  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 4 (e)(1).  Here, plaintiff asserts that service
was effected under the New York law for personal service upon a natural person, specifically
N.Y.C.P.L.R. §308(4).  That law states that where personal service cannot be made, despite due
diligence, substituted service can be made “by affixing the summons to the door of either the actual
place of business, dwelling place or usual place of abode within the state of the person to be served
and by either mailing the summons to such person at his or her last known residence or by mailing
the summons by first-class mail to the person to be served at his or her actual place of business.”
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/23/2009   Page 1 of 3

It further requires  “such affixing and a mailing to be effected within twenty days of each other; proof
of such service shall be filed with the clerk of the court designated in the summons within twenty
days of either such affixing or mailing, whichever is effected later; service shall be complete 10 days
after such filing, except in matrimonial actions.” Plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements of
the New York law.
The Affidavit of Service states that the summons was delivered on April 25, 2009, to the
doorman at a building where plaintiff allegedly has an apartment.  It further states that the summons
was mailed to that same address on April 29, 2009.  The Affidavit of Service also summarizes the
efforts made to effect personal service.  Defendant Kellen contests that the efforts described in the
Affidavit of Service constitute due diligence as required by the New York law, and that service upon
the doorman was sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the summons be affixed to a dwelling
place or usual place of abode.  This Court need not reach these issues, however, because under any
circumstance, plaintiff did not make proper service because she did not file the Affidavit of Service
in this Court within twenty days of the mailing on April 29, 2009.  Instead, the Affidavit of Service
was filed in this Court on June 12, 2009, which was approximately 44 days after the mailing.  By
waiting 44 days to file the Affidavit of Service, plaintiff did not comply with the New York
requirement that the proof of service “shall be filed with the clerk of court designated in the
summons within twenty days of either such affixing or mailing, whichever is effected later.”  As
such, service was not proper under New York law and therefore was not proper under Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 4(e).
In addition, even if service had been proper under New York law, the time for a responsive
pleading had not expired prior to the Order of Default being entered.  Under New York law, service
is not complete until ten days after the Affidavit of Service is filed with the clerk of the court
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/23/2009   Page 2 of 3

designated in the summons.  In this case that would be the clerk of the court for the Southern District
of Florida.  This filing occurred on June 12, 2009.  Therefore, service is not completed until June 26,
2009.  Fed.  R.  Civ. P. 6(a)(2)..  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(a), a responsive pleading
would not be due until twenty days thereafter.  The Order of Default entered on June 17, 2009,
should be set aside because, as of that date no responsive pleading was due, so there was no default.
Undersigned counsel has attempted in good faith to confer with counsel for the Plaintiff, but
has not been able to speak to him.
WHEREFORE, good cause having been shown under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c), the Order of
Default should be set aside.

PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO PLAINTFF’S FIRST 
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 
Plaintiff Jane Doe, hereby moves this Court for an order compelling defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, to answer her first request for production or, in the alternative, to prove 
that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege is proper.  Jane Doe also requests 
production of a privilege log. 
Jane Doe has propounded 16 requests for production, including such 
straightforward requests as requests for production of: 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 4 of 16

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Request No. 1: Copies of all telephone records; 
Request No. 2: Photos of the inside of your home located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida, that depict the room(s) where massages took place (including 
massage table).  
Request No. 10:  Correspondence between Epstein and federal prosecutors; 
Request No. 12:  Personal tax returns; 
Request No. 13:  Photocopies of Epstein’s passport;  
Request No. 14:  A statement of net worth; and  
Request No. 16:  Medical records. 
In response to each and every one of these requests, Epstein has given the 
following response (with only minor variations here and there): 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
This Court should order Epstein to provide all of the requested information or, in 
the alternative, prove that his Fifth Amendment invocations are valid. It is for the court, 
not the claimant, to determine whether the hazard of incrimination is justified.  United 
States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991).  “A court must make a 
particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 5 of 16

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.” Id.  
Typically this is done in an in camera proceeding wherein the person asserting the 
privilege is given the opportunity “to substantiate his claims of the privilege and the 
district court is able to consider the questions asked and the documents requested by 
the summons.”  Id.  
Here Epstein has made boilerplate invocation of the Fifth Amendment to each 
and every request propounded by Jane Doe, including for example the request for 
correspondence with federal prosecutors and for production of federal tax returns.  This 
obviously is not a request with Fifth Amendment implications, as the information has 
already been fully disclosed to the Government.   
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the requests or 
provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation with regard to 
each request. 
Epstein’s “cut and paste” response to the request for production also blatantly 
disregards the requirements for invoking privilege under the Court’s local rules.  Local 
rule 26.1.G very specifically requires the preparation of a privilege log with respect to all 
documents and oral communications (among other things) that are withheld on the 
basis of privilege.  Epstein has failed to prepare such a log, making it impossible for 
Jane Doe to effectively challenge his generic assertions.  Indeed, with respect to a few 
requests, Epstein has stated: “Further, the request may include information subject to 
work product or an attorney-client privilege.”  Of course, the whole purpose of forcing a 
defendant to prepare a privilege log is to force the defendant to decide whether or not 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 43   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 6 of 16

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
information is privileged.  An assertion that something “may” be privileged is obviously 
woefully deficient.  The Local Rules do not permit this tactic, and Epstein should be (at a 
minimum) promptly required to produce a privilege log.   
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to provide a privilege log 
and to answer the interrogatories or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth 
Amendment invocation with regard to each request. 
It should be noted that (with minor exceptions) the only grounds on which Epstein 
can refuse to answer the request for production is proof of a valid Fifth Amendment 
privilege.  This the only objection Epstein has asserted (with minor exceptions).  As a 
result, any other objections to production are deemed waived.  See Local Rule 
26.1G.3.(a) (“Any ground [for an objection] not stated in an objection within the time 
provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or any extensions thereof, shall be 
waived.”). 
SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION 
For the convenience of the court – and in compliance with Local Rule 26.1 H 
(party filing motion to compel shall list specific requests in succession) – Jane Doe’s 
requests for production and Epstein’s objections are as follows: 
Request No. 1:  Copies of all telephone records in your or your attorney’s possession 
from 2002 through 2005 that in any way relate to you (including all phone lines owned 
by you or that were used to contact girls for the purposes of scheduling massages for 
you.) 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
Request No. 2:  All massage appointment books, diaries, computer calendars or 
scheduling entities, scheduling books or any other writing or correspondence that 
contains the names of any of the girls that were called, contacted, scheduled or who 
otherwise went to your home located at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, for the 
purpose of giving you a massage. 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select

States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
Request No. 3:  Any and all documentation in your possession that contains Plaintiff’s 
name or that refers to Plaintiff, directly or indirectly, (includes e-mails, letters, message 
pads, diaries, appointment books, computer print outs).   
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective

the Constitution.   
Request No. 4:  Any and all photos, videos, downloaded digital prints or any other visual 
depiction of Plaintiff, or of any other known or suspected minor females introduced to 
you, directly or indirectly, by Plaintiff.

massage table).

Request No. 7:  All discovery information obtained by you or your attorneys as a result 
of the exchange of discovery in the State criminal case against you or the Federal 
investigation against you. 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to

attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must

the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.  In addition to and without waiving his constitutional 
privileges, the information sought is privileged and confidential, and 
inadmissible to the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, Federal 
Rule of Evidence 410 and 408, and § 90.410, Fla. Stat.1  Further, the 
request may including information subject to work product or an attorney-
client privilege. 
Request No. 8:  All financial documents evidencing asset transfers from 2005 to present 
for you personally or any company or corporation owned by you. 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my 
attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select 
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must

States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
Jane Doe does not intend to use these materials to draw a forbidden inference of guilt from the mere 
fact that information was provided to law enforcement officials as part of plea discussions, but rather for 
other purposes.  These materials are also quite clearly likely to lead to the discovery of other admissible 
evidence, as they relate to the same subject matter as this lawsuit.  To the extent that Epstein relies on 
the non-prosecution agreement, nothing in that agreement bars discovery of information relevant to this 
lawsuit.

Request No. 13:  A photocopy of your passport, including any supplemental pages 
reflecting travel to locations outside the 50 United States between 2002 and 2008, 
including any documents or records regarding plane tickets, hotel receipts, or

States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my

the Constitution. In addition to and without waiving his constitutional 
protections and privileges, the scope of information is so overbroad that it 
seeks information that is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead 
to the discovery of admissible evidence; compiling such information over a 
six year period would be unduly burdensome and time consuming.4

Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United States 
Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these circumstances would 
unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my constitutional rights, would be 
unreasonable, and would therefore violate the Constitution. 
Request No. 15:  All financial statements or affidavits produced by you for any reason, 
to any person, company, entity or corporation since 2005. 
Defendant is asserting his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to 
respond to all relevant questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my

the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
Jane Doe believes that Epstein used overseas travel as a means of obtaining underage girls for sexual 
purposes and for avoiding criminal prosecution for such activities.  Also, providing a copy of a passport is 
hardly “burdensome.”  Also, given the fact that Epstein is likely to have used the services of a travel agent 
or another intermediary, it should not be difficult for him to provide evidence of his overseas travels from 
such intermediaries.

CONCLUSION 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the request for 
production, or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation 
with regard to each request.  Epstein should also be required to provide a privilege log.  
Counsel for Jane Doe have conferred with opposing counsel on the issues raised in this 
motion, and no resolution was possible.

PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO PLAINTFF’S 
FIRST REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS TO DEFENDANT  
Plaintiff Jane Doe, hereby moves this Court for an order compelling defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, to answer her first requests for admissions or, in the alternative, to 
prove that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege is proper. 
Jane Doe has propounded 23 requests for admission to Epstein, including such 
straightforward requests as: 
• Your net worth is greater than $1 billion. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 4 of 10

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
• You own or control, directly or indirectly, real estate property in foreign 
countries. 
• You are moving significant financial assets overseas, outside of the direct 
territorial reach of the U.S. and Florida Courts. 
• You currently have the ability to post a bond of $15 million to satisfy a 
judgment in this case without financial or other difficulty. 
In response to each and every one of these questions, Epstein has given the 
following response: 
In response, Defendant asserts his U.S. constitutional privileges as 
specified herein.  I intend to respond to all relevant discovery regarding 
this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled me that I cannot 
provide answers to any discovery relevant to this lawsuit and I must 
accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective 
representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional rights under 
the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution.  Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.   
This Court should order Epstein to answer all of the requests for admission or, in 
the alternative, prove that his Fifth Amendment invocations are valid. It is for the court, 
not the claimant, to determine whether the hazard of incrimination is justified.  United 
States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991).  “A court must make a 
particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the 
questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.” Id.  
Typically this is done in an in camera proceeding wherein the person asserting the 
privilege is given the opportunity “to substantiate his claims of the privilege and the 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 5 of 10

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
district court is able to consider the questions asked and the documents requested by 
the summons.”  Id.  
Here Epstein has made boilerplate invocation of the Fifth Amendment to each 
and every question propounded by Jane Doe, including for example a request that he 
admit that his net worth is more than $500 million.  It is not apparent how admitting his 
net worth is incriminating in the circumstances of this case.  In any event, the Fifth 
Amendment does not operate in this fashion. It is Epstein’s obligation to explain his 
claims on a “question-by-question basis.”  Id.   
The only issue before the Court is Epstein’s Fifth Amendment privilege.  Epstein 
has only asserted a Fifth Amendment objection to production.  As a result, any other 
objections to production are deemed waived.  See Local Rule 26.1G.3.(a) (“Any ground 
[for an objection] not stated in an objection within the time provided by the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure, or any extensions thereof, shall be waived.”). 
SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION 
For the convenience of the court – and in compliance with Local Rule 26.1 H 
(party filing motion to compel shall list specific requests in succession) – Jane Doe’s 
requests for admission are as follows: 
1.  Your net worth is greater than $10 million. 
2.  Your net worth is greater than $50 million. 
3.  Your net worth is greater than $100 million. 
4.  Your net worth is greater than $500 million. 
5.  Your net worth is greater than $1 billion. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 6 of 10

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
6.  Since being incarcerated you have, directly or indirectly (through the services 
or assistance of other persons), conveyed money or assets in an attempt to insulate or 
protect your money or assets from being captured in any civil lawsuits filed against you. 
7.  You own or control, directly or indirectly, real estate property in the Caribbean. 
8. You own or control, directly or indirectly, real estate property in foreign 
countries. 
9.  In the last 2 years you have transferred assets and/or money and/or financial 
instruments to countries outside the United States. 
10.  You have provided financial support to the modeling agency MC2. 
11. You have committed sexual assault against Plaintiff, a minor. 
12.  You committed battery against Plaintiff. 
13.  You digitally penetrated Plaintiff when she was a minor. 
14.  You offered Plaintiff more money contingent upon her having sex with your 
or giving you oral sex. 
15.  You intended to harm Plaintiff when you committed these sexual acts 
against her. 
16.  You knew Plaintiff was under the age of 16 when you sexually touched and 
fondled her. 
17.  You intend to hire investigators to intimidate and harass Plaintiff during this 
litigation. 
18.  You were engaged in the act of trafficking minors across state or country 
borders for the purposes of sex or prostitution between 2000 and the present. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 44   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 7 of 10

               CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
19.  You coerced Plaintiff into being a prostitute and remaining in prostitution. 
20.  You are guilty of the following offenses against Jane Doe: 
A.  Procuring a minor for the purpose of prostitution as defined in F.S. 796.03; 
B.  Battery as defined by Florida Statutes. 
C.  Sexual Battery. 
21.  You are moving significant financial assets overseas, outside of the direct 
territorial reach of the U.S. and Florida Courts. 
22.  You are making asset transfers with the intent to defeat any judgment that 
might be entered against you in this or similar cases. 
23.  You currently have the ability to post a bond of $15 million to satisfy a 
judgment in this case without financial or other difficulty. 
CONCLUSION 
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the requests 
for admission or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment invocation 
with regard to each request.  Counsel for Jane Doe have conferred with opposing 
counsel on the issues raised in this motion, and no resolution was possible.

PLAINTIFF JANE DOE’S MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO PLAINTFF’S FIRST 
SET OF INTERROGATORIES  
Plaintiff Jane Doe, hereby moves this Court for an order compelling defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, to answer her first set of interrogatories or, in the alternative, to prove 
that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege is proper. 
Jane Doe has propounded 23 interrogatories, including such straightforward 
requests as: 
Interrogatory No. 2: Describe financial assets that are under your control, 
directly or indirectly, including interests in corporations or other business entities.   
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 45   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 4 of 20

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
Interrogatory No. 3:  Describe which financial assets listed in your answer to 
interrogatory #2 are located outside the 50 states of the United States and where they 
are located. 
Interrogatory No. 4: 
Describe your net worth, including income and 
expenses for 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. 
Interrogatory No. 5: 
Describe any real property in which you have a total 
or partial interest, either directly or indirectly. 
Interrogatory No. 7: 
Describe any transfer of assets under your control, 
either directly or indirectly, to locations outside the 50 United States in 2005, 2006, 2007 
and 2008. 
Interrogatory No. 8:  Describe, with specificity, your travel to locations outside 
the 50 states of the United states in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, including your dates 
of travel, location to which you traveled and persons that accompanied you in each such 
travel.   
Interrogatory No. 11: Have you heard or do you know about any statement or 
remark (verbal or written) made by or on behalf of any party to this lawsuit, other than 
yourself, concerning any issue in this lawsuit? If so, state the name and address of each 
person who heard or read it, and the date, time, place and substance of each statement 
or remark. 
Interrogatory No. 12: Do you intend to elicit testimony of witnesses other than 
Plaintiff regarding any statements she has ever made?  If so, what statements do you 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 45   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 5 of 20

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
intend to produce through testimony?  Through which witness do you intend to elicit 
such statement?  And for what purpose do you intend to admit such statement? 
Interrogatory No. 23: State the facts upon which you rely for each affirmative 
defense in your answer. 
In response to these interrogatories, Epstein has given the following response 
(with only slight variations on the overbreadth objection): 
Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the interrogatories as 
well as his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled 
me that I cannot provide answers to any questions relevant to this lawsuit 
and I must accept this advice or risk losing my Sixth Amendment right to 
effective representation.  Accordingly, I assert my federal constitutional 
rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed 
by United States Constitution.   Drawing an adverse inference under these 
circumstances would unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my 
constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and would therefore violate 
the Constitution.  In addition to and without waiving his constitutional 
privileges, Defendant objects as the interrogatory is so overbroad and, 
thus, seeks information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the 
pending action nor does it appear reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence. 
This Court should order Epstein to answer all of these interrogatories or, in the 
alternative, prove that his Fifth Amendment invocations are valid. It is for the court, not 
the claimant, to determine whether the hazard of incrimination is justified.  United States 
v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991).  “A court must make a 
particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the 
questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.” Id.  
Typically this is done in an in camera proceeding wherein the person asserting the 
privilege is given the opportunity “to substantiate his claims of the privilege and the 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 45   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 6 of 20

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
district court is able to consider the questions asked and the documents requested by 
the summons.”  Id.  
Here Epstein has made boilerplate invocation of the Fifth Amendment to each 
and every question propounded by Jane Doe, including for example the question: 
Do you intend to elicit testimony of witnesses other than Plaintiff regarding any 
statements she has ever made?  This obviously is not an interrogatory with Fifth 
Amendment implications.  Nor is Epstein’s claim that this interrogatory is somehow 
“overbroad” or “not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence” even 
facially plausible.   
Epstein’s  “cut and paste” response to the interrogatories also blatantly 
disregards the requirements for invoking privilege under the Court’s local rules.  Local 
rule 26.1.G very specifically requires the preparation of a privilege log with respect to all 
documents and oral communications (among other things) that are withheld on the 
basis of privilege.  Epstein has failed to prepare such a log, making it impossible for 
Jane Doe to effectively challenge his generic assertions.  The Local Rules do not permit 
this tactic, and Epstein should be (at a minimum) promptly required to produce a 
privilege log.   
For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the 
interrogatories or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment 
invocation with regard to each request. 
It should be noted that the only two grounds on which Epstein can refuse to 
answer the interrogatories are either proof of a valid Fifth Amendment privilege or proof 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 45   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/10/2009   Page 7 of 20

                  CASE NO:  08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON 
of a valid overbreadth objection.  These are the only two objections Epstein has 
asserted.  As a result, any other objections to production are deemed waived.  See 
Local Rule 26.1G.3.(a) (“Any ground [for an objection] not stated in an objection within 
the time provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or any extensions thereof, 
shall be waived.”). 
SPECIFIC INTERROGATORIES 
For the convenience of the court – and in compliance with Local Rule 26.1 H 
(party filing motion to compel shall list specific requests in succession) – Jane Doe’s 
interrogatories are as follows: 
1. 
What is the full name and Florida address of the person answering these 
interrogatories, and, if applicable, the person's official position or relationship with 
the party to whom the interrogatories are directed? 
[Note: This is the only interrogatory Epstein answered in any way.] 
2. 
Describe financial assets that are under your control, directly or indirectly, 
including interests in corporations or other business entities. 
Defendant is asserting specific legal objections to the interrogatories as 
well as his U.S. constitutional privileges.  I intend to respond to all relevant 
questions regarding this lawsuit, however, my attorneys have counseled 
me that I cannot provide answers to any questions relevant to this lawsuit

For all these reasons, the Court should compel Epstein to answer the 
interrogatories or provide a particularized justification for his Fifth Amendment 
invocation with regard to each request.  Epstein should also be required to produce a

issues raised in this motion, and no resolution was possible.

PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT KELLEN’S
MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT
Plaintiff, JANE DOE II, through counsel, opposes the Defendant SARAH KELLEN’S
Motion to Set Aside Default. Defendant KELLEN offers no proof that she did not actually
receive the service of process; she says she “contests” the efforts but offers no evidence
to contest the Affidavit of the process server, who made six (6) attempts to serve before
being forced to resort to “nail and mail” service, valid under New York law. Maines Paper
& Food Service, Inc. v. Boulevard Burgers Corporation, 52 A.D. 3d 1150, 861 N.Y.S. 2d 808
(N.Y.S.C., Appellate Division, June 26, 2008).   
Defendant KELLEN first argues that Plaintiff’s Motion is defective because the
Plaintiff did not timely file the Affidavit of Service. However, a delay in filing proof of service
under CPLR 308 is merely a procedural irregularity, not jurisdictional, and may be corrected
nunc pro tunc by the court. Haegeland v Massa, 75 A.D. 2d 864; Hudela v Posner, 70 Misc
2d 726. If anything, the delay in filing the Affidavit of Service provided Defendant KELLEN
additional time to avoid being defaulted. An action is commenced with the delivery of a
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 47   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/14/2009   Page 1 of 4

summons, and cannot thereafter be defeated simply by reason of a belated filing of proof
of service.  Lopez v Quickset Printers, 70 Misc 2d 732, particularly in the absence of a
statement by defendant categorically denying that she ever received the papers.  Empire
Nat. Bank v Judal Constr., 61 A.D. 2d 789. Defendant KELLEN serves no Affidavit
contesting that she was served and received the Summons and Complaint.
Defendant makes a half hearted attempt to question the sufficiency of service.
Conspicuously absent is any statement or inference that the defendant did not receive the
papers served upon her or that, under New York State law, due diligence  was not made.
Schwarz v Margie, 2009 NY Slip Op 03890, 62 A.D.3d 780 (May 12, 2009); Leviton v
Unger, 2008 NY Slip Op 09363, 56 A.D. 3d 731 (November 25, 2008). Here, the Defendant
was given notice through proper service that a law suit was being instituted against her and
she deliberately chose to ignore the claim, not moving for relief until after a default was
entered. Even if the Defendant where to deny that she received service, which she has
failed to do, the presumption of receipt of properly mailed materials renders ineffective
defendant’s denial of receipt. Guccione v. Flynt, 618 F.Supp. (S.D. N.Y. 1985). Defendant
ultimately does not challenge the sufficiency of service with any evidence that might require
an evidentiary hearing.  
The second argument made by Defendant KELLEN, that the Court prematurely
defaulted her without waiting 10 days from Plaintiff’s filing proof of service, is equally
unavailing. New York State law requirements of filing an affidavit of service within 20 days
of completion under CPLR 308(4), along with the 10 grace period , pertains solely to the
time within which a defendant must answer, and does not relate to the jurisdiction acquired
by service of the summons.  Browning v Nix, 47 Misc 2d 709; William Iser, Inc. v. Garnett,
Misc 2d 450. The “additional notice” of 10 days is intended to give the defendant notice
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 47   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/14/2009   Page 2 of 4

that  a default judgment is imminent so that she may take remedial action is she desires.
(See 4 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 3215:29) as cited in Mobil Oil Corp. v.
Christian Oil & Gas Distributors, 95 A.D. 2d 722; 463 N.Y.S. 2d 253 (N.Y. App. Div. 1983).
Defendant has been on notice for almost three months that a default was imminent, and
took no action; she then, through counsel, served a Motion to Set Aside Default, on June
23, 2009, and has still failed to file a responsive pleading of any kind, despite admitting that
such a pleading would have been due, under her reading of the Rule, on or before June 26,
2009. Hence under the facts of the instant case, service is proper, the defendant was on
notice of default and, even to date, has not responded to the allegations of the Complaint
sh was served with on April 23, 2009, almost three (3) months ago.    
In addition, under New York law, the moving party seeking to set aside a default,
must demonstrate a meritorious defense. Maines Paper, supra, 52 A.D. 3d at 1152. No
such argument is made here, no proposed Answer and Affirmative Defenses has been filed,
in fact there is nothing in the Motion to suggest that Defendant KELLEN even has a defense
to the claims made against her. Accordingly, denial of a Motion to Vacate Default would not
be an abuse of discretion. “Given defendant’s failure to present proof of a meritorious
defense, [the] Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to vacate
the default judgment,” Maines Paper, supra, 52 A.D. 3d at 1152 (citation omitted).    
In this case, Defendant KELLEN chose to ignore service of a summons for several
months, and sought relief after the Court had defaulted her. Defendant KELLEN is not
entitled to relief because her Motion is not supported by any case law interpreting New
York’s “nail and mail” statute and because she has not come forth with a meritorious, or any
defense. The Default should stand and the issue of damages reserved for trial or summary

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO. 09-cv-80469-Marra/Johnson
JANE DOE II,
          Plaintiff,
vs.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,
and SARAH KELLEN,
Defendants.
______________________/
SARAH KELLEN’S REPLY TO PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
KELLEN’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT
Defendant SARAH KELLEN, by and through undersigned counsel, and pursuant to the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7.1, replies to Plaintiff’s Memorandum Of Law In
Opposition to Defendant Kellen’s Motion To Set Aside Default (DE 47) and states as follows:
Ms. Kellen asks the Court to set aside default in this case because service of process was
legally deficient under New York law, and, the entry of default was premature.  Moreover, Ms.
Kellen asks the Court to set aside the default because she has a meritorious defense to the instant
action which might affect the outcome, granting her motion to set aside the default would not result
in prejudice to the non-defaulting party, and default in this action was not willful.
Service of Process Was Legally Deficient Under New York Law
It is undisputed by the parties that the purported service of process on Ms. Kellen in this
action is pursuant to Federal Rule of Procedure 4(e)(1) which allows service “pursuant to the law
of the state . . . in which effected.”  In this case, Plaintiff claims to have served Ms. Kellen in New
York under section 308(4) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (“CPLR”), which is
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 48   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2009   Page 1 of 7

colloquially known as “nail and mail service.”  This type of service is disfavored in New York.  In
fact, New York’s highest court has construed the statutory requirements of nail and mail service
“strictly” stating that “the liberalization of the requirements of service would jeopardize the primary
statutory purpose of ensuring that defendants receive actual notice of the pendency of litigation
against them.”  Feinstein v. Berger, 397 N.E.2d 1161, 1164 (1979). 
1.
Plaintiff Failed to Exercise Due Diligence
 “It is well settled that ‘nail and mail’ service pursuant to CPLR 308(4) may be used only
where personal service under CPLR 308(1) and (2) cannot be made with ‘due diligence.’” Silber v.
Stein, 731 N.Y.S. 2d 227, 228 (N.Y. App. Div. 2001).  Plaintiff has the burden of showing due
diligence for the purposes of CPLR 308(4).  See State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp. V. Cacia, 652
N.Y.S. 2d 883 (N.Y. App. Div. 1997).   Courts strictly enforce the due diligence requirement “given
the reduced likelihood that a summons served pursuant to the action will be received.” See
Lemberger v. Khan, 794 N.Y.S. 2d 416 (N.Y. App. Div. 2005).   A plaintiff that resorts to using
CPLR 308(4) should be prepared to make a detailed showing of the efforts constituting due
diligence, inasmuch as rigid adherence to the requirement of due diligence is expected.  There is no
set fast rule as to what constitutes due diligence.  Instead, courts consider the facts and
circumstances of each case. Hanover New England v. MacDougall, 608 N.Y.S. 2d 561, 561-62
(N.Y. App. Div. 1994).
Here, Plaintiff fails to meet her burden of showing due diligence for the purposes of CPLR
308(4).  In fact, the only reference Plaintiff makes to due diligence in her Response is the following
phrase: “the process server, who made six (6) attempts to serve before being forced to resort to nail
and mail service, valid under New York law.”  Importantly, all six attempts to serve Ms. Kellen
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 48   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2009   Page 2 of 7

occurred between April 14 and April 25, 2009, a span of eleven days. The process server states that
on April 14, 2009, April 21, 2009 and April 24, 2009 he was informed by the doorman at Ms.
Kellen’s apartment residence that Ms. Kellen was “out of town.”  Certainly, given the consistency
of the statement that Ms. Kellen was out of town, the process server should have exercised due
diligence and waited an appropriate period of time for Ms. Kellen to return to town.  His repeated
attempts to serve Ms Kellen when he possessed knowledge that she was not at the residence speaks
to his failure to exercise due diligence.  
Notably, the case law Plaintiff relies upon in her Response clearly supports Ms. Kellen’s
legal position.  Plaintiff relies upon  Maines Paper & Food Service, Inc., v. Boulevard Burgers, 52
A.D. 3d 1150, 1152 (N.Y.S. App. Div. 2008)  to support her claim that the process servers efforts
comply with New York Law.  However, Plaintiff fails to point out that Maines states that “due
diligence  . . . refers to the quality of the efforts made to effect personal service . . . not to their
quantity or frequency.”  Id.  Unlike the efforts in this case, in Maines the process server not only
made repeated attempts to serve at the residence, he also spoke to neighbors, and sought out persons
who worked with the individual, and he had counsel investigate the individual and research
databases, credit applications, verify home addresses, and check with the Secretary of State as to
property ownership. Id.  Here, Plaintiff’s process server efforts are merely six visits to Kellen’s
residence when he knew she was out of town.  Plaintiff also cites Leviton v. Unger, 868 N.Y.S. 2d
126 (N.Y.S. App. Div. 2008) in her Response.  However, once again Plaintiff fails to point out to
the Court that in Leviton the court found that service of process by “nail and mail” was insufficient
as a matter of law because the process server repeatedly went to the person’s residence on a day and
time when the person was likely to be working or commuting, and statements by the process server
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 48   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2009   Page 3 of 7

as to his efforts to determine where the person worked were conclusory and ambiguous.  In this case,
Plaintiff demonstrates significantly less due diligence that what was at issue in Leviton and Maines. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s due diligence efforts fail as a matter of law. 
2.
The Entry of Default Was Premature
Once the due diligence burden is met, the plain language of the New York “nail and mail”
statute, CPLR 308(4) requires three steps for service to be complete: (1) the summons must be
affixed to the door; (2) a copy of the summons and complaint must be served upon the person by
mail; and (3) plaintiff must file “proof of service” with the court. See N.Y.C.P.L.R. 308(4).  The
plain language of the New York statute states that plaintiff must fulfill each of these elements for
service to be complete.
In this case, Plaintiff did not file her proof of service as required by the “nail and mail”
statute until June 12, 2009, when she attached the proof of service to her motion for default against
Ms. Kellen (DE 37).  Only upon filing of this notice is service deemed complete by New York law. 
Once service is complete the time in which to answer, appear or move is set by the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure.  Importantly, Plaintiff admits in her Response that the filing of the proof of
service required under CPLR 308(4) “pertains solely to the time within which a defendant may
answer.” (Plaintiff’s Response DE 47:2).  It is well settled New York law that “the failure to file
proof of service merely enlarge[s] the defendant’s time to appear, answer or move.” Browning v.
Nix, 47 Misc. 2d 709, 711 (N.Y.Sup. 1965).  Ms. Kellen acknowledges that Plaintiff’s failure to file
a proof of service, standing by itself, does not defeat the efficacy of otherwise valid service.  The
purpose of the filing of the proof of service under the nail and mail statute is to go an extra step so
as to ensure that someone who has not been personally served has every opportunity to comply. Id. 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 48   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2009   Page 4 of 7

Here, Ms. Kellen  had 20 days from June 12, 2009, specifically until July 2, 2009, in which
to file a responsive pleading.  However, on June 17, 2009, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion and
entered a default.  Five days later, on June 23, 2009 Ms. Kellen moved to set aside the default (DE
42).  Because the Order of Default was entered before the time in which Ms. Kellen had to file a
responsive pleading expired the Order was premature, there was no default, and the Order should
be vacated. 
Importantly, soon after filing her Motion to Set Aside Default, Ms. Kellen, through counsel,
commenced good faith efforts with Plaintiff to effect a waiver of service.  Counsel for Plaintiff was
contacted by the undersigned by certified letter, email, and telephone. Plaintiff never responded.
The Default Should Be Set Aside For Good Cause Shown
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) provides the standard for setting aside an entry of
default. The rule states that “[f]or good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default. Fed.
R. Civ. P. 55( c).  The Eleventh Circuit holds that the standard for setting aside a default is different
and less burdensome than the setting aside of a default judgment.  See E.E.O.C. v. Mike Smith
Pontiac GMC, Inc., 896 F.2d 524, 527-28 (11th Cir. 1990).  Good cause is a liberal standard. Coon
v. Grenier, 867 F.2d 73, 76 (1st Cir. 1989).   The relevant factors courts consider under “good
cause”  include “whether (1) the default was willful, (2) a set-aside would prejudice plaintiff, and
(3) the alleged defense was meritorious.” See Compania Interamericana Export-Import, S.A. v.
Compania Dominicana De Aviacion, 88 F.3d 948, 951 (11 th Cir. 1996).  
Here, even if the default was properly entered, all factors weigh in favor of setting it aside. 
First, Ms. Kellen’s conduct was not willful. Willfulness is determined by considering whether the
party intended to violate court rules and procedure and not merely whether the party failed to
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 48   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2009   Page 5 of 7

answer. Widmer-Baum v. Chandler-Halford, 162 F.R.D. 545 (N.D. Iowa 1995).  Situations where
a party absconds to avoid liability have been found to be willful.  Good faith or the inadvertent
failure to answer are not willful.  Commercial Bank of Kuwait v. Rafidain Bank, 15 F.3d 238, 27
Fed. R. Serv. 3d 1353 (2d Cir. 1994). Here, there is no evidence that, prior to the default being
entered, Ms. Kellen or her counsel knew she had been properly served under the New York “nail
and mail” statute1, and that therefore a responsive pleading was due.  As set forth above, Plaintiff’s
process server showed no due diligent efforts to provide actual notice to Ms. Kellen.  Instead, the
process server merely repeatedly showed up to serve Ms. Kellen when he knew she was not at that
location. 
Second, Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by setting aside the default because litigation in this
case has just begun. Plaintiff filed this case in late March 2009.  Litigation is in its early stages. See
Feliciano v. Reliant Tooling Co., 691 F.2d 653, 656-57 (3rd Cir. 1982)(finding that plaintiff’s
expenses, or delay in realizing satisfaction do not constitute sufficient prejudice).
Third, Ms. Kellen has a meritorious defense to this action.  Ms. Kellen did not personally
commit any sexual battery on the Plaintiff, nor did she conspire with Mr. Epstein to do so.  In fact,
Plaintiff does not allege any physical contact with Ms. Kellen, nor does she allege that Ms. Kellen
was present for any improper sexual touching.  At best, she alleges that Ms. Kellen arranged for
Plaintiff to massage Mr. Epstein.  The evidence will show that Ms. Kellen was not aware of
whatever happened (or would happen) privately between Mr. Epstein and Plaintiff.  As such,
Plaintiff will not be able to prove Ms. Kellen’s knowledge or intent to commit any tortious conduct,
nor her agreement to further such conduct.
1Florida law does not permit this kind of service.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 48   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2009   Page 6 of 7

Last, “[d]efaults are seen with disfavor because of the strong policy of determining cases on
their merits.”  Florida’s Physician’s Ins. Co. V. Ehlers, 8 F.3d 780, 783(11th Cir. 1993)(internal
citations omitted).  Long-standing Eleventh Circuit precedent holds that “[e]ntry of judgment by
default is a drastic remedy which should be used only in extreme circumstances.”Wahl v. McIver,
773 F.2d 1169, 1174 (11th Cir. 1984).    The facts and circumstances set forth in this case do not rise
to an extreme circumstance.  Even if the Court finds that service was proper, Ms. Kellen should be
afforded the opportunity to have this dispute determined on its merits. 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Kellen respectfully requests that her Motion To Set Aside
Default be granted.

SARAH KELLEN,
Defendants.
_______________________________________/
ORDER SETTING ASIDE DEFAULT AGAINST DEFENDANT SARAH KELLEN 
AND REQUIRING KELLEN TO RESPOND TO COMPLAINT 
ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 3, 2009
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant Sarah Kellen’s (“Defendant” or
“Kellen”) Motion to Set Aside Order of Default (DE 42), filed June 23, 2009.  The motion is
fully briefed and ripe for review.  The Court has reviewed the motion, response, reply, and the
record and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.
On June 17, 2009, the Court entered an Order of Default Against Defendant Sarah Kellen
(DE 39).  In that Order, the Court stated that it “has reviewed the affidavit of service
accompanying Plaintiff’s motion for default against Kellen and concludes that Plaintiff effected
service on Defendant Kellen in a manner authorized by New York state law.” See DE 39, citing 
N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 308(4).  The Court concluded that, because Defendant Kellen failed to timely
answer the complaint or otherwise respond thereto, Plaintiff was entitled to an Order of Default
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 49   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2009   Page 1 of 3

against Kellen. Id.  
In her motion to set aside default, Kellen argues that (1) the process server failed to
exercise “due diligence” before resorting to New York “nail and mail” service; (2) the entry of
default was premature because Plaintiff did not file her proof of service until she filed her motion
for default against Kellen; (3) Kellen has shown good cause for setting aside the default because
her conduct was not willful, litigation is in its early stages, and Kellen has a meritorious defense
to this action.  
Upon review of the process server’s affidavit, the Court concludes that the server
exercised “due diligence” by making six attempts to serve Plaintiff over a twelve-day period, at
varying times of morning and evening, before resorting to New York “nail and mail” service. 
However, Defendant correctly notes that pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 308(4), the time for her to
respond to the complaint did not begin to run until Plaintiff filed “proof of service” with the
Court.  Accordingly, Defendant should have been afforded twenty days to respond to the
complaint from the June 12, 2009 filing of the proof of service before Plaintiff could obtain an
entry of default against her.  Because the default was entered prematurely, the Court will set aside
the Order of Default Against Sarah Kellen (DE 39), without prejudice, for Plaintiff to move for
default against Kellen if she does not respond to the complaint on or before August 3, 2009. 
Additionally, even assuming Defendant’s interpretation of New York law is incorrect, she
had a good faith basis to believe that the time for her to answer the complaint had not expired. 
Thus, at the very least, she has shown excusable neglect.  Defendant also asserts meritorious
defenses and Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the setting aside of the default.  Accordingly, it is
hereby
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 49   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2009   Page 2 of 3
--

ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:
1. Defendant Sarah Kellen’s Motion to Set Aside Order of Default (DE 42) is 
GRANTED.
2. The Order of Default against Kellen (DE 39) is set aside, without prejudice for Plaintiff
to move for an entry of default against Kellen if she does not respond to the complaint on
or before August 3, 2009.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 22  day of July, 2009.

DEFENDANT, JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S, NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE 
WITH COURT ORDER (DE #192) 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, by and through his undersigned attorneys, in compliance with 
the Court's Order (DE #192) hereby submits a proposed order on Plaintiffs Motion for 
Protective Order (DE #114), and states: 
1. 
The Court granted the Plaintiffs Motion for an Order for Preservation of 
Evidence, (DE #192). However the Court determined that the Plaintiffs proposed order was 
overly broad and directed that the parties attempt to submit an agreed order. The parties have

sections. However, we were unable to finalize an order. 
Therefore, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is providing his proposed order attached as 
Exhibit A. Plaintiffs counsel will be serving their proposed order. 
2. 
Should the Court allow, counsel for the parties are willing to provide the Court a 
brief joint statement setting forth the differences in their proposed order and their respective 
positions. However, neither party, absent this Court's permission believed it was appropriate.

Forensic Child Psychiatric Evaluations, Life Care Plans & Testimony 
DECLARATION OF GILBERT KLIMAN, M. D. 
RE: EXPECTATION OF HARM FROM DISCLOSING THE PLAINTIFFS' IDENTITIES 
IN DOES V JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
1. I, Gilbert W. Kliman, M.D., of2105 Divisadero Street, San Francisco, California, 
CA. Physicians License G55912, declare the following under penalty of perjury: 
2. I have been retained by plaintiffs' law firm, Mermelstein & Horowitz, to give expert 
testimony. If called as a witness, I would testify truthfully and competently concerning 
my psychiatric findings about each of the plaintiffs' alleged experiences of sexual abuse, 
and the enduring effects that I find each of the young women have suffered as a direct 
result of the sexual acts perpetrated by the defendant. 
3. I have been asked to respond to the Defense motion, which requests that some of the 
plaintiffs, who are now adults, should be publicly named. It is my opinion that 
involuntary public disclosure will result in the plaintiffs experiencing revictimization, 
albeit by a justice system that is designed to protect them. If their identities are released, 
the victims will be at-risk of having their personal lives scrutinized by friends, extended 
family, spouses, children, fellow students, employers and fellow employees, the media 
and general public. This type of exposure humiliates many victims and represents another 
betrayal of trust. Public exposure places the plaintiffs at further risk of stigmatization, 
shame and retraurnatization. 
4. Due to traumatization the plaintiffs are arrested in their development, and even those 
who are now legally adults are arrested in part to adolescent aspects of psychology. 
5. The plaintiffs do not hold their heads high with pride for having been sexually 
controlled by Mr. Epstein. They hold their heads low with shame. The internal life of a 
typical adolescent, into late adolescence and early adult years in the best of 
circumstances, usually involves generous proportions of self-consciousness, shame, self-
absorption and self-doubt and self-blame about sexual acts. 
EXHIBIT 
I A 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 52-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 2 of 5
6. Clinically harmful levels of shame, self-consciousness, self-doubt and self-blame are 
even more prominent among victims of molestations than among the general population. 
7. Molested teenagers are particularly vulnerable to wrongful manipulations and special 
clinical harms from the experiences of shame and humiliation. In fact, shame and efforts 
to cope with it played an underlying role in the harm to each plaintiff. Each was lured 
into Mr. Epstein's sexual lair with the promise of overcoming bodily and sexual shame 
by earning money and bettering their lot in life. The defendant capitalized on their sexual 
naivete, insecurities and effort to better themselves, and he worked hard to overcome 
their shame at his enlistment of them in his selfish gratifications. 
8. The defendant who wishes to make their identities public is one whom the criminal 
justice system has already determined is a person who has already committed a crime of 
child molestation. That surely means he has already exploited and manipulated the girls' 
state of adolescent sexuality, including their embarrassment, awkwardness and bodily 
self-consciousness. He perverted their nascent and developing moral structures by posing 
as a generous, avuncular mentor who could coach them about their bodies, sex and love. 
The exploitation of adolescent bodies, sex and love is - from a psychoanalytic point of 
view - an influence on the developing moral conscience of the children, as well as on 
their sexual urges. Now the ravaging of their internal and private moral conscience is 
intended by the perpetrator to be made a public ravaging. 
9. Among sexual trauma victims, the insidious and destructive persistence of shame, 
humiliation and associated self-blame is well-documented (Finkelhor and Brown, 1985). 
Stigmatization, as experienced by a sexual trauma victim, has especially painful and 
pathologic consequences. Shame lingers and becomes integrated within the adolescent 
victim's malleable emerging identity, character structure and self image. Moral clarity is 
distorted. Perceptions of self-blame and guilt are magnified. The impact of shame lends 
to cultivating a self image of being "spoiled goods." 
10. Stigmatization following sexual trauma results in long-term risks that can negatively 
shape multiple facets of adult development: sexual, emotional, interpersonal and 
vocational. Stigmatization, which is generally to be avoided among psychiatric patients, 
increases risks among those - as in our plaintiffs as a group - who experience clinical 
depression and self-destructive behaviors: drug use, criminal activity, even prostitution. 
Stigmatization following abuse is associated with delinquency due to increased anger 
and affiliation with deviant peers (Feiring et al., 2007). 
11. Shame and guilt are important dimensions of both complex and single event, 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms of shame are associated with feelings of 
helplessness and powerlessness, which each of the plaintiffs endorsed experiencing in 
relation to Mr. Epstein. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 52-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 3 of 5
12. The DSM-IV-TR recognizes both powerlessness and helplessness as requisite parts of 
the traumatic experience in Criterion A for the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder 
trauma (Martin Seligman, recent Past President of the American Psychological 
Association, coined relevant terms of "learned helplessness and "Loss of Personal Locus 
of Control." See Seligman, M.P. 1975: Helplessness, Depression, Development and 
Death. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco). The teenaged girls suffered the loss of personal 
locus of control to a much more experienced, sexually aggressive, powerful and 
dominant, manipulative perpetrator. 
13. Releasing names of the plaintiffs to the public will reenact experiences of 
powerlessness and helplessness in the face of a boundary violation. Repetition and 
reenactment represent central features of Criterion Bin the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of 
posttraumatic stress disorder trauma. In effect, release of their identity and public 
intrusion into their personal life represents a reenactment of the shame of sexual 
traumatization. Repetition and reenactment are central pathologies that afflict sexual 
trauma survivors. 
14. Victims of sexual abuse often rely upon some form of dissociation, splitting or denial, 
as a defensive means to manage overwhelming affects associated with the sexual trauma. 
Each of the plaintiff girls has employed some variation of this defense, both during the 
massages and then subsequently following disclosure of the abuse. Primitive, 
maladaptive responses of this nature will become additionally reinforced as a result of 
public disclosure. 
15. Another aspect of the plaintiffs' experience, which is recognized by DSM-IV-TR, is 
that the trauma was associated with human design factors (such as cruel intention to do 
harm, rape, torture). Trauma of this origin has a tendency to produce more "severe or 
long lasting" posttraumatic stress disorder than natural events (DSM IV TR p. 464). A 
policy of deliberate revelation of the names of the victims would reinforce the sense of 
design, pattern and policy of human intentions. 
16. Negative expectations about significant activities are noted in DSM-IV-TR, as part of 
Criterion C. Symptoms of foreshortened future are characteristic of a traumatized 
individual's clinical course (C4). They expect revictimization. They expect bad outcomes 
(C7) in their social, educational, vocational, relational plans. They are hypervigilant 
(Criterion D4) for further trauma, and this affects lifestyle choices and future planning. 
Hypervigilance is part of the arousal set of criteria. Public disclosure of the victims' 
identity will aggravate existing symptoms ofhypervigilance. 
17. The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic category of "chronic" is justified for each of the 
plaintiffs. Scientific literature shows that the prognostic consequences of PTSD and 
residual effects may last for decades (U.S. Dept. of Health, 2005; Issues in Child Abuse 
Prevention Number 9 Autumn] 998: Long-term Effects of Child Sexual Abuse, Paul E 
Mullen and Jillian Fleming). The lasting impact upon character, identity and moral 
development will probably affect long-term influences upon adult development. It is 
more probable than not that stigmatization associated with public disclosure of the 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 52-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 4 of 5
plaintiffs' identities will intensify the scope, nature and severity of the chronic symptom 
course. 
18. In addition to PTSD, shame and humiliation themselves have also been associated 
with causing clinical depression. Coexisting PTSD and clinical depression places the 
plaintiff's at increased risk for re-victimization and high risk sexual behaviors (e.g., 
sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy, rape) (Nelson, 2002), and at greater 
risk to victimize others (Filipas and Ullman, 2006; Desai, Centers for Disease Control, 
2002) who are in their control. Studies have also shown that chronic symptoms of PTSD, 
in association with a single episode of Major Depressive Disorder, can produce lifetime 
adjustment difficulties, which include suicidality (Oquendo et al, 2005; Dube et al, CDC, 
2001; Rohde, J. Am. Acad. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 2005). The plaintiffs will be 
additionally vulnerable to these clinical outcomes, if they suffer the stigmatization and 
humiliation ass_ociated with public disclosure of their identities. 
19. Alternative hypothesis: I have applied the evidence shown from examination and 
testing of the plaintiffs and relevant observations and information from other 
professionals while testing an alternative hypothesis: that no harm would result from 
public disclosure of the plaintiffs' identities. During the evaluations with the six 
plaintiffs, I used generally acceptable criteria for establishing whether a DSM-IV-TR 
disorder occurred. I established that there were provable and diagnosable injuries, 
primarily posttraumatic stress disorder and comorbid depression. Based upon these 
diagnostic signs, it is more probable than not, that exposing the plaintiff's identity to the 
public is not a trivial concern or one without substantial clinical repercussions. I believe 
that most child, adolescent and adult psychiatrists would share the opinion that additional 
psychiatric injury will result from such exposure. 
20. However, consider for the sake of argument, that my diagnostic conclusions are 
incorrect, notwithstanding having fulfilled standard psychiatric evaluation procedures of 
taking a history from multiple sources, videotaping and transcribing my initial interview, 
and reviewing available medical and legal documents. Even if this was the case, and my 
diagnostic conclusions were faulty, I believe that multiple experts, even those who may 
now propose publication of the victims' names, would still come to a conclusion that the 
plaintiff's suffered sexual abuse, and in some cases, multiple acts of ongoing abuse, at the 
hands of Jeffery Epstein. Even without developing a subsequent disorder, there is much 
clinical evidence and scientific literature showing likelihood of substantial psychiatric 
harm to these sexually abused plaintiffs. 
21. To form these conclusions, I have used my extensive experience in forming these 
opinions. That experience is both as a treating child psychiatrist and separately as a 
forensic psychiatrist. I have treated hundreds of minor patients, as well as additionally 
evaluated hundreds of children and adolescents who have suffered sexual abuse. I have 
made long term followups of many of the children and have treated many adults who 
have been molested as adolescents. It is my opinion, with a reasonably high degree of 
medical certainty that the defense motion to allow public disclosure of the plaintiffs' 
identities is clinically and ethically a wrongful plan. The act of revealing their identities 
against their wishes places the plaintiffs at risk, in the best of circumstances, of suffering 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 52-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 5 of 5
an aggravation of existing diagnostic concerns. It is more probable than not that releasing 
personal identities will foster an exacerbation and magnification of symptoms lending to 
increased risk of revictimization and retraumatization. 
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the 
foregoing statements are true and correct, and that this declaration was executed at San 
Francisco, California on June 4, 2009.

DECLARATION OF JANE DOE NO. 4 
I, 
, state as follows: 
I am the Plaintiff identified as Jane Doe No. 4 in this lawsuit. 
2. 
During the past week, three investigators working on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein 
contacted the office ofmy former employer, Florida Realty, on three separate occasions. 
3. 
During the contacts, the investigators asked my former employer personal 
questions about me, including whom I am dating and how they can contact my ex-boyfriend. 
The investigators obtained the name of my ex-boyfriend from my former employer and have 
been repeatedly contacting a former co-worker to get the telephone number of my ex-boyfriend. 
Once they obtained the number of my ex-boyfriend, they have repeatedly contact him, asking 
very personal questions about my relationship with him, as well as my current relationship, 
employment, and residence. 
4. 
None of the individuals whom the investigators have contacted or attempted to 
contact knew that I am a plaintiff in a childhood sexual abuse lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein, but 
now they are asking me questions about it.

I am worried that J ef:frey Epstein will continue to send investigators to speak with 
people I know who do not know that I am a Plaintiff in this lawsuit. I am concerned that the 
investigators will ask these people very personal questions about my life and disclose that I am a 
Plaintiff in a sexual abuse lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein. It could cause problems in my social 
circle and with my future employment and educational opportunities if people fmd out that I am 
a plaintiff in a childhood sexual abuse suit against Jeffrey Epstein. 
I declare under penalty of perjury the foregoing to be true and correct.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES’  2- 7 MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE  
1. 
Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 are proceeding with a Jane Doe pseudonym as this case 
involves facts of the utmost intimacy and there is a genuine risk of psychological harm if their 
identities are disclosed.  
ORDER AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW  
Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-7 (“Plaintiffs” or individually, “Plaintiff”), by and through 
undersigned counsel, hereby file Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order, pursuant to 
S.D.Fla.L.R. 7.1, and state as follows:   
See Exhibit “A” (Declaration of Gilbert Kliman, M.D.) (See also DE 
144, Jane Does’ 2-7 Response to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Identity, et al.).  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 52   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 3 of 8

2. 
Despite the obvious need for Plaintiffs to have their identities protected, 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein has employed investigators who have made repeated contacts with ex-
boyfriends, former employers, and others who know nothing of the underlying facts of the case.  
These investigators have contacted such nonparties asking them for extensive personal 
information about a Plaintiff, such as names and contact information of former boyfriends and 
other friends and acquaintances in the Plaintiff’s community.    
3. 
The Defendant’s repeated contacts with these nonparties is harassing and 
designed to intimidate the Plaintiffs.  The purpose and intent of these contacts is to brand the 
Plaintiffs as alleged sexual abuse victims to their families, friends and communities.  
4. 
A Motion is pending in which this Court is being asked to determine whether and 
how Defendant may obtain discovery from nonparties. (DE 91, 144). Defendant’s investigative 
efforts improperly circumvent the issues in the pending Motion, and only serve to highlight the 
need for this Court to implement appropriate protective measures to prevent Defendant from 
harassing, intimidating, and intruding unnecessarily into the personal lives of the Plaintiffs. 
5. 
While it is not unusual for a defendant to use appropriate means to obtain records 
from former employers and others referenced in a plaintiff’s discovery responses, it is not 
customary for a defendant to retain private investigators to make personal contact with these 
individuals.  Indeed, this practice is particularly inappropriate in a sexual abuse case where these 
nonparties are unaware of the underlying abuse.  Plaintiffs have a well-grounded fear that the 
investigators will use the opportunity of their contacts with these nonparties to “out” the 
Plaintiffs’ as alleged childhood sexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein. (See Kliman Decl., Exh. 
“A” hereto).  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 52   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 4 of 8
--

6. 
As an example of the investigators’ intimidation tactics, three of Defendant’s 
investigators recently called the former employer of Jane Doe 4 on repeated occasions over a 
two-day period, asking personal questions about her, including the name and telephone number 
of her ex-boyfriend.  See
7. 
Similarly, one of Defendant’s investigators contacted the former employer of Jane 
Doe 6.  
 Exhibit “B”, Declaration of Jane Doe 4. 
See
8. 
There is no basis for Defendant or his multiple investigators to make repeated 
personal contacts with former employers and ex-boyfriends to ask personal questions about a 
Plaintiff.  It is apparent that these contacts are not designed to obtain relevant information, but 
rather are intended to intimidate the Plaintiffs and to reveal that they are childhood sexual abuse 
victims. 
 Exhibit “C”, Declaration of Jane Doe 6. 
9. 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs request the entry of a protective order that would prevent 
Defendant, his attorneys and investigators from making ex parte contacts concerning this 
litigation with nonparties who have no knowledge that a Plaintiff was a childhood sexual abuse 
victim of Jeffrey Epstein.   
10. 
This Court has discretion to enter a protective order designed to protect a party 
from, among other things, annoyance or embarrassment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c).  As set forth above, 
given the investigators’ conduct, a protective order is appropriate to prevent unnecessary 
intrusion into the Plaintiffs’ personal lives and divulgation of Plaintiffs in their communities as 
childhood sexual abuse victims.  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7, respectfully request that this Court grant 
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Protective Order, as follows: (i) order Defendant, his attorneys and 
investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties identified in plaintiffs’ discovery 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 52   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009   Page 5 of 8

responses, such as, for example, former employers; (ii) order Defendant, his attorneys and 
investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties found during the course of 
discovery or investigation who know the Plaintiff or live in her community, such as, for example, 
current and former boyfriends and family friends of the Plaintiffs; (iii) order Defendant, his 
attorneys and investigators to cease making ex parte contacts with nonparties who otherwise 
know one of the Plaintiffs personally but who are unaware that she is an alleged victim of 
childhood sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein; and (iv) grant all such other relief this Court deems 
just and appropriate.    
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULE 7.1.A.3 
Undersigned counsel has conferred with Defendant’s counsel in a good faith effort to 
resolve the issues raised in this motion, and has been unable to do so, as Defendant’s counsel has 
advised that Defendant opposes this motion.

NO. 09-80469-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON
JANE DOE II,
Plaintiff,
v.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN and
SARAH KELLEN,
Defendants.
_______________________________________/
ORDER AND OPINION
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendant Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiff’s Complaint (DE 13), filed May 6, 2009.  The motion is now fully briefed and ripe for
review.  The Court has carefully reviewed the motion, amended response, and reply, and is
otherwise fully advised in the premises. 
Background
On March 24, 2009, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and
Sarah Kellen, alleging a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2255. (DE 1).  The facts, as alleged in the
Complaint, are as follows:  
During the events giving rise to this claim, Plaintiff was a minor but has now reached
majority.  Compl. ¶ 4.  Defendant Epstein has a history of enticing young women, who are
minors, and soliciting them to engage in prostitution for his own sexual gratification.  Compl. ¶
8.  Epstein conspired with two persons he employed for this purpose, Haley Robson and
Defendant Sarah Kellen, and others, to solicit young women of the type Epstein preferred,
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2009   Page 1 of 9

blonde, attractive in appearance, and younger than 18 years of age, to provide sexual gratification
for him by engaging in acts of prostitution.  Compl. ¶ 9.   Defendants Epstein and Kellen entered
into a criminal conspiracy to solicit young women for acts of prostitution, including Plaintiff, in
Palm Beach County.  Compl. ¶ 10.  
From about June, 2003 until about February 2005, Defendants persuaded, induced, or
enticed Plaintiff to come to Epstein’s home and provide Epstein with “massages.”  The
“massages” escalated into sexual encounters between Epstein and Plaintiff designed to fulfill his
unnatural sexual desires for young women or even younger girls who were minors.  Compl. ¶ 11. 
These acts included Epstein’s request that he wanted the encounter to be like a “porn video.” 
Compl. ¶ 11.  Epstein would script lines for Plaintiff to say, including calling out his name and
requesting that he perform a certain sexual act “harder,” while he touched Plaintiff’s vagina with
a vibrator or with his fingers; alternatively he would masturbate in the presence of Plaintiff after
demanding her to disrobe and walk in from of him in provocative sexual poses.  Compl. ¶ 11. 
Epstein would pay Plaintiff a fee of $200 on each occasion after he ejaculated while masturbating
in the presence of Plaintiff.  Compl. ¶ 11.  Epstein touched Plaintiff’s vagina, or penetrated
Plaintiff’s vagina, using his fingers and/or a vibrator on multiple occasions, during the time that
Plaintiff was a minor, causing personal injury to her.  Compl. ¶ 12.  
In violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), Defendants knowingly persuaded, induced, or enticed
Plaintiff to engage in acts of prostitution, when Plaintiff was under the age of 18.  Plaintiff can
document the following dates when the acts recurred based on payments received: 06/16/03,
07/02/03, 04/09/04, 06/07/04, 07/30/04, 08/30/04, 10/12/04, 10/30/04, and 11/09/04.   Compl. ¶
13.  In addition, Plaintiff believes that there were as many as 10 to 20 other occasions during this
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2009   Page 2 of 9

time frame that Epstein solicited and procured her to perform prostitution services, all during the
time that she was a minor.  Compl. ¶ 13.  
Epstein has made an agreement with the United States Attorney’s Office to not contest
liability for claims brought exclusively pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, in exchange for avoiding
federal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), which provides a sentence of 10 years for each
violation of the law. Compl. ¶ 15. 
Defendant argues in his motion that the case should be dismissed because (1) Plaintiff
previously filed a case in state court based on the same set of facts as in this case; (2)  Plaintiff
can seek damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 of a minimum of $50,000 per victim; (3) Plaintiff has
failed to allege a violation of the requisite predicate act as identified in 18 U.S.C. § 2255; and (4)
Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 2255. 
Plaintiff responds that the Court should deny the motion because she is entitled to pursue
separate state and federal claims in their respective courts, the damages issues are not appropriate
for a motion to dismiss, and the pleadings at issue provide Defendant with sufficient notice of the
underlying factual bases for the claims.
Standard of Review
In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a
court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most
favorable to the plaintiff.  See Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007).  To satisfy the
pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, a complaint must contain a short and
plain statement showing an entitlement to relief, and the statement must “give the defendant fair
notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Swierkiewicz v.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2009   Page 3 of 9

Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512 (2002) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8); see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964 (2007); Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 346 (2005). 
This is a liberal pleading requirement, one that does not require a plaintiff to plead with
particularity every element of a cause of action. Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for Choice, Inc., 253
F.3d 678, 683 (11th Cir. 2001).  Instead, the complaint need only “contain either direct or
inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under
some viable legal theory.” Id. (internal citation and quotation omitted).  “A complaint need not
specify in detail the precise theory giving rise to recovery.  All that is required is that the
defendant be on notice as to the claim being asserted against him and the grounds on which it
rests.”  Sams v. United Food and Comm'l Workers Int'l Union, 866 F.2d 1380, 1384 (11th Cir.
1989).
“While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed
factual allegations, [ ] a plaintiff's obligation to provide the ‘grounds' of his ‘entitlement to relief’
requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause
of action will not do.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65 (citations omitted). 
“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the
assumption that all of the complaint's allegations are true.”  Id. at 1965.  Plaintiff must plead
enough facts to state a plausible basis for the claim.  Id.
Discussion
First, Defendant argues in his motion that this case should be dismissed because Plaintiff
previously filed a case in state court based on the same set of facts as in this case.  Plaintiff filed
the instant case alleging violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and filed the state case alleging sexual
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2009   Page 4 of 9

battery and civil conspiracy.  Defendant argues that the state court would have concurrent
jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s 18 U.S.C. § 2255 claim and that exceptional circumstances exist
requiring dismissal of the federal action in favor of the first filed state action. See American
Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida v. First State Ins. Co., 891 F.2d 882 (11  Cir. 1990).
th
The exceptional circumstances test is set forth in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v.
Mercury Constr., 460 U.S. 1 (1983).  As the Eleventh Circuit explained in American Bankers
Ins., 891 F.2d at 884: 
In Colorado River [Water Conserv. Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976)] 
the Supreme Court announced that a federal court may dismiss an action because
of parallel state court litigation only under “exceptional” circumstances. 424 U.S.
at 818. Indeed, “[o]nly the clearest of justifications will warrant dismissal.” Id. at
819.  The Court set out four factors to be considered in determining whether
dismissal on the grounds of exceptional circumstances is appropriate: (1) whether
one of the courts has assumed jurisdiction over property; (2) the inconvenience of
the federal forum; (3) the potential for piecemeal litigation; and (4) the order in
which the forums obtained jurisdiction. Id. at 818.  In Moses H. Cone, the Court
reaffirmed its view that only exceptional circumstances will warrant dismissal of
federal cases in favor of a concurrent state suit. 460 U.S. at 14.  The Moses H.
Cone decision also repeated the four Colorado River factors and added two more:
(5) whether state or federal law will be applied; and (6) the adequacy of the state
court to protect the parties' rights. Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 23, 26; Noonan
South [Inc. v. County of Volusia, 841 F.2d 380, 381 (11th Cir. 1988)].  The test
for determining when exceptional circumstances exist, therefore, involves the
careful balancing of six factors. The weight to be given any one factor may vary
greatly depending on the case; however, the balance is “heavily weighted” in
favor of the federal court exercising jurisdiction. Id. at 16.
Here, the first factor is inapplicable because neither the federal court nor the state court
has assumed jurisdiction over any property.  The second factor, the inconvenience of the federal
forum, focuses primarily on the “physical proximity of the federal forum to the evidence and
witnesses.”  American Bankers Ins., 891 F.2d at 885, quoting Evanston Insurance Co. v. Jimco,
Inc., 844 F.2d 1185, 1191 (5th Cir. 1988).  This factor does not weigh in favor of dismissal of the
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2009   Page 5 of 9

state court proceeding.
The focus of the third factor is avoiding piecemeal litigation.  Plaintiff has brought claims
under federal law in the federal court action and under state law in the state court action.  The
fact that the state court may have concurrent jurisdiction over an 18 U.S.C. § 2255 claim, and the
fact that Plaintiff could have chosen to bring her 18 U.S.C. § 2255 claim as part of her state court
action do not preclude her from filing a claim in federal court.  Although many of the same facts
are involved in both cases, Plaintiff has brought different causes of action in each forum and has
not brought any federal claims in her state court case.  By litigating cases involving many of the
same facts simultaneously in both federal and state court, Plaintiff risks the potential application
of res judicata principles to claims in the forum which is the last to decide the case. See Jang v.
United Technologies Corp., 206 F.3d 1147 (11  Cir. 2000) (plaintiff may not split causes of
th
action to bring state claims in one suit and then file a second suit with federal causes of action);
Aquatherm Industries, Inc. v. Florida Power & Light Co., 84 F.3d 1388 (11  Cir. 1996) (holding
th
that a Federal Lanham Act claim was barred in federal court after the plaintiff elected to bring
only its state law claims in the initial state court litigation where both state and federal claims
relied upon the same essential facts); Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153 (1979)
(explaining that the purpose of the doctrine is to protect an adverse party “from the expense and
vexation attending multiple lawsuits [and] conserves judicial resources.”).  The presence of that
risk, which Plaintiff has apparently chosen to take, does not preclude Plaintiff from proceeding in
both fora on the separate claims.  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2009   Page 6 of 9

The fourth factor, the order in which jurisdiction was obtained, “should not be measured
exclusively by which complaint was filed first, but rather in terms of how much progress has
been made in the two actions.” American Bankers Ins., 891 F.2d at 885, quoting Moses H. Cone,
460 U.S. at 21.  Here, the state action was filed first and Defendant Epstein has responded to the
complaint in both cases.  Even assuming that the state court litigation has progressed further than
the federal litigation, this factor does not weigh heavily in favor of dismissal, considering the
overall analysis of the other five factors.   
The fifth factor, whether federal or state law will be applied, does not point toward
dismissal, as the federal case raises only federal causes of action.  Finally, the sixth factor,  the
adequacy of the state court to protect the parties’ rights, is in equipoise.  There is no reason to
defer to the state court pursuant to this factor.  
“A federal court cannot properly decline to exercise its statutory jurisdiction, however,
simply because judicial economy might be served by deferring to a state court.  Federal courts
have a ‘virtually unflagging obligation’ to exercise the jurisdiction given them.”  American
Bankers Ins., 891 F.2d  at 886., quoting Colorado River Water Conserv. Dist. v. United States,
424 U.S. 800, 816 (1976).  This is especially true here because this case asserts a federal cause of
action and the state case does not.  Defendant has failed to demonstrate that “exceptional
circumstances” require dismissal of this case in deference to the pending state court proceeding. 
American Bankers Ins., 891 F.2d  at 886. 
Defendant also contends that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege a violation of the
requisite predicate act as identified in 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  The Complaint alleges a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 2422(b), which is one of the statutes listed in § 2255 as a basis for liability under that
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2009   Page 7 of 9

  Defendant also contends that an alleged victim of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2255 is
only entitled to one award of the statutory minimum amount of damages, regardless of the
number of incidents or acts that took place which constituted  violations of the act.  Because
Plaintiff has only asserted one cause of action in her complaint, it is not necessary to decide this
question at the present time because the issue is one of damages and not whether a cause of
action has been stated.  The Court will reserve ruling on this question and decide it when it is
presented in a more appropriate context either in this case or in any of the related cases.
statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a).  Section 2422(b) states as follows:
b) Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign
commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United
States knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has
not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for
which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so,
shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years or for life.
The Complaint sufficiently alleges that Defendant Epstein knowingly persuaded, induced, or
enticed Plaintiff to engage in acts of prostitution, when Plaintiff was under the age of 18. Comp.
¶ 4, 11, 12, 13.  However, the Complaint does not allege that Defendant used the mail or any
facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce.  Plaintiff asserts in her response that the
telephone system is clearly a facility of interstate commerce and states that she is prepared to
allege that Defendants Epstein and Kellen used an instrumentality of interstate commerce,
namely Kellen’s cellular telephone, to solicit Plaintiff.  Plaintiff shall be permitted to amend her
complaint accordingly.  
Lastly, Epstein asserts that Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for conspiracy to
violate 18 U.S.C. § 2255 for the same reason she failed to state a cause of action under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2255 against Epstein individually.  As explained supra, Plaintiff shall be permitted to amend
her complaint to allege that Defendant used the mail or any facility or means of interstate or
foreign commerce to violate § 2255.  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2009   Page 8 of 9

Based on the foregoing, it is hereby 
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:  Defendant Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion to
Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint (DE 13) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART as
follows:  Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed without prejudice to amend to allege that Defendant(s)
used the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to violate 18 U.S.C. §
2255.  Except as to the question of whether Plaintiff is limited to one award of statutory
damages, on which the Court reserves ruling, the remainder of Defendant’s Motion is denied.  
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 11  day of August, 2009.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
1.
Plaintiff, JANE DOE II, hereby sues JEFFREY EPSTEIN and SARAH
KELLEN, and states:
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
2.
This is an action for damages in excess of $75,000, exclusive of interest, costs
and attorney’s fees. 
3.
Venue is proper in this Court as all acts occurred in Palm Beach County and
all parties reside and/or do business herein.
PARTIES
4.
Ms. DOE II is a natural person residing in Palm Beach County, Florida. During
the events giving rise to this claim, she was a minor but has now reached majority. She files
this suit under a pseudonym to protect her privacy because the acts alleged occurred while
she was a minor.  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 60   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/02/2009   Page 1 of 6

5.
Defendant EPSTEIN is a natural person, who is an adult, and who resides
and/or does business in Palm Beach County, Florida, and who committed the acts alleged
within the jurisdiction of Palm Beach County, Florida, within the boundaries of the United
States District Court in and for the Southern District of Florida. Defendant KELLEN is a
natural person, who is an adult, believed to reside in the State of New York, but who
committed some of the acts alleged within the jurisdiction of Palm Beach County, Florida,
within the boundaries of the United States District Court in and for the Southern District of
Florida. 
6.
Defendant EPSTEIN is believed to now reside in Palm Beach, Florida but
claims to be a resident of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
FACTS
7.
Defendant EPSTEIN was, at all times relevant to this action, a part time
resident of Palm Beach County, Florida. All acts complained of herein occurred at his estate
residence in the Town of Palm Beach, Florida.
8.
Defendant EPSTEIN has a history of enticing young women, who are minors
(under 18 years of age), and soliciting them to engage in prostitution for his own sexual
gratification.
9.
Defendant EPSTEIN, in agreement with two (2) persons he employed for this
purpose, HALEY ROBSON and Defendant KELLEN, conspired together, and/or with
unnamed others, to solicit young women of the type Defendant EPSTEIN preferred, blonde,
attractive in appearance, and younger than 18 years of age, to provide sexual gratification
for him by engaging in acts of prostitution.
10.
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN entered into a criminal conspiracy to 
solicit young women for acts of prostitution, including the Plaintiff.    
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 60   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/02/2009   Page 2 of 6

11.
From about June, 2003 until on or about February, 2005, Defendants
EPSTEIN and KELLEN persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff to come to Defendant
EPSTEIN’s home and provide Defendant EPSTEIN with “massages” which escalated into
sexual encounters between Defendant EPSTEIN and the Plaintiff designed to fulfill his
unnatural sexual desires for young women or even younger girls who were minors. These
acts included Defendant EPSTEIN’s  request that  he wanted the encounter to be like a
“porn video.” Defendant EPSTEIN would script lines for the Plaintiff to say, including calling
out his name and requesting that he perform a certain sexual act “harder,”while he touched
the Plaintiff’s vagina  with a vibrator or with his fingers; alternately, he would masturbate in
the presence of the Plaintiff after demanding her to disrobe and walk in front of him in
provocative sexual poses. Defendant EPSTEIN would pay the Plaintiff a fee of $200 on
each occasion  after he ejaculated while masturbating in the presence of the Plaintiff. 
12.
Defendant EPSTEIN touched Plaintiff’s vagina, or penetrated Plaintiff’s
vagina, using his fingers and/or a vibrator on multiple occasions, during the time that
Plaintiff was a minor, causing personal injury to her.         
13.
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 and in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2422(b)
Defendants EPSTEIN and KELLEN knowingly persuaded, induced, or enticed the Plaintiff
to engage in acts of prostitution, when the Plaintiff was under the age of 18, approximately
on or about the following dates that Plaintiff can document based on payments received:
6/16/03, 7/2/03, 4/9/04, 6/7/04, 7/30/04, 8/30/04, 10/9/04, 10/12/04, 10/30/04 and 11/9/04.
In addition, Plaintiff believes that there were as many as 10 to 20 other additional occasions
during this time frame that Defendant EPSTEIN solicited her and procured her to perform
prostitution services, all during the time that she was a minor.  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 60   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/02/2009   Page 3 of 6

14.    Defendants’ manner of persuasion, inducement and/or enticement of the
Plaintiff to commit acts of prostitution was  knowing and wilful. Defendants in committing the
above offenses did use a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knowingly
persuade, induce or entice Doe II and other minor females to engage in prostitution, and/or
a commercial sex act, and/or to commit a lewd or lascivious act and/or a sexual battery in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422 (b).  The facility or means of
interstate and/or foreign commerce includes but is not limited to: telephone and cell phone
communications between Defendants, wherein Defendant EPSTEIN would solicit the
Plaintiff by and through Defendant KELLEN, who would, after speaking by telephone and
cell phone with Defendant EPSTEIN, solicit the Plaintiff by telephone and cell phone.

in the acts alleged, and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to 
be reduced accordingly. 
2. As to the claim, Plaintiff actually consented to and participated in conduct similar 
and/or identical to the acts alleged with other persons which were the sole or 
contributing cause of Plaintiff's alleged damages. 
3. As to Plaintiff's claim, Plaintiff impliedly consented to the acts alleged by not 
objecting, and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be 
reduced accordingly.

Page 6 
4. As to Plaintiff's claim, Defendant reasonably believed or was told that the Plaintiff 
had attained the age of 18 years old at the time of the alleged acts. 
5. As to Plaintiff's claim, Plaintiff's claims are barred as she said she was 18 years 
or older at the time. 
6. As to Plaintiff's claim, Plaintiff's alleged damages were caused in whole or part 
by events and/or circumstances completely unrelated to the incident(s) alleged in the 
complaint. 
7. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
8. Plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action as she does not and can not show a 
violation of a predicate act under the applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005) -the 
version in effect prior to the 2006 amendment, eff. Jul. 27, 2006. 
9. As to Plaintiff's §2255 claim, the version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect at the time 
of the alleged conduct applies, and, thus, the presumptive minimum damages amount 
should Plaintiff prove the elements of such claim is $50,000, and not subject to any 
multiplier. 
10. As to Plaintiff's §2255 claim, Plaintiff is entitled to only a single recovery of her 
actual damages. 
Should Plaintiff prove actual damages in an amount less than 
$50,000, the applicable statutory minimum, she is entitled to a single recovery of 
$50,000, regardless of the number of acts. Allowing a multiplication of the damages 
recoverable would be in violation of the prohibition against the recovery of duplicative 
damages.

Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 7 
11.As to Plaintiff's §2255 claim, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, effective July 27, 2006, would be in violation of the legal axiom against 
retroactive application of an amended statute, and also in violation of such constitutional 
principles, including but not limited to, the "Ex Post Facto" Clause, U.S. Const. Article I, 
§9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1, and procedural and substantive due process, U.S. Const. 14th 
Amend., 5th Amend. The statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct applies. 
12.As to Plaintiff's §2255 claim, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, effective July 27, 2006, is prohibited pursuant to the vagueness doctrine and the 
Rule of Lenity. A criminal statute is required to give " 'fair warning ... in language that 
the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is 
passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.' " United 
States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259,265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quoting 
McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931)) 
(omission in original). The "three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement" 
are: (1) the vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of a statute which either forbids or 
requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must 
necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application; (2) the canon of strict 
construction of criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving 
ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered; (3) due 
process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct 
that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its 
scope.

Jane Doe II v. Epstein, et al. 
Page 8 
13. The applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 creates a cause of action on behalf of 
a "minor." Plaintiff had attained the age of majority at the time of filing this action, and 
accordingly, her cause of action is barred. 
14.Application of the 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 2006, is in 
violation of the constitutional principles of due process, the "Ex Post Facto" clause, and 
the Rule of Lenity, in that in amending the term "minor" to "person" as to those who may 
bring a cause of action impermissibly and unconstitutionally broadened the scope of 
persons able to bring a §2255 claim. 
15. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment 
under the U.S. Constitution, and thus Plaintiff's claim thereunder is barred. 
16. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the constitutional guarantees of procedural and 
substantive due process. Procedural due process guarantees that a person will not be 
deprived of life, liberty or property without notice and opportunity to be heard. 
Substantive due process protects fundamental rights. Accordingly, Plaintiff's cause of 
action thereunder is barred. 
WHEREFORE Defendant requests that this Court deny the relief sought by Plaintiff.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES
1.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff actually consented to and was a willing participant in the acts
alleged, and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be reduced accordingly.
2.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff actually consented to and participated in conduct similar
and/or identical to the acts alleged with other persons which were the sole or contributing cause of
Plaintiff’s alleged damages.
3.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff impliedly consented to the acts alleged by not objecting, and
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 62   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2009   Page 5 of 9

therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be reduced accordingly.
4.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Defendant reasonably believed or was told that the Plaintiff had
attained the age of 18 years old at the time of the alleged acts.
5.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff’s claims are barred as she said she was 18 years or older at
the time.
6.
As to Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff’s alleged damages were caused in whole or part by events
and/or circumstances completely unrelated to the incident(s) alleged in the complaint. 
7.
Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
8.
Plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action as she does not and can not show a violation of
a predicate act under the applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005) – the version in effect prior
to the 2006 amendment, effective July 27, 2006.
9.
As to Plaintiff’s §2255 claim, the version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect at the time of the
alleged conduct applies, and, thus, the presumptive minimum damages amount should Plaintiff prove
the elements of such claim is $50,000, and not subject to any multiplier.
10.  As to Plaintiff’s §2255 claim, Plaintiff is entitled to only a single recovery of her actual
damages.  Should Plaintiff prove actual damages in an amount less than $50,000, the applicable
statutory minimum, she is entitled to a single recovery of $50,000, regardless of the number of acts.
Allowing a multiplication of the damages recoverable would be in violation of the prohibition against
the recovery of duplicative damages.
11. As to Plaintiff’s §2255 claim, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255,
effective July 27, 2006, would be in violation of the legal axiom against retroactive application of an
amended statute, and also in violation of such constitutional principles, including but not limited to,
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 62   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2009   Page 6 of 9

the “Ex Post Facto” Clause, U.S. Const. Article I, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1,  and procedural and substantive
due process, U.S. Const. 14  Amend., 5  Amend.  The statute in effect during the time of the alleged
th
th
conduct applies.
12. As to Plaintiff’s §2255 claim, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255,
effective July 27, 2006, is prohibited pursuant to the vagueness doctrine and the Rule of Lenity.  A
criminal statute is required to give “ ‘fair warning ... in language that the common world will
understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far
as possible the line should be clear.’ “ United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137
L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quoting McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816
(1931)) (omission in original).  The “three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement” are:
(1) the vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of
an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and
differ as to its application; (2) the canon of strict construction of criminal statutes, or rule of lenity,
ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct
clearly covered; (3) due process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute
to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its
scope.
13. The applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 creates a cause of action on behalf of a “minor.”
Plaintiff had attained the age of majority at the time of filing this action, and accordingly, her cause
of action is barred.
14. Application of the 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 2006, is in violation of the
constitutional principles of due process, the “Ex Post Facto” clause, and the Rule of Lenity, in that
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 62   Entered on FLSD Docket 10/21/2009   Page 7 of 9

in amending the term “minor” to “person” as to those who may bring a cause of action impermissibly
and unconstitutionally broadened the scope of persons able to bring a §2255 claim.
15.  18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14  Amendment under the U.S.
th
Constitution, and thus Plaintiff’s claim thereunder is barred.
16.   18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the constitutional guarantees of procedural and substantive due
process.  Procedural due process guarantees that a person will not be deprived of life, liberty or
property without notice and opportunity to be heard.  Substantive due process protects fundamental
rights.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s cause of action thereunder is barred.
WHEREFORE Defendant requests that this Court deny the relief sought by Plaintiff.

THIRD PARTY WITNESS, IGOR ZINOVIEW'S, 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND 
INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LA ,v 
Third Paiiy Witness, Igor Zinoview's, ("Mr. Zinoview") by and through his 
undersigned attorney, moves this Court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) for a protective 
order regarding his deposition and as grounds therefore would state: 
1. 
As reflected on the affidavit of Igor Zinoview, attached as Exhibit A, he 
works for Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Mr. Epstein") as a driver and bodyguard. He did 
not know Mr. Epstein before November of 2005. He first became employed by Mr. 
Epstein in November of 2005. 
2. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview would testify as set forth on his affidavit, that 
at no time has he discussed with Mr. Epstein any issues involving Mr. Epstein's criminal 
case nor any of the cases or issues involved with civil plaintiffs. 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 69   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 2 of 26
3. 
In many of the depositions, counsel for L.M. and E.W., has asked them as 
witnesses to assume ce1iain facts about which they have no knowledge, and he then asks 
their opinions about certain facts. See Exhibit B ~Epstein's Motion for Protective Order 
to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions. 
4. 
There is no information which Mr. Zinoview has relating to the facts and 
circumstances surrounding any of the pending civil cases, in that none of their allegations 
directed to Mr. Epstein extend beyond September of 2005. 
Therefore whatever 
information Mr. Zinoview may have, postdates that time. 
5. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order (DE #377), "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, it 
is not without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 
1570 (11th Cir. 1992). . .. Cou1is have long held that ' [ w]hile the standard of relevancy 
[in discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear ge1111ane 
on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food & 
Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) (string 
cite omitted)." 
6. 
Rule 26(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that, "[a] party or 
any person from whomn discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court 
where the action is pending.... The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect 
a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or 
expense, including one or more of the following: (A) forbidding the disclosure or 
discovery;". 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 69   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 3 of 26
7. 
As set forth in his affidavit, Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action. Accordingly, the

JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR PALM 
BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
____________ ____;/ 
EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER TO 
PROHIBIT INAPPROPRIATE DEPOSITION QUESTIONS 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("Epstein"), pursuant to Rule 1.280(c), Florida 
Rules of Civil Procedure, moves for a protective order to prohibit argumentative, 
harassing and inappropriate questions in depositions, and states: 
1. 
At numerous depositions, Plaintiff's counsel has repeatedly asked 
argumentative and harassing questions that are irrelevant and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
2. 
In particular, Plc;iintiff's counsel has asked questions that improperly 
sought to illicit lay opinions from fact witnesses, asked questions regarding witnesses' 
feelings towards Mr. Epstein and their beliefs regarding media reports of this case, 
asked whether they would leave their children with Mr. Epstein and asked whether they 
would go back to work for Mr. Epstein assuming the media reports were accurate, 
among other things. 
These questions and the responses thereto will never be 
admissible. 
They are argumentative, irrelevant and seek speculative answers and 
inadmissible lay opinions.

LM v, Egstein 
Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMBAB 
Epstein's Motion for Protective Order to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions 
Page 2 of 9 
3. 
For example, in the deposition of Larry Visoski, one of Mr. Epstein's pilots, 
Plaintiff's counsel asked the following questions seeking to obtain Mr. Visoski's beliefs 
and opinions on Plaintiff's allegations: 
Q. 
All right. 
When you read in the newspapers 
the 
allegations that Mr. Epstein was involved with 
numerous 
underage girls for sexual reasons, were you surprised? 
A. I didn't believe it. 
Q. Do you believe it today? 
A. I don't believe it. 
Q. You don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was involved with 
underage girls in a sexual way? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: You're asking for my opinion, and I don't 
think my opinion is relevant in that matter. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I think it's relevant. Can you just tell me whether today 
you believe that Jeffrey Epstein has engag.ed in sex with 
underage girls? 
• 
• 
• 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation, irrelevant, always. 
THE WITNESS: It's irrelevant. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. I need an answer. 
A. I don't believe he had sex with underage women. 
Q. Or engaged in any· sexual acts with underage women? 
MR. CRITTON: Form.

Page 3 of 9 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
You think that this ls just a story that a bunch of 
underage women have made up? 
A. 
Speculatlon. 
* * * * 
Q. 
Then we'll handle the question this way: If you were to 
believe based on information and evidence that Mr. Epstein 
engaged in sex or some form of sex acts with people of the 
age range of 12, 13, 14, 15 years old, would you continue 
your employment with Mr. Epstein? 
MR. CRITTON: Form; speculation. 
THE 
WITNESS: 
I would 
certainly 
speculating 
and I have to discuss it with my wife long and hard. I don't 
think I could give you a correct and honest answer at this 
time. 
See Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Visokski at 66-67; 181-82 (attached as 
composite Exhibit A). Other examples of similar improper questions are included in 
Exhibit A. 
4. 
Not only do these questions seek improper lay opinions, Plaintiff's counsel 
asked Mr. Visoski his belief as to the truth of hearsay newspaper articles. 
The 
foregoing questions are obviously irrelevant, argumentative and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
5. 
Moreover, whether Mr. Visoski would continue working for Mr. Epstein if 
Plaintiff's allegations are true has absolutely no relevance to any claim or defense in this 
case. 
The questions are simply improper and meant to harass and embarrass the

witness. 
6. 
Mr. Visoski was questioned for over four hou'.s and much of the time was 
wasted on irrelevant and harassing questions. 
7. 
Plaintiff's counsel asked similar questions at the deposition of Larry 
Eugene Morrison, another one of Mr. Epstein's pilots: 
Q. 
Certainly you've read certain newspaper articles about 
the allegations, police reports, otherwise, the allegations that 
occurred or have been alleged to have occurred at his Palm 
Beach mansion, correct? 
A. 
Uh-huh. 
Q. 
Correct? 
A. 
Correct. 
Q. 
Given the nature of those allegations, would you leave 
your daughter of 17, 16, 15 years old with Mr. Epstein 
alone? 
MR PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. 
* * * * 
Q. 
And despite pleading guilty to procuring underage girls 
for the purposes of sex, you still feel comfortable leaving a 
13, 14, 15-year-old girl around him? 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
A. 
Yes. I mean, with my daughter, yes. I don't know how 
he behaves around anybody else. 
I just know that the 
respect that he showed me, I feel safe with my daughter. 
Q. 
And have you read in detail the reports as to what 
happened at his house with the girls?

LM V. Epstein 
Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMBAB 
Epstein's Motion for Protective Order to Prohibit Inappropriate Deposition Questions 
Page 5 of 9 
A. 
Only --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
-- what's been in the newspapers and published. 
Q. 
If you read and hear testimony given - well, I can tell 
you now - testimony has been given in this case that what 
happens is: A 13 or 14 year old is led upstairs by herself, 
told to get naked, he lays down on his back, there is a brief 
massage before he turns over, exposes himself erect, 
masturbates while he tells this 13 or 14 year old to pinch his 
nipples as hard as she can while he inserts his fingers into 
their vagina and ejaculates all over them before saying, 
"Take your money and leave." 
MR. PIKE: Form. Move to strike. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Okay? Then, 
11You can continue to come back for $200 
every time or every girl you bring me within your age group 
and I get to do this again, I pay you $200 per person." If that 
is the testimony --
MR. PIKE: Form. 
Q. 
-- that what happens behind closed doors with him, do 
you still feel comfortable leaving a 13 or 14 year old in a 
room with Jeffrey Epstein? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
If that, in fact, is what actually happened, no. 
* * * * 
Q. 
[Would you] go back - considering what you've read and 
what you may or may not believe - would you go back to 
working for Jeffrey Epstein? 
MR. PIKE: Form. 
A. 
I can't say. I still work for him on a maintenance - to 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 69   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 13 of 26

Page 6 of9 
maintain the airplanes and stuff like that, so. 
§ee Excerpts of Deposition of Larry Eugene Morrison at 135-36; 175-76; 184 
(attached as composite Exhibit B). 
8. 
Again, whether Mr. Morrison would work for Mr. Epstein "considering what 
[he has] read and what [he] may or may not believe" (i.e. considering hearsay media 
accounts and inadmissible lay opinion) has no bearing on the instant case. 
9. 
ln addition, questions regarding whether Mr. Morrison would leave his 
children alone with Mr. Epstein could have only been meant to harass and embarrass 
Mr. Morrison. Nevertheless, Mr. Morrison testified that he would leave his children with 
Mr. Epstein. As Plaintiffs counsel was obviously not happy with the answer to this 
question, he proceeded to press Mr. Morrison with inflammatory statements until he got 
the answer he wanted. 
10. 
Plaintiff's counsel has also asked the same improper line of questions in 
other witnesses' depositions. 
11. 
The above-cited questions exceed the bounds of permissible discovery; 
they have absolutely no relevance to this case. Accordingly, the Court should enter a 
protective order prohibiting such questions and should sanction Plaintiff's counsel if 
such inappropriate questions are asked at future depositions. 
12. 
Regarding the scope of discovery, Judge Linnea Johnson noted in her 
October 28, 2009 Omnibus Order, 1 "[w]hile the scope of discovery is broad, lt is not 
The Omnibus Order (DE #377) was entered in the federal companion case Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, 
Case No. 08-CIV-80119 MARRNJOH NSON in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida.

without limits. Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, 959 F.2d 1566, 1570 (11th 
Cir. 1992). ... 
Courts have long held that '[w]hile the standard of relevancy [in 
discovery] is a liberal one, it is not so liberal as to allow a party to roam in the shadow 
zones of relevancy and to explore matter (sic) which does not presently appear 
germane on the theory that it might conceivably become so.' Food Lion, Inc. v. United 
Food & Commercial Workers Intern. Union, 103 F.3d 1007, 1012-13 (C.A. D.C. 1997) 
(string .cite omitted)." §ee also Capco Properties, LLC v. Monterry Gardens of Pinecrest 
Condo., 982 So. 2d 1211, (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (holding that discovery in civil cases must 
be relevant to the subject matter of the case and must be admissible or reasonably 
calculated to lead to admissible evidence); Morton Plant Hospital Ass'n, lnc. v. 
Shahbas, 960 So. 2d 820, 824 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007) (holding that ''discovery should be 
denied when it has been established that the information requested is neither relevant 
F 
to any pending claim or defense nor will it lead to the discovery of admissible evidence," 
citing Tanchel v. Shoemaker, 928 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006)). 
13. 
As illustrated above, the questions are simply not germane to any pending 
'--.. 
claim or defense nor will they lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Whether 
Mr. Visoski believes or disbelieves the media accounts of this case, or whether Mr. 
Morrison would leave his children with Mr. Epstein is not relevant and cannot 
conceivably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
14. 
The Court should curtail these inappropriate lines of questions and enter a 
protective order prohibiting them. 
15. 
Rule 1.280(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides the Court with 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 69   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/09/2009   Page 15 of 26
LM v. Epstein 
Case No, 502008CA028051 XXXXMBAB

the power to "make any order to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense that justice requires including 
... (4) that certain matter not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be 
limited to certain matters." 
16. 
Accordingly, Epstein requests the Court enter a protective order 
prohibiting Plaintiff's counsel from asking witnesses' questions regarding opinions and 
beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case and whether they would 
leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar nature, and limiting the scope 
to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters relevant to the claims and 
defenses in this case. See Shahbas, 960 So. 2d at 824. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, respectfully requests the Court 
enter a protective order prohibiting Plaintiffs counsel from asking witnesses' questions 
regarding opinions and beliefs regarding media articles and the allegations in this case 
and whether they would leave their children with Epstein or questions of a similar 
nature, and limiting the scope to the witnesses personal knowledge regarding matters 
relevant to the claims and defenses in this case and grant any additional relief the Court 
deems just and proper.

MR. EDWARDS: We're going to put something on

MR. REINHART: Do it at the end, after we get 
him - whatever you want. It's your show. 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. There were --1 don't 
even think Mr. Willits is aware of this. There was 
a subpoena duces tecum for this witness, as well as 
the previous witness, which was another pilot, Dave 
Rogers, and that duces teoum was to bring the 
flight logs related from 1998 through 2005. What 
was produced at the previous deposition were flight 
logs from 2002 through 2005, ancl now Mr. Reinhart 
has agreed to produce the remainder of the flight 
logs requested, those going from 1998 t11rough 2002. 
MR. REINHART; Correct. They're pilot logs, 
not night logs. There are other records we 
indicated are corporate records, and with those you 
have to deal with Mr. Critton. 
MR. CRITTON: However, with the proviso, too,

Q. All right. When you read in the newspapers 
the allegations that Mr. Epstein was involved with 
numerous underage girls for sexual reasons, were you 
surprised? 
A. I didn't believe it, 
Q. Do you believe it today? 
A. I don't believe it. 
Q, You don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was 
B 
involved with underage girls in a sexual way? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: You're asking for my opinion, 
and I don't think my opinion·ls relevant in that 
matter.

MR. CRITTON: It's argumentative. 
MR. EDWARDS: You're objecting to the form? 
MR. CRITTON: Yes. 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q, Is that something that you believe that a 
b1.1nch of women -- some of which know each other, some 
don't, some of which have been on the airplane and some 
which haven'! - made this up, that Jeffrey Epstein 
engaged In some sexual conduct with them? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: What I believe doesn't matter in

MR. REINHART: I'm going to instruct him not 
to answer. Move on. 
MR. EDWARDS: Is there a privilege that we're 
asserting? 
MR. REINHART: No, It's irrelevant. It's 
harassment and not likely to lead to discoverable 
evidence. 
'MR. EDWARDS: I'm going·to--put on the record 
right now that it is -- we are allowed discovery 
into a RICO count. We are also allowed discovery 
into the intent of Mr. Epstein In developing a 
criminal enterprise designed to sexually exploit 
and sexually abuse underage girls. We believe that 
in doing so, he associated intentionally with 
people of similar beliefs that sex with underage 
girls is okay, and that there have been rnany 
discussions with this witness, as well as many 
other witnesses with -- to Ins lire his protection 
from law enforcement that they not answer these 
specific questions. And thus, the opinions and 
beliefs of all of these witnesses that we are

REPLY TO ROTHSTEIN ROSENFELDT ADLER'S P.A.'S 
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S EMERGENCY MOTION FOR ORDER 
FOR THE PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE (DE 4051 
(AS TO JANE DOE v. EPSTEIN CASE NO.: 08-CIV- 80893) 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"), by and through his undersigned attorneys, 
hereby files his Reply to Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler P.A.' s ("RRA") Response to 
Defendant's Emergency Motion for Order for the Preservation of Evidence [DE 405], 
and states: 
1. 
It now appears that the Honorable Herbert Stettin ("Mr. Stettin") is the 
sole individual, as the Chief Restructuring Officer, in charge of RRA assets, including 
electronic and paper records. There also appears to be no objection to the entry of the 
preservation order consistent with his fiduciary/trustee duties for RRA, although certain 
documents may no longer exist within his possession. 
2. 
Par. 4 of the response reflects that some 40 plus boxes of documents were 
obtained by the Department of Justice from search warrants served on the offices of 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 70   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 2 of 5
RRA; "it is believed that the Department of Justice also sequestered about (13) boxes of 
documents related to this [Epstein] case." In fact there are three Epstein cases which 
have been brought by the RRA firm, one being in federal court, two in state court. Mr. 
Stettin confirms Defendant's belief that there are serious ethical and potentially criminal 
issues that may impact Plaintiffs' ability to pursue their cases. 
3. 
Unfortunately, time is critical with regard to this case in that there are 
deadlines to Disclose Experts and Exchange Reports by October 29, 2009 (but Plaintiff 
has not seen her expert, has no report and only made herself available for the Defendant's 
exam on November 13, 2009), deposition discovery deadline is November 28, 2009 and 
a calendar call of February 19, 2010 for the February 22, 2010 trial docket. While the 
undersigned understands that Mr. Stettin may be working expeditiously to deal with 
critical and pressing needs of stabilizing the firm, a delay of 45 days for his deposition 
(which has been set in the state court case in the 15th Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach 
County, State of Florida, L.M. v. Epstein, Case No. 502008CA028051XXXXMB AB, 
not the case sub-judice) will place his deposition sometime during the first 15 days of 
January, after every pre-trial deadline has expired. 
4. 
If in fact there has been inappropriate and/or illegal conduct associated 
with the prosecution of this case by RRA or any of its attorneys or by the Plaintff herself, 
which might result in sanctions, dismissal or other remedy, Defendant Epstein will be 
severely prejudiced. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant Epstein request that the court's preservation order be 
made permanent, which does not seem inconsistent with Mr. Stettin's position as 
expressed by his lawyers but deny the relief sought for delaying the deposition unless the 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 70   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/16/2009   Page 3 of 5
court is disposed to modify the current scheduling deadlines and trial date that exist in 
this case.

PLAINTIFF, CAROLYN M. ANDRIANO’S, RESPONSE TO THIRD PARTY WITNESS, 
IGOR ZINOVIEW’S, MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AND INCORPORATED 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, Carolyn M. Andriano, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby 
files her Response Third Party Witness, Igor Zinoview’s, Motion For Protective Order 
and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (D.E. 402), and in support thereof states as 
follows: 
1. 
Third party witness, Igor Zinoview, seeks to have this Court enter an order 
preventing his deposition from going forward at all, or, in the alternative, limiting the 
scope of permissible questioning during same.  Mr. Zinoview’s deposition is presently 
scheduled to be taken on December 18, 2009. 
2. 
Mr. Zinoview has been employed by Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” since November of 2005.  See Affidavit of Igor Zinoview 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 73   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 1 of 8

(D.E. 402) dated November 9, 2009.  Mr. Zinoview argues that his deposition should not 
go forward as scheduled because Defendant Epstein has never discussed nor 
attempted to discuss with him “any facts or information related to any legal matters in 
which he [Jeffrey Epstein] is involved.” Id.  From Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion springs 
the bold yet erroneous argument that “Mr. Zinoview cannot possibly have any 
knowledge or information that is presently germane to this action.” 
3. 
It should initially be noted that a “complete prohibition of a deposition is an 
extraordinary measure which should be resorted to only in rare occasions.” Jennings v. 
Family Management, 201 F.R.D. 272 (D.D.C. 2001); See also, Salter v. Upjohn Co., 
593 F.2d 649, 651 (5th Circ. 1979)(It is very unusual for trial court to prohibit the taking 
of a deposition altogether, and absent extraordinary circumstances, such order would 
likely be in error.); Inv. Properties Intern., Ltd. v. IOS, Ltd., 459 F.2d. 705, 708 (2d Circ. 
1972)(“an order to vacate a notice of taking deposition is generally regarded as both 
unusual and unfavorable . . . “).  Neither Mr. Zinoview’s conclusory affidavit nor his 
Motion provide anything even approaching the “extraordinary circumstances” necessary 
to justify the entry of order precluding his deposition from going forward at all. 
4. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview’s vague assertion that he and Defendant 
Epstein have never discussed any facts or information related to any legal matters that 
Mr. Epstein is involved in does not give rise to requisite “extraordinary circumstances” 
either. Detweiler Bros, Inc. v John Graham and Company, 412 F.Supp. 416 (E.D. Wash, 
1976)(Plaintiff could not properly seek to prohibit defendant from deposing plaintiff’s 
employee via a protective order on grounds that employee had no knowledge of matters 
at issue.) See also, 8 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. §2037, Wright and Miller(“A witness 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 73   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 2 of 8

ordinarily cannot escape examination by denying knowledge of any relevant facts, since 
the party seeking to take the deposition is entitled to test the witness’s lack of 
knowledge.”)  
5. 
The undersigned, as well as counsel for all of the other victims of Jeffrey 
Epstein, are entitled to question and challenge Mr. Zinoview on his purported lack of 
knowledge.  Mr. Zinoview and plaintiffs’ counsel very well might have a difference of 
opinion on what constitutes “facts and information related to any legal matters” in which 
Defendant Epstein is involved.  The victims of Jeffrey Epstein ought not to be forced to 
accept Mr. Zinoview’s opinion as to what constitutes “facts and information related to 
any legal matters” involving Jeffrey Epstein.  Instead, plaintiffs should be able to explore 
these relevant matters directly with Mr. Zinoview, rather than being forced to rely on his 
twenty seven (27) word claim of lacking any knowledge. 
6. 
Additionally, Mr. Zinoview worked for Defendant Epstein during portions of 
the Palm Beach Police Department’s months’ long investigation which spanned from 
March 15, 2005 through February 2006 into the illegal sexual contact committed by 
Defendant Epstein against these minor plaintiffs.  Accordingly, Mr. Zinoview certainly 
might have direct knowledge about what was going on in and around the Epstein 
residence during the time period in which he was employed by Defendant Epstein as his 
“driver, bodyguard, and trainer” while his employer was being investigated by law 
enforcement.  Given the Defendant’s voracious invocation of his Fifth Amendment 
privilege, the plaintiffs have consistently been denied the opportunity to seek any 
relevant information directly from Defendant Epstein himself.  Rather, plaintiffs have 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 73   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 3 of 8

been forced to build their cases against Mr. Epstein by other discovery methods, 
including deposing his employees who may have relevant information.  
7. 
Third party witness Igor Zinoview has failed to meet his very high burden 
of establishing “extraordinary circumstances.”  Mr. Zinoview has failed to demonstrate 
the “good cause” required by Rule 26(c) to protect a person from “annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” to overcome the liberal 
scope of permissible discovery.  The above proposed lines of inquiry of Mr. Zinoview 
are certainly reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  
Accordingly, to the extent that it seeks to preclude his deposition from going forward at 
all, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion should be denied 
8. 
Next, Mr. Zinoview also seeks to prevent questions being posed to him 
wherein he is first asked to “assume certain facts about which he has no knowledge,” 
and then be asked about his “opinions about certain facts.”  First, it remains to be seen 
exactly what facts about which Mr. Zinoview has no knowledge.  Second, Mr. Zinoview’s 
opinions and beliefs about the factual matters surrounding plaintiffs’ claims are relevant 
to exploring any potential bias and prejudice in favor of his employer and against 
Defendant Epstein’s victims.  For example, if Mr. Zinoview believes that these plaintiffs 
are simply inventing their claims against his employer that they were sexually victimized 
by Defendant Epstein while they were minor children, it very well might impact his 
impartiality as a witness.  Third, the undersigned has no present intention of engaging in 
this line of questioning unless the proverbial “door” has been opened by Mr. Zinoview 
first.  Lastly, counsel for Mr. Zinoview is certainly free to invoke the privileges afforded to 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 73   Entered on FLSD Docket 11/28/2009   Page 4 of 8

him by the applicable procedural rules should he feel that his client is being asked 
inappropriate questions during the deposition. 
9. 
In conclusion and for the reasons cited above, Mr. Zinoview’s Motion For 
Protective Order should be denied in its entirety. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Carolyn Margaret Andriano, respectfully requests that 
this Court deny Third Party Igor Zinoview’s Motion For Protective Order. 
Respectfully submitted,

AO 88A (Rev. 01/09) Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition or to Produce Documents in a Civi! Action (Page 3) 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 (c), (d), and (e) (Effective 12/1/07) 
(c) Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena. 
(])Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or 
attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take 
reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a 
person subject to the subpoena. The issuing court must enforce this 
duty and impose an appropriate sanction -
which may include lost 
earnings and reasonable attorney's fees -
on a party or attorney 
who fails to comply. 
(2) Command to Produce Materials or Perl1Ut Inspection. 
(A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce 
documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or 
to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the 
place of production or inspection unless also commanded to appear 
for a deposition, hearing, or trial. 
(B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or 
tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or 
attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to 
inspecting, copying, testing or sampling any or all of the materials or 
to inspecting the premises -
or to producing electronically stored 
information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be 
served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 
days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the 
following rules apply: 
(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving 
party may move the issuing comt for an order compelling production 
or inspection. 
(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and 
the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's 
officer from significant expense resulting from compliance. 
(3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena. 
(A) When Required. On timely motion, the issuing court must 
quash or modify a subpoena that: 
(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; 
(ii) requires a person ·.vho is neither a party nor a party's officer 
to travel more than I 00 miles from where that person resides, is 
employed, or regularly transacts business in person -
except that, 
subject to Rule 45(c)(3)(B)(iii), the person may be commanded to 
attend a trial by traveling from any such place within the state where 
the trial is held; 
(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if 
no exception or waiver applies; or 
(iv) subjects a person to undue burden. 
(B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by 
a subpoena, the issuing court may, on motion, quash or modify the 
subpoena if it requires: 
(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, 
development, or commercial infonnation; 
(ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or information that 
does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from 
the expert's study that was not requested by a party; or 
(iii) a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer to incur 
substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial. 
(C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circumstances 
described in Rule 45(c)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or 
modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under 
specified conditions if the serving party: 
(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that 
cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and 
(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably 
compensated. 
(d) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena. 
(1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. 
These procedures apply 10 producing documents or electronically 
stored information: 
(A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce 
documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary 
course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to 
the categories in the demand. 
(B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not 
Specified. If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing 
electronically stored information, the person responding must 
produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or 
in a reasonably usable form or forms. 
(C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One 
Form. The person responding need not produce the same 
electronically stored information in more than one form. 
(D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information. The person 
responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored 
information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably 
accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel 
discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show 
that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue 
burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless 
order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows 
good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The 
court may specify conditions for the discovery. 
(2) Claiming Privilege or Protection. 
(A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed 
information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to 
protection as trial-preparation material must 
(i) expressly make the claim; and 
(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, 
communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without 
revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the 
parties to assess the claim. 
(B) Information Produced. If information produced in response to a 
subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-
preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any 
party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. 
After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or 
destroy the specified infonnation and any copies it has; must not use 
or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take 
reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it 
before being notified; and may promptly present the information to 
the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The person 
who produced the information must preserve the information until 
the claim is resolved. 
(e) Contempt. The issuing court may hold in contempt a person 
who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the 
subpoena. A nonparty's failure to obey must be excused if the 
subpoena purports to require the nonparty to attend or produce at a 
place outside the limits ofRule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii).

NON-PARTY, JEAN LUC BRUHNEL’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF 
JANE DOE’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND FOR 
AN ORDER TO COMPEL AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Non-party Jean Luc Bruhnel hereby files his Response to Plaintiff, Jane Doe’s Motion
for an Order to Show Cause and for an Order to Compel and Incorporated Memorandum of Law
which was filed on March 10, 2010. (DE#483).  Plaintiff’s counsel seeks to compel Mr. Bruhnel,
a french citizen who is not a party to the instant action, to sit for a deposition that was canceled
and for which he has never been re-noticed.  This motion is premature at best, and frivolous. 
 While visiting New York, Mr. Bruhnel was served with a Subpoena and Notice of
Videotape Deposition in this matter.1  As a courtesy, undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 75   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 1 of 6

Please see Exhibit B, annexed hereto and incorporated by reference.
-2-
agreed to produce Mr. Bruhnel for deposition in Florida on November 3, 2010 for the
convenience of the parties because Mr. Bruhnel had plans to travel to Florida at that time.  The
videotape deposition was accordingly canceled.  Two new deposition notices were then e-mailed
to counsel for Bruhnel, both of which emanated from related cases in Florida Circuit Court, with
no additional notice emanating from the instant matter before this Court. 2  That scheduled
deposition was then canceled by agreement of the parties, who mutually agreed that plaintiff’s
counsel’s secretary would call counsel for Mr. Bruhnel to reset the deposition. 
Neither plaintiff’s counsel nor his secretary called to reschedule the deposition until
January, 2010.  In the intervening time, all depositions in the myriad related matters had been
canceled, upon information and belief, due to the scandal involving plaintiff’s counsel’s previous
law partner.  Further, Mr. Bruhnel had left the United States with no firm plan to return, which
was conveyed to plaintiff’s counsel during a telephone conversation in January.  
Mr. Bruhnel’s counsel attempted to secure firm dates on which Mr. Bruhnel would be
traveling to the United States, but was unable to do so. Undersigned counsel accordingly
informed planitiff’s counsel that she could not secure any firm dates.  When plaintiff’s counsel
insisted that Mr. Bruhnel provide deposition dates, plaintiff’s counsel was informed that Mr.
Bruhnel could not be compelled to return to the United States.  Undersigned counsel told
plaintiff’s counsel that there were appropriate mechanisms through which he could secure Mr.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 75   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 2 of 6

-3-
Bruhnel’s testimony abroad pursuant to Florida, Federal and International law.  Indeed,
undersigned counsel directed plaintiff’s counsel to the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and the
Hague Convention, each of which provide specific mechanisms for the securing of testimony
abroad.  
Plaintiff’s counsel has never served Mr. Bruhnel or undersigned counsel with a re-notice
for deposition since the cancellation of the prior scheduled depositions, and has never attempted
to avail himself of proper legal procedures to secure Mr. Bruhnel’s testimony abroad.  Further,
contrary to plaintiff’s counsel’s Certification to this court, plaintiff’s counsel never conferred
with undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel regarding the instant Order to Show Cause and for an
Order to Compel.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
As stated above, the previously scheduled depositions were canceled by agreement of the
parties herein and Mr. Bruhnel has never been re-noticed for deposition.  The motion currently
before the court is therefore premature and frivolous.  Regardless, it is respectfully noted that the
Court lacks authority to compel Mr. Bruhnel to return to the United States for deposition. 
Indeed, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure specifically decline to confer upon the Court the
power to compel foreign nationals to appear before it. See Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. Rule 45, 28 USC
§ 1783.
The Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and the Hague Convention, however, have each
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 75   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 3 of 6

-4-
adopted procedural rules to facilitate the deposition of a non-party foreign national.  Indeed,  The
Uniform Foreign Depositions Act,  as adopted by Florida in section 92.251 (“UFDL”) provides
a road map for litigants seeking to secure evidence from foreign non-party witnesses, stating:
(2) Whenever any mandate, writ or commission is issued out of any court of record in any
other state, territory, district, or foreign jurisdiction, or whenever upon notice or
agreement it is required to take the testimony of a witness or witnesses in this state,
witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify in the same manner and by the same
process and proceeding as may be employed for the purposes of taking testimony in
proceedings pending in this state.
§ 92.251 Florida statutes.
Thus, whenever a Florida litigant desires to depose a witness residing in another state,
that litigant must first secure the appointment of a commissioner from the court where the
litigation originates. See Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 507 So.2d 1180 (Fla 2d DCA 1987), at 1183.
The foreign litigant may then apply to the court having personal jurisdiction over the witness for
the process necessary to secure the attendance of the witness. Id. (citing Travelers Indem. Co. v.
Hill, 388 So.2d 648 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980)).  See Greenlight Financial Services, Inc. v. Union
America Mortg., Inc., 971 So.2d 983 (Fla. 3d DCA 2008). This may be done through mechanisms
provided via The Hague Convention, to which France is a signatory.  Given that several cases are
currently pending in Florida Circuit Court that are related to the instant matter, plaintiff may
avail herself of this mechanism to secure Mr. Bruhnel’s testimony, but has chosen not to. 
Accordingly, there has been no malfeasance herein by Mr. Bruhnel or his counsel, only
nonfeasance by plaintiff’s counsel.
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 75   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/12/2010   Page 4 of 6

-5-
Plaintiff’s counsel has misrepresented to this court that he spoke to Mr. Bruhnel’s
counsel about this motion prior to filing it with the Court. Undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel
was never notified in any manner that any such motion was being prepared or filed.
Plaintiff’s counsel has further misrepresented to this Court that undersigned counsel for
Mr. Bruhnel stated that Mr. Bruhnel, “has been out of this country since prior to the New Year
with no plans to return.”   In fact, undersigned counsel has consistently told Plaintiff’s counsel
that she was unaware of Mr. Bruhnel’s travel schedule and that she did not know when Mr.
Bruhnel planned to return to this country. 
WHEREFORE, JEAN LUC BRUHNEL, a non-party to the instant matter, and
undersigned counsel for Mr. Bruhnel, respectfully request that the Court DENY plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order to Show Cause and an Order to Compel in its entirety.  Mr. Bruhnel and
undersigned counsel further respectfully request that the Court impose sanctions and attorney’s
fees incurred in the defense of Plaintiff’s frivolous motion, and for whatever further relief this
Court deems appropriate.

PLAINTIFFS JANE DOES 2-8’ MEMORANDUM IN  
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S RULE 4 APPEAL  
Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-8 (“Plaintiffs”), by and through undersigned counsel, file this 
Memorandum in Response to Defendant’s Rule 4 Appeal of the Magistrate Judge’s Orders (DE 
480 and DE 513) directing Defendant to produce his income tax returns, as follows:  
Introduction 
Defendant appeals the Magistrate Judge’s Orders (DE 480 and DE 513) compelling 
Defendant to produce income tax returns and related forms and schedules.  He fails, however, to 
demonstrate that the Magistrate Judge’s decision as to tax returns is clearly erroneous or contrary 
to law.  The applicable case law establishes that the tax returns are not protected from discovery 
by the Fifth Amendment privilege under the act of production doctrine, or alternatively, that they 
fall within the “required records” exception to the Fifth Amendment privilege.   
The tax returns are indisputably relevant in these cases, particularly as to Plaintiff’s 
claims for punitive damages, and given the Defendant’s invocation of the Fifth Amendment in 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 76   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 1 of 10

blanket fashion to all requests for net worth discovery, there is a compelling need for this 
discovery.  Even if Plaintiffs could not demonstrate a compelling need for the tax returns in 
discovery, under applicable Eleventh Circuit precedent and reported cases in this District, 
Plaintiffs would be entitled to this discovery under the broad relevance standard of Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 26(b).  Finally, there is no basis to delay this discovery, as the tax returns are relevant to 
punitive damages, which is an important, current issue in these cases.  For the reasons set forth 
herein, Plaintiff’s request that the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to Defendant’s tax returns be 
affirmed and that Defendant be ordered to produce the tax return discovery requested by 
Plaintiffs.    
Argument 
I. 
DEFENDANT HAS BURDEN TO SHOW THAT MAGISTRATE  
JUDGE’S ORDER IS CLEARLY ERRONEOUS OR CONTRARY TO LAW 
In seeking reversal of the Magistrate Judge’s Order as to discovery of tax returns, it is the 
Defendant’s burden to show that the order is “clearly erroneous or contrary to law”.  28 U.S.C. 
§636(b)(1).  Absent such a showing, the Magistrate Judge’s decision “shall not be disturbed.” 
Emmisive Energy Corp. v. Novatac, Inc., 2009 WL 2834841 *1 (S.D. Fla. 2009).  In the instant 
appeal, Defendant has not shown that the Magistrate Judge’s Order to produce tax returns is 
clearly erroneous or contrary to law.  
II. 
THE ACT OF PRODUCTION OF TAX RETURNS IS NOT  
PROTECTED BY THE FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE 
The Plaintiffs served the following document request in discovery, to which Defendant 
asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege:  
Request No. 1:  All Federal and State income tax returns, including all W-2 
forms, 1099 forms and schedules, for tax years 2003-2008. 
The Magistrate Judge rejected the Defendant’s privilege assertion as to tax returns.  (De 480, pp. 
8-9).  In so holding, the Magistrate Judge applied the act of production doctrine set forth in 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 76   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 2 of 10

Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 410 (1976) and United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 35-
(2000).  As noted by the Magistrate Judge, “Defendant cannot reasonably and in good faith 
argue that in producing these documents to Plaintiff he will somehow be incriminating himself.”  
(Order, p. 9).  Yet, Defendant argues just that.  In Hubbell, the Supreme Court made express 
reference to tax returns in discussing documents that cannot be protected by the Fifth 
Amendment privilege under the act of production doctrine:  
[T]he fact that incriminating evidence may be the byproduct of 
obedience to a regulatory requirement, such as filing an income 
tax return, maintaining required records, or reporting an accident, 
does not clothe such required conduct with the testimonial 
privilege.  
120 U.S. at 2043, 530 U.S. at 35 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis supplied).  Accord United States 
v. Hammes, 3 F.3d 1081, 1083 (7th Cir. 1993) (“[w]e reject [defendant’s] compulsory self-
incrimination claim because the government may use voluntarily filed tax returns against a 
defendant without violating the Fifth Amendment”).  See also Garner v. United States, 96 S.Ct. 
1178, 424 U.S. 648 (1976) (holding that disclosures in tax returns are not compelled 
incriminations and may be used as evidence in criminal prosecution); Ebay, Inc. v. Digital Point 
Solutions, Inc., 2010 WL 147967 *8 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (holding that a person cannot incriminate 
himself by turning over a document already in the government’s possession); Federal Savings 
and Loan Ins. Corp. v. Hardee, 686 F. Supp 885 (N.D. Fla. 1988) (holding that personal income 
tax returns and supporting schedules are not protected by the “act of production” doctrine under 
Fisher).  
As an alternative to finding that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply because 
the act of producing documents is not testimonial and communicative, courts have invoked the 
“required records” exception to the act of production doctrine.  See Federal Saving & Loan Ins. 
Corp. v. Rodrigues, 717 F. Supp. 1424, 1427 (N.D. Cal 1988) (“required records” exception is a 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 76   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 3 of 10

distinct basis to deny Fifth Amendment privilege alternative to the “foregone conclusion” 
rationale under Fisher).  The “required records” exception defeats the Fifth Amendment privilege 
where: “(1) because of the public aspect of the required records the individual admits little of 
significance by their production; and (2) by doing business in an area where the government 
requires record keeping, an individual may be deemed to have waived the Fifth Amendment 
privilege as to the production of those records.”   In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 21 F.3d 226, 229 
(8th Cir. 1994).    
Defendant contends that the “required records” exception does not apply to tax returns 
because they cannot be accessed by the public.  This is wrong, however, as the “required 
records” exception requires only that there be “public aspects” to the documents at issue.  Id. 
Numerous courts that have addressed this precise issue have found that tax returns have “public 
aspects”. See Rodrigues, 717 F. Supp. at 1426-27 (citing cases); accord Doe v. United States, 
711 F.2d 1187, 1191 (2d Cir. 1983).1   Accordingly, the “required records” exception applies to 
the production of tax returns.   In Rodrigues, the Court denied the Fifth Amendment privilege for 
the act of producing tax returns under the “required records” exception, noting that “records filed 
with a public body pursuant to a valid regulatory scheme have been held to have public aspects.”  
Id. at 1427.  Accordingly, the fact that federal tax returns cannot be accessed by the general 
public does not aid the Defendant.  Accord Resolution Trust Corp. v. Lopez, 794 F. Supp. 1, 3 
(D.D.C. 1992). 
Thus, there are two alternative grounds for holding that Defendant’s assertion of the Fifth 
Amendment privilege to production of tax returns is invalid:  (1) the tax returns are in the 
Defendant further appears to argue that the “required records” exception should be limited to 
“highly regulated business (e.g., physicians)”, citing In re Dr. John Doe, 97 F.R.D. 640, 641-643 
(S.D.N.Y. 1982).  In Dr. John Doe, however, the Court held contrary to Defendant’s assertion 
and consistent with the case law cited herein stating, “[w]e agree that some of these records (e.g. 
W-2 and other tax forms) may indeed fall within the required records exception.”  Id. at 644 
(ordering that Dr. Doe comply with subpoena for W-2 forms).  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 76   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 4 of 10

possession of the government, their existence is a foregone conclusion, and there is no risk of 
“implicit authentication” by Defendant’s production of these documents; or (2) tax returns fall 
within the “required records” exception to the act of production doctrine, and are thus not 
protected by the Fifth Amendment.  Under either of these grounds, the Defendant’s tax returns 
are not privileged and must be produced in discovery.  
II. 
THERE IS NO HEIGHTENED BURDEN 
FOR DISCOVERY OF TAX RETURNS 
Defendant asserts that there is a heightened burden on a party seeking discovery of tax 
returns, requiring that party to show not only relevance, but also that “a compelling need for the 
tax returns exists because the information contained therein is not otherwise available.”  (Appeal, 
p. 24).  However, in the Eleventh Circuit this heightened burden has been rejected. “[T]he 
Eleventh Circuit does not require a showing of compelling need before tax information may be 
obtained by a party in discovery.” Bellosa v. Universal Tile Restoration, Inc., 2008 WL 2620735 
(S.D. Fla. 2008) (citing Maddow v. Procter & Gamble Co., 107 F.3d 846 (11th Cir. 1997)); 
accord U.S. v. Certain Real Property, 444 F.Supp. 2d 1258 (S.D.Fla. 2006); Platypus Wear, Inc. 
v. Clarke Modet & Co., 2008 W.L. 728540 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Preferred Care Partners Holding 
Corp. v. Humana, Inc., 2008 WL 4500258 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Ruskin Co. v. Greenheck Fan Corp., 
2009 WL 383349 (S.D. Fla. 2009).  Significantly, in both Preferred Care and Ruskin the Court 
affirmed the decision of a Magistrate Judge rejecting a higher standard for production of tax 
returns, holding that, despite an arguable split of authority, 2 the Magistrate Judge’s decision was 
not “contrary to law.”  Id.  Likewise, the Magistrate Judge’s decision in this case compelling 
Defendant relies upon Pendlebury v. Starbucks Coffee Co., 2008 WL 2105024 (S.D. Fla. 2005) 
and Dunkin Donuts, Inc. v. Mary’s Donuts, Inc., 2001 WL 34079319 (S.D. Fla. 2001), in which 
the Court applied the higher standard.  These cases do not consider the Eleventh Circuit’s 
opinion in Maddow, and the federal judges in this District over the past five years since 
Pendlebury have consistently rejected the “compelling need” standard for production of tax 
returns.  See cases cited above.  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 76   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 5 of 10

production of tax returns is consistent with authority in this District and the Eleventh Circuit, and 
thus should be affirmed.  
III. 
EVIDENCE OF DEFENDANT’S FINANCIAL 
STATUS AND HISTORY IS RELEVANT TO  
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AMONG OTHER ISSUES 
Defendant does not go so far as to contend that the discovery of his tax returns is not 
relevant under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26.  Defendant only argues that the Magistrate Judge did not address 
the relevancy standard in her Order.  (Appeal, p. 25).  As a result, Defendant does nothing to 
show that the Magistrate Judge’s Order as to tax returns is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.  
In any event, it is abundantly clear that Defendant’s financial status and history are relevant to 
punitive damages, among other issues in these cases, and in this regard the Defendant’s tax 
returns are pertinent and discoverable.  Tennant v. Charlton, 377 So.2d 1169 (Fla. 1979) (holding 
that party may obtain tax returns for purposes of net worth discovery on issue of punitive 
damages).  See also State v. O’Malley, 53 S.W. 3d 623 (Mo. App. 2001) (“[i]t is well settled that 
when a plaintiff seeks punitive damages against a defendant, evidence of the defendant’s 
financial status is both relevant and admissible”); Interstate Narrow Fabrics, Inc. v. Century 
USA, Inc., 2004 WL 444570 (M.D. N.C. 2004) (holding that tax returns are relevant to the jury’s 
determination of the amount of punitive damages to award); E.J. Lavino & Co. v. Universal 
Health Services, Inc., 1991 WL 275767 (E.D. Pa. 1991) (“[m]ost courts that have considered this 
issue have held that a plaintiff seeking punitive damages may discovery information pertaining 
to a defendant’s net worth”).  
Defendant further argues that he should not have to produce his tax returns until “it 
becomes apparent” that “punitive damages will be an issue.”  (Appeal, p. 26).  This argument 
ignores Florida law on punitive damages.  It is well established that “punitive damages are 
always recoverable in intentional tort cases where malice is one of the essential elements of the 
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 76   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 6 of 10

tort.”  Ciamar Marcay, Inc. v. Monteiro Da Costa, 508 So.2d 1282 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987) 
(emphasis supplied).  “In Florida it is clear that an act of intentional assault and battery 
committed without legal justification supplies proof of malice.”  Joab, Inc. v. Thrall, 245 So.2d 
291 (Fla. 3d DCA 1971).  Therefore, it is clear in this intentional tort case that punitive damages 
are an issue.  As this Court knows, Defendant Epstein is alleged to have perpetrated a plan and 
scheme to sexually molest dozens of underage teenage girls.3 
Even assuming that the “compelling need” standard were applicable for discovery of tax 
returns, clearly in this case there is a compelling need. Defendant has provided no net worth 
discovery, asserting a blanket Fifth Amendment privilege.4   Defendant nonetheless contends that 
there exists an “alternative” - not to discovery of the necessary information, but through his offer 
to “stipulate” to a net worth in the nine figures.  Of course, a stipulation requires the consent of 
the parties and there is no agreement in this case on the Defendant’s net worth.  Defendant 
cannot unilaterally by fiat claim a certain net worth for purposes of trial.5  The law is well 
established that a jury may determine punitive damages “by exacting from [the defendant’s] 
pocketbook a sum of money which, according to his financial ability, will hurt, but not 
Defendant’s reliance on Gallina v. Commerce and Industry Ins., 2008 WL 3895918 (M.D. Fla. 
2008) is misplaced.  Gallina is an insurance bad faith case and does not involve a claim of 
punitive damages against an intentional tortfeasor. Moreover, in the present case it would make 
no sense to have a different “stage” for punitive damages discovery or trial.   
“[T]he burden to identify an alternative source of the information lies with the resisting party.”  
Interstate Narrow Fabrics, 2004 WL 444570 at *2.  Here, Epstein’s blanket Fifth Amendment 
privilege assertion to all net worth discovery makes it clear that there is a compelling need for 
any net worth discovery not protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege.  
Defendant relies upon Myers v. Central Florida Investment, Inc., 592 F.3d 1201 (11th Cir. 
2010) for its “stipulation” argument.  In Myers, however, the district court heard testimony 
regarding each of the defendant’s net worth.  There was no unilateral statement of net worth in 
Myers as Defendant wishes to create in the instant case.   To the extent that Defendant relies 
upon the Court’s holding in Myers regarding the reasonableness of the trial court’s award of 
punitive damages, the issue of reasonableness is determined by the particular facts and 
circumstances of the case and the discussion in Myers of this issue has no relevance here. Id.  
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 76   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/28/2010   Page 7 of 10

bankrupt.”  Joab, Inc. v. Thrall, 245 So.2d 291 (Fla. 3d DCA 1971) (emphasis supplied).  
Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to discovery on the Defendant’s real net worth so that the jury 
will be in a position to make an award that “will hurt”.   In any event, it seems beyond dispute 
that Defendant’s tax returns are relevant and discoverable, either under a straight relevance test 
under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 or a heightened “compelling need” standard. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to Defendant’s production of 
tax returns in response to Plaintiffs’ document request no. 1 are not clearly erroneous and not 
contrary to law.  As a result, the Magistrate Judge’s Orders as to production of tax returns should 
be affirmed.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ document 
request no. 1 be ordered to be produced forthwith.

JUN f 4 2010 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein's Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion to 
Quash and Motion for Attorneys' Fees, With Incorporated Memorandum Of Law 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter "EPSTEIN") by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, hereby files his Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion 
to Quash and Motion for Attorneys' fees and Costs, With Incorporated Memorandum Of 
Law. In support, Defendant states as follows: 
1. As this Court is well aware, these cases have been consolidated for discovery. 
However, on April 1, 2010, Plaintiffs counsel, Spencer Kuvin, filed C.L. v. Epstein, 
Case No. 10-80447-cv-Marra/Johnson, and that case has not been consolidated with the 
other related cases for purposes of discovery. 
2. On April 20, 2010, Mr. Kuvin served Maritza Milagros Vasquez with a subpoena 
for deposition, which is set to occur tomorrow. See Exhibit "A". However, this Notice 
and subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed as Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his 
client, has failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 (d). That rule states, in pertinent part, 

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 77   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010   Page 2 of 9
j 
that: "[a] party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred 
as required by Rule 26(t) .... " Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, has not complied with 
Rule 26(t) and, therefore, the subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed and a 
Protective Order should be entered pursuant to Rule 26( c) forbidding the deposition from 
occurring for non-compliance with the applicable rules. In Varo, Inc. v. Litton Systems, 
Inc., 129 F.R.D. 139, 141 (N.D. TX 1989), the court held that one cannot be compelled to 
comply with a withdrawn subpoena. Id. Likewise, the court here cannot compel Maritza 
Milagros Vasquez to attend any deposition when the subpoena itself is invalid, especially 
when it will require those involved in these matters to incur substantial attorneys' fees. 
3. Next, Mr. Brad Edwards, counsel for Jane Doe, cross-noticed Maritza Milagros 
Vasquez's deposition in Jane Doe (#08-80893 - Exhibit "B"), which matter is already set 
for trial in July 2010. 
Discovery concluded on May 31, 2010 (see DE 531). 
Accordingly, the cross notice served by Jane Doe must be stricken/quashed and a 
protective order entered because the subpoena itself in invalid due to C.L.'s counsel's 
failure to comply with Rule 26(d) and discovery in Jane Doe (80893) has concluded. 
Rule 7 .1 Certification 
I hereby certify that counsel for the respective parties communicated by e-mail in a 
good faith effort to resolve the issues set forth above prior to the filing of this Motion and 
none of the issues were resolved. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court enter an order granting 
. 
Defendant's motion for protective order and motion to quash. Defendant further requests 
that this Court award his attorney's fees and costs associated with this motion, m 
accordance with Rule 37, Fed.R.Civ.P. and applicable Local Rules and specifically: 
a. Quash CL's subpoena attached as Exhibit "A"; 
1I

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 77   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010   Page 3 of 9
b. Quash and/or strike Jane Doe's cross notice as to Exhibit "A" because 
Exhibit "A" is invalid and discovery has concluded in Jane Doe; 
c. Award attorneys to Defendant for CL and Jane Doe's noncompliance with 
these discovery matters; and 
d. for such other and further relief as this co

_______________________________________/
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
THIS CAUSE is before the Court sua sponte. 
This Court’s Order of March 25, 2009 directed the parties to confer within twenty-one
(21) calendar days after the filing of the first responsive pleading by the last responding
defendant, to submit a written report of this conference outlining their proposed discovery plan
within 14 days after the conference, to hold a scheduling conference either at the same time as
the discovery conference or within fourteen (14) calendar days thereafter, and finally, within
fourteen (14) days of the scheduling conference, file a joint scheduling report.  Thus, since the
Complaint in this case was filed March 24, 2009 and Defendant Sarah Kellen filed a responsive
pleading on October 21, 2009, the latest a joint scheduling report should have been filed was in
January of 2010. 
Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff shall show cause why
Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM   Document 79   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/25/2010   Page 1 of 2

they have failed to follow this Court’s Order, and shall further file a report on or before Friday,
July 2, 2010 as to the status of this case.  Failure to timely file a status report as ordered may
result in dismissal of the case.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 25  day of June, 2010.

PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL’S RESPONSE TO COURT’S ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
Plaintiff’s counsel responds to the Court’s Order to Show Cause, and states:
1.
Plaintiff’s counsel apologizes to the Court for a failure to finalize a Joint
Scheduling Conference Report and Order and to file same with the Court in accordance
with the Court’s Order.
2.
The parties did exchange a number of drafts of the Joint Scheduling Report
and proposed Order but despite efforts to finalize it did not do so. There was some delay
in effecting service on Defendant SARAH KELLEN, who is believed to have been avoiding
service, and this accounts for part of the delay in filing the Report and Proposed Order,
although it certainly does not excuse it.    
3.
The parties have been involved in settlement discussions for some time, and
reached a resolution of the claims in this and the State court companion case this week,
and all claims have been resolved. Defendant has filed a Joint Stipulation and proposed
Order indicating the resolution of this case.
