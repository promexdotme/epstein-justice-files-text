           TODD BLANCHE:  I am going to ask everybody
to put their name on the record here.
           SPENCER HORN:  Good morning.  My name is
Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Spencer Horn of
FBI, New York.
           Today we're doing a proffer of
Ms. Maxwell.  The date is July 24th and the time is
10:12 a.m.  This interview is being recorded.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And my name is Todd
Blanche.  I'm the Deputy Attorney General.  And
before we start formally asking questions of
Ms. Maxwell, I'm going to put on the record everybody
that's in this room, in addition to me, starting with
you, Diego.
           DIEGO PESTANA:  Diego Pestana, Associate
Deputy Attorney General.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then you heard from
Special Agent in Charge Horn.  Mark Beard from the

           And then David.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yes.  This is David Oscar
Markus, and I'm counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  My name is Leah Saffian and
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 3
I'm counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell.
           MELISSA MADRIGAL:  My name is
Melissa Madrigal and I'm counsel for Ghislaine
Maxwell.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I'm -- I'm
Ghislaine Maxwell.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Good morning, Ms. Maxwell.
How are you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Good morning,
Mr. Blanche.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Good.  Okay.  So before we
started recording, we met for a few minutes.  I
introduced myself and we -- we've chatted and now
I've told you that we were going on the record.  And
before we start asking questions, I know that you've
been given, by your lawyer, a copy of what's called a
proffer agreement.
           And I just want to spend two minutes
making sure that you understand what -- what governs
our conversation today.  The most important part of
this agreement is that this isn't a cooperation
agreement, meaning that by you meeting with us today,
we're really just meeting, I'm not promising to do
anything.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 4
           I'm not promising to ask Judge Nathan or
any of the judges that's been assigned to your case
to do anything.  It -- we're just talking.  And so
that's the most important -- important part of -- of
this agreement.
           However, almost as important is the fact
that what this agreement does for you is it gives you
protection.  So what it means is that the government
cannot use what you say today against you, with some
exceptions, which we'll talk about in a minute.
           But whatever you talk about today, you
have what's called immunity.  So that means that the
words that you say today, we cannot use against you
in a case in chief, if we were ever to bring one.
Okay?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  All right.  There's
exceptions to that.  The most meaningful one of which
is that, if you say something today that's not true,
that's a lie, we can bring a prosecution against you
for what's called false statements.
           So I'm a federal officer, I have several
officers here.  The FBI is here.  And if -- if you
lie to someone that's -- like me or like Special
Agent Horn, it's a crime.  So you have to be
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 5
truthful.
           The other exception to this, that doesn't
necessarily apply directly to you, but if there ever
was a retrial in your case, or if there ever was a --
a criminal case -- a future criminal case against
you, and your lawyer or you said something different
or took a position that's different than what you say
today, we can then cross examine you or a witness,
based upon what you say today.
           So it's a little bit nuanced, meaning I
can't use what you say against you in our case in
chief.  However, if you were to testify or if your
lawyer called a witness to testify, and they said
something that is totally different than what you say
today, we could then cross examine you or the witness
and say, hey, do you remember when we met with
Ms. Wax -- when we met with Ms. Maxwell back in July
of 2025?  She told us and then say what she said.
Okay?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I understand.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Other than that,
you -- I -- I know you didn't have a lot of time this
morning to meet with -- with -- with Mr. Markus, but
did -- did you have a chance to go over this briefly
with him?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 6
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  All right.  So I've
already signed it, as has Special Agent Horn --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- and Mr. Markus signed it
as well.  So you got a pen, please sign it --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right here?
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- right where it says
"client." Yes.
           And I will provide a copy of this to -- to
your lawyer so you guys have it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay, thank you.
           So Ms. Maxwell, about a week and a half
ago or two weeks ago --
           SPENCER HORN:  Can you see the light
blinking on there?  On the Sony?  Yeah, there it is.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay. We're just confirming
that it works and it does.
           Ms. Maxwell, I guess about a week and a
half or two weeks ago, Mr. Markus reached out to me
and said that -- that you wanted to speak with
somebody from the government about, not only your
case, but about everything that's been in the media
and that's been publicized about Mr. Epstein in your
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 7
case.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did he --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's true and I did
speak to him and I did ask him if -- oh, and did tell
him that I would be very keen to talk to anyone,
because no one from the government, at any time, ever
in the -- since the inception of the case, so dating
back to the early 2000s, has ever spoken to me, and
indeed, I believe ever reached out to me at any time
to even speak to me. And that includes up to when I
was indicted and prosecuted.
           I believe that -- or I understand, I
should say, rather, that my attorneys, at the time,
did tell the government that I wanted to speak to
them, because I was very keen to meet with anyone, so
that I could tell or have them ask me any question.
           I've never had any problem to -- to speak
to anybody.  And I offered myself and I kept asking,
if they would meet with me, so I could talk to them
and for whatever reason --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- that was not
happening.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  I have questions
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 8
that I want to ask you, but I'm not -- if there's a
path that -- a question that I'm not asking, that you
think should be asked, I -- I invite you to
volunteer.  Same thing goes to your lawyers.
           Just to start a little bit very briefly,
can you talk about when you first met Mr. Epstein.  I
know that goes back a while.  And just very generally
talk about your relationship with Mr. Epstein, from
the time you met him all the way up until -- until
his death.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met Mr. Epstein in
1991.  My -- I had -- I had never heard of him or met
him before.  And no one in my family had ever either.
My father never knew him.  And I'll explain why that
is the case. I met --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Where did you -- where --
where did you meet him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I had a girlfriend
who -- I -- I was -- yeah.  I had moved to America,
briefly, in -- well, I'd moved to America in 1990.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- well "moved,"
that's a big word.  I'd come to visit America in
1990.  I had been running my own company up until
that time, which was a company called Maxwell's
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 9
Corporate Gifts.
           And I had also been working for my father
at the time.  I had multiple jobs with him.  I was --
in 1990 I was working with a -- a new company of his,
a new -- a new newspaper that he was launching,
called The European.
           And I was in charge of launching a
magazine to go with the -- The European.  And I was
traveling at that time from England to America,
because my father was looking to -- well, he'd also
bought McMillan the -- the publishing house.  And he
had purchased the New York Daily News.
           And it's truth that my father always
wanted me to come back, full time and work for him,
but that's a much longer story I don't think we need
to go into at this time.
           So -- but I was always working with him.
There was no escaping it were -- as it were to -- to
work for him.
           So in 1990, I had come over to New York,
to help look at some of that.  He was having some
advertising issues with the New York Daily News.  And
in fact, I met -- I may have met Donald Trump at that
time, because my father was friendly with him and
liked him very much.  And I think, should be said
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 10
that he also very much liked Ivana, because she was
also from Czechoslovakia where my dad was from.
           So I don't -- I don't remember if I did
meet him or not in 1990 with my dad, but I knew that
that's how I knew about, -- about Mr. Trump.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And this was before you
met --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  This was before I met
Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay. All right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I was already going
backwards and forwards in America.  And then in April
of 1991, I came to New York, but, I can't remember
for what reason -- what business reason, but there
was a business reason -- something to do with my dad
at that time.
           And a girlfriend of mine who -- an
American, told me I -- I -- I had broken up with my
long -- I'd been engaged, getting my -- the very
long-term boyfriend and we'd broken up.
           And she said, I've got -- you know, as
your girlfriends do, I've got a guy for you to meet.
And I was like, who is it?  And she goes, it's --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 11
he's been dating my sister.  You'll love him.  He's
looking for a wife.  I'm edging towards 30.  I don't
need to tell you guys, That's a very important moment
for a girl to, like, think about important things.
And sure, I'd be happy to meet him.
           And so sometime in 1991 now.  We are in
1991, I met him at his offices in -- on Madison
Garden.  And I think the most memorable thing I can
think about that is he was wearing a tie, which he
didn't often do.  It had a giant, seemed like a
ketchup stain on it.  So I was like, wow, okay. And
that was how we met.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was your meeting at his
office for you to meet him just personally or were
you -- were you there for --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- work related reasons?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I -- I knew
nothing about him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- he just invited
me to come and have tea, and I was like tea, that's
English.  Okay.  But what was unusual, was in his
offices.  So I went to his offices and we met.  And I
found him very engaging and that was that.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 12
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- okay.  So that's how
you meet him.  So we -- and again, I don't want to
spend a lot of time, you know, on -- on this
particular issue, but what happened with your
relationship over the years, from the time you meet
him in 1991, up until the time he -- he passed away?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Just give the highlights.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay, the highlights.
So I -- I was looking for real estate for my dad to
buy some, and Epstein told me that he was also
looking to move from his apartment and would I help
him?  And I -- I said, sure I'm looking already so I
could look for him.  So that's how it started.
           And then, in 1991, my father passed away
and I returned to New York after that, originally to
come back and help with the family businesses, which
was McMillan.
           And then the debacle of my father's
passing hit the family. And -- and we lost all our
businesses and my family thought that it would be
best if I stayed in America, because of the intensity
of the press and the drama surrounding my father's
death in England
           So I stayed and Epstein said, well, you
can keep helping me. You can help me find a house and
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 13
we can decorate the house.  And it gave me something
to do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Were you in a romantic
relationship with him at this point or just friends?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, just friends.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And while we're just --
with respect to your father, there have been multiple
questions about whether he worked for any
intelligence agency.
           Do you have any knowledge about that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think -- well
certainly my father had a background in intelligence
during -- because he was -- I believe he did in the
second World War.  He was an intelli- -- a British
intelligence officer.  I think that, my sort of
belief is that once you've been an intelligence
officer, you're kind of -- always; it doesn't mean
that you're formally employed.
           So I don't think my dad in any formal
sense was, you know, employed by the -- any agency.
But when you are a very significant businessman and
politician, as my father was, you meet with people
over time and you, I guess trade business or ideas.
           I think if -- if that would fall under
that definition, that's how I would give it.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 14
           Now he certainly, I have no formal
knowledge of anything specifically that he did in
that thing, but if you're asking me if I thought that
he did help people, the answer would be yes, I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did your father and Mr.
Epstein have a business relationship over the years?
I know we're maybe jumping around a little bit.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  They never met.  So --
           TODD BLANCHE:  As far as you know, they
never even met?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No. I -- I--
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or you know they never
met?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I know they never met.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, how do you know they
never met?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  They -- just
categorically know they never met.  Well, because
after, in 1991, before my father died, he asked me if
I'd met anybody interesting or whatever, you know,
because I was still trying not to be sucked back into
the family business.
           And I told him that I had met Mr. Epstein.
And the reason why I shared that I'd met Mr. Epstein,
because I believed, at that time, that Epstein worked
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 15
for Bear Stearns.  And Bear Stearns was one of our
banks.  And I knew that my father was friendly with
both Jimmy Cayne and with Ace Greenberg.
           So my dad came -- was actually in
New York, I think.  If I remem- -- I may -- I don't
think I had this conversation on the phone, but I --
I honestly we're talking 30 years ago, so I'm not
sure.
           But if I -- I maybe I told him this
verbatim, because it happened -- I know that what my
dad did, whether I saw it or whether I -- he did it
and told me later I -- that I don't remember.
           But he called both Jimmy Cayne and Ace
Greenberg to ask if -- what sort of guy he was and
was he even allowed to -- because (indiscernible)
so . . .
           TODD BLANCHE:  So they never -- they never
met.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He didn't even know
who he was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But they had -- they --
they knew some of the same people, it sounds like, or
certainly the Bear Stearns connection was something
that -- that you -- that you knew that they had.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Well, he never
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 16
had a connection with Epstein.  He had a connection
with the bank.  I mean, Epstein, I'd never heard of
him or knew of him before.  And I certainly -- if my
dad had known him, right, when I said, this is who he
was, he didn't know who he was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So he rang Ace and he
rang Jimmy, to ask if it was okay that I even knew
him.  And I just want to explain, briefly why my
father would even do such a thing.
           I've had some -- some interesting things
that have happened in my life.  And one of them was
to be found on an IRA kidnap and murder list.  And so
after that happened -- well, there were other
related -- I'm not going to bore you with all the
horrible things in that vein, but I -- if you want
the details, of course I can.
           But after that happened, my father wanted
to put a lot of protection on me, obviously.  And I
declined on the grounds that that would be a very
life-restricting event.  You are all in law
enforcement, I know you understand this.
           And so he had told me that, you know, I
would be taking my life in my own hands and then
whatever.  And so I think after that event and
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 17
several others, where I had stalkers and all that
thing that one has, he was always quite protective of
me.  And so if I met somebody, he would try and
verify that they weren't going to do anything
hideous.
           And so in case he thought it was weird,
that he would call Jimmy and -- and Ace -- it
might -- you know, you may think it is but in my --
from my perspective, he was just -- because he was
concerned, I was in America alone and he had an
opportunity to verify who this person was.
           And so I don't know if I was in the room
with him, I don't recall.  But I know that at some
point my father told me he's fine.  You can see him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He's safe.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So we might come back and
touch a little bit more on that at some point, but --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I went down a rabbit
hole for a minute.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's all right.  I
just wanted to --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 18
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, that's helpful.
Thank you.
           So -- okay.  So you're -- you're now in
the '90s and you're friends with Mr. Epstein.  Your
house -- decorating the house or the apartment.
           What -- what happens with your
relationship?  Again, I know we're talking about a
35-year time period or whatever, but to the extent
you can kind of, at a very high level, talk about it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Listen, I think just
full disclosure is the best way to go at this point.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So in 1992, I slept
with him one time and I was like, whoa, that's it.
We're going to be dating, because that's how I
thought.  And -- and I kind of thought of myself in
that moment.  Like, because you, I felt if you slept
with someone, that you were then dating them.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's the world I
came from.  But that really was -- well, that's how I
thought.  And -- but we didn't sleep together again
for, I don't know, really a significant period of
time.  And when I say --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like years or?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 19
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if it was
a year.  I don't -- it feels that feels long, but
maybe nine months, I mean, a long time.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I just want to go
back to -- I had found a house for him to rent in
New York, because he had asked me -- I had been
looking at one for my father, and I found one, which
was a former Iranian embassy, I think it was.  I
think it belonged to the Iranians, or the Iraqis or
someone.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I didn't know that
he had any money.  It was like, I want to say it was
$12,000 a month, which to me seemed like a fortune.
And I said to myself, I found this house, but I don't
think you can afford it.  He was like, that's
ridiculous.  Of course I can afford, and he rented
it.
           And that house came with -- it was a State
Department house, because it was -- I think that was
under sequestration or whatever it was.
           And I -- I put it back together, but there
were certain rules, you couldn't paint, because it
had to go back and he gave it back to the country
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 20
then.
           So he had this house and I had moved into
a 10 foot by 10 foot apartment, because all of our
stuff had been either lost or frozen or -- or
whatever.
           So he became, in this moment, my life
line, really, because I was -- everything was --felt
very similar to this moment, if that makes sense.
           Anyway, so but I had no key to his house.
I had no free access to his house.  And in the entire
time that he lived there, which was I believe until,
the beginning of 1996, I never slept a single night
in that house.  Never ever.  Not one.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you -- so you -- you --
you said a minute ago that the -- that you had slept
with him on one occasion, and at the time you
remember thinking, you know, that this meant you were
in a relationship, but then it didn't -- you really
were not in that type of relationship.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I thought --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did that change over --
between '91 and '92 or whatever and -- and -- and
years forward?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I did travel with
him a lot.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 21
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I would go to his
houses in Palm Beach.  He only had that house
actually in -- no, that's not true.  He had the house
in Palm Beach and he had a house in Ohio.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Ohio.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And he had the house
in Ohio because of his business relationship with
Mr. Wexner.  And he had a -- and I had to go and
decorate and put that house together.  When we
traveled together, we stayed in the same bed, but not
in -- but I didn't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.  It's okay, talk.
           So you -- you stayed -- so when you would
travel with him to his houses in Palm Beach, Ohio, or
even just traveling, if -- if -- if it was just
traveling with him, you would stay in the same bed.
So sleep in the same bed with him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Epstein told me that
he had a heart condition.
           DAVID MARKUS:  A what?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 22
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Heart condition.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Heart condition.
           TODD BLANCHE:  A heart condition.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Which meant that he
didn't have intercourse a lot, which suited me fine,
because I actually do have a medical condition, which
precludes me having a lot of intercourse.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So what -- what was your
understanding of his heart condition and why that
prevented him from having intercourse regularly?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know.  I mean,
he liked other forms of sexual activities.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, let's come back.
           We're going to obviously spend some
time -- a lot of time on the actual conduct he was
accused of.  So we'll --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- we'll -- we'll come back
to that.  So pick up where you -- where you were
talking about you traveling around with him, he
rented the New York, former Iranian House --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Iranian, there you go.
Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- until around '96.  At
that time, you -- I believe you said that he was
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 23
basically your life, like you were with him pretty
regularly.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I -- no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I never was with
him regularly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That is one of those
misnomers.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, at the
beginning I did see more of him, but I worked in his
office.  So I would go to the office and I would see
him, and I would count in my head when I would see
him.  I would count that I would -- that would be a
day that I would see him.  But I didn't -- I never,
ever stayed with him.
           I believe certainly until '93 or '94, what
I didn't know was that I think he was still with his
actual girlfriend who was Eva Andersson, who became
Eva Dubin.  They had been together, my understanding,
I think about 10 years.  I'm not sure, but that's
what I think, 10 years.
           And I had understood from my girlfriend
initially, that they weren't together and Epstein
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 24
himself had told me that they were not together.  But
I don't -- I don't think that was true.  In fact, I
know it's not true.  So they were still together, up
until, I think '94, when at some point, in that
period of time, Eva met Glenn Dubin and they got
married, I think in '94.
           I don't remember when they got married,
but her, she was his best friend and his everything,
he told me that he always wished that he had married
her and had a child with her.
           And I know that they -- she was family for
him for his whole life.  And I think even -- I'm not
sure this is true, but you guys will know if this is
true or not.  When he came from -- back from Paris
and you arrested him, I don't know if Eva was on the
plane.
           Now, I think that either I read it in the
-- in the discovery that I received, or I saw it
somewhere.  But even if she wasn't on the plane,
there must have been some email communication where
she was in Paris at the same time and going to fly
back.
           One or the other, I don't know which one
is the correct version of that.  But so they were
still obviously very close and remained throughout
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 25
the time.  In fact, he -- he was-- still saw her a
lot.
           And so I also know now, which I didn't
know at the time, was that he saw lots of other
women.  And I know that now, because I can see -- I
can see it from the flight logs and I know it now
because I can see from the emails.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So, you know from the
case --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, not from --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- that what happened.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, I didn't know --
           TODD BLANCHE:  You didn't know that along
the way.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I contemporaneously, I
absolutely did not know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So, okay -- so just -- and
we're going to spend time on everything you're
talking about, but just to kind of close out the big
picture of your relationship.
           So we're now in the late '90s, continue on
with, again, staying high level to the extent you
can, about your relationship with him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So after -- so my
responsibilities increased with each acquisition that
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 26
he had and each new project.  So I believe the first
thing that he purchased after was the ranch in
New Mexico.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And so what he had
tasked me with up until that, and I think that was
purchased in '94, if I'm right.  So he had tasked me,
one of the things that we did was visit, in my mind,
I say every state, but it wouldn't have been every
state, but many states, to go look at real estate
property.
           And so I know we went to Montana.  I know
we went to Utah and it was -- it was to go look at
real estate.  It was fun, to be honest.
           And then I arranged for us to go to
New Mexico and he just loved New Mexico.  And then I
don't remember how the ranch happened.  I don't
remember that now, it's lost.  And then he ended up
buying the ranch.
           And I think, if I'm right, it came from --
well, the Kings who may have been the governor, I --
you know, bought the ranch.  And then I had to deal
with that.  Dealing with that was the extent of it.
           The way that I thought of myself, or the
way that I think is the best way to explain how I
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 27
view my role, was as a general manager.  Because each
property, to me was like a -- a hotel.
           So the ranch was very challenging, because
not only that, but it had BLM land, so to help
maintain your BLM, you have to have cattle and I love
animals.
           And so the first thing, horses.  And so I
wanted it, if you're going to have a ranch, I like
authenticity.  And so I don't think you should have a
ranch if you're not going to have the things that
make it special.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So were you -- were you
paid by him along the way --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- during this time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I became -- I became
salaried at some point.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I -- my memory is
that I got paid $25,000 a year to begin with.  That's
my memory.  I may be wrong.  And then with each -- as
it became obvious, because I kept thinking I was
going to go home; home being England.  And -- but
it --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- and financially,
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 28
you were not relying on him, the -- the $25,000 or
whatever amount you were paid, were you relying on
that money to live and his generosity to live or did
you have your own -- your own money.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So there's a --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And again, I -- I want to
just make sure we're talking about that.  Like
keeping it between like the late '90s, you know,
maybe, I guess into a little of the 2000s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just want to hit
something on the head right now.  There's a
tremendous amount of reporting that said that I had a
--
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  A trust fund.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.  A trust
fund.  I have never had a trust fund, at any time.
           DAVID MARKUS:  So how did you live, did
you live with -- with -- I mean, $25,000 is not
enough to live on.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No. So I had -- during
this period of time, the secret -- secret, the
Serious Fraud Squad had come to see me, in relation
to my father's passing, and to establish whether I
had been involved in any way with his business or
with any shenanigans.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 29
           I think -- I've told this story many
times, so I don't know if it's now somewhat
apocryphal, but I'll tell you what it -- my memory
is.
           So I received a letter from them that said
about my business, and my memory may be apocryphal,
there was a PS that said (unintelligible), I had
nothing.  There was no -- I was never involved in any
of his business, whatever, so I was free.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And were you -- so, but
your -- you know, obviously your -- your father and
your family had a lot of businesses.  Did -- is it
because the money, whatever money or whatever equity
was in the businesses, just stayed with your other
family members?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, there was no
money.  So my father was never attached to money.  He
was born a peasant, a real one.  Dirt floor, no
shoes, no clothes -- some clothes, but not, you know,
sorry, I don't mean to say -- nothing.
           And he never -- he was never into that.  I
mean, there were things that he had his
extravagances, he loved his boat and his plane.  So
obviously you need money for that.  But there was no,
nothing else.  And there was not a single penny that
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 30
came to any of us, at any time, ever.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- so when you
are talking about your life with Mr. Epstein in the
'90s, you -- you're -- you're not -- you -- you're
very different financially.  You -- you're very
different financially positioned than he is --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- meaning he's giving you
money, he's paying for your -- when you fly, he -- I
assume pays for your flights.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Okay.  So you -- you
-- I interrupted you when you were saying how you
were functioning as a general manager.  You helped
with the New Mexico ranch.
           So did -- did your role with him continue
like that for many years or for how long?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I continued -- in
2000 -- well, in -- by 1999, our relationship had
foundered.  In --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- well, two
reasons:  We were never sleeping together again.  So
we stopped having sexual relations in 1999.  Not full
sex.  Sorry, just to be clear.  Didn't mean that we
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 31
didn't still share a bed bedroom sometimes or
whatever.  He had another girlfriend.
           TODD BLANCHE:  He had what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Other girlfriends.  I
definitively knew that it was over after 9/11,
actually, because we were both in New York and I
don't know, were you in New York on 9/11?  I mean,
9/11 ...
           And it was a scary time if you were in New
York.  You didn't know, I didn't know, nobody knew
what was going on.  And he was in 71st Street and I
was in 65th Street, my house.
           And he wouldn't see me at all.  Asked me,
his mum, who I'm very close to, who's in hospital at
Lennox Hill, just asked me to look after her.  And
then I knew, as anyone did at that time, if you're
not going to be there for someone in 9/11, you're
never going to be there.  So for me, that was the
line's end.  And he had another English girlfriend
actually, from 2000.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Are you, though, still on
his -- are you still being paid by him at this point?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- so go ahead.
           So what -- what -- at that point, when you
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 32
say you realized kind of it was over?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I mean, I'm
talking about the -- the -- I had had, there was a --
I had wanted to get married and have children.
           And Epstein had encouraged me to believe
that that would -- I don't know about the --
certainly by the mid late '90s, I knew the marriage
part was never going to happen.  I had believed that
maybe in '96, '97, '98 maybe, but then I realized it
wasn't that.  But I did think that we might have a
child, which is what I had really wanted.  And I
realized --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- so -- okay.  So what
happens between 2001 and then 2019 with your
relationship with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Give or take, 2001.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So we stopped having
physicality.  I mean, that doesn't mean we weren't
friends.  I certainly did stay, sometimes, in his
room.  I mean, friends with benefits, if you will,
just not sex.  Sorry.
           And I started dating.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I met someone that
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 33
I fell very much in love with in 2003.  His name was
Ted Waitt.  Ted Waitt, you may know as the founder of
Gateway, the computers.  And we had an amazing
relationship that ended in -- went on until 2010, I
think.  And I was with Ted from that time.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you meet him through
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Well, indirectly,
I suppose you could say so.  No, they'd never met.  I
was at a dinner where I met Ted, but it wasn't -- I
was with President Clinton.  President Clinton was my
friend, not Epstein's friend.
           And Epstein had flown him and there was a
dinner and Ted came to the dinner.  So I guess,
indirectly, through Mr. Epstein, because it was with
his plane, but I'd have been there anyway without
him.  I had -- was not the --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Was Epstein on the plane
when you guys flew?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  On that trip, yes.
Well, yes.  They -- that, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when you say the -- the
dinner was -- was where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Hong Kong.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And so the -- and
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 34
you had flown over with -- so who was on the plane
for that trip?  I don't mean everybody.
           When you said, so Mr. Epstein was on the
plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You were on the plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who else, that you can
remember?  I'm not, you know, you only remember what
you remember.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Was President Clinton on
the plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Clinton.  He would've
-- he would've had his guy, Doug Vance, maybe Jason
Cooper, maybe the two.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you -- and so why --
so -- so how do you meet -- so -- so why did you say
that's when you met him and that you met him through
Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, it was a -- I
don't think Ted would've been there, had it not been
a -- it was a President Clinton dinner and Ted came
to be with President Clinton --
           TODD BLANCHE:  I see.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not to be with
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 35
Mr. Epstein.  Does that make sense?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's why I say that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So you're -- you're,
so in the time that you're dating, that you're with
him to 2009, are you still working for Mr. Epstein
during that time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So his -- so it'd be
true to say that Jeffrey tried very hard, he tried
very hard to -- to keep me to working for him,
because this is a complex operator.
           I'm not talking about anything untoward,
just the sheer size of the projects.  I'm talking the
construction projects, the houses, the staff.  It's
a -- it's a really significant job.  And I ran all
the properties, the staff in the properties, the
management of the properties that -- and all the
construction.
           And we're talking tens of millions of
dollars for the island alone.  I can't remember what
the budget was for the construction on any given
year, it's gone.
           But it -- it was -- these are very
significant projects.  And so that was what I did.
And I managed the budgets.  Well, not, I didn't
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 36
manage the budgets, I oversaw the budgets.  So I
would just make sure that if you said you bought an
air conditioning part, I saw an air conditioning part
and I could call the island manager.
           Did you receive the Carrier, whatever, you
know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When did Mr. Epstein
purchase the island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say '96 or
'97, something like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So we're going to
come back and spend more time on the money with --
with respect to Mr. Epstein and -- and his wealth.
           But just so we can finish this, so in
2009, you end your relationship with Ted.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  2009, 2010.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can't remember if it
was '10.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So in that time
period, what happens next with -- as far as your
relationship with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't have one with
him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You don't have one with
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 37
him, like you don't see him or it's just a different
relationship?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did see -- I maybe
saw him once or twice, maybe even three times.  I
certainly went to his house once, for sure, maybe
twice.  But I was not seeing him.
           The only time that I was in touch with him
was when the things happened.  Like things, I mean,
in the press that affected me or when the CVRA case
was filed and there was like rubbish that went out,
because I needed information.
           Because I didn't know -- I didn't know
anything about what was happening and I needed his
help.  A, to under- -- I -- I-- well, that doesn't
sound right.  Let me rephrase that.  I don't mean his
help.  I meant to have answers, so that I had an
ability to defend myself, that's what I'm talking
about.  I'm not talking any- --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when does that
relationship change?  So -- so you're working -- you
talked about when your -- the physical relationship
stopped and then you're still working for him, or
with him managing his properties and being -- serving
as like a general manager.
           You then start your own relationship with
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 38
another individual from -- with Ted from 2003 till
2009 or '10.  At what point in that whole period is
there like more of a break, where you're no longer
acting as his general manager?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I -- I wanted to
have a full break when I started dating Ted.  And he
was clever.  I -- I -- I suppose it would be true to
say that I sort of viewed Mr. Epstein, at that point,
as sort of family, if you will.  Like someone I could
rely on.
           And I should have had more confidence in
myself.  I can see that now.  But at the time, given
everything that had happened in my life, I thought
that it would -- and I saw how he was with other
people like Eva, who seemed to be very comfortable
with him, and I thought this would be -- and he
always said, I was like family.
           So he worked hard to make -- maintain a
relationship with me.  He was generous with me.  He
let me use the plane, for instance, which was very
generous, he would check in with my mum.  He did
things that were meaningful to me in that time.
           And then, it may still not have worked,
but that his -- his mother, Paula, had been in a very
serious car crash.  And I -- she had become sort of
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 39
like a -- a surrogate mother for me, sort of, because
my mum wasn't there.  I could -- I could look after
her the way that I would -- sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  It's all right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The way that I
would've liked to look after my own mum.  So I became
very close to his mother.
           And she had been in a car crash and in
2004, I believe it -- it may have been 2005, I -- I
don't recall exactly.  She took a -- her health took
a serious decline.  And Epstein called me and asked
me if I could look after her.  And by looking after
her, that meant organizing her doctors, making sure
she had new clothes, making sure her house was clean.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Where was she?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She lived in -- in a
retirement establishment in -- outside of Palm Beach,
outside of -- its West Palm.  I want -- I was going
to say something like the Golden Girls, but it's not
called that.  I just don't remember what it's called.
But it was an old age -- it was a retirement home, if
you will.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Todd, I don't know, we've
been going for maybe about an hour now.
           Do you think -- is this a good time to --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 40
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah -- yeah.  So we'll
take a -- we'll take a break.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yep.
           SPENCER HORN:  All right.  So we're going
to take a break, the time is 10:56.
         (Break at 10:56 a.m. to 11:07 a.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  We're continuing the
proffer interview with Ms. Maxwell.  The time is
11:07 a.m., on Thursday, July 24th.
           TODD BLANCHE:  All right.  So just picking
up where we just stopped.  So -- so you -- you have
basically a break.  Well, not a break, that's the
wrong word, but your -- your relationship with
Mr. Maxwell [sic] -- professional and other changes
in 2003, '04?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  I mean, and
over the time that I stay with Ted, the more time I'm
with Ted, the more distance I have with him.  And
then when the arrest -- well, let's go back.
           When he -- whatever -- whatever happened
in 2005 and he became arrested in 2006.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when he's charged and
arrested in what we'll call the Florida
Investigations, that's what you're talking about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I am.
MAGNA9

Page 41
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I had -- I was not
in -- well --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, were you part of that
investigation?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did law enforcement
ever talk to you as part of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you, like, the feds
never talked to you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- the FBI never talked to
you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never even received
a phone call.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- did you -- so you didn't
receive a subpoena?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did the state law
enforcement ever reach out to you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  As far as you know, did the
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 42
government, either state or federal, subpoena your
bank records or subpoena anything from your financial
life, during that time?  During the -- that time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Not as far as I'm
aware.  Now, if they did, I don't know it and I have
-- I have no idea about that, to be honest.  But I'm
-- I'm not aware of it and I would say no, but maybe
you guys do things that I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So how did -- how did you
learn of that case?  When Mr. Epstein was arrested,
or did you know that something was happening before
then?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The -- the first thing
I knew was he had told me he was deciding to
redecorate the house in Palm Beach.  It didn't
surprise me, it was like a rolling situation.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And, but by that time are
you doing -- are you -- like he tells you because he
wants your help or your relationship changed by this
time where you were no longer kind of acting his --
as his general manager?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I was -- I was
still around.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wasn't gone.  I was
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 43
with Ted.  I was traveling.  I wasn't daily -- if you
would ask me where he was in any given time, I'm not
sure I would've known then.  I mean, it was, I -- I
felt like I suppose the relationship moved into sort
of like a long-term friend-family, you know, like --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- like I felt he had
with Eva, if I'm honest.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  So -- so he
says to you he's going to redecorate the Palm Beach
house.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He -- he asked me
specifically which decorator he thinks I -- he should
use, because I had a lot of contacts with decorators
and he was not very good with people.  He was useless
at maintaining relationships with people who worked
for him, I'm not.  So anyways, I recommended -- I
think I recommended.  I can't be a hundred percent
sure, because it's been a long time, but I think I
recommended Mark Zeff at that time.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Mark Zeff --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I believe.  And I
don't know why.  I -- I don't remember.  That's all
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 44
lost to time.  But anyway, at some point, I think his
mother had died now.  I can't remember the timing of
all of that either.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But I ended up in Palm
Beach and he had asked me to come and look at the
swatches or whatever he was doing, because they had
laid it all out over the house and various things,
and I think he'd asked for my opinion.  That's my
memory of this.
           It may also be that Ted and I were going
to Palm Beach, because Ted had a golf match or
something.  There was a reason I was in Palm Beach.
It wasn't solely -- I don't -- maybe that's not true
either.  I don't know.  So I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- there's a, you
know, sometimes I went to Palm Beach because Ted was
there.  I don't know if that's part of that time --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead -- go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- or Ted went there
and left me.  I don't know, something.
           Anyway, I was there.  No.  That's not how
that went either.  No.  Anyway, at some point in that
time, I saw all the swatches, at some point in 2005,
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 45
I think that was.  And then I believe, or I don't
remember.  I -- I think I got a phone call actually.
I wasn't in Palm Beach.  I think I got a phone call
that there was a police at his house or something.
There was a --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And would you have gotten a
phone call from him or you think you were just told
by somebody that knew that it had happened or don't
-- or don't you remember?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Definitely not him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it would've
been the houseman.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when that happens,
whenever it was, that's kind of the first time you
know that Mr. Epstein's being investigated for --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I didn't even
know what that -- I didn't even understand.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I didn't have a
context for that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was like, I didn't
even know -- I -- I didn't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So after --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 46
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I didn't -- I
didn't -- I didn't -- I'm not sure even what I
thought.  I was like, that's weird.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so after he -- after you
find out about it, what happens with your
relationship with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I asked him.  I asked
him what was going on --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and he said, I --
I -- not to worry.  Nothing, nothing, taking care.
Don't worry about it (indiscernible) and then it all
went quiet.  I didn't -- he didn't say, he didn't
share.  I wasn't part of it at all.  I was off with
Ted and I really just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did he tell you -- well,
why don't we come back to more specifics around that
time period in a few minutes --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I want to just finish
this opening part.
           So that case goes on, ultimately it ends.
What -- what -- what was your relationship like with
him during that case, when he goes, you know, when
he -- when he was sentenced.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 47
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He asked -- he -- he
-- he told me, he said, "Listen.  I'm going to jail."
I was like, "Okay."  And he goes, "I would like you
to stay on board to manage the properties, the
animals, this and that, and just stay put and I'll
continue to pay you.  In case there's any emergency,
I don't trust anyone."  And I was like, "Okay."
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, when you said
continue to pay, had he con--- has he --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He had never stopped
paying me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  He never stopped paying
you.  So even when your relationship changes, you're
getting -- does the amount increase from the $25,000
or so a year from the beginning?  Like how much are
you getting paid yearly?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it ended -- at
the time, well, we had different payment structures
and I'm happy to explain how that was, but I think
salary wise, if I'm right, it ended at around a
quarter of a million a year.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How much?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Quarter of a million.
$250,000.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when -- and when did it
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 48
end?  When was that that it stopped?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  2008, or '09.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  '09.  When did he come
out of jail?  Whenever he came out of jail.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So, and over the
years, it increased from what you said was you
thought about $25,000 to $250,000.  That's between
like '90, early '90s until 2009 or '10, whenever he
stopped; is that right?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes -- yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how were you paid?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  W2.
           TODD BLANCHE:  W2 from which -- from what
company?  Or do you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He, like I -- he just
moved me around over to this company, that, I didn't
care --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and I didn't care
and I didn't think that -- I didn't understand any
rhyme or reason, it doesn't, I just, you know,
whatever --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- so maybe --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 49
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so when he's going to go
to jail, he says, "Can you stay around and manage
everything."
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you do that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And then -- and then
we'll come back to that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, not manage
everything, no.  I mean there are other people at
this point.  My specific role then was very, very
diminished.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I reviewed the bill
structure that came from the constructions, that were
still made, the island --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and wherever else I
was going, Paris at this point, because I speak
French, I'm fluent in French.
           And also my relationship with the French
decorator was critical to him.  And in the French
component part of -- of that aspect, that was really
vital and so you would have had to find someone who
was -- well, actually, and the Spanish trilingual,
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 50
you would've had to find someone who was trilingual
to -- and that he trusted --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- to manage, not
steal from him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- so when he gets
out of jail, between that time 2009 or '10, and 2019,
what's your relationship like with -- with
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Almost nonexistent.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I had just moved
on and I just didn't want to have anything to -- I
didn't want the drama.  I didn't want to be
associated with ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  So do you recall -- when
you say "almost non-existent," does that mean --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It doesn't mean it --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- was it some phone calls,
some visits --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I definitely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- some trips, or what does
it mean?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I -- I don't -- I
don't think there were any trips.  Oh, I don't -- I
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 51
don't think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Where were you living
during that time period?  Or was it --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Which time period?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Between 2009, '10 and 2019?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was back in
New York.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So you had no -- so
when you -- so -- so your -- you had phone calls with
him on occasion?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Well, I
certainly did when it -- whenever there was any legal
drama or any like, serious press attention, I always
called him to try and find out what was going on.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Okay.  And then --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I did email him at
that time for those types of details.  It was like,
what do I do?  What, I mean, I was like ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  And -- and then when he's
charged in New York federally --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- how did you learn about
that case?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  In the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And had you, as far as you
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 52
know, been contacted by law enforcement before his
arrest?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I wasn't in an
indictment.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  I know that, but even
as a witness or -- or asking you if you would give
documents or materials?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I had never -- up
until he -- up until when my lawyers said that, I
don't even know.  I -- I had no knowledge of them
being interested in me, honestly.  I don't -- I want
to say until he had died.
           Now I know that my lawyers were in touch
with the Southern District of New York at some point
after his arrest.  I'm pretty sure that had to have
happened, right --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- but I -- my
understanding is that they had not shown any
interest.  I know my lawyers went to see them once, I
believe, and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Went to see him meaning
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, them.  So Southern
District of New York.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 53
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  The Southern
District of New York.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.  And that they
had been in regular, in touch with him and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But now you're talking
about after Mr. Epstein died or are you talking about
before he died?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think, I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  If you can remember.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Easily verifiable.  I
-- my memory is that they were in touch with him when
he was arrested.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if
anything happened until after his death, then after
that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think they saw
them -- met with them, Southern District of New York
I'm talking about now, until after he died.  I know
that they were in regular telephone contact with them
and that my lawyers believed that they had been told
that there was no interest in me --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and were absolutely
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 54
stunned when I was arrested.  But maybe stunned is
too big a word, but surprised.  I certainly was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So let's -- okay.
So that's -- that's -- was a long description of --
of what was a very long life and that was very
helpful.  So I want to go back and talk more
specifically now about particular areas, and, but
that was a -- a very helpful kind of foundation
for -- for us.
           The first -- the first thing I want to
talk about, you talked about earlier on, about
Mr. Epstein's financial success.  What -- you know,
do you know how he -- when you first meet him, at
some point you say, "I got this place for you to
rent, you can't afford it."  And he laughs at you and
says, "Yes.  I can."
           What did you learn about his wealth and
how he was -- and how he accumulated his money?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can tell you what he
told me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I -- I know that he
was hired from working at a private school whose name
eludes me at this point.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Dalton.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 55
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Dalton.  He was
working at Dalton, he was a math teacher.  And he
met, I think it was Ace, I'm not sure.  He met
someone from Bear who hired him, because he was very
good at math.  And I believe that he then worked on
creating a trading of, oh, my gosh.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Just describe it.  It's
okay.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He came -- came up
with some new type of trading system.  Not -- not a
system so much, but as a -- as a -- as a --as
vehicle.  A trading vehicle.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm just escaping
right now.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And this is while -- while
he was working at -- at Bear Stearns?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  At Bear Stearns.  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And, well --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And was this before you met
him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So this is what he told
you.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 56
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What you learned?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  This is what he
told me --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- himself.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so -- and then
eventually he starts a financial firm?  Do you know
that to be true or no?  J. Epstein & Company.  You
ever heard of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it's, yeah.
Yes.  So hang on a minute.  So I -- this I did not
know, but this I have subsequently learned --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- is that he had some
problem or some issue at Bear Stearns and there was
some, I don't know, disagreement.  He wasn't fired,
because obviously he was still very friendly with Ace
and with Jimmy, at least by the time I met him, but
they were working with him and he ran -- he had cli-
-- money at Bear Stearns, and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- his money, his
client's money.  We'll -- I'll come to that.
           But he started -- he told me himself that
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 57
he started a business where he looked for stolen
money.  So if somebody -- let's see.  I'm trying to
think of some intelligent way to say it, but I can't
think of anything, I've been with -- not great --
I'll -- I'll give it to you.
           So let's say you have El Chapo, oh God, I
don't know where he comes from.  But anyway, we've
got El Chapo.  And El Chapo's laundering money or
still -- he's working with the Sinaloa Cartel and he
steals money from the Sinaloa Cartel and he moves it
to wherever.  So he's got stolen money from the
Sinaloa, goes to it.  This didn't happen.  I'm just
--
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah -- yeah.  I
understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- just coming up with
something in my head.  And the Sinaloa says to
Epstein, "Can you track down my billion dollars that,
the car- -- the other cartel stole from me?"  And
Epstein will go and find the billion dollars and will
take a portion of the money that was stolen at a fee
and give back the remainder.  That would be on a
percentage basis.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  But like what you just
described, which I appreciate what you said, a
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 58
hypothetical --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The -- the -- please,
that was completely hypothetical.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- but that -- but that
would involve like, so two kind of drug cartels
stealing from each other.
           Practically speaking, did -- he was a --
more of a businessman, correct?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So here's how I think
that started, is that he had a girlfriend.  It was
always you -- you -- always to the girls.  I guess
there was a girl whose name will come back to me,
maybe not, whilst we're here, but I don't know,
maybe.  There's a woman --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- there's always a
woman.  And he -- she was the daughter of a
billionaire, for instance.  And that billionaire,
whoever his --whatever his name was, had had some
money stolen.  And for some reason this woman
introduced Jeffrey, and Jeffrey, I think that's how
that business started.  That's what I remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And is that something he
told you about or something that happened while you
knew him?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 59
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Something he told
me before I met him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so when you meet him
and -- and once you're part of his life in the early
to mid '90s, what is he doing to make money that you
see?  He -- does he have clients?  Does he have rich
clients?  Does he have famous clients?  And -- and
how -- and what -- if he does have clients, what
service is he providing them?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He does have -- well,
obviously there's the one very famous client that
everybody talks about, which is Les Wexner.  That was
a very important client to him.  And he -- I think
it's probably helpful to describe what I imagine --
what I imagine, know -- would I know to be true about
what he managed for Les.  And there's some bits that
I'll be improvising --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I want to just make
you understand, I was not part of Epstein's business
world, except tangentially and obviously.  So what
I'm talking about is I -- what I observed or what I
overheard or what I saw within the business, but I
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 60
wasn't responsible for any of the client's money or
anything like that.  So it's separate.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Yeah.  I understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So with Les, for
instance, it was really all encompassing.  It could
go from the structure of the business.  So he
would -- he structured or restructured The Limited.
           I know that, and I'll come back to that
because I also traveled with him and Les, and I was
in business meetings with them on the plane when they
were there.  So I could observe and I could hear some
of this.
           And whilst I'm not necessarily terribly
business sophisticated, I'm sophisticated enough to
be able to at least have some knowledge of what was
happening.
           All right.  So then he restructured the
business.  He restructured his entire personal
finances, and would also handle all of the investment
strategy.  I don't know if it was -- if it was a
hundred percent --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Mr.  Wexner is what you're
saying?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 61
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.  Yes.  All --
this is all Wexner I'm talking about now.
           So let's say you had a billion dollars to
invest.  So you would, you know, in people's normal
investment portfolios, you would have, you know, some
T-bonds and this and that, but Epstein's strategies
would be much more sophisticated than that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so just staying with
Mr. Wexner.  Does -- from what you heard or saw, is
Mr. Epstein paid by him in percentages?  Like so --
so there would be a deal and he would be paid or
was -- did you understand it to be like a flat fee?
Was he a business partner?  Like how did you
understand him to be paid?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was more ?
la carte.  So let's say this is a conversation I
actually -- Epstein told me.  So all -- illustrated
for me, said if I saved someone $5 billion, he would
take a flat percentage of that $5 billion.  He
wouldn't have $5 billion back, and he would take --
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you say you think
that, is that because you heard him talking about
that or you -- you ...
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It would be a
combination of both.  He certainly told me that and I
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 62
heard him talk to people like that.  I couldn't --
sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No -- no.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- was there -- did --
did he give -- did Mr. Wexner gift a property in
New York to Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So we're talking about
71st Street.  So I don't know what the business deal
was, because, again, I'm not part of his business
thing, but I think what happened would be that, let's
say Les owed him in, theoretically, for his services,
$100 million or whatever it was.  He could have
traded that against the property.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But do you know that that
happened or that's -- are you -- are you kind of --
do you remember whether there was conversations about
that or are you just thinking that could be one way
that it happened?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not sure.  And I'm
not trying to be -- I just don't remember if that's
something I know or if that's something that I
remember, or if it's something that I subsequently
know.  I believe -- I believe that to be what
happened, but I don't want to tell you that I have --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 63
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that make sense?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did Mr. Wexner and
Mr. Epstein -- are you aware of they -- of their
falling out that they ultimately had?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think -- I wasn't
there and I don't know how it happened.  I only know
what Les has said in the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you only know about
their, you know, their falling out or whatever you
want to call it, from what you've kind of read, not
from any firsthand knowledge?  You did -- you weren't
there, you weren't part of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know somebody named
Steven Hoffenberg?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Only from the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And so you don't
know anything about whatever business relationship
they may have had, Mr. Epstein --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never spoke about him,
never mentioned it.  I -- I only learned about that,
whatever that is, even -- I don't even know what the
truth is of that story, from the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How about Leon Black?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 64
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, I did meet Leon.
I do know Leon.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When do you remember -- and
again, I know we're talking about a very long time
ago, but do you remember approximately when you met
him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I could have met Leon,
not really -- so I might have met him, nothing to do,
because Leon Black is very good friends with other
friends of mine.  I would've met him, when I say
socially, I might have met him.  How Leon and Epstein
became really good friends, I don't -- I'm not sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But not through you, as far
as you recall?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Not through me as
far as I know.  No.  I -- in fact, I'm -- I'm sure
that's not through me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know what kind of
work Mr. Epstein was doing for Mr. Black over the
years?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Same as what he did
for Wexner.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So we just talked about two
individuals.  And again, I know we're talking about
a, maybe a 15-year time period or even longer.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 65
           How many clients like that did Mr. Epstein
have?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But why don't I just
give you the names that I remember and that's --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Why won't I just give
you the names.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Do you want the names?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Elizabeth Johnson --
Johnson & Johnson.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When did -- as far as you
know, when did the relationship between Ms. Johnson
and Mr. Epstein start?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  '90s.  '90 -- I
don't -- I -- '95, '96.  '90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So during the time period?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  We're talking
'90s.  We're talking when I was there.  When I was
around.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how did the
relationship start?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know how he
became that friendly where he ended up managing her
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 66
money, I wasn't there.  I mean, he -- I really had a
separate life.  We really had separate lives --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- except where they
synced.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But it wasn't from --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It wasn't from me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- from you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  It was not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And what's your
understanding of what Mr. Epstein did for
Ms. Johnson?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Same as what he did
for Wexner.  And when I -- and you have to
understand, it -- it went down to, in tiny details.
So I remember this -- I remember, this is an actual
memory, that he would make the contracts for the
maids, for the people who worked in their homes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So he would assist his
clients, at times, with -- you're saying with even
small things like contractual relations with --
with --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He said no detail was
too small, because everything that affected how they
lived and how they managed their life, was something
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 67
that he felt he was -- if they want, he would be
responsible for, to make sure that the contract -- so
that if you had to fire someone, it wouldn't come
back and sue you or if that -- that sort of ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So Mr. Black,
Mr. Werner [sic] -- Ms. Johnson.  Who else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What's the name of the
woman from Ohio (inaudible).
           TODD BLANCHE:  Know someone named
Jes Staley.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  I do know Jes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who's that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He was at Morgan
Stanley and at Barclays.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do -- do you know
whether he and Mr. Epstein had a relationship?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, not a -- not a
physical one.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Business one.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I didn't suggest.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry, I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  I'm saying a -- a
relationship in the broadest sense of word; business,
personal --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 68
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- both.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Both.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And do you know when
they met?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I -- no.  I don't
know when they met.  But you can time it.  Well, I
don't know that you can.  No.  I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So, but what was the nature
of their relationship, as far as you know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think they were
friends and I think that they were business partners.
Well, partners, too strong a word, but they were --
they did business together.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So did you -- again, I want
to stay focused on the time where you were the most
involved in his life, so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The '90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- the early '90s through
early 2000s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the beginning --
beginning of the 2000s, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did you -- so we
talked about four people, so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There's more.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 69
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- were there more?  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, yes.  There were
more.  There was a lady whose name I just can't --
can I get my book?  Maybe I wrote them down.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  (Indiscernible)
Epstein wouldn't really let me meet his clients.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What book are you using?
What is that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wrote some notes for
the meeting.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Great.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Is that alright?
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  That's fine.  I just
was curious what -- what we're looking at.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, okay.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Not the birthday book.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It's not the birthday
book.  No.  We are going to come to that, I'm sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All right.  I wrote
down some names because I tried to make -- I just
want you to understand my -- my memory's not as good
as it was, because when I was in Brooklyn, I was in
the SHU for almost two years, and I was on suicide
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 70
watch for almost two years, which meant that they
woke me up every 15 minutes for the entire time.  And
it's -- it really did affect my ability to ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I'm not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you've taken some notes
in anticipation --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just made some names
in -- in advance for this --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  So go ahead.
So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and you're happy to
look at them as well, if you want.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  Go -- go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Oh, well, funny
you say, first two names.  One is Wexner, two is
Staley, three is Leon Black.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Glenn Dubin was a
client.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who's that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Eva Dubin's husband.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  What was their, I
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 71
mean, if you can -- do you know when -- about when
that relationship started?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Whenever -- well,
wouldn't have been before they got married, for sure.
So if you're going to start -- you're going to date
that from wherever that was.
           And then Epstein was heavily involved with
Highbridge Capital and the financing or selling of
Highbridge to JP Morgan.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Go ahead.
Eva Dubin.  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  You're only
looking for clients, so, all right.  There's a
woman -- well he -- there's a woman in Ohio.  I just
can't think of her name, but it will -- I tried to
remember it yesterday and I can't.
           DAVID MARKUS:  So this is a good thing.
Like, you know, as you think of things, write it
down, and if they have any other names, they'll ask
you.  But you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Just --
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- don't -- don't force it
out.  So -- so you'll have time to think about this,
especially today, this afternoon, overnight --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 72
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- because we'll probably
meet tomorrow.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But you can find them.
I mean, if you basically find a billionaire female.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So the woman in Ohio who's
wealthy, that you worked with.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And well, you can
identify her yourself because she had the largest
Klein painting.  That was huge.  So you can find her,
because it'll be in a museum.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So that's her.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so he -- that was one
of Mr. Epstein's clients?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  She was one of
Mr. client -- Mr. Epstein's clients as well?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Who else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I think that
there was people, other people that he would, like,
assist.  I know that he helped Lynn Forester, who
became Lynn de Rothschild.  She'll deny it and she
has, but she -- she can't.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 73
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when you say "help,"
the same help in business or what help?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, so-- so -- I
have no idea what he did for her.  I know he helped
her financially.  Her husband was the controller of
New York.  So, but I don't -- again, I'm not inside
his business, but he would've -- his -- his -- this
notion that he black -- blackmailed men or we don't
really have to go there, that he wasn't a businessman
and that everything he did was a fraud or a funk or
what -- I don't believe that to be true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you -- so you say
you don't believe it to be true, but show me why you
think that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Just from -- I know you've
been talking about it, that he was very -- he was
very conscientious.  He was very good at math.  He
was -- took, paid a lot of attention to his clients,
but -- but yes.  You're right.  There's allegations
of -- of blackmail or also that -- that there was
some level of -- of fraud involved in what he did,
and you don't believe it.  Why do you -- why do you
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 74
say that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I -- let me
rephrase that.  If there was fraud, I never saw it.
What I saw or what I felt when I -- his -- I ran that
office.  I mean, ran.  I didn't -- I was responsible
for the staff.  People worked.  There were lawyers,
there were accountants.  I never heard him -- I never
-- wit- -- I never felt anything, I don't know, icky.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Did -- did you ever see him
blackmail a --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- a client?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Did you ever see him
blackmail a -- an -- a friend or an acquaintance?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, so I think when folks
talk about block -- blackmail, and we can talk about
-- sorry about that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We can talk about that now.
There are a lot of allegations about him, which
we'll -- which we should talk about and we can do
that now.  And the fact that he abused young women.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 75
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Full stop.  Okay.  Which
means, the way that I'm defining abuse, as has been
widely reported, is that -- that he would cause young
women in high school to be recruited to come to his
house and give him massages.  And a part of -- and
the -- and the -- and as part of that, he would
sexually abuse them, okay?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I want to talk about
that.  But as it relates to blackmail, the question
is whether you're aware of any time, that any of the
individuals we're talking about, and we'll talk about
others, received massages from women who were under
or may have been under 18.
           And that whether there was any sexual
assaults or sexual contact between any of these
people and those masseuses, which would've allowed
then, Mr. Epstein, potentially, to blackmail them and
say, "You have to continue to work with me or you
have to give me money, or else I'm going to tell the
world that -- that -- that you did this."
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  I -- I think
this is a really good place to start with how this
story began.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 76
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So even, let's assume
that that premise is correct, that he was doing that
and he was going to tell everybody, going to say,
"oh, you know, you had inappropriate relations with
an underage girl."  If you don't have a video or
photograph, photographic evidence, because I -- I'm
not sure that even the FBI would take that.  Well,
maybe today, but certainly not back then, would take
that seriously.
           So you have to have something to say,
"Hey, you know, look, I've got this video of you
doing terrible things and you need to."  So I built
those houses, many of them.  I decorated those
houses.  I put the electricians in for the wiring.  I
never wired, nor saw, a single house that had any
type of inappropriate, let's say, video surveillance.
           And I'll define that for you.
Inappropriate surveillance would mean in a bathroom,
in a bedroom, in any private area of a home.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In a room where there were
massages given?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Inappropriate.  I
would say I would define "appropriate" surveillance
to be the front door of a house, or potentially, as
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 77
in 71st Street, the physical plant.  Anywhere else
would be grotesque.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I just want to come back
to -- I know I'm just hopefully stating the obvious,
but when you say "the houses," you're talking about
his New York --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- brownstone?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You're talking about the
island in -- in the Caribbean?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You're talking about the
residence in Palm Beach?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you're talking about
the ranch in New Mexico?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Anywhere else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Paris.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And in Paris.  And so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the plane.  I saw
some ridiculous thing with the plane --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the plane.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- that was what we're
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 78
doing.  Yes.  I didn't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I didn't hire any
electrician on the plane.  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so unequivocally,
unequivocally from what you know, and you only know
what you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I only know what I
know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- but from what you know,
you do not believe a camera exists, or a video camera
or a camera that takes pictures, inside any of his
residences?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So even the appropriate
cameras that you just talked about, which would be
kind of exterior security cameras, did you know
whether there was any cameras, that you're aware of,
inside any of the locations?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never, with one
exception.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  What's the
exception?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The exception is
Palm Beach.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 79
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the reason -- so
in Palm Beach, Epstein was having money stolen.  He
noticed money was being stolen from his briefcase,
call it his briefcase.  And he called in the
Palm Beach police and they, the Palm Beach police
installed cameras on where he kept his briefcase.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Where was that?  Do you
remember?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  At his desk in -- so
the house on the ground floor was -- he had a desk,
sort of in a corner.  There was that camera.  I think
there was another camera.  I think there were two or
maybe three cameras.  I believe only on the ground
floor, wherever he may have had -- maybe he had
another office in the cabana.  There may have been a
camera there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was this?  I'm not
looking for an exact date, but what time period are
you thinking about when you say this?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  2003.  I think I can
date it for you precisely, actually, 2003.  I'm
pretty firm on that date.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I can be firm
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 80
because John Alessi, the butler was fired in the end
of 2002 and he was the thief.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So aside from law
enforcement installing a camera, to try to catch
somebody stealing money from Mr. Epstein, you're not
aware of any cameras at the island -- no.  Sorry.
You're -- just so we record it because ...
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry -- sorry --
sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  That's okay.  You were
nodding your head no.
           So what about --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No cameras anywhere,
outside of, possibly, things that would -- I would
consider -- myself, I would consider normal.  So the
garage gate, something like that, a front door.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Outside, like security
cameras?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Security cameras.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  I -- I --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And there were cameras
inside in the 71st Street that did the plant, the
physical plant, because it was a commercial building.
So you had the whole -- that's a real thing there.
It's a commercial building.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 81
           And there were -- there was one camera on
the -- on the front door, internal, from the internal
that did the front door, as I recall.  But I -- there
were no other cameras inside the house.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever -- how about
photographs.  Did you ever observe Mr. Epstein, or
anybody around him, take pictures of anybody in
compromising positions with women or with -- or with
anybody?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever hear, when you
were present for conversations that Mr. Epstein was
having, or others were having, anybody accuse him of
blackmailing them or of trying to extort them,
because of something Mr. Epstein knew?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  There have been -- and --
and you -- you -- in the discovery you got in the
New York case, okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And in the civil cases that
you've been part of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- associated with
Mr. Epstein, have you ever been given or ever been
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 82
told that video exists, like what we're talking
about, or photos were taken that -- that were
compromising?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So in the -- in both
of those, I never received no pictures or anything
from the civil case.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But in the criminal
case, I received videos of Epstein talking to women
and stuff like that.  I did get those.  I also saw
binders, photographs of women and (indiscernible).  I
never saw any, well, I don't know -- I don't know how
old some of these women were.  There were definitely
some of the victims from Palm Beach, the photographs
of them in -- in -- without clothing.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And in that -- in those
photographs, were -- the victims that were
photographed, were there any of the people you've
talked about?  Like, were there men with the victims
or were they just photographs of the victims?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There was no men with
these pictures.  There was no client of his with
those pictures.  They would be standalone, for want
of a better word, like modeling shots.  If you
were -- if you -- if you were, I don't know.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 83
           DAVID MARKUS:  Pictures that Epstein had
with the girls, but not Epstein with the clients and
the girls.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- I understand you
said you got those in the discovery.  Did you know
those -- those pictures -- pictures like that
existed?
           So right now I'm talking about photographs
of victims or photographs of women that Mr. Epstein
had on his computer or wherever he had them.  Did you
know that those photos existed before you got them in
discovery?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Some of them,
absolutely, because they were in his house.  Some of
these pictures were on his, you know, credenza or
whatever.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Some pictures I've
simply never seen before.  I mean, there was -- I --
I had never seen some of them.  Some of them I had,
some of them I hadn't, I mean.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- so -- so you're
right, and I -- I accept that having video or
photographs of somebody famous or powerful in a
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 84
compromising position, would be good blackmail.
           But -- so separate -- putting aside what
you've said about the fact that you don't know of any
existence of those, did you observe, over the years,
the folks we're talking about, or others which we can
talk about, getting massages from young women?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I -- I just -- I
think it's really helpful to understand a few things
that has been missed in this whole mishigas.
           DAVID MARKUS:  That's a technical term.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I'll look it up later.
           Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I thought about this
obviously a lot and I've given it --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- some -- so this is
the benefit of -- some benefit of what I saw and some
benefit of what I now think, so just for clarity's
sake.
           I think -- I just want to say for the
record, that I do believe that Epstein did a lot of,
not all, but some of what he's accused of.  And I'm
not here to defend him in any respect whatsoever.  I
don't want to, and I don't think he requires, nor
deserves any type of protection or -- from me in any
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 85
way, to sugarcoat what he did or didn't do.  So
there's that.
           However, the man I met and the man he
became, I believe that there is a progression, and I
don't think that the man I met is the man that he
became.  I believe he became that man over a period
of time.
           Now we can discuss anything you want and
I'll tell you everything I know, but I think somebody
who has an interest, however you define that, in
underage people is obviously someone who is unwell.
But I don't think that you wake up one day and you
start doing what he's accused of.  I think this is
something that you develop or you progress to.  I --
I think, because --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Ghislaine, before -- before
you get into all that, let's answer the top line
question and then get into it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  The top line
question is?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Did you ever see any of
these people with underage women?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No -- no.  I -- so the
reason I'm saying that is not -- is not to avoid that
question, but it's because by the time, when you were
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 86
talking in the '90s, I don't think he was there.
I -- there's that description.  I think that this,
what you were talking about is a later version.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  And --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that -- is that?
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  I understand that and
I do want to talk -- I'm not --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it's just I'm -- I
think you need to separate the periods of time --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- because it --
this -- one of the things that was definitely missing
in my trial, and definitely missing from the
narrative, is this notion, this, everything happened
and he was always but -- no.  I don't -- I don't
believe that to be true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I mean, that --
that's -- that's fine.  And I do want to talk about
that.  I'm not -- I'm not pushing that away.  I'm
just putting it aside for a moment.
           What Mr. Epstein did and -- and, frankly,
what -- what you did, or are accused of doing, is one
thing that I -- that we'll talk about, but what --
right now what I want to understand is -- is whether
one of the ways that Mr. Epstein befriended his
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 87
clients or -- or took care of them, or some would say
blackmail them, was by encouraging them to have -- to
interact with -- with women, underage or not.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I think in the
'90s, he may have encouraged them, but these were
people who were in their 20s or 30s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- so.  Understand that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  May have -- so he
would have a masseuse, right?  And he did, male and
female, by the way, in the '90s, that's never been
discussed.  Both in yoga and everything, there were
men as well as women.
           And so if he would travel, and I can show
them to you, I highlighted them on the flight record,
so you could see that there really were men that were
also there.  He would say, would you like to do yoga
with Tito?  Or would you like a massage with this
one?  But they would be in their late 20s and
professional masseuses.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I think there's a
distinction.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I want to talk about
actual individuals here.  But -- and I understand the
distinction between somebody who's an adult and --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 88
and -- and someone who's underage.
           But even with somebody who's an adult, did
you know Mr. Epstein to encourage folks to do that,
whether it's a client or somebody else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So with a -- with a --
I certainly witnessed him.  So if you were staying
with him and you had a massage that -- he would often
travel with a masseuse.  He would say, hey, would you
like a massage?  And he did do that, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But would you or him or
anybody else follow up with the masseuse afterwards,
to find out if there was any inappropriate sexual
contact?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never did, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So meaning -- and then
coming back to the blackmail issue.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  There's nothing wrong with
getting a massage, Of course not.  Especially, you
know, especially if somebody's obviously an adult, a
masseuse.  There's -- I'm not quibbling with that.
           But my question is that there's a lot of
accusations that -- that one of the way Mr. Maxwell,
I'm sorry, Mr. Epstein was successful, was -- was
through this idea of blackmail.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 89
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And yes, young -- young
women and -- and is a crime.  Children are -- is a
crime.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But even women over the age
of 18, if -- if Mr. Epstein encouraged these men or
whomever to get massages and have inappropriate
sexual contact with the masseuses, that's -- that's a
separate issue.  Maybe -- maybe slightly nuanced, but
did you ever know him to do that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I never did
absolutely myself.  I never heard him ask someone.  I
never -- I never heard that.  I never -- no one -- in
the entire time I was with him or friends with him,
or had anyone, no one ever reported to me or came to
me and said that anything inappropriate happened or
was upset by -- I never saw a tear.  I never saw ever
any of that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when you say, "No one
reported to me," meaning like the masseuses --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or any of the house
staff --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 90
           DAVID MARKUS:  Or the clients.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or the clients
themselves?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- so let's --
again, I want to stay -- and -- and coming back now
to what you were talking about a moment ago with
Mr. Epstein's kind of progression or -- or -- or
getting worse.  So just staying within the '90s.
           What role -- what did -- what role did you
have or what did you observe -- which are two
different issues, but both important -- with respect
to recruiting masseuses to come to either, I guess,
Palm Beach or to travel, or eventually New Mexico.
What role did you have in that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He asked me to find
masseuses for him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He asked me if I could
find him masseuses.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Like, as part of --
like you said, you were his general manager.  As part
of all your -- your duties, that was one of them?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I did do that.  So
the first person I believe that I introduced him to
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 91
as a masseuse was somebody called 
.  She
was, I don't know, mid, late 20s.  Professional
masseuse.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And was this something that
happened early on in your relationship or -- and
again, I know we're talking about the '90s, but are
we talking about early '90s or is this later on?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So in terms of
massage, I am a -- I have a lot of injuries.  I do a
lot of dangerous sports and have had multiple serious
accidents, and walk without any lameness, because of
physical therapy and massage.  I've -- that to me is
a very -- it's medicinal for me.
           So Epstein, whatever his massage
situation, whatever -- he loved massage.  And if I
met somebody who I thought was a good masseuse or
masseur, I introduced them.
           And he -- because I got them, and he asked
me if I did, and I said yes.  And that's -- I'm
pretty sure that would've -- well, I don't remember.
'93, '92, from the beginning.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- so go ahead.  So then
what happens over the next, you know, like there's
been -- there's a ton of writing and a ton of, I
guess, testimony as well, but also public reporting,
DOJ REDACTION
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 92
about how the recruiting was a very aggressive effort
that you were a part of, that he was a part of, and
others, to try to find more and more masseuses.
           What -- is that -- is that true, and what
role did you have in that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That was partially
true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it is true that I
found masseuses and he became more insistent.  He --
he -- he liked new all the time.  He got bored.  So
he would be bored with a masseuse and he would say,
find me a new masseuse.
           I am the entire opposite.  If I find
someone that I like, I stay with them.  I'm like, I
don't want new.  He would drive for new.  So that is
true.
           And in my effort to find them, I would go
to massage spas, like legitimate spas.  Not -- we're
not talking, you know, funky ones that people have.
           So -- and I -- if I got a massage from
somebody in a spa, that was -- I liked -- I liked, I
asked them if they would do home visits.  If they
said yes, I would ask them to come to the house and
he would see if he liked them or not.  But these were
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 93
people who worked in spas.  I never, ever checked
their age and I never checked their credentials.  I
never asked for a certificate.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What --
           DAVID MARKUS:  But just to be clear, you
never thought anybody was under 18?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never crossed -- I
never -- no.  That was never my -- that was never a
drive.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- what did you know
at the time about him, Mr. Epstein, requiring
masseuses to be naked or requiring masseuses to
either perform sexual favors for Mr. Epstein or to be
there if Mr. Epstein masturbated or things like that.
           And again, I'm asking you about a 15-year
period or whatever, 10-year period.  So I appreciate,
it's a very broad question.  So answer it in a way
that, you know, addresses what you've been charged
with doing, but also what's been said about you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So I don't --
the '90s, I don't think that I ever thought -- that
never would cross my mind.  I'm not sure that I
thought about that in those contexts at all, until
his arrest and those papers came out.  But I believe
the -- the subject of the -- the question that you're
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 94
asking me, I believe started in the 2000s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In the 2000 time period?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  2000.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you -- why do you
think --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  2000.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like what -- what in your
mind makes you think that that's the time that it
started?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think because in
December of 2001, he met 
  And I
think 
 was responsible for that in
its entirety.
           And the reason I believe that, so this --
she -- she was a self-confessed having been sexually
abused as a young girl, and was trained -- her words
I'm quoting now, not mine, in all the arts of
whatever that is, the sex program by a man called Ron
Eppinger, who was her pimp from when she was 14, I
believe, or 15, I don't know.
           And in her book describes him training her
to be what every man wants in all its manners,
fellatio and everything else.  I believe that then
what happened was that he met her, and she came as a
masseuse to his house, in December of 2001 is when I
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDACTION
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 95
think it started.
           Now, what their relationship was or what
happened with them in that early period of time, I
cannot say.  What I can say is that he liked her and
she started to travel with him at that time period.
           I believe -- I know, then, what happened
was that she -- when she first started to see him or
first came into his orbit as his masseuse or
whatever, she was engaged to be married and wearing
an engagement ring, and was living with her fianc?.
           She broke up after a few months, with her
fianc?, and took up with the local drug dealer.  So
let's say after four or five months of -- in the time
period when she was seeing Epstein, let's say we're
now May, June of 2002 or is it 2000.  I can't
remember.
           From whenever she hits the -- whatever
that is if that's 2000.  I think it's 2000.  I'm
sorry.  I think it's when she met him.  December of
2000.  So -- so then you go through -- I don't
remember.  You'll have to look.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  I'm not holding you
to exact dates.  I'm not --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I mean, I'm just
trying to -- I'm giving the --
MAGNA9

Page 96
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I appreciate.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So then I think -- so
she -- she takes up with the local drug dealer and
she becomes druggie, druggie.  Like, you know, how
druggies -- well, maybe you don't.  I live with a lot
in Tallahassee.  They become even more unreliable
than normal.
           And at some point, she's now working
somewhere else.  He stopped seeing her, because he
doesn't like people who do drugs.  And I think that
not seeing her lasted five or six months.  And in
that period of time, she got arrested for theft, and
she had a warrant out for her arrest.
           Now, this I've pieced together because
this piece I didn't know.  She then called Epstein
to -- to have help avoiding the warrant for her
arrest, and he sent her to Thailand to get a massage
therapy license.  This is the bit that I guess.  This
is the bit that I extrapolated.
           In the period of time from when she came
back to when she left, he asked her to replace
herself as his masseuse or whatever -- whatever she
was doing, and she brought the first replacement for
her.  That would've been one of the accusers in my
case, I think, would've been 
.

           And that -- and then everyone who came
subsequent to 
 or simultaneously, if she
wasn't the first, I don't know.  Everyone -- every
single person who came to his house, came through
 and her boyfriend, Tony, and then whoever
else underneath her.  And that is how it started.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So before her --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Tony Figueroa.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Tony Figueroa is her
boyfriend.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Before her -- so now going
back in the '90s.  You don't believe that Mr. Epstein
was abusing masseuses?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Underage?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Or over age?  I mean, I
think -- well, I'm using abuse in the broadest sense
of word, because I'm assuming that you -- you --
you -- you -- you -- you said that you have no idea
of the year -- you-- you always assumed the masseuses
were over age, right?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when I'm talking about
abuse, I'm even talking about an adult masseuse who
comes in to give a massage and is told to take off
their clothes, told they're not going to get paid if

they don't take off their clothes.  Basically
suggested they had to watch him masturbate.  Like the
things that have been publicly said about what he
did.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  For now I'm not -- I'm not
distinguishing adults or -- or -- or young or
underage women for that.  I'm saying abuse.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm -- I'm going to
think that that would've been a habit.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm going to say that
the massage game was a habit.  And I think --
           DAVID MARKUS:  What does that mean?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That means that I'm
sure that he didn't suddenly start having relations
with masseuses in 2002.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I am sure he must have
had relations with masseuses, who knows when.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you're saying, as far
as you -- I -- I used the word abuse.  You're saying
that as far as you sit here today, you would describe
that more as consensual?  Meaning the masseuse did
those -- did this willingly?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 99
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I saw him with
lots of masseuses.  I never saw a single masseuse
ever look unhappy or not come back or whatever.  So
based on my observation, I don't think that if you
are being raped, as now he's like this prolific -- I
just -- I just can't imagine why you would return.
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's not what you
observed at the time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not what I observed at
the time, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I want to -- we're -- we're
going to spend a little -- we're going to spend more
time on this issue, because I -- I think it's
important.  But just going back to kind of the -- the
question that I started with in this area, which is
that it ties into the blackmail issue.
           So we talked about people that were his
clients, and you've mentioned President Clinton, and
then early on --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, I never said he
was a client.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I -- I did not say you
said.  I'm saying when you talk about his clients.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, okay.  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  And puts his clients
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 100
off the side.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then you mentioned some
other people.  You mentioned President Clinton --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- you mentioned President
Trump early on.
           Who were other famous/politicians, who
were other individuals in Mr. Epstein's life during
that time period?  So the early '90s --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was the '90s.
Let's -- should we just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Congressman
McMillen.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  McMillen.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Henry Rosovsky, who
was the provost of Harvard.  Hang on (Indiscernible).
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.  You're looking at
your -- your -- your notes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Joe Pagano, Jerry

Page 101
Goldsmith, Joe Roberts, Kenny Lipper, Dan Abramson.
           I don't know if in the '90s Tom Pritzker,
Ace, Jimmy Cayne, Lou Ranieri.  I mean, there were --
           TODD BLANCHE:  What about the royal
family?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  He didn't know
them in the '90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What about the -- the --
what about Prince Andrew?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Didn't know him in the
'90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When did --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, well -- is that
right?
           TODD BLANCHE:  I wouldn't know.  I do not
know.  So I don't want you to have -- to worry about
exact dates.  You're -- you're not positive about
that.  But you don't have a specific recollection of
that being in the '90s?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I can -- I can
date it for you, I think, but I can't give you --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's okay.  I think
that's fine.

           So with respect to just -- and we'll --
we'll take a break in a minute to get some food.  But
just with respect to Mr. -- with respect to the
individuals you just talked about.  So again, focus
on the '90s.
           And so the people that I'm talking about
right now, and we might add some names later.  So
we're talking about the -- the clients that he worked
with, which you've mentioned several of.  And I know
that that wasn't exhaustive, but you mentioned
several of them.
           And then the -- the kind of what -- what I
called famous friends, but the -- the prominent
individuals that were in his life in the '90s.
Did -- did -- does any stick out in your mind as
having received massages?  All of them.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Henry Rosovsky
received a massage.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And why do you -- why does
that stick out in your memory?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because I saw him in a
bathrobe at 71st Street, and he had received a
massage, he told me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether
that -- whether there was any -- whether the masseuse
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 103
was naked during that massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wouldn't have any
idea.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether he --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I doubt it.  He was
like in his 80s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I doubt it.  He was
like in his 80s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- but do you
know -- notwithstanding his age --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Minsky, sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say that again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Minsky was another
person.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether, for
example, President Clinton ever received a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't believe he
did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what makes you say you
don't believe he did?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, because I
don't -- so that's a good question.  The time that
Epstein and President Clinton spent together, the
only times I believe -- well, obviously they
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 104
traveled.  There was that, you know, the plane, they
went on the plane 26 times or whatever.  That would
be one journey.
           So they spent time on the plane together,
and I don't believe there was ever a massage on the
plane.  So that would've been the only time that I
think that President Clinton could have even received
a massage.  And he didn't, because I was there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you mentioned that
early -- in the very beginning of the conversation,
you mentioned President Trump in the early '90s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- what's -- what did
you observe, as far as President Trump, and his
relationship with you or Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I just want to
say for my relationship with President Trump --
relationship's a big word -- but I just want to say
that I met him or I believe I may have, because of my
father in the '90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yep.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So my father liked him
very much, and he was loved -- really liked his wife
as well, because we were both Czechoslovakian.
           And as far as I'm concerned, President
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 105
Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me.
And I just want to say that I find -- I -- I admire
his extraordinary achievement in becoming the
President now.  And I like him, and I've always liked
him.  So that is the sum and substance of my entire
relationship with him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What about Mr. Epstein's
relationship with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know how they
met, and I don't know how they became friends.  I
certainly saw them together and I remember the few
times I observed them together, but they were
friendly.  I mean, they seemed friendly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was that in social settings
or was that in private settings?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe I only ever
saw them in social settings.  I don't recall any
private settings.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever -- have you
ever been to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In what time period are you
thinking about when you say yes?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't remember when
the President purchased Mar-a-Lago.  So from whenever
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 106
it turned into the club, I went there and I was --
loved going there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- did you go there
alone or with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Mostly alone.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know where --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the times I went
there it was for an event, maybe once or twice.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether
Mr. Epstein ever went there?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I believe he did,
but again, we really were -- he -- he didn't take me
with him all the time.  So he would go and -- oh,
right.  He never -- I never -- well, he did from time
to time, but he would go alone.  I think he would
maybe go himself to the spa.  I certainly did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe
President Trump receive a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe -- you
said that you -- you were -- I mean, have you seen
the -- there's photographs, public photographs of
Mr. Epstein and President Trump together.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And there's photographs
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 107
of -- I think you're -- you're in some of the
photographs --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- as well.  Those all
appear to be social settings.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's -- that's my
memory.  They were social settings.  I don't know
Epstein's -- if he had -- whatever the nature of the
President's friendship, if you will, or however you
want to define that with Epstein, I was -- never
witnessed.
           I think they were friendly like people are
in social settings.  I don't -- I don't think they
were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the
President in any of -- I don't recall ever seeing him
in his house, for instance.
           I actually never saw the President in any
type of massage setting.  I never witnessed the
President in any inappropriate setting in any way.
The President was never inappropriate with anybody.
In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman
in all respects.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When's the last time you
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 108
think you saw, in person, President Trump?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Um, it was -- it's --
it's been a long time.  Probably not -- sometime in
the -- beginning -- mid -- mid 2000s maybe.  And it
would only have been a social setting, as far as I
recall.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did you ever hear
Mr. Epstein or anybody say that President Trump had
done anything inappropriate with masseuses or with
anybody in your world?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely never, in
any context.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
masseuses from Mar-a-Lago's spa ended up giving
massages to -- private massages to Mr. Epstein?  I'm
not asking for what you may have read, but from -- at
the time, from your personal knowledge, do you know
whether that's true?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I don't -- I
don't recall.  Is it possible?  Yes.  But I don't
remember -- I don't remember that.  So I don't want
to -- I don't recall that, but it's possible.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you have a recollection
of you ever recruiting a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago spa
to give -- to go give a private massage to
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 109
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I've never recruited a
masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I
remember.  I can't ever recollect doing that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So what -- what I
think we should do now, it's about 12:15.  We'll take
a -- we'll take a break and we will come back in a
little bit.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           (Break at 12:15 p.m. to 12:59 p.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  Good afternoon.  We are
continuing the recorded proffer interview of
Ms. Maxwell.  The time is 12:59, Thursday, July 24th.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So just to continue
what we're talking about, Ms. Maxwell, still focused
on the '90s time period with -- understanding that
could spill over in the early 2000s.  But still that
part of your -- of your life with Mr. Epstein.
           There's been public reporting about
conduct by Mr. Epstein and others at Little Saint
James.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So can you talk about the
frequency with which you went there, and address some
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 110
of those -- some of the reporting, namely around
young masseuses or young women who would be present
and what you observed --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- relating to them, and
then I'll ask questions around that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So if I'm right, he
purchased the island in 1996 and he was friendly with
the owners.  And originally, we went to the island as
guests of the owners.  And then I guess at some point
the owners told him -- he -- they wanted to sell and
he decided to purchase it.
           So the island was very rustic.  I loved
it.  He, of course, had completely different ideas.
And I would say there was none of what you were
describing at that early period of time.
           So the frequency was -- was often.  We're
often on the island, because he loved it.  He really,
really loved it.  And we would, -- we would go all
the time.  Mostly all the early phase was based on
improvements that could be made on the island.
           Always going with new architects, new
designers, new construction people.  I'd say the
first two years, almost every trip, not every one,
but almost every trip contained some -- an individual
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 111
who would be brought on board to have an opinion as
to how to -- I don't want to use the word "improve
the island," because I don't think you could improve
it, but to -- I can't think what the word would be.
To -- what's the word I'm looking for?  To develop
it.  Sorry.  That's the word.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Develop -- develop the
island.  That's the word I'm looking for.
           So -- so there were trips, constant trips
with that in mind.  And I would say now if we are
moving to the late '90s, '96, '97 I definitely
witnessed a progression in Mr. Epstein's behavior,
and a modification, if you will.
           Where in the past, in the early '90s, I
don't remember traveling so much with other people.
There would be a masseuse or a yoga person, but now
he started to travel with more, always a masseuse.
Whereas in the past it wasn't always a masseuse or
always an instructor.  There was now starting to be
always an individual or a friend or whatever.
           There's always a, like, maybe the word
would be entourage, but these were always people in
their 20s, late 20s, early 30s in my -- as my memory
sees it, as I -- as I observe that time.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 112
           And he tasked me with finding a local
masseuse for him in St. Thomas, because sometimes,
even though I say he would always travel with an
entourage, sometimes he didn't, and he wanted to have
a massage locally.
           So I visited the mass- -- the spas that
were local in St. Thomas and in St. John.  And if I
met someone, a man or a woman, actually, because it
was difficult to find somebody in St. Thomas, it's
not exactly, you know.  So, and I did find a couple
of people who would come.
           So that's how they came, because also it
was a schlep.  So if you had somebody who came, it
would be -- you would have to, you know, boat ride
and you -- several hours.  It wasn't just a -- it's
not like arriving with your massage table and stuff.
So there was that.  So I did do that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So did, over the years,
males also give massages to Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  I did say, I
don't think -- at the beginning, definitely.  And I
would say towards sort of, again, late '90s, I don't
remember any men.  They were at the beginning, I
think in that -- towards the late '90s, I cannot
think of any men.  I only think of women.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 113
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- well, you talk
about entourage flying, right now we're talking about
to the island.  Did you observe any sexual, I was
going to say misconduct, but any sexual -- any sex at
all whatsoever on the plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never on the plane,
no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was there a part of the
plane that was closed off from others where
Mr. Epstein could go and get a massage or whatever?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  Okay.  So
that's a good question.  So there were two planes.
So you had the -- there was a Gulfstream, and that's
open plan.  So anything -- I mean, there was a sofa
that turned into a bed.  And he did sleep on that.
           And then -- but in the Boeing, which he
flew on a lot, there was -- his area could be closed
off with a door.  And behind that door there would
be -- there was a bedroom and an office.  So if that
door was shut, you wouldn't see it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But do you -- so if you
never -- so -- but you never observed Mr. Epstein
engaging in sex or getting a massage with somebody --
with whether the masseuse was not clothed on the
plane?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 114
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can't say that.  I
might have --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I definitely might,
either both in the Gulfstream or in the --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- in the -- I'm sure
I did, but it's not -- I can't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's fair.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I'm absolutely
sure I did.  I must have, because, you know, he was
so obsessed of someone rubbing his feet or -- just --
when you ask me about massages, I want to be clear.
           I generally -- what I think of that is
somebody on a massage table, but other people might
think of it as something different.  You know, you
could have someone rubbing his feet or his shoulder.
I saw that all the time.  That I did.  But sep- --
that's separate from being on a massage table.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How -- again, I know we're
talking about a decade-long period, but during the
period we're talking about, in a seven-day week, how
often would Mr. Epstein get a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  In the '90s, when
we're talking, he would get one every day.  I think,
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 115
as that time progressed, he would get one, maybe
twice a day.  I do want to say that there was maybe a
reason that things altered or morphed or progressed,
and it is maybe part of the reason, also, that I --
he and I, our relationship or have a, somebody wants
to call it altered.
           And he started doing testosterone and that
altered his character.  And I believe that started in
the late '90s.  And I believe that the FBI has his
medical records and you may see that on his medical
records.  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you believe that he
started taking testosterone in the '90s, and when you
say that altered his behavior, you're saying it
wanted to -- made him get more massages or that was
just one part of what changed about him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, he became more
aggressive.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I see.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I think that he
maybe -- well, now I'm just imagining that the
testosterone altered his desires or something, does
that --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so when, given what
you've said the past couple hours about his kind of
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 116
progression or change, let's focus on that time
period, so the more towards the late '90s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The testosterone.
Yeah, okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So '96, '97, '98, you know,
toward --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- when you've said that he
changed.  Did you know flat out that he was having
sex or otherwise some sort of sexual conduct with
masseuses regularly?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Flat out?  No, I
denied that.  I couldn't imagine that he would but I
think looking back now, that -- I did not.  But I
started to suspect that he was not faithful.  Seems
ludicrous but that's what I thought.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But if -- look, if -- if
he's flying from Palm Beach to -- to St. Thomas or if
he's flying all over the country to New Mexico or to
New York, or even in Palm Beach and there's young
women, putting aside whether they're under the age of
or in their 20s, every day at the house, multiple
masseuses -- multiple massages on some days, you're
interacting with the masseuses constantly.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Huh?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 117
           TODD BLANCHE:  Or maybe that's not right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's not right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let me take back what I
just said.  Ignore that part.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you understand that he
is getting massages every day, sometimes multiple
times a day.  The -- by the late '90s, it's all
women, presumably they're -- some of them are new,
but they're also repeat masseuses.
           What did you -- I mean, you had to know at
that point that there was something going on beyond
just, he really needed to get massaged.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So -- very fair
question.  There's two things.  The first is the
person that he saw the most at that period of time
was in her 40s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And she was with him
all the time.  And I'm, like, married as well --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And as -- I'm square.
And it never occurred -- well, I don't believe it
occurred to me at the time that with this woman, he
would be having relations.  And he was with her --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 118
that was the person he had the most massages, yoga,
and that -- with -- at that time in the '90s period.
           The second thing is that -- is he told me
he didn't -- he had difficulty having an erection,
and I believed him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you said he said that,
you mean he regularly told you that?  Like he --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  When I first --
because when I didn't have sex with him after the
first time, and it took -- so I asked him, was it me?
And he told me it was him.
           And I had never, up until this moment in
my life, I -- as if I'm not stupid.  I'm very bright.
I've had an excellent education.  I traveled all over
the world.  I had had boyfriends, but I had never met
or understood that somebody could be so -- would lie
to me about -- I could -- it never occurred to me.
           I didn't have a frame of context within my
life experience where somebody would be so
manipulative and devious with me.  I just -- and
plus, I just didn't have -- I just -- and I was happy
not to have sex, because I have a condition that
doesn't lend itself to that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Does -- when you learned --
so fast forward just for a moment to the 2007, '08,
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 119
'09 time period and he's arrested and charged and
there's all kinds of press around his purported
contact, at that point -- at that point, did you
accept that that was true?  Meaning, did it make
sense at that point?
           When you were reading about women who
claimed that they had been abused, even underage
and -- at that point, did you think to yourself,
well, geez, that makes sense now that I think about
it or no?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  First of all, I
didn't -- that's -- I only read what was in the
newspapers.  I didn't have any other thing.  And I'm
embarrassed to say it, I didn't -- I didn't believe
it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Right.  I mean, you
didn't believe that the accusations were true at the
time.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  So let's --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And sorry, I need to
say, even if they were true, I believe that he was
duped and he didn't know that they were -- whatever
that was in the papers at that time, whether they
said that they were 17 or, I didn't -- it didn't
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 120
register, because --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- along with all of
those -- well, not in 2006, but later when the more
salacious and other allegations came out, I knew were
utterly false, which then just reinforced my belief
that the rest was not true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let me ask you a question
about the age of the masseuses over the years.  It --
I think in my mind, there's a difference between you
knowing or not knowing that a masseuse is under the
age of 18 and coming to give a massage, and you
knowing that Mr. Epstein, you know, sexually abused
the underage person or made her strip or something
like that, meaning -- and I want to understand
whether you believe that nobody that came to give
massages, none of the women were under 18 or that you
didn't focus on their age, but you -- you were more
focused on whether any underage woman was abused by
him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it's better to
answer this question with corroborating evidence and
then go back and explain, so that I frame --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- your understanding
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 121
of what I'm saying.  Of the -- my understanding is
that in 2000 and, let's say 2008, they had
interviewed 44 women, let's say, or around that
number.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  You have to
understand, not a single one of those 44 women
mentioned me in a single report.  And it's not
because -- go back.
           They didn't mention me in their report
because they never met me, they never saw me, and
they never interacted with me.  So to go back to your
question, it's not that I thought one way or another,
it's that I didn't see them.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  I see.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, no, that's helpful.
So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not -- and but
when I say not one, not single one of those reports
talked about me.  And I just want to clarify exactly,
because I'm obviously aware that one of those girls
is -- was one of the witnesses in my trial,
specifically 
.
           To use her own testimony so that you don't

LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 122
have to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- hear my point of
view.  It's better if it comes from her own words and
that way there's no second-guessing whether -- what
I'm saying.
 herself said that 
recruited her, 
 brought her and 
trained her.  Those are 
 own words.
           Where was I going with this?
           TODD BLANCHE:  That you were -- that you
didn't know.  I mean, I assume you were saying that
you weren't --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh yeah, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  That's okay --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm trying to remember
where I was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- that's all right.  It's
okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I really do have some
slow cognition issues.
           The --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So she says -- she
testifies that it was 
 that recruited her
DOJ REDACTION

Page 123
and trained her and not you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So wait.  So then in
her first FBI meeting, she reports seeing a woman
with short dark hair at the house, which then is used
as evidence that that person was myself.
           But the maid, lady that who helped keep
the house, John Alessi's wife -- oh, and with an
accent, I believe she said.
           John Alessi's wife had short, dark hair
and an accent.  I'm sorry, but I find -- and you can
ask yourselves this, I mean, I've obviously modified
my accent.  I've been in America a long time, but I'm
British.  I've been brought up with a very strong
British accent.
           And I don't believe there's an American on
planet Earth that doesn't recognize this to be
British or Australian, maybe, if you really don't
know.  But it's not some random accent.
           Now the Hispanic, maybe.  Okay.  That was
John's wife that she saw, not me.  And I'd like to
point out further how you -- potentially her own --
through her own words.  She identify --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Why don't we -- why don't
we --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 124
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- stop there and let him
ask the next question.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You're good.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So it's -- so just -- and
look, I want to -- I want to try to -- I think
probably tomorrow we will -- I want to talk more
about kind of the evidence against you and how to
address that.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, don't apologize.
That's -- so that's helpful but --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I don't want you to be
burdened.  I want you to just tell the truth the best
you can, so I don't want you to be burdened by what
people said at trial or what you know the press says
about you, so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just thought it was
illustrative when you asked the question --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And it was.  It was.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- because it
doesn't -- I did not -- I absolutely have no memory
at any -- now I'm leaving 
 separate
DOJ REDACTION
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 125
to this obviously --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- so that's a
separate story.  I'm not going to pretend -- well,
we'll come to her.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We'll get to her.  Go
ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, she -- but in the
terms of the scheme or whatever, however you want to
determine what you're calling that, I have no -- no
memory, no active anything of having seen anybody
that resembles a young -- a child, let's call it what
it is, at that house giving him a massage at all.
           It's not even like I did this.  It's an at
all.  And 44 people didn't see me or talk about me
either, including 
.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- and when you say
"that house," I --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry.
Palm Beach.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, no, I understand what
you mean but, and I -- does the same memory or lack
thereof, apply to on planes, at -- in New Mexico, in
New York, in --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, with some other
DOJ REDACTION-
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 126
important caveats.  Well, on that -- but Julian --
Jane, in my trial, was clearly underage, clearly a
child.  And I only saw her in Palm Beach and I only
saw her with her mother.
           The other person who's clearly also not an
adult or even close, 
, I believe, I
remember her now.  That would be the only two or
three, whatever that is.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So did you ever know
Mr. Epstein to communicate with FBI agents, either
like intelligence FBI agents, like as a source or
just generally with FBI agents?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you think if he had done
that, you would've known, like he would've told you
something like that?  Like if I said to you,
Mr. Epstein was a source for the FBI, would you say,
that's crazy, no, he wasn't or maybe he was, I
would -- he wouldn't have told me that anyway.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have two answers for
that.  I think if he was for real, I think he
would've bragged about it to me as a show off,
because he could be a show off.  And if he wasn't, he
might have dropped it like he was cool.  And I don't
think -- I don't remember him doing either.
DOJ REDACTION
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 127
           Now, with, again, the caveat that in
his -- before I met him finding money, I think he may
have suggested that there was some people who helped
him, but that's the only context that I recall that
in.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do you mean by that?
When you said "finding money," what do you mean?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, his business
where he -- remember I told you --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I think in that
context, he made -- he showed me a photograph that he
had with some African warlords or something that he
told me.  And, you know, I get -- I don't remember if
I -- that's what I interpreted the -- like that kind
of thing or whether it was something like that.
           That's the only actual active memory I
have of something nefarious -- not nefarious.  I
don't even know if it was nefarious, but covert, I
suppose would be the word.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what about any other
intelligence agency, like the CIA or Defense
Intelligence or any other law enforcement agency?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I don't think
so.  I think that -- I don't remember anything like
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 128
that.  I just don't think he had the wherewithal and
I think that whole aspect of that is -- can I use a
bad word?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Bullshit.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And what do you --
you think it's bullshit, meaning?  What do you mean?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Would you have known if he
was -- would he have been bragging to you?  Would he
have been saying these things.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think he was because
I -- I think, well, sorry.  I think that -- I think
one of the reasons why he liked me was because of my,
you know, my family connections and why he liked
other people was because they were cool or whatever.
           And I think that, certainly, early in when
I met him, he would've tried to impress me or tried
to show off, if you will.  Like he was that guy, you
know, and he wasn't that guy.  And so -- and I think
that he would've tried to bullshit me and he didn't,
so I think it's --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, he may have
tried to bullshit me, but no, I couldn't.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 129
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I want to just shift for
a few minutes to talk about post-2000.  2000 to kind
of when your relationship changed over the years with
him.
           Did there come a time when he,
Mr. Epstein, did meet members of the Royal Family?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I need to go back,
because I think I may have misspoke --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I didn't misspeak
but I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- it's something that
I have forgotten.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Of course.  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Before I met Epstein,
he lived in London for a period of time, I don't know
for how long.  And he met and knew some truly fancy
people, like people -- high society people, that
included Princess Diana's best friend.  Her name was
Rosa Monckton.  And Rosa's husband, Dominic Lawson,
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 130
who's a famous journalist, actually is a very well
known journalist.
           And when I -- and he had -- he was friends
with the Barings, Barings Bank and he had like, sort
of --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That was, you're talking
about --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Before he met me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Before, so in the --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  '80s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- '80s.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  He was dating
Eva Andersson, Miss Sweden, I think.  I don't know
when she became Miss Sweden.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So earlier when you
said that he met them later --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- you think he may have
met some members of the Royal Family or certainly
British high society.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He met -- I don't know
about the Royal Family, but certainly high society.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the reason why I
know this is because, sometime we can -- this is a
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 131
documentable thing.  Docu -- whatever.  There's a
photograph that can give you the date, because I
don't remember what the date is of this, so there's
something that will peg whatever this date is.  I
don't remember when that is.
           Epstein went to London without me.  He
often went everywhere without me, but he was in
London without me, which was decently unusual because
London's my hometown.
           But anyway, he went without me.  And he
went to a big event in, I think it was in the --
anyway, it was a big event.  It's on -- it's on --
it's on -- it's on the news.  It's like a -- there's
photographs of it.  And he, I don't know if he sat
with Diana or he met Diana and he'd already met her.
I don't know, but this, I believe was organized by
Rosa.
           And so there's -- I don't know if she was
being set up as a date for him, maybe because she --
I don't want to speak bad of Diana, but -- I'm not
going to do that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So that was
pre-meeting you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, that was -- that
event happened when we were --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 132
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh, okay.  That was
(Inaudible).
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and I would --
sometime --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understood.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  - - no, it's when we
were --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I'm not going to
say together, but when -- how about this?  When I was
his employee, that's a bit better.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So now moving back
to the 2000s, did there come a time when Mr. Epstein
met Prince Andrew?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And others in the
Royal Family or just Prince Andrew as, far as you
know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, so as -- as much
as I can piece it together, all right, first of all
let's just state, I did not introduce him to
Prince Andrew.  I did not introduce him to Prince
Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson.  That is a flat untruth.
I'll start with that.
           So now I'm going to tell you how he did
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 133
actually meet him.  So I -- if you find me that
photograph, I can date that time when he met
Princess Diana at that event.  I -- and based on
that, I'll be able to tell you if it's pre or post
that event, because I haven't looked it up and I've
never bothered to check.
           So Lynn Forester, who was a client or some
type of client, or I think she actually tried to date
him or might have dated him, for the record.  She was
in -- do you want to ask me something?
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  She was -- she
had a house or she rented a house in the Vineyard.  I
think it was in the Vineyard or Nantucket, I can't
remember now which one it was.  It was one of those.
It was either in Nantucket or the Vineyard, and
invited Epstein to go, and I believe that's when he
met Prince Andrew.
           However, I believe that before that event,
he had gone to the Bahamas and had hung out with
Sarah Ferguson.  And Sarah had called Epstein and had
arranged with Lynn, or I don't know.  I don't know.
Now I'm speculating.  Anyway, long and short, he met
Andrew up there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I'm not holding you to
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 134
an exact date, but when, approximately, was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, we can date it
from that picture, if you find me the picture.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But do you know, I --
without looking at a photo, in your mind,
approximately, when was that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say it was
the 2000 -- no, probably 2001, 2002.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Early 2000s?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I think it was actually
Prince Andrew himself who suggested that he met
Jeffrey Epstein through you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think that's true.
So -- well --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  It's true that Andrew said
that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, no, I'm sure
it's true, because I -- I'm English and my close
friends are all close friends with Sarah and Andrew.
And I would not say that I was close friends with
Andrew before, but certainly we were friendly and
certainly his best friends, some of them, are very
close with me.
           And I think that my friendship, my -- me
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 135
being present or me is what made Andrew like Jeffrey
more, like, trust him or I think that's the idea.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you don't dispute that
you're -- that you kind of had a role in them getting
together.  You're just saying you didn't say, Prince,
here's Jeffrey.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would never have
introduced them.  It would never have occurred to me
to introduce them.  I couldn't imagine them being
friends.  Two chalk and cheeses would never -- I
mean, for real, there's nothing there to connect
them.
           So he met Prince Andrew and then he had a
really good relationship.  I don't like that word.
It sounds clunky.  They had a friend --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Acquaintanceship.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.  And --
through Sarah, actually.  I think Sarah is the one
that pushed that.  And they met and hung out, I want
to say two or three times that had nothing to do with
me.  I wasn't communicating with Andrew, I wasn't in
touch with him.
           And I know this because I was annoyed and
I felt left out, and I felt disrespected and I was
like, this is weird.  I couldn't even imagine Epstein
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 136
and Andrew together.  And I thought that Sarah was
trying to put the moves on Jeffrey, if I'm being
honest, and I thought the whole thing was annoying
and I was pissed off.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So what happened with their
relationship?  Putting aside the publicity around
Prince Andrew's purported relationship with
, what happened, as far as you know, with
Prince Andrew and Mr. Epstein's relationship, from
the times you just described or you give me --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So after that,
at some point Jeffrey told me -- Epstein told me that
Andrew was coming to New York and I needed to
organize the whole thing.  That's classic by the way,
classic Epstein.
           Of course, if someone -- I'm like, all
right, fine, whatever.  And because he wanted to make
sure that Andrew was taken care of and that he was
comfortable, he had whatever he needed, yada, yada,
yada.
           And I'm like, well, am I going to meet him
or are you just going to have me do all the job?  And
he said, well, you know, you can come and say hello.
Like, wow.  Well, that's so nice of you, for real.
           Because you have to understand, like, I
DOJ REDACTION
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 137
don't know if I told you this before, but I did not
have the keys to his -- I was not allowed to go to
his house, unless I was summoned or told.  I was not
allowed to answer his phones.  We can go there, but
anyway.  So this -- you can tell there's a bit of a
sore point, perhaps.
           Anyway, so Andrew came, and of course the
minute we got together I was like, yay.  Hi.  And
then it was so nice, because the difference of being
in England with Prince Andrew versus being in
New York without all the bullshit was insane.
           And our friendship just like lit up like
this, because first of all, he knew that I'm safe.  I
mean safe as in I'm not, yeah, you know, Nigel
Dempster or taking a picture.
           I mean, not in a million years would I do
something so gross.  And we honestly got on like a
house on fire.  I really liked him a lot and he's --
it was so nice and we just became really, really good
friends, much more so than when we were in London, if
I'm honest.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then with respect to
 and Prince Andrew, what do you know about
that relationship?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Would you like to ask
DOJ REDACTION
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 138
that again?  Relationship is a big word.  Like I
said, I don't like the word.  Let's just start there.
Okay.
           So I have read -- I just want to like
piece together.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, but don't say --
before you say what you read, because that's one of
the problems is that we're all kind of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All right.  What, I
know --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- we're all formed by like
all the publicity and information around what
everybody else has said, but like, what do you --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- what do you think or
what did you see?  What did you hear?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What's an even bigger
word than bullshit?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Why?  Well, go ahead
just -- but finish that thought.  Why do you think
that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm going to tell you
right now.  I'm so happy to tell you.  I'm like
excited.  I'm beyond excited.
           Okay.  So there's been a mixture of what
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 139
I've actually seen and know from the evidence and
versus what I've put together.  Impossible for me at
this point to separate everything, but I'll tell you
what I know versus what I saw and what I physically
have in here, but it's helpful for you to know.
           So the allegation, I have to go with the
allegation.  The allegation was that at my house in
London, in March, whatever that was, 2001 I believe,
we went to London, especially so that 
 could
have a -- or 
 could have a relationship with
Prince Andrew and she was paid a vast amount of money
for that purpose.
           Okay.  And that she then got in the -- in
my bathroom in my house in London and had sex, sexual
relations with him and then went into my guest room
and had full blown sex and then left my house, or he
left, and she felt used and disgusting.
           And a photograph was taken of them just
before all these events took place in my study.  That
is what is the story.
           Oh, and then after that she met him
several other times.  But we'll come to that.  We'll
come -- this is where it will -- allegedly started.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  And they went to Tramp.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, right.  We went to
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDACTION-
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 140
nightclub that night.  Oh, we went to dinner, right?
We went to dinner and then to Tramp.  Okay.  So the
first thing about that weekend, that specific
weekend, was it's my mum's 80th birthday and I was in
the country.
           And I have some corroborating evidence for
that and a lot of testimonial that you can check.  So
that takes care of the reason why I -- one of the
reasons why her story doesn't hold water.
           The second reason why -- so -- by the way,
when I say that, my mum turned 80th, that actual
weekend was, her birthday is on March the 11th.  And
the reason why I went to London, and I presume, but
I -- this I don't remember, is why when we were -- so
the whole trip started because of Alberto Pinto, who
is the decorator for the island and for -- and for
New York as well.
           And he had wanted Epstein to go to see a
house in Marrakesh, if I remember rightly, and went
via the Alhambra, it was also for New Mexico.  So
there's architectural pieces that -- paint.  And that
was the basis of that trip.
           And I suspect now, that that trip was
planned all around the fact that I had to be in --
wanted to be in -- was going to be in London no
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 141
matter what for my mum's 80th birthday at my
brother's house in the country, which is
approximately an hour outside of London, an hour and
a half --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  An hour and a half.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- an hour and a half
outside of London, in my brother's home.  And we all
congregated on the Saturday for her birthday
celebration on the Sunday, and then we left.  So
that's that.
           The second reason why -- probably maybe
even the more important reason than my mum's
birthday, that I think it's absolute rubbish, is that
Prince Andrew.  The idea of him doing anything of
that nature in my house, that's the size of this
room, is so mind-blowingly not conceivable to me, as
the man or what -- I just can't -- I can't even --
I -- no.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Is there any way that it
could have happened?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Describe the physical plan.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, the physical -- so
the -- my house was tiny.  I think it's 900 square
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 142
feet in total.  Well, maybe that; is that right?
Maybe nine --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It is on three floors,
however.  So you're talking about a little -- it's a
jewel.  It used to be a stable for a horse.  It was
the stables for the big house.  It was a little poor
man's home behind the rich man's home.  It's a jewel.
           It's a -- was a gorgeous little place, but
it is the size of a nut.  If you make a noise, let's
say, a little burp or something you don't want to --
you'd hear it.  It just --
           Where she says that they had relations in
a bathroom, I -- first of all, the bath is an old
Victorian bath.  I could -- I'm quite -- quite small,
it's tight for me.  I put my brother in there to see
what would happen.  And it looks like a blivet, which
is a sausage in like a very tight skin.
           So her description of whatever the two
people were doing in the tub, that wouldn't work.
The bathroom itself is so small, you can't lie flat
on the floor.  So it couldn't happen on the floor,
because you physically, physically can't.  This
bathroom is too small to even be on the floor.
           And then the kicker of all kickers, is
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 143
that because the bathroom was so small, I decorated
it to try make it look huge, which meant that I put
mirrors the whole way around it.  And what was so fun
about being in there is that if you stood in the
bathroom, you saw like a hundred of you, like you do
if you were in --
           DAVID MARKUS:  A fun house.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, well, Alice in
Wonderland or one of those things that you would see
yourself going, stretching everything.  And the
image.  If you said you were -- let's say you were,
let's say that 
 was telling the truth.
           She could say she was having sex with
5,000 generations of the Royal Family, because that's
how far back you could see yourself.  There is no way
in God's green earth if that had taken place, that
this is something that you would miss, because it's
-- you couldn't miss it.
           If you were standing there, you'd see the
whole -- the FBI, the whole Department of Justice
standing behind you.  It's like, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  And also -- let me just --
also explain where the tap was in the bathtub.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, well it's an old
DOJ REDACTION-
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 144
Vic- had a tap.  So if you were in -- if you were in
the top, right, it might -- this is the tub.  My tap
would be here, I think -- no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you think it's kind of
logistically and physically not something that could
have happened.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, there's that.
And there's just -- Andrew would -- he's so English.
He's so -- he had a tie on.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Do you think there's any
way it could have happened or no?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely on -- no
way -- no how, absolutely not.  Wait, I haven't
finished.  So on her --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry.
           DAVID MARKUS:  No, go ahead.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.  Go, go, go.
Finish.  Please, go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.  Can I finish?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  When all this
nonsense took place, where this whole story with the
picture and the this and the that and this bullshit,
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 145
I believe that this whole thing was manufactured, and
I can point you to some potentially corroborating
evidence of this.
           So when she gave the photograph to the FBI
in Australia --
           DIEGO PESTANA:  Just to be clear, the
photo, you're talking about, you're talking about the
famous one where --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, I have a image
of it here.  Who wants to look at it?
           DIEGO PESTANA:  -- where Prince Andrew is
holding 
 and you're in the background?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The fake, just to be
clear.  So on the back of that, and this is in the
discovery by the way.  I don't know if it's in -- I
don't know where, which discovery I saw it in now.
           But this -- she wrote, she, 
,
wrote in the back that it was a picture that was
taken in January of 2000 and -- on 2000 or 2001, I
don't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So now in her
handwriting, that she's giving the FBI this picture,
suddenly now it's March.  So how do you go from her
writing it's January to March.  It's because it
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDACTION
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 146
only -- it's the only one that fit with the flight
logs, that when she could be in London and this took
place.
           The second thing is that -- oh, I'm so
excited to tell you this.  There is a journalist, I
know you guys are quite -- well, I don't know.  The
fake news is at work here.
           So there's a journalist called Sharon
Churcher.  There is a lawyer called Brad Edwards.
These two -- and there is a Southern District of
Florida prosecutor called Villafana.
           I would very much look forward to showing
you the relationship between these three parties that
created that story.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why?  Well, without --
putting aside the relationship, why do you think they
created that story?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe that story
was created for the purposes of -- well, there are
multiple.  The first one is financial, the second one
is for the purposes of the CVRA case.  The third one
was for the serialization, both of her book and in
the papers, for the story to attack the Royal Family.
           And just as a --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I think when -- when you
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 147
were just asked about the photo, you said you
actually thought the photo was fake.
           Do you think it was just misdated or do
you think it's a fake -- literally a fake photo?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe it's
literally a fake photo.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you think that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, first of all, I
don't remember it.  We'll start --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  Okay.  But the
outfit I'm wearing --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- is the outfit from
my mum's birthday party.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So but you don't have
any -- do you dispute that they've met each other?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Do you know whether they've
met each other?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not know that
they met.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- so you not
only -- so you think the photograph is fake, but you
also are not even positive they actually ever met
each other.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 148
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you don't have a
specific recollection of kind of being at an event or
a party or your apartment, or you know, you're flat
in London with Prince Andrew and 
?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not.
           DAVID MARKUS:  She doesn't know one way or
the other.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understand that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm just -- I want you
to know that --
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, I know.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- the reason why --
I'm not hesitant.  I'm not -- I don't have any memory
of that, so that -- that's not the issue.  The issue
is, could Andrew have come to the house to see me or
see Epstein, and say hi and she had been there?  Yes.
I can't say that that didn't happen.
           But what I can absolutely, categorically
say is that I never, at any time, set Andrew up to
have relations with her or any other human being
ever.
           And I can categorically state that her --
her characterization of whatever may or may not have
happened, could -- physically would just no.  And
DOJ REDACTION
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 149
plus, I was in the country, so all of that's just not
conceivable.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you attend -- did you
attend social parties over -- and again, I really,
now I'm focused on 2000 plus, so not -- not the
earlier, where Mr. Epstein would host a party or be a
big part of the hosting of the party and some of, or
many of the young women who were masseuses would be
invited to the party, as guests or his entertainment?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I certainly went to
his house when he would have people who would be
there that were -- I call them -- I would -- the way
I would think of it and I would characterize it, were
his entourage.  That's how I thought about it.  And
that certainly was in the later 2000s, Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did you attend any
weddings of famous people with Mr. Epstein?  Again,
I'm mostly focused on post -- plus -- post 2000, but
if there's something that comes to mind in the '90s,
that's fine as well.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  A wedding?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Weddings.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  With Epstein?  I don't
think I ever went to a wedding with Epstein.  I can't
think of a wedding that I ever went to with him.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 150
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- so you don't
remember -- you didn't attend President Clinton's
daughter's wedding --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- Chelsea Clinton's.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But that wasn't with
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, it was with
Ted Waitt, my boyfriend.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  With Ted Waitt, my
boyfriend.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein was at that wedding?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He was not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And how did you --
did you have a relationship -- well, why did you get
invited to that wedding?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because Ted and
Clinton were very close.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And why -- how were you
close to them?  Like what was the reason you were
close to them?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met President
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 151
Clinton -- well, I first of all, I went to the
White House with Epstein once for, I think it was for
a historical, like one of those benefits and I met
the President then, but like a thousand other people
shook his hand.
           Then after that, I had a very -- a good
friend of mine that was the mayor -- known to be the
Mayor of Miami Beach, Philip Levine, and Philip and
the President were very good friends.  And Philip was
a very -- and I were very good friends, and so I
actually was introduced to the President post his
coming out of the White House and became friendly
with him, because of Philip Levine.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Because of what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Philip Levine.
           TODD BLANCHE:  There's some names that
have been publicly associated with Mr. Epstein that I
just want to ask you if you know about:  Piers
Morgan?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Is friendly with who?
           TODD BLANCHE:  With Mr. Epstein.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have no idea.
Never.  I doubt it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  There's no trick
question.  I'm not trying to --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 152
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I'm not suggesting that
I know the answer to it.  I'm generally just asking.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I would be
astonished.  I can't imagine they'd have anything in
common either.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How about --
           DIEGO PESTANA:  Were you friends with
Piers Morgan?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I've met him.  I've
met him.  I met him at an event in Manhattan.  I
can't remember what -- in more recently, so probably
in 2012, '13, something in that, and we had a very
nice conversation.  So I remember -- I remember that.
           I remember thinking -- I'd never -- I
don't remember if I'd ever met him before, but I
remember thinking how nice he was and I was
surprised.  So I liked him.  What can I tell you?
           So that's the only one -- that's the only
memory I have of that.  I'm not sure if that's
correct but that's what I think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I don't have a correct or
incorrect answer.  I just want you to tell the truth.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I just don't know.
I just want to try and...

Page 153
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, but I don't -- I want
you to believe me and -- because I mean this.  There
is so much information in the public sphere --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- about you and
Mr. Epstein and others around, and some of it is
definitely true and some of it is definitely false --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  All right.  I
just -- I guess that's --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so when I ask a question
--
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- if I think that you're
not being honest or that you're missing something,
I'm not going to -- this isn't got you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I'll say that to you.
           Did you ever meet JFK, Jr.?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm sorry?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever meet JFK, Jr.?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I will -- I met him at
Andrew Cuomo's wedding?  No, Kerry -- Kerry's
wedding.  Kerry's wedding.  Who did Kerry marry?
MAGNA9

Page 154
Andrew Cuomo.  Yes.  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Andrew Cuomo's wedding
in --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when would that have
been, approximately?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  1990.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So before --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  1999.  I don't -- I --
something like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But would that have been
before you met Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Or maybe -- yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you have a -- any sort
of professional or social relationship with John F.
Kennedy, Jr.?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I fancied him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I thought he was very
attractive.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh, you fancied him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Besides him -- finding him
attractive and fancying him, did you have any sort
of, you know, social relationship with him?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 155
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, we knew each
other.  I thought he was wonderful and fun and I
enjoyed meeting him, but I -- we went out -- I want
to say we had a dinner or two, but obviously I was
very excited, but that was it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then Alan Dershowitz.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- what's the
question with Alan?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you -- say that again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What's the question?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know Mr. Dershowitz?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether he knew
Mr. Epstein?  Do you know the nature of their
relationship?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I definitely do
know Alan.  I want -- I'm just trying to remember if
I knew him -- I am trying to remember how I met him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and if I met him
separate from -- I don't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So that I have no
recollection.  I remember -- I know that he was
Epstein's lawyer.  I don't know if they had any
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 156
relationship prior to that.  I don't remember.  Oh, I
do actually.  Sorry.
           I think they met at the same
Martha's Vineyard through Lynn Forester.  I think
that's what happened.  I think that's it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And why do you think that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because it just popped
into my head.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And did you -- did
you -- you said that Mr. Dershowitz was Mr. Epstein's
attorney.
           Do you know whether they also socialized?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So my personal memory
of when I remember two -- I have two distinct
memories with Alan.  One is with him and his wife at
the island, and I actually remember that.  And I
remember, I think, going to his house in Boston, if
he had a house in Boston, that's -- it was only two
times I remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe
Mr. Dershowitz doing anything inappropriate with
young women around Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever hear
anybody -- did anybody ever tell you that he had done
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 157
anything inappropriate?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever -- did you --
do you know one way or the other, whether
Mr. Dershowitz ever got a massage at the island or
any of the locations that he was at with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't remember
anything about him ever getting massaged.  I don't
ever have any recoll- -- I don't believe I ever even
saw him in a bathrobe.  I have no knowledge of that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I'm jumping around a little
bit.  You mentioned, I think briefly the TerraMar
Project.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What is that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I founded TerraMar
in -- well, the idea of TerraMar came, I think in
2010.  So I want to just explain TerraMar a little
bit.
           So Ted and I bought a boat -- well, Ted
bought the boat.  And its -- basis of the boat was to
do explorations and sea -- sea exploratory stuff.
This really started because I have, and have had
since I was a child, a love of the ocean and
everything aquatic.  And I've always been, I just --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 158
I'm nervous about the state of the ocean.
           When Ted and I, we worked with National
Geographic and we did exploratory work and the most
exciting -- we did many exciting things, but one of
the most fabulous ones that we did was we looked for
Amelia Earhart twice.  I did two expeditions to look
for Amelia Earhart, as an example of an -- of a
exploration that we did.
           And he had a foundation for the ocean and
we worked with Nat Geo, we worked with Woods Hole.
We did amazing things.
           We bought-- he bought the Remus 6000, so
when the plane went missing, the plane that went --
was it Air France?  From Brazil to Paris that went
down, it was the Remus 6000 that found that plane.
It's one of those deep sea explorers.
           Anyway, when I broke up with Ted, I
just -- one of the things I did not want to give up
was the -- my love of the ocean and everything that
we did and TerraMar, the genesis of TerraMar came
from that.  So TerraMar obviously means land, sea.
           And the story of the ocean is that earth
really shouldn't be called earth, it should be called
ocean because three quarters is the ocean.
           So -- and so I wanted to not clash with
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 159
anything to do with Ted, because it was a bit awkward
between us and I -- so he took all the part of the
ocean that was close to land, so within 200 miles.
           And so I decided I would focus on all the
part of the ocean that was outside of national
borders, TerraMar.  And that's how that -- that's the
genesis of TerraMar.  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So what was the time period
of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That -- I think after
I broke up with Ted, so 2010, '11 is when it started.
And then I ran it all the way up until whenever the
Epstein drama struck and then I just shut it down.
           Not -- I shut it down because I didn't
want what was happening to hurt any -- the
Smithsonian or Nat Geo or the -- I just couldn't let
everything be hurt by what was happening to me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know Jean-Luc
Brunel?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met him -- so
when -- I told you I was working for the European,
for my dad --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 160
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and I was in
charge.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So back in like '90, early
'90s?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  And I was
running a magazine.  One of the things in the
magazine is fashion.  And so I was going to some
fashion shows and I was looking for fashion
sponsorship.  And in fact, when I came to America,
one of the first sponsors that I got for it was Ron
Perelman at Revlon, who was great.  And I met
Jean-Luc through just in Paris like that.  But
socially not ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did Mr. Epstein know him as
well?  Did you later learn whether they knew each
other?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not sure I -- I
don't -- he would've -- Epstein had his own fashion
situation, so he would've -- I don't -- he didn't
meet Jean-Luc through me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe them
together over the years?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely.  Yeah, I
saw them many times together.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did he visit the
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 161
island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did he go to Palm --
meet -- go to Palm Beach House?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, he went -- yeah,
he went everywhere.  I saw him in every place.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did do you ever observe him
getting a massage or do you ever know whether they
got a massage?  Maybe you didn't observe him
personally?  You don't remember.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know.  I mean,
I don't -- I never -- I have no conscious memory of
Jean-Luc.  I would imagine that he did, but I
never -- I don't see it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How about Mr. Weinstein,
Harvey Weinstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What would you like to
know?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know him?  Like,
I guess when I say "how do you know him," is it a
relationship you had kind of separate from
Mr. Epstein or did you guys -- did you meet him
through Mr. Epstein or both?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 162
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wouldn't say --
first of all, I wouldn't say I had any type of
relationship with Harvey Weinstein --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- in any context.
           Socially, I would meet him because I would
go to events that Harvey would be at and also his
wife was English back then, Georgina.  And I was, I
mean, friendly also, would be a big word, more
acquaintance.
           So we would see each other and I would go
to Miramax events, be -- there was a couple of people
who worked for Harvey who I was friendly with, his
primary producer whose name is Meryl Poster, who I
was friendly with, and yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein had his own relationship with
Mr. Weinstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did they socialize together
at the island or in Palm Beach, or in New Mexico?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw Harvey at
any of Epstein's houses.  So socialize -- I don't
know that they were friends.  I mean, I can't see
them together, either.  I mean, literally.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 163
           But I know that they certainly do that.  I
would imagine -- and in fact, I think I have a
memory, but I can't -- that when Harvey was trying to
raise money for whatever his business was called, I
can't remember what his business was called.
           Maybe he went there, because Epstein was
good at raising money.  I just don't know.  But I
never saw them.  I don't -- I don't recall seeing
Harvey in any of the properties.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let's just go a few more
minutes and take a break, I know it's after lunch.
           So do you -- we talked several hours ago
about your father and his business a little bit.
           After your father passed, do you know
whether Mr. Epstein was involved in your family
business, that you know of?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not, in any
respect.  First of all, there was no family business
left.  Start with that problem.  And the second one
is, my family didn't like him very much.  And they
were busy dealing with their own problems and there
was no relationship whatsoever.
           Oh, I mean, he -- my mum and he got along
quite well.  That was it.  But that was -- she's an
old lady and, you know, he was nice to her.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 164
           TODD BLANCHE:  We're repeat -- we're now
being a little repetitive, but you're confident that
before you met Mr. Epstein, he didn't know your
father, and so there's no -- he wouldn't have done
business with your father's companies in the '80s
either.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not.  I'm a
hundred percent sure of that.  I never met him.  I
never saw him.  I never heard his name.  No.
Nothing.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So there's been a lot of
conversations about whether Mr. Epstein maintained,
like, a list of people, like a book of famous people
that he knew.  Like a, it's called a black book or a
client list or a list.
           Did you know of the existence of any such
list?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There is no list.
We'll start with that.  The genesis of that story, I
can actually trace for you from its absolute
inception, if that is what you're interested in.
           TODD BLANCHE:  It is.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Well, first, you know, to
be short, there is no list, there's no client list.
Nothing like that.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 165
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, there is nothing
like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  That you know of.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That I -- obviously.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  So
you say you think you know the genesis, so go ahead.
Tell us.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'd like you to know
that I have brought some supporting corroborative
evidence to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, tell me what it is,
too, and then we'll get the corroboration.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Well, why don't you tell
him first.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Is this -- is this -- do
you want to take a break here because this is a
long --
           TODD BLANCHE:  It's a long story.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, this is long.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, let's take a break.
           SPENCER HORN:  All right.  The time is
2:03 and we're going to take a break right now.
           (Off the record at 2:03 p.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  All right.  We're resuming
the recorded proffer of Ms. Maxwell.  It is 2:16 on
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 166
Thursday, July 24th.  And the recording device is now
on.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when we stopped to take
a break, we were talking about what has been publicly
discussed as a black book or the Epstein list.  And
that's where we are.
           So you said you think you might know or
that you're aware of kind of the origin of this
narrative.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  I just want to
reiterate again, there is no list that I am aware of.
I've never, at any time, at least during the period
of time when I was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- present.
           The origin of this story, I believe,
begins -- or it has a beginning in 2009, and then it
has a prequel but we have to start in 2009.
           In 2009, there is -- Epstein is, I think,
out of jail, and there are civil suits taking place.
Many of these are coming out of a disgraced law firm,
Rothstein Adler -- Rothstein, Rosenfeldt & Adler.
           At that law firm is a lawyer who started
there in April, May, 2009, called Brad Edwards.  In
2009, allegedly the FBI gets a call in October of
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 167
2009 from Brad Edwards, and he allegedly tells them
that he has come across a piece of evidence that
belongs to Epstein, that contains a list of all of
his clients and victims, underage girls, massage
therapists, and his -- and the men who are having sex
with them.  And he becomes -- he, Brad Edwards
becomes a cooperating witness -- cooperating --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Confidential.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- confidential
informant, sorry.  Confidential informant for them.
           And in a sting operation obtains the list
from a former butler of Epstein's called Alfredo
Rodriguez.  And it becomes evidence in the civil
suit.
           In the -- Alfredo Rodriguez is
subsequently prosecuted for having an AK-47 or
something weird, some guns or something, and goes to
trial.  And there's a criminal complaint that the FBI
produced.
           And in that criminal complaint, it says
that Brad Edwards became aware of the list, but --
we'll call it the list for the purposes of this.
After Alfredo Rodriguez's two depositions that are
held in Epstein's civil suit.
           It's in the FBI's affidavit that the
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 168
evidence was collected, and Brad Edwards became aware
of it after the second deposition.  It's in the
criminal complaint.  The truth is different from
what's in both the criminal complaint and in that FBI
affidavit, and in Brad Edward's own statements on the
subject.
           The truth is that Alfredo Rodriguez was
deposed twice, once in July and once in August.  And
in the July deposition, told Brad Edwards that he had
handwritten notes or a journal, whatever, in the
deposition.
           And Brad Edwards replies, well, we're
going to come back for a second deposition.  And the
second deposition takes place in August.
           What this means is that Brad Edwards had
access to the list from sometime between July and
August, until when he actually called the FBI in
October.  So we're talking six months or so.
           Rothstein's firm was raided a few days
after the list went into the FBI's hands, and,
subsequently, Rothstein himself was prosecuted for
RICO, and I believe went to jail for 50 years.
           As part of that RICO case, he admitted to,
on the record, and was -- I don't know whether he was
prosecuted for creating fake settlements and fake
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 169
evidence in Epstein's case.
           In 2009, simultaneously whilst this was
going on, my boyfriend, Ted Waitt, was asked for
$10 million to keep me out of any of Epstein's civil
suits.  Up until then, I had not been in any of
Epstein's civil suits.  In fact, I wasn't even sure,
save for the first time I was mentioned was by
, I hadn't been -- I was basically nowhere.
           And then Ted was called for this
$10 million and had been shown -- his people had been
shown evidence that included the list, the flight
logs and various other pieces of evidence.
           Now, we're going to the prequel part of
this story, so then it can tie to how this starts.
           In 2007, Epstein signs the non-prosecution
agreement.  He then fights the prosecution agreement
or debates it through the DOJ or whatever happened
there, and is -- goes to the court in 2008, when it's
accepted or whatever that is.
           Villafana was the lead prosecutor or the
lead -- yes, in that case.  And she, I think, was not
happy or with the outcome and utilized, at that time,
Brad Edwards, to file the CVRA case.
           Now, what is -- what I have managed to
understand from this is, within the OPR itself, there
DOJ REDACTION-
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 170
is evidence.  There it says that Brad Edwards was the
only lawyer that she was allowed to talk to.  So I
just want to preface that.
           The reason why I know that she went behind
Acosta's back, and everything else to do this, is
because Brad Edwards in a podcast made the
revelation.  What he says is that he'd never heard of
the CVRA case before, and Villafana called him and
told him to file it.  The sole purpose of the CVRA
was to overturn the non-prosecution agreement.
           So what I believe is that Villafana worked
with Brad Edwards, who she had also been -- he was
the lawyer that she had selected as a pro bono lawyer
for some of the victims.  And he was also working for
Rothstein's firm, that was under RICO investigation
for that entire time, creating fake evidence in
Epstein's case.
           And she had just filed hidden secret using
Edwards to overturn the NPA by filing the -- this
CVRA case, that sole purpose was to overturn it.  And
so when he approached her with the list, this was
part of the effort to utilize and find new evidence
to support the overturning, either of the NPA and/or
a new case against Epstein.
           Because Brad Edwards -- or I don't know it
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 171
was Brad Edwards.  Because Rothstein's firm asked my
then boyfriend for $10 million, to kick me out of
suits that I had no knowledge of at that time
whatsoever, I now know that the base of this story
was a blackmail of a billionaire, because Ted Waitt
was a multi-billionaire.
           He had everything.  He was way, way more
wealthy than Epstein, if anyone cares.  And that is
the reason why Ted and I broke up, was the basis of
that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And that list was
created -- so then the -- the masseuses that were on
that list, I have never heard of some of them.  I --
not even from the civil suits that had come up since
I've seen it.  And this is me now knowing what's in
the list today.
           And I believe that -- oh, Alfredo
Rodriguez, so there's a metamorphosis of this list.
So the original statement that Brad Edwards makes,
that's in the documents contemporaneously, is that
it's pieces of paper that Alfredo has.
           It then morphs into something that Alfredo
took a book, that Alfredo took from Epstein's
computer, but there's no computer I know.  Certainly
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 172
not in 2005 when this was allegedly taken, that came
out as a book.
           And then it morphed into, at the civil
time -- my civil case, into a book that was taken
from my computer.  And then it morphed into the
Southern District of New York as a combination list
of mine and Epstein's.  That is a metamorphosis
through documents that you can trace.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So the -- in your mind, or
from what you just described, there is a list, it's
just manufactured.  Meaning, have you seen the list,
even fake?  Like do you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I haven't seen it, but
what I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So just -- I was confused
--
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I guess my thing is
that what Brad Edwards says in all of these things
is -- in the paperwork and whatnot.  And in -- so all
this story is basically controlled by five people.
           There's four alleged victims that speak
about the list and the blackmail and the men and the
sex and whatnot -- And the lawyers and now the
prosecutors, sorry.  The Southern District of
New York for sure.  But no one else.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 173
           None of these stories carry from any of
the 44, alleged, original victims.  They never ever
say that they were farmed out to anybody.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But the list itself --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- where is it?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There is no list, but
Brad Edwards said that he created the list.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So that's what I was a
little  confused about.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.  He created a
list.  He -- so in that book that Alfredo Rodriguez
produced, that became evidence, Exhibit 52 in my
trial, has markings all over it.  Circles and dots
and whatnot.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And Brad Edwards says
that he got Alfredo Rodriguez to mark up the book of
all the people who were involved.  It includes Alan
Dershowitz, for the record, who's marked.  I don't
remember what it does with Donald Trump.  I don't --
I don't know.  You'd have to look.  I don't have it.
           But I believe --
           TODD BLANCHE:  I see.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So what he did, he
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 174
marked up -- I don't know who.  Somebody marked up
that book of names, and I think all the names of the
people that they went for were originally selected
between two sources.  One was this alleged book of
names, and one was also from the telephone logs that
were collected from the house in Palm Beach.
           And just to finish it off, there is a
note -- I have some papers for you if you wanted
them, where Brad Edwards says that he has a list of
men that he got money off --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- okay.  So the list
that everybody, the black book, the list, what you're
saying is that your -- your Exhibit 52 from your
trial, which is like a -- more of an address book, a
Rolodex type thing, that Mr. Rodriguez -- Alfredo
Rodriguez, your understanding, is that somewhere
along the way he went through and kind of marked that
list to say --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know where
that book actually comes from.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know what that
book is.  That book is some type of a compilation,
but what it is, is it's just pieces of paper with
type.  So if you had -- you could have made a list.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 175
I could put --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you're referring to
something that's been public for a long, if we're
thinking about the same thing.  You're talking about
the -- you're right, it's like a bunch of different
types of paper or whatever.  I only have a copy of
it, but with big parts of it redacted publicly,
because there was people's addresses and whatnot on
it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  That's what I'm
talking about.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it -- oh, perfect.
Yes.  So you will find --
           TODD BLANCHE:  We're looking at Exhibit 52
now.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So you're
looking at Exhibit 52.  So the one they produced,
they, the Southern District of New York actually
produced a book for me to see it as evidence, the
actual thing it was.
           And I -- it has marks, it has tabs, it has
things, it has names I've never seen.  It had -- like
that list -- those -- that list was basically the
names that they choose to produce at trial.  Now, in
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 176
Rothstein Adler's firm, I also have some documents
where Rothstein -- his original scheme, Rothstein
Adler, was to place prostitutes.  He had a bar, a
dance bar where he had girls.  And I believe he would
use them and put them as fake secretaries in people's
offices, and then she might touch him or he might
touch her or something, and boom, he got $25,000 for
that.
           And those girls --now, I'm not saying that
those are the girls that came in Epstein's case
necessarily, but the --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- but again, let's --
like, so we're separating the evidence that came in
at your trial and what you just talked about with
Brad Edwards and Mr. Rodriguez.
           During the time that you were with
Mr. Epstein, and even in the 2000s when you were
around less frequently, you never observed or you
never saw any sort of list or black book or a list of
individuals who, you know, linked to certain
masseuses or --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- anything like that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely no.  There
is no list.  There is no -- I'm not aware of any
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 177
blackmail.  I never heard that.  I never saw it and I
never imagined it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  While we're on this topic,
just -- and again, I know we're jumping around and
we've been going on it for a while, so I apologize.
           But there's recently been reports about a
birthday book that you assembled for Mr. Epstein, I
think, for his 50th birthday in 2003.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do you know about
that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So, my mum did a
birthday book for my father at his 60th.  And when
I -- Epstein would talk about his 50th, he said, I
don't know what I'm going to do.  And I said, well,
these are nice things, my mom did this book for my
dad.  He said, I love that idea.
           He said, can you help coordinate it?  And
he organized who -- he called a lot of the people
himself.  I coordinated the putting together of the
book.  And some -- in some instances, I called people
that asked them to contribute --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what was in the book?
Like what was the ask of the people you called?
            GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It's his 50th
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 178
birthday, say anything you want on a piece of paper.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, nothing more
than that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.  I mean, it was an
obvious question.  But you basically -- his folks
were invited to send something to you to celebrate
his birthday.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  To say happy
birthday with like, have a wonderful day or something
else.  There was no -- there was no ask, but I wasn't
responsible for everybody in that book.  And there
were people that he would ask himself to contribute.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you remember some --
do you remember specific names of individuals who did
send letters or who did contribute?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It's been so long.  I
want to tell you, but I don't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I honestly don't
remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  The article talks about
several names, but including the folks -- the
article, which is on Donald Trump.  Do you remember
President Trump submitting a letter or a card or a
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 179
note?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you think the
articles -- well, do you remember seeing that book or
any portion of the letters in your discovery in
New York?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  What do you remember
seeing?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I remember there
was -- there were some portions of that book.  But
what surprised me -- yeah.  What surprised me was how
few there were, because I thought if you had those,
where are the rest?  There was none of Mr. Trump.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In your discovery?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, in my discovery,
sorry.  President Trump, there was nothing from
President Trump.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you remember -- but
separate and apart from your discovery, do you
remember one way or the other whether President Trump
submitted a letter for his 50th birthday?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the article that
references the letter talks about like a -- sounds
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 180
like either a naked -- a picture of a naked woman or
something like that.
           Do you have any recollection of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not.  But just --
no, I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember -- so what
do you remember seeing from your discovery around the
book?  Like you said, portions of it or some of the
pages.
           What do you remember.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I remember there were
maybe -- so I just want to say about the discovery
that I had about -- maybe this is an exaggeration,
I'm not sure, but in my mind it's about close to 5
million page -- 5 million documents.  It was a lot.
           And of that giant document dump that I
received, I was only -- maybe as much as 30 to 35
percent, I was never able to access.  And this is
documented on -- at the court.  And so I cannot say
that I saw everything, because I didn't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just want you to
know that.  And I think that that was by design.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you -- but you do
remember --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 181
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do remember some
pages.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- seeing some pages of the
book?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Do you remember what
pages you saw?  Like from -- it was from -- who had
written those letters or no?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I really don't
remember.  I'm sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  It's okay.  Did you
-- did you and/or -- so the same questions we've
asked about some other individuals.
           Did you have -- did you meet Bill Gates
over the years?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Because of your
relationship with Mr. Epstein or separate?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That one -- well, I
met Mr. Gates -- I went to the TED conference.  I
gave -- I went to the TED conference and I actually
spoke at the TED Conference, not the main stage, the
substage.  And I also gave several TEDx's.
           But -- and I met him there, but we were
friendly and I actually did meet him, because I knew
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 182
his -- I don't know if he was chief of staff or
whoever, Boris.  And I met him, I think, once.  I may
have met him actually at 71st Street.  I may have
once.  I don't remember if I met him there or at a
restaurant, I don't remember.  And that would've been
because of Epstein, because Epstein was friendly with
Boris and Boris -- that's all I remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Gates traveled with Mr. Epstein on his plane to
any of his houses?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So if that -- that
friendship was after, you know, it was in the late
2000s.  So if I met him -- like I said, I went to
Epstein's house maybe once or twice.  Maybe I met him
there.  I don't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you don't --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I wouldn't know if
he had been on Epstein's plane.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you weren't -- you
don't recall ever being on the plane with him flying
to the island or to anywhere?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know somebody named
Reid Hoffman?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 183
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who's that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Reid is a Silicon
Valley guy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Is what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Silicon Valley.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how do you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Through my friends in
San Francisco.  I have a -- I used to have a very
close friend who is in San Francisco who's part of
that whole -- I have several, actually, or had.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So is that a relationship
you had kind of separate and apart from Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Separate.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein had a relationship with Reid Hoffman?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe
Mr. Hoffman flying anywhere with you or Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Or getting massages?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So there was -- there's a
list of multiple masseuses that is floating around.
I think you had in your discovery.  I think you were
just talking about that.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 184
           That list, do you know how that list was
created?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  That -- all that
stuff that came out of that book, I now find suspect.
           TODD BLANCHE:  As far -- as part of the
story you just told us?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Now, I'm not
saying it's all fake.  I don't know what's real and
what's not.  I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understood.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- know what name is
true.  Now that it's been to my mind anyway, now that
it has been, without a doubt, contaminated and
possibly fraudulent, I'm not -- I don't know.  I
mean, obviously the numbers that I recognize are my
own, those are real.
           But how it was actually ended up put
together and compiled and the purposes for it, for
which then they blackmailed my boyfriend, now I'm
just -- no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Over the years when you
were serving as like the general manager, so the mid
'90s all the way into the 2000s.  Did you or do you
know whether anyone maintained a list of all the
masseuses, like a running list?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 185
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So there would've --
so there's two things -- well, three ways.  So I know
that the house itself, John Alessi had a Rolodex that
he kept the names and numbers of all the people that
came to the house so that he could call.
           So --because I only was with Epstein, even
at best, half the time.  So when I was there, he had
like his chief of staff who could find whatever he
needed.  And when I wasn't there, he had to rely on
somebody else, right?  So it'd be that John Alessi or
whoever else.
           So everybody -- whoever was traveling with
him or wherever he was, he needed somebody else to
access information.  So he had an assistant chief who
was his secretary, who would be the one that would
update his computer, you know, like everybody has an
address book.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But was what you're
describing, which I'm not -- it makes sense.  I'm
just -- was that a list of masseuses or a list of
people that might need to be contacted, which would,
necessarily, include a lot of masseuses?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's -- the latter.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did you update that?
Like were you part of -- were you one of the people
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 186
that would add names to it?  Like if a masseuse came
and leaves and Mr. Epstein says yes, she was good,
would you be part -- like, how, how was the list kind
of maintained or who maintained it?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Typically, no --
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- because there would
be an assistant who would do that.  Plus, Epstein
would not allow me to answer the telephone ever.  So
-- or maintain or keep any of his messages in the
office or at the house.
           So typically that wouldn't be, because I
wouldn't be the one.  Could I say to you I never did
it?  No, of course not.  Because that just seems
ludicrous.  But as a rule of thumb, the answer would
be no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  During the 2007, '08, '09,
investigation -- the investigation out of the
Southern District of Florida.  So you said that you
weren't contacted by law enforcement.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  After Mr. Epstein was
charged, did you have conversations with him about
the investigation?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He never talked to me
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 187
about it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, I can't --
let's put it this way.  If he did, I have no
recollection of it.  I mean, I'm sure he must have
said, this is all -- whatever he said or it's nothing
or whatever.
           I mean, I just don't have any -- I just
don't have any memory.  I mean, I just -- I was with
Ted.  My -- I was like gone.  I mean, plus I just
didn't want to know either, I suppose.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you don't know,
firsthand, why the U.S. Attorney in Florida made the
deal that he did?  Meaning you weren't part of that
discussion along the way.
           Like Mr. Epstein didn't say, I'm getting a
good deal or, you know, I -- something is happening
with the case that's very good.
           You were -- to the extent you know
anything about it, it's just from what you've heard
or read from others, not from Mr. Epstein; is that
right?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He never talked about
the non-prosecution directly with me, no.  But he did
--
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 188
           DAVID MARKUS:  But it's still enforceable
as to her.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, he never said,
hey, do you -- are you happy with this deal like
that.  But I understood.  He never -- he never
enjoined me to the NPA, but I understand that he
included me, specifically, and I'll tell you why.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Well, it's okay.  You don't
need to get into that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, no.  Yeah.  I'm not --
I don't want to talk about the legal -- the -- what's
on appeal.  I'm just --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I -- well, I
wasn't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  The reason for my question,
just to be -- I'm not trying to hide something, but
there's a very strong belief that he got a very good
deal.  And that he should -- she -- he should have
been sentenced to more time or got a different
sentence from the feds than a non-prosecution
agreement.
           And I'm not asking you to opine on that,
but I'm wondering whether he ever talked to you about
that.  But it sounds like he didn't.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That he got a good
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 189
deal.  No.  I think actually -- well, his comments
that I've read was that he didn't get a good deal.
And I think that the, you know, when he fought it so
hard is because he didn't think he did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When he was serving his
sentence, were you ever -- were you around during
that time, like when he was allowed to leave during
the day or travel during the day?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never called him.  I
never saw him and I never went to the jail.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I'm going to ask you
questions that you shouldn't read into them.  I just
want to know whether you -- whether they resonate
with you.
           Have you ever had any contact with any
representative, that you know of, from Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence agency.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Can you ask me that
again.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Has -- have you ever had
any contact with an individual that you understand to
be from Mossad, an Israeli intelligence agency?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, not
deliberately.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Pardon me?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 190
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not deliberately.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And did you know --
we asked this -- we talked about this a little bit
earlier, but just to put a finer point on it.  Did
you ever know that Mr. -- did you ever -- were you
ever told -- did you ever think that Mr. Epstein was
getting any money from any intelligence agency,
including Mossad?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I don't believe
so, but I wouldn't know.  I mean, I would be very
surprised if he did.  I don't think so.  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We've talked about a lot of
names and I'm sure we've -- there's some that we
haven't covered.  Are there any foreign nationals --
so right now we've talked about some British, the
Royal Family a little bit, and maybe high society
folks in Britain.
           Were there any international businessmen
or politicians that had a very close relationship or
a close relationship with Mr. Epstein, that we
haven't already talked about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Off the top of my,
head, I can think of Ehud Barak.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You said that Mr. Epstein
at some point in the mid to late '90s he started
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 191
taking testosterone.  Did you ever know him to take
any other drugs?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I mean, he took
pills for his heart, I think, but I don't -- no
other -- no substances.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- do you know
anything about his heart condition?  I know we talked
about this at, you know, 9:45 this morning.  But do
you know anything about his heart condition, beyond
that you understood he had a heart condition that
affected his ability to have sex?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Other than what he
told me, no.  He never shared anything, but he did
take pills.  I don't know what -- I don't know
anything above that.  And like I said, he did the
testosterone, which made him mean.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And we're jumping around a
little bit.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sorry.  Do you know someone
named Donald Barr?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  He is -- I can represent to
you, was a former headmaster of the Dalton School,
which you mentioned earlier.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 192
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember any
conversations with Epstein about a book that Mr. Barr
wrote called Space Relations?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I've never heard of
that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  About aliens and sex?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether --
well, have you ever met the former Attorney General
of the United States Bill Barr?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember whether
Mr. Epstein knew him or whether his name ever came up
in conversations you had with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't recall any.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Did you have a
relationship or know -- I'm using "relationship," but
I appreciate you don't like that word.
           Do you have -- did you know Mr. Epstein's
brother Mark Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How did you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Through Jeffrey.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How would you describe your
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 193
relationship; close, friendly?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My personal?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not that close, but
friendly enough.  I mean, you know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How was Jeffrey Epstein's
relationship with his brother Mark from what you
observed?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, they were
brotherly, but I think that -- I don't know.  I don't
know.  They had periods when they were closer and
then when they weren't.  I think sometimes Epstein
found his brother irritating.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I think I know the
answers, given what you just said about Bill Barr,
but did you ever hear any -- from Mr. Epstein or
anybody else -- that Bill Barr had any role in
Mr. Epstein getting a good plea deal in Florida, or
any role in that process with Mr. Acosta?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never heard that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I think you said this in an
interview, but if I'm wrong forgive me.  Do you have
a view of Mr. Epstein of whether he committed suicide
or whether something else happened?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Can we take a break?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 194
           TODD BLANCHE:  Want to take a break?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yeah, sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  We can take a break.
Yeah.  Sure.  Actually, it's a good time to take a
break anyway, because it's to be the last one of the
day.
            SPENCER HORN:  All right.  So we're going
to take a break at -- it's 2:53, Thursday, July 24th.
            (Off the record at 2:53 p.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  We are continuing with the
recorded proffer of Ms. Maxwell.  The time is now
3:10 p.m., Thursday, July 24th.
           TODD BLANCHE:  My colleagues alerted me to
a couple questions I think I may have forgotten to
ask you.  One is -- sorry, I'm just going through my
notes.
           Well, we talked few minutes ago about this
birthday book that there's press about.  I understand
you don't remember anything with President Trump or a
lot about the book anyway.
           Do you remember asking President Trump to
submit a letter for that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you remember --
would you have been the one to do that or could
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 195
somebody else -- would somebody else have done that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did ask some people.
I don't remember Mr. Trump.  I don't remember who I
did ask, but Epstein also asked people himself
directly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it could have
happened that way, if it happened at all.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Where is that?
           DIEGO PESTANA:  You mentioned Ehud Barak.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           DIEGO PESTANA:  What was his involvement?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  This would've been in
the later 2000's.  So I do not know how they met, but
I do know that they -- I don't know if friendly would
be the right word.  I don't know that, but I know
that they saw each other and only because my
father -- you know, anything that touches Israel or
the state of Israel, I'm always interested in,
because my father loved Israel and so I pay attention
to it and we have ties to, you know, to Israel.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you said it was later
though --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Ties meaning friends
and family relations.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 196
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was the Prime Minis- was
Mr. Barak, Prime Minister Barak, do you know what the
nature of his relationship was with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- were you
ever with them together?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think I met -- I
have a memory of meeting Ehud, but I don't know if he
was with Epstein or -- I don't remember.  I just know
that I did see him and I'm trying -- struggling to
remember the context around it, but if I -- if -- I'm
sure it happened, but it must have been very brief.
Because I don't have any serious memory of it.  Any
like, deep memory of that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And maybe this is
obvious --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And maybe it comes
also because I've read it in the press.  That may be
something that brought it to my memory.  So that's
also -- I mean, I'm also -- I think the press has
been very contaminating, so I just -- it's hard
sometimes to separate those stories from your memory
sometimes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know a British
gymnast by the name of Heather Mann?
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 197
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did she --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I didn't know she was
a gymnast.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh, okay.  I'm reading
something that says she was a gymnast, but please
don't assume that that's correct.  This is based upon
my words.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did she ever travel with
you and/or Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think, yeah, she did
actually.  I think that she might have been one of
Mr. Epstein's girlfriends at some point.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- again, I know we're
talking about time periods that are vast.  What time
period would that have been?  Like after you --
like since 2000?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say -- I
don't know, it could be the '90s -- could be the
'90s, I don't know.  But I mean, listen, there are
people that pop out of the woodwork all the time.  I
just saw one on TV saying she was his girlfriend in
'93 and '94.  So I mean, he obviously was very busy.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Or she's lying.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 198
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Or there's that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did - someone named Mark
Middleton --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, I remember him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He was in the --
Mr. Clinton's administration -- President Clinton's
administration, I think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how do you -- do you
know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I met him and
that is -- I met him through Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you -- was he, from
what you observed, was he a friend or business
acquaintance of Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, I only saw him
a handful of times, but I did see him with him.  I
mean, he seemed friendly.  I don't know if I would
characterize -- I mean, only having seen him briefly,
I don't know how to characterize that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether he like
flew on airplanes with Mr. Epstein?  Did he visit the
island?  Do you know anything about that or their
relationship as it relates to that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never -- I don't
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 199
have any recollection of seeing Mark Middleton at the
island.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How about former US Senator
George Mitchell?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, I do remember
George.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do you remember about
him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I traveled with him.
We went to -- the most memorable affair I went to --
well, I was friendly with his wife.  Start with that,
with Heather.  And Heather was in New York, so I hung
out with her a few times.  We had dinner and I was
just friendly, I would say separately with --
separately from her husband.  I was friends with
Heather.  I met Heather through her husband, but we
became friends.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You became friends with
Heather?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Heather, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was Mr. Epstein friends
with, Mr. Mitchell?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did they travel together
besides New York?  Did they travel to the island or
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 200
to New Mexico?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't -- I don't
remember George ever at the island.  But the most
memorable trip I do recall with Senator was to Italy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was to where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  To Italy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Ah, okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  We went to Rome.
           TODD BLANCHE:  As the four of you.  So
Heather and Mr. Mitchell, and you and Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's my
recollection.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what were you there
for?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, the most
memorable aspect of that trip is we went to the
Vatican.  It was extraordinary, the most
extraordinary thing was going to the archives and
holding Henry VIII's document to the Pope asking for
his divorce.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know the former
president of Colombia, Andr?s Pastrana?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met Andr?s Pastrana
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 201
in a pub in Dublin.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did he travel with
Mr. Epstein, that you know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't -- I don't
know if -- I don't know if he ever was ever on the
plane.  I don't know if he ever -- I don't think he
ever came to the island.  But, I went to places with
Andr?s Pastrana.  One was to Colombia and Epstein
came to that, and the other was to Cuba and Epstein
and Andr?s Pastrana was -- I think was there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what were the purposes
of traveling to Colombia, then Cuba?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I am a helicopter
pilot and Andr?s is a helicopter pilot.  And we just
became friends and I flew a Blackhawk in Colombia.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how about to Cuba?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My -- I have a friend
of mine who was the cigar distributor for Montecristo
maybe, I can't remember which cigar it was.  And so
we went there, and he organized the trip and we met
Fidel Castro.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that,
approximately?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Had to be -- it had to
be 2002, 2003.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 202
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Something like that, I
think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  There's some more names
that we might talk about tomorrow with the same type
of questions, just -- but as far as a catchall,
there's been a tremendous amount of public
information about all kinds of names, including some
of the folks we talked about today and their
relationship with Mr. Epstein and or you.
           For any of the folks that we've talked
about today, did you observe them doing anything
improper with Mr. Epstein, whether with masseuses or
with women who were -- or girls who were traveling or
at the residence that they were at or at the parties
that they were at?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did not ever, at any
time, see that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And for any of the names
we've talked about today, and then tomorrow we'll
talk about some more, but for today, do you recall
having any conversations with anybody else, where
they reported to you that they had seen something
that one of these individuals had done, whether
someone else that works with Mr. Epstein or somebody
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 203
that observed something?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  If anybody had ever
reported anything -- first of all, the answer to that
is no.  And also, I just want to be clear that had
anybody ever reported anything illegal or disgusting
like that, I would've immediately done something.
And I never heard it.  I never saw it.  And no one
ever, ever, ever complained to me or tears, nothing
like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  All right.  So we
took a break when we were talking about Mr. Epstein
and his death.  Oh, bless you.  That's okay.  Take
your time.
           So Mr. Epstein and his death.  So you were
not, obviously, at the MCC during that time, correct.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Oh, thanks.  I thought you
were giving it to him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I've got something
that blew up my nose.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So just take some water.
It's okay, no problem.
           You were not at the MCC during that time,
correct?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was not.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 204
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you're going to tell us
what you believe, but just to -- I just want to make
sure I understand, your basis for belief is kind of
what you've read and seen and your knowledge of
Mr. Epstein for the many years you knew them -- knew
him, right?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And actually there's a
third component.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The answer to that is,
yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And there's a third
component to that, which is having experienced now,
the mismanagement and inefficiencies and total
dereliction of duty at the Bureau of Prisons.
           TODD BLANCHE:  From BOP.  From the Bureau
of Prisons.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Fair.  Okay.  So,
you know, I want to -- what I do want to be careful
about is -- you know, asking you to speculate,
because anybody can do that.  And I don't think
that's fair to you or anybody else to ask you to give
us your kind of opinion.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 205
           But, do you think that -- the third point
you say, which is kind of a failure by the BOP,
there's been a lot of -- there's an OIG report,
there's SDNY investigation about that.  Do you -- so
you think he was -- he did not die by suicide, given
all the things we just talked about.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not believe he
died by suicide, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you believe that --
do you have any speculation or view of who killed
him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- no, I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I ask that because, if
you don't believe that there's any truth to the
allegations of blackmail or that he had kind of a
list, or that he had reasons to have people hate him,
why would somebody kill him in prison?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  In prison, where I am,
they will kill you or they will pay -- somebody can
pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of
commissary.  That's about the going rate for a hit
with a lock today.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So that goes to the third
reason, which is kind of the mismanagement.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 206
           TODD BLANCHE:  Or the shortfallings or
shortcomings of the Bureau of Prisons.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Which is a little bit
different than my -- from my question is, which is,
do you think there was somebody on the outside of
prison, so putting aside, what could happen on the
inside on the outside of prison, who would -- who
wanted him dead so badly that he would've, or she
would've, you know, caused him to be killed on the
inside?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think that's -- I
don't see that.  I think, is it possible?  Of course
it's possible.  But I don't know of any reason why,
and I don't believe in the blackmail or in any of
this, I don't think Epstein had a hit on like that.
If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal
situation.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  So you're not -- you
don't have any reason firsthand knowledge or even
speculation, it sounds like, to think that he was --
if -- that he was killed to kind of silence him or to
keep him from going public about people he knew
about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't, no, because I
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 207
think that is just part of the story that's been
created that started back in 2008, '09.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Yeah, I mean, that's
the point.  Like, I don't want -- I don't think
there's value in talking -- you know, there's been a
lot of -- there's a lot of information about what
happened, you know, at the MCC and -- but what is
important to me is whether, you know, if -- is the
idea that he didn't die by suicide, that's one thing.
But if to the extent that folks believe that he was
murdered to keep him quiet or because he had
information on rich and powerful people, that's what
I -- do you have any reason to believe that that's
true?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not have any
reason to believe that.  And I also think it's
ludicrous, because if that -- I also happen to think
if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty
of opportunity when he wasn't in jail.  And if they
were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he
would've been a very easy target.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In the time -- so we've
talked about a lot of time, all the way up through
2009, '10, and then your -- the time that after
Mr. Epstein was arrested, when's the last time you
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 208
spoke with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Maybe 2016, 2017,
maybe 2016 -- 2015, 2016, 2017 in that area, I
believe.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what -- when you're
thinking about that last time was that you had
talked -- been talking to him a lot, and then you
stopped, or was that a one-off time and it was
infrequent at that point?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I really wasn't in
communication.  The only communications I had with
him was in -- with regards to the civil suits, the
civil suit that I found myself in, the defamation
suit I found myself in.  I needed help, I needed
information, and I didn't have what I needed.
           And so that was really what it was -- that
what drove it, was me trying to get myself out of
this situation, which I -- ultimately led to where I
am today.
           And so when -- when all that -- when
that -- I don't remember even if I stopped talking to
him before that, I think he was -- I thought he was
angry with me anyway.  He didn't like what I did, and
he -- I wasn't interested in what he had to say to
me, and --
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 209
           TODD BLANCHE:  What did you think he was
angry with you about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think he was angry
that I had even said that I had referred to her being
a liar.  He said I should have not said anything but.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When the civil suits that
were ongoing before Mr. Epstein's death?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did your lawyers coordinate
with his lawyers, like in discovery and things like
that or anything?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think we
coordinated in -- I don't -- I'm not sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't want to
misspeak.  I don't -- I -- there was some degree of
communication for sure.  I just don't know the degree
that that took place.  So definitely -- I mean, I was
definitely hoping for him to be more helpful.  And I
was definitely, coordinating is not a good word,
because that sounds like I was trying to make --
align myself.
           That's not where we were going here, but I
was definitely trying to get help.  As in documents
or information that I could use to defend myself.
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 210
That's a hundred percent true.  And the degree to
which that took place, I'm not -- I don't recall.
There was definitely some of that, though.  I don't
want to mislead you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And we touched on this
earlier, but I just want to -- I don't think we
really ran it to ground maybe as much as we could
like.  Going up through that time, you know, so in
the '16, '17, '18, up until the time he's arrested,
had your view or your understanding of what had
happened changed?
           Meaning did you believe that in the late
'90s or early 2000s when he started, you know,
behaving much differently.  Did you believe what you
were hearing about him at that point?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My views, I didn't
like the people he was with anyway.  So I don't find
-- how do I say this?  I don't like -- I like people
who my age or older, and I don't find the society of,
or the companionship of younger people who are young
people, I suppose, is really that enjoyable.  So I
don't like the company that he chose to be with, and
so I just was -- I find it boring and fundamentally
uninteresting.  That's probably the nicest way I can
say it.
MAGNA9

Page 211
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  So I think
what we should do is just spend a few minutes talking
about tomorrow.  Everything was great today.  I think
that we -- it was very helpful and I appreciate you
trying to be as complete as you can.
           I think tomorrow -- you've said a few
things today about materials that you brought.  When
we're done, we will give you a few minutes with Mr.
Markus to -- if there's things that you want to show
him that you think we should see.
           Like I said, I'm not asking you to
corroborate anything.  If I was asking you to
corroborate something, I would tell you, but if
there's something you think that you don't think that
the government has seen or you think that is
important for me to see, let Mr. Markus know and he
can share it with me.
           Tomorrow we'll certainly have some
follow-on questions when we all think about tonight.
And I think you will too.  You know, we can all think
about stuff we've talked about.  We covered a lot of
different areas.  We are -- I do want to talk about
more about you.
           So by design today we wanted to focus on
Mr. Epstein and talk about, you know, kind of, well,
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 212
everything under the sun that we've gone through
today.  I do think it's important when we all
evaluate what you've said today, and kind of your
story to understand, to also understand your -- why
you're here, right?
           So you were indicted, you were charged,
you went to trial.  And I want to do that in a way
that gives you an opportunity to say -- to kind of
say your piece or to say what you haven't said
before.
           But also understanding that there was
people who took the witness stand and swore to tell
the truth and testified about you, and what you did,
and what they think you saw and what they heard you
say.
           And I'm not -- I said to Mr. Markus, I'm
not trying to create a kind of a she said, she said
situation or he said, she said situation.  But I do
want to hear from you about your conduct, because
it's important, I think, for when we evaluate what
you say and how you say it and your recollection of
things to also to talk about that.
           So we're going to -- we'll do that
tomorrow.  I want to talk about, you know, the
circumstances leading up to your arrest.  There's a
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 213
lot of, I think, misinformation or there's a lot of
information out there that -- I don't know whether
there's misinformation, but about the time from, you
know, 2019 up until the time that you were -- that
you were arrested.
           And then, like I said, that'll take us
through lunch tomorrow and then we'll be done.  I'm
not -- I don't have a plan.  I didn't know that I was
coming here until this week, okay?  So I'm not --
there isn't like a -- we don't have like a schedule
of what happens next or what happens.
           But the -- but that's not a negative
thing.  I'm just saying that that's -- so you
shouldn't take the lack of a next step as anything
other than, we don't have a next step yet, so.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  May I say something?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Of course, yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just would like to
put out there that I also focused on how I think the
president got swept into some of this unnecessarily,
by the way.  And I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and I
certainly don't subscribe to all the -- all of
everything that I see.
           But I do believe that there is animus in
some areas that may have contributed to how the use
MAGNA9 
LEGAL SERVICES 

Page 214
of the president to harm him, that I find deeply
offensive.  And whilst I can't obviously say
definitively that that is what it is, I would like to
show you what I see so that you can evaluate it and
do with that as you see fit if it needs to be
addressed.  I've seen it, it struck me, and I would
like to give it to you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  For what it's worth.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that seem
something that I can --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, that's fine.  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Of course.  I don't
like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  That's fine.
That's great.  Okay, so why don't we stop for today.
I'll give you a little bit of time to chat and then,
see you in the morning.
            SPENCER HORN:  This will conclude the
recorded proffer interview for Thursday, July 24th.
We will continue tomorrow, Friday, July 25th.  The
time is 3:34.

                         ***
           TODD BLANCHE:  I am going to ask everybody
to put their name on the record here.
           SPENCER HORN:  Good morning.  My name is
Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Spencer Horn of
FBI, New York.
           Today we're doing a proffer of
Ms. Maxwell.  The date is July 24th and the time is
10:12 a.m.  This interview is being recorded.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And my name is Todd
Blanche.  I'm the Deputy Attorney General.  And
before we start formally asking questions of
Ms. Maxwell, I'm going to put on the record everybody
that's in this room, in addition to me, starting with
you, Diego.
           DIEGO PESTANA:  Diego Pestana, Associate
Deputy Attorney General.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then you heard from
Special Agent in Charge Horn.  Mark Beard from the
United States Marshal Service is here as well.
           And then David.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yes.  This is David Oscar
Markus, and I'm counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  My name is Leah Saffian and
Page 3
I'm counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell.
           MELISSA MADRIGAL:  My name is
Melissa Madrigal and I'm counsel for Ghislaine
Maxwell.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I'm -- I'm
Ghislaine Maxwell.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Good morning, Ms. Maxwell.
How are you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Good morning,
Mr. Blanche.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Good.  Okay.  So before we
started recording, we met for a few minutes.  I
introduced myself and we -- we've chatted and now
I've told you that we were going on the record.  And
before we start asking questions, I know that you've
been given, by your lawyer, a copy of what's called a
proffer agreement.
           And I just want to spend two minutes
making sure that you understand what -- what governs
our conversation today.  The most important part of
this agreement is that this isn't a cooperation
agreement, meaning that by you meeting with us today,
we're really just meeting, I'm not promising to do
anything.
Page 4
           I'm not promising to ask Judge Nathan or
any of the judges that's been assigned to your case
to do anything.  It -- we're just talking.  And so
that's the most important -- important part of -- of
this agreement.
           However, almost as important is the fact
that what this agreement does for you is it gives you
protection.  So what it means is that the government
cannot use what you say today against you, with some
exceptions, which we'll talk about in a minute.
           But whatever you talk about today, you
have what's called immunity.  So that means that the
words that you say today, we cannot use against you
in a case in chief, if we were ever to bring one.
Okay?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  All right.  There's
exceptions to that.  The most meaningful one of which
is that, if you say something today that's not true,
that's a lie, we can bring a prosecution against you
for what's called false statements.
           So I'm a federal officer, I have several
officers here.  The FBI is here.  And if -- if you
lie to someone that's -- like me or like Special
Agent Horn, it's a crime.  So you have to be
Page 5
truthful.
           The other exception to this, that doesn't
necessarily apply directly to you, but if there ever
was a retrial in your case, or if there ever was a --
a criminal case -- a future criminal case against
you, and your lawyer or you said something different
or took a position that's different than what you say
today, we can then cross examine you or a witness,
based upon what you say today.
           So it's a little bit nuanced, meaning I
can't use what you say against you in our case in
chief.  However, if you were to testify or if your
lawyer called a witness to testify, and they said
something that is totally different than what you say
today, we could then cross examine you or the witness
and say, hey, do you remember when we met with
Ms. Wax -- when we met with Ms. Maxwell back in July
of 2025?  She told us and then say what she said.
Okay?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I understand.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Other than that,
you -- I -- I know you didn't have a lot of time this
morning to meet with -- with -- with Mr. Markus, but
did -- did you have a chance to go over this briefly
with him?

(Pages 6 to 9)
(Pages 6 to 9)
Page 6
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  All right.  So I've
already signed it, as has Special Agent Horn --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- and Mr. Markus signed it
as well.  So you got a pen, please sign it --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right here?
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- right where it says
"client." Yes.
           And I will provide a copy of this to -- to
your lawyer so you guys have it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay, thank you.
           So Ms. Maxwell, about a week and a half
ago or two weeks ago --
           SPENCER HORN:  Can you see the light
blinking on there?  On the Sony?  Yeah, there it is.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay. We're just confirming
that it works and it does.
           Ms. Maxwell, I guess about a week and a
half or two weeks ago, Mr. Markus reached out to me
and said that -- that you wanted to speak with
somebody from the government about, not only your
case, but about everything that's been in the media
and that's been publicized about Mr. Epstein in your
Page 7
case.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did he --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's true and I did
speak to him and I did ask him if -- oh, and did tell
him that I would be very keen to talk to anyone,
because no one from the government, at any time, ever
in the -- since the inception of the case, so dating
back to the early 2000s, has ever spoken to me, and
indeed, I believe ever reached out to me at any time
to even speak to me. And that includes up to when I
was indicted and prosecuted.
           I believe that -- or I understand, I
should say, rather, that my attorneys, at the time,
did tell the government that I wanted to speak to
them, because I was very keen to meet with anyone, so
that I could tell or have them ask me any question.
           I've never had any problem to -- to speak
to anybody.  And I offered myself and I kept asking,
if they would meet with me, so I could talk to them
and for whatever reason --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- that was not
happening.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  I have questions
Page 8
that I want to ask you, but I'm not -- if there's a
path that -- a question that I'm not asking, that you
think should be asked, I -- I invite you to
volunteer.  Same thing goes to your lawyers.
           Just to start a little bit very briefly,
can you talk about when you first met Mr. Epstein.  I
know that goes back a while.  And just very generally
talk about your relationship with Mr. Epstein, from
the time you met him all the way up until -- until
his death.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met Mr. Epstein in
1991.  My -- I had -- I had never heard of him or met
him before.  And no one in my family had ever either.
My father never knew him.  And I'll explain why that
is the case. I met --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Where did you -- where --
where did you meet him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I had a girlfriend
who -- I -- I was -- yeah.  I had moved to America,
briefly, in -- well, I'd moved to America in 1990.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- well "moved,"
that's a big word.  I'd come to visit America in
1990.  I had been running my own company up until
that time, which was a company called Maxwell's
Page 9
Corporate Gifts.
           And I had also been working for my father
at the time.  I had multiple jobs with him.  I was --
in 1990 I was working with a -- a new company of his,
a new -- a new newspaper that he was launching,
called The European.
           And I was in charge of launching a
magazine to go with the -- The European.  And I was
traveling at that time from England to America,
because my father was looking to -- well, he'd also
bought McMillan the -- the publishing house.  And he
had purchased the New York Daily News.
           And it's truth that my father always
wanted me to come back, full time and work for him,
but that's a much longer story I don't think we need
to go into at this time.
           So -- but I was always working with him.
There was no escaping it were -- as it were to -- to
work for him.
           So in 1990, I had come over to New York,
to help look at some of that.  He was having some
advertising issues with the New York Daily News.  And
in fact, I met -- I may have met Donald Trump at that
time, because my father was friendly with him and
liked him very much.  And I think, should be said

(Pages 10 to 13)
(Pages 10 to 13)
Page 10
that he also very much liked Ivana, because she was
also from Czechoslovakia where my dad was from.
           So I don't -- I don't remember if I did
meet him or not in 1990 with my dad, but I knew that
that's how I knew about, -- about Mr. Trump.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And this was before you
met --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  This was before I met
Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay. All right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I was already going
backwards and forwards in America.  And then in April
of 1991, I came to New York, but, I can't remember
for what reason -- what business reason, but there
was a business reason -- something to do with my dad
at that time.
           And a girlfriend of mine who -- an
American, told me I -- I -- I had broken up with my
long -- I'd been engaged, getting my -- the very
long-term boyfriend and we'd broken up.
           And she said, I've got -- you know, as
your girlfriends do, I've got a guy for you to meet.
And I was like, who is it?  And she goes, it's --
Page 11
he's been dating my sister.  You'll love him.  He's
looking for a wife.  I'm edging towards 30.  I don't
need to tell you guys, That's a very important moment
for a girl to, like, think about important things.
And sure, I'd be happy to meet him.
           And so sometime in 1991 now.  We are in
1991, I met him at his offices in -- on Madison
Garden.  And I think the most memorable thing I can
think about that is he was wearing a tie, which he
didn't often do.  It had a giant, seemed like a
ketchup stain on it.  So I was like, wow, okay. And
that was how we met.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was your meeting at his
office for you to meet him just personally or were
you -- were you there for --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- work related reasons?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I -- I knew
nothing about him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- he just invited
me to come and have tea, and I was like tea, that's
English.  Okay.  But what was unusual, was in his
offices.  So I went to his offices and we met.  And I
found him very engaging and that was that.
Page 12
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- okay.  So that's how
you meet him.  So we -- and again, I don't want to
spend a lot of time, you know, on -- on this
particular issue, but what happened with your
relationship over the years, from the time you meet
him in 1991, up until the time he -- he passed away?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Just give the highlights.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay, the highlights.
So I -- I was looking for real estate for my dad to
buy some, and Epstein told me that he was also
looking to move from his apartment and would I help
him?  And I -- I said, sure I'm looking already so I
could look for him.  So that's how it started.
           And then, in 1991, my father passed away
and I returned to New York after that, originally to
come back and help with the family businesses, which
was McMillan.
           And then the debacle of my father's
passing hit the family. And -- and we lost all our
businesses and my family thought that it would be
best if I stayed in America, because of the intensity
of the press and the drama surrounding my father's
death in England
           So I stayed and Epstein said, well, you
can keep helping me. You can help me find a house and
Page 13
we can decorate the house.  And it gave me something
to do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Were you in a romantic
relationship with him at this point or just friends?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, just friends.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And while we're just --
with respect to your father, there have been multiple
questions about whether he worked for any
intelligence agency.
           Do you have any knowledge about that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think -- well
certainly my father had a background in intelligence
during -- because he was -- I believe he did in the
second World War.  He was an intelli- -- a British
intelligence officer.  I think that, my sort of
belief is that once you've been an intelligence
officer, you're kind of -- always; it doesn't mean
that you're formally employed.
           So I don't think my dad in any formal
sense was, you know, employed by the -- any agency.
But when you are a very significant businessman and
politician, as my father was, you meet with people
over time and you, I guess trade business or ideas.
           I think if -- if that would fall under
that definition, that's how I would give it.

(Pages 14 to 17)
(Pages 14 to 17)
Page 14
           Now he certainly, I have no formal
knowledge of anything specifically that he did in
that thing, but if you're asking me if I thought that
he did help people, the answer would be yes, I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did your father and Mr.
Epstein have a business relationship over the years?
I know we're maybe jumping around a little bit.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  They never met.  So --
           TODD BLANCHE:  As far as you know, they
never even met?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No. I -- I--
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or you know they never
met?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I know they never met.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, how do you know they
never met?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  They -- just
categorically know they never met.  Well, because
after, in 1991, before my father died, he asked me if
I'd met anybody interesting or whatever, you know,
because I was still trying not to be sucked back into
the family business.
           And I told him that I had met Mr. Epstein.
And the reason why I shared that I'd met Mr. Epstein,
because I believed, at that time, that Epstein worked
Page 15
for Bear Stearns.  And Bear Stearns was one of our
banks.  And I knew that my father was friendly with
both Jimmy Cayne and with Ace Greenberg.
           So my dad came -- was actually in
New York, I think.  If I remem- -- I may -- I don't
think I had this conversation on the phone, but I --
I honestly we're talking 30 years ago, so I'm not
sure.
           But if I -- I maybe I told him this
verbatim, because it happened -- I know that what my
dad did, whether I saw it or whether I -- he did it
and told me later I -- that I don't remember.
           But he called both Jimmy Cayne and Ace
Greenberg to ask if -- what sort of guy he was and
was he even allowed to -- because (indiscernible)
so . . .
           TODD BLANCHE:  So they never -- they never
met.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He didn't even know
who he was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But they had -- they --
they knew some of the same people, it sounds like, or
certainly the Bear Stearns connection was something
that -- that you -- that you knew that they had.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Well, he never
Page 16
had a connection with Epstein.  He had a connection
with the bank.  I mean, Epstein, I'd never heard of
him or knew of him before.  And I certainly -- if my
dad had known him, right, when I said, this is who he
was, he didn't know who he was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So he rang Ace and he
rang Jimmy, to ask if it was okay that I even knew
him.  And I just want to explain, briefly why my
father would even do such a thing.
           I've had some -- some interesting things
that have happened in my life.  And one of them was
to be found on an IRA kidnap and murder list.  And so
after that happened -- well, there were other
related -- I'm not going to bore you with all the
horrible things in that vein, but I -- if you want
the details, of course I can.
           But after that happened, my father wanted
to put a lot of protection on me, obviously.  And I
declined on the grounds that that would be a very
life-restricting event.  You are all in law
enforcement, I know you understand this.
           And so he had told me that, you know, I
would be taking my life in my own hands and then
whatever.  And so I think after that event and
Page 17
several others, where I had stalkers and all that
thing that one has, he was always quite protective of
me.  And so if I met somebody, he would try and
verify that they weren't going to do anything
hideous.
           And so in case he thought it was weird,
that he would call Jimmy and -- and Ace -- it
might -- you know, you may think it is but in my --
from my perspective, he was just -- because he was
concerned, I was in America alone and he had an
opportunity to verify who this person was.
           And so I don't know if I was in the room
with him, I don't recall.  But I know that at some
point my father told me he's fine.  You can see him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He's safe.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So we might come back and
touch a little bit more on that at some point, but --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I went down a rabbit
hole for a minute.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's all right.  I
just wanted to --

(Pages 18 to 21)
(Pages 18 to 21)
Page 18
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, that's helpful.
Thank you.
           So -- okay.  So you're -- you're now in
the '90s and you're friends with Mr. Epstein.  Your
house -- decorating the house or the apartment.
           What -- what happens with your
relationship?  Again, I know we're talking about a
35-year time period or whatever, but to the extent
you can kind of, at a very high level, talk about it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Listen, I think just
full disclosure is the best way to go at this point.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So in 1992, I slept
with him one time and I was like, whoa, that's it.
We're going to be dating, because that's how I
thought.  And -- and I kind of thought of myself in
that moment.  Like, because you, I felt if you slept
with someone, that you were then dating them.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's the world I
came from.  But that really was -- well, that's how I
thought.  And -- but we didn't sleep together again
for, I don't know, really a significant period of
time.  And when I say --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like years or?
Page 19
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if it was
a year.  I don't -- it feels that feels long, but
maybe nine months, I mean, a long time.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I just want to go
back to -- I had found a house for him to rent in
New York, because he had asked me -- I had been
looking at one for my father, and I found one, which
was a former Iranian embassy, I think it was.  I
think it belonged to the Iranians, or the Iraqis or
someone.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I didn't know that
he had any money.  It was like, I want to say it was
$12,000 a month, which to me seemed like a fortune.
And I said to myself, I found this house, but I don't
think you can afford it.  He was like, that's
ridiculous.  Of course I can afford, and he rented
it.
           And that house came with -- it was a State
Department house, because it was -- I think that was
under sequestration or whatever it was.
           And I -- I put it back together, but there
were certain rules, you couldn't paint, because it
had to go back and he gave it back to the country
Page 20
then.
           So he had this house and I had moved into
a 10 foot by 10 foot apartment, because all of our
stuff had been either lost or frozen or -- or
whatever.
           So he became, in this moment, my life
line, really, because I was -- everything was --felt
very similar to this moment, if that makes sense.
           Anyway, so but I had no key to his house.
I had no free access to his house.  And in the entire
time that he lived there, which was I believe until,
the beginning of 1996, I never slept a single night
in that house.  Never ever.  Not one.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you -- so you -- you --
you said a minute ago that the -- that you had slept
with him on one occasion, and at the time you
remember thinking, you know, that this meant you were
in a relationship, but then it didn't -- you really
were not in that type of relationship.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I thought --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did that change over --
between '91 and '92 or whatever and -- and -- and
years forward?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I did travel with
him a lot.
Page 21
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I would go to his
houses in Palm Beach.  He only had that house
actually in -- no, that's not true.  He had the house
in Palm Beach and he had a house in Ohio.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Ohio.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And he had the house
in Ohio because of his business relationship with
Mr. Wexner.  And he had a -- and I had to go and
decorate and put that house together.  When we
traveled together, we stayed in the same bed, but not
in -- but I didn't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.  It's okay, talk.
           So you -- you stayed -- so when you would
travel with him to his houses in Palm Beach, Ohio, or
even just traveling, if -- if -- if it was just
traveling with him, you would stay in the same bed.
So sleep in the same bed with him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Epstein told me that
he had a heart condition.
           DAVID MARKUS:  A what?

(Pages 22 to 25)
(Pages 22 to 25)
Page 22
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Heart condition.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Heart condition.
           TODD BLANCHE:  A heart condition.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Which meant that he
didn't have intercourse a lot, which suited me fine,
because I actually do have a medical condition, which
precludes me having a lot of intercourse.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So what -- what was your
understanding of his heart condition and why that
prevented him from having intercourse regularly?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know.  I mean,
he liked other forms of sexual activities.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, let's come back.
           We're going to obviously spend some
time -- a lot of time on the actual conduct he was
accused of.  So we'll --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- we'll -- we'll come back
to that.  So pick up where you -- where you were
talking about you traveling around with him, he
rented the New York, former Iranian House --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Iranian, there you go.
Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- until around '96.  At
that time, you -- I believe you said that he was
Page 23
basically your life, like you were with him pretty
regularly.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I -- no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I never was with
him regularly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That is one of those
misnomers.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, at the
beginning I did see more of him, but I worked in his
office.  So I would go to the office and I would see
him, and I would count in my head when I would see
him.  I would count that I would -- that would be a
day that I would see him.  But I didn't -- I never,
ever stayed with him.
           I believe certainly until '93 or '94, what
I didn't know was that I think he was still with his
actual girlfriend who was Eva Andersson, who became
Eva Dubin.  They had been together, my understanding,
I think about 10 years.  I'm not sure, but that's
what I think, 10 years.
           And I had understood from my girlfriend
initially, that they weren't together and Epstein
Page 24
himself had told me that they were not together.  But
I don't -- I don't think that was true.  In fact, I
know it's not true.  So they were still together, up
until, I think '94, when at some point, in that
period of time, Eva met Glenn Dubin and they got
married, I think in '94.
           I don't remember when they got married,
but her, she was his best friend and his everything,
he told me that he always wished that he had married
her and had a child with her.
           And I know that they -- she was family for
him for his whole life.  And I think even -- I'm not
sure this is true, but you guys will know if this is
true or not.  When he came from -- back from Paris
and you arrested him, I don't know if Eva was on the
plane.
           Now, I think that either I read it in the
-- in the discovery that I received, or I saw it
somewhere.  But even if she wasn't on the plane,
there must have been some email communication where
she was in Paris at the same time and going to fly
back.
           One or the other, I don't know which one
is the correct version of that.  But so they were
still obviously very close and remained throughout
Page 25
the time.  In fact, he -- he was-- still saw her a
lot.
           And so I also know now, which I didn't
know at the time, was that he saw lots of other
women.  And I know that now, because I can see -- I
can see it from the flight logs and I know it now
because I can see from the emails.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So, you know from the
case --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, not from --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- that what happened.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, I didn't know --
           TODD BLANCHE:  You didn't know that along
the way.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I contemporaneously, I
absolutely did not know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So, okay -- so just -- and
we're going to spend time on everything you're
talking about, but just to kind of close out the big
picture of your relationship.
           So we're now in the late '90s, continue on
with, again, staying high level to the extent you
can, about your relationship with him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So after -- so my
responsibilities increased with each acquisition that

(Pages 26 to 29)
(Pages 26 to 29)
Page 26
he had and each new project.  So I believe the first
thing that he purchased after was the ranch in
New Mexico.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And so what he had
tasked me with up until that, and I think that was
purchased in '94, if I'm right.  So he had tasked me,
one of the things that we did was visit, in my mind,
I say every state, but it wouldn't have been every
state, but many states, to go look at real estate
property.
           And so I know we went to Montana.  I know
we went to Utah and it was -- it was to go look at
real estate.  It was fun, to be honest.
           And then I arranged for us to go to
New Mexico and he just loved New Mexico.  And then I
don't remember how the ranch happened.  I don't
remember that now, it's lost.  And then he ended up
buying the ranch.
           And I think, if I'm right, it came from --
well, the Kings who may have been the governor, I --
you know, bought the ranch.  And then I had to deal
with that.  Dealing with that was the extent of it.
           The way that I thought of myself, or the
way that I think is the best way to explain how I
Page 27
view my role, was as a general manager.  Because each
property, to me was like a -- a hotel.
           So the ranch was very challenging, because
not only that, but it had BLM land, so to help
maintain your BLM, you have to have cattle and I love
animals.
           And so the first thing, horses.  And so I
wanted it, if you're going to have a ranch, I like
authenticity.  And so I don't think you should have a
ranch if you're not going to have the things that
make it special.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So were you -- were you
paid by him along the way --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- during this time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I became -- I became
salaried at some point.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I -- my memory is
that I got paid $25,000 a year to begin with.  That's
my memory.  I may be wrong.  And then with each -- as
it became obvious, because I kept thinking I was
going to go home; home being England.  And -- but
it --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- and financially,
Page 28
you were not relying on him, the -- the $25,000 or
whatever amount you were paid, were you relying on
that money to live and his generosity to live or did
you have your own -- your own money.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So there's a --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And again, I -- I want to
just make sure we're talking about that.  Like
keeping it between like the late '90s, you know,
maybe, I guess into a little of the 2000s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just want to hit
something on the head right now.  There's a
tremendous amount of reporting that said that I had a
--
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  A trust fund.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.  A trust
fund.  I have never had a trust fund, at any time.
           DAVID MARKUS:  So how did you live, did
you live with -- with -- I mean, $25,000 is not
enough to live on.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No. So I had -- during
this period of time, the secret -- secret, the
Serious Fraud Squad had come to see me, in relation
to my father's passing, and to establish whether I
had been involved in any way with his business or
with any shenanigans.
Page 29
           I think -- I've told this story many
times, so I don't know if it's now somewhat
apocryphal, but I'll tell you what it -- my memory
is.
           So I received a letter from them that said
about my business, and my memory may be apocryphal,
there was a PS that said (unintelligible), I had
nothing.  There was no -- I was never involved in any
of his business, whatever, so I was free.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And were you -- so, but
your -- you know, obviously your -- your father and
your family had a lot of businesses.  Did -- is it
because the money, whatever money or whatever equity
was in the businesses, just stayed with your other
family members?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, there was no
money.  So my father was never attached to money.  He
was born a peasant, a real one.  Dirt floor, no
shoes, no clothes -- some clothes, but not, you know,
sorry, I don't mean to say -- nothing.
           And he never -- he was never into that.  I
mean, there were things that he had his
extravagances, he loved his boat and his plane.  So
obviously you need money for that.  But there was no,
nothing else.  And there was not a single penny that

(Pages 30 to 33)
(Pages 30 to 33)
Page 30
came to any of us, at any time, ever.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- so when you
are talking about your life with Mr. Epstein in the
'90s, you -- you're -- you're not -- you -- you're
very different financially.  You -- you're very
different financially positioned than he is --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- meaning he's giving you
money, he's paying for your -- when you fly, he -- I
assume pays for your flights.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Okay.  So you -- you
-- I interrupted you when you were saying how you
were functioning as a general manager.  You helped
with the New Mexico ranch.
           So did -- did your role with him continue
like that for many years or for how long?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I continued -- in
2000 -- well, in -- by 1999, our relationship had
foundered.  In --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- well, two
reasons:  We were never sleeping together again.  So
we stopped having sexual relations in 1999.  Not full
sex.  Sorry, just to be clear.  Didn't mean that we
Page 31
didn't still share a bed bedroom sometimes or
whatever.  He had another girlfriend.
           TODD BLANCHE:  He had what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Other girlfriends.  I
definitively knew that it was over after 9/11,
actually, because we were both in New York and I
don't know, were you in New York on 9/11?  I mean,
9/11 ...
           And it was a scary time if you were in New
York.  You didn't know, I didn't know, nobody knew
what was going on.  And he was in 71st Street and I
was in 65th Street, my house.
           And he wouldn't see me at all.  Asked me,
his mum, who I'm very close to, who's in hospital at
Lennox Hill, just asked me to look after her.  And
then I knew, as anyone did at that time, if you're
not going to be there for someone in 9/11, you're
never going to be there.  So for me, that was the
line's end.  And he had another English girlfriend
actually, from 2000.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Are you, though, still on
his -- are you still being paid by him at this point?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- so go ahead.
           So what -- what -- at that point, when you
Page 32
say you realized kind of it was over?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I mean, I'm
talking about the -- the -- I had had, there was a --
I had wanted to get married and have children.
           And Epstein had encouraged me to believe
that that would -- I don't know about the --
certainly by the mid late '90s, I knew the marriage
part was never going to happen.  I had believed that
maybe in '96, '97, '98 maybe, but then I realized it
wasn't that.  But I did think that we might have a
child, which is what I had really wanted.  And I
realized --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- so -- okay.  So what
happens between 2001 and then 2019 with your
relationship with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Give or take, 2001.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So we stopped having
physicality.  I mean, that doesn't mean we weren't
friends.  I certainly did stay, sometimes, in his
room.  I mean, friends with benefits, if you will,
just not sex.  Sorry.
           And I started dating.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I met someone that
Page 33
I fell very much in love with in 2003.  His name was
Ted Waitt.  Ted Waitt, you may know as the founder of
Gateway, the computers.  And we had an amazing
relationship that ended in -- went on until 2010, I
think.  And I was with Ted from that time.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you meet him through
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Well, indirectly,
I suppose you could say so.  No, they'd never met.  I
was at a dinner where I met Ted, but it wasn't -- I
was with President Clinton.  President Clinton was my
friend, not Epstein's friend.
           And Epstein had flown him and there was a
dinner and Ted came to the dinner.  So I guess,
indirectly, through Mr. Epstein, because it was with
his plane, but I'd have been there anyway without
him.  I had -- was not the --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Was Epstein on the plane
when you guys flew?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  On that trip, yes.
Well, yes.  They -- that, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when you say the -- the
dinner was -- was where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Hong Kong.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And so the -- and

(Pages 34 to 37)
(Pages 34 to 37)
Page 34
you had flown over with -- so who was on the plane
for that trip?  I don't mean everybody.
           When you said, so Mr. Epstein was on the
plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You were on the plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who else, that you can
remember?  I'm not, you know, you only remember what
you remember.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Was President Clinton on
the plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Clinton.  He would've
-- he would've had his guy, Doug Vance, maybe Jason
Cooper, maybe the two.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you -- and so why --
so -- so how do you meet -- so -- so why did you say
that's when you met him and that you met him through
Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, it was a -- I
don't think Ted would've been there, had it not been
a -- it was a President Clinton dinner and Ted came
to be with President Clinton --
           TODD BLANCHE:  I see.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not to be with
Page 35
Mr. Epstein.  Does that make sense?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's why I say that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So you're -- you're,
so in the time that you're dating, that you're with
him to 2009, are you still working for Mr. Epstein
during that time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So his -- so it'd be
true to say that Jeffrey tried very hard, he tried
very hard to -- to keep me to working for him,
because this is a complex operator.
           I'm not talking about anything untoward,
just the sheer size of the projects.  I'm talking the
construction projects, the houses, the staff.  It's
a -- it's a really significant job.  And I ran all
the properties, the staff in the properties, the
management of the properties that -- and all the
construction.
           And we're talking tens of millions of
dollars for the island alone.  I can't remember what
the budget was for the construction on any given
year, it's gone.
           But it -- it was -- these are very
significant projects.  And so that was what I did.
And I managed the budgets.  Well, not, I didn't
Page 36
manage the budgets, I oversaw the budgets.  So I
would just make sure that if you said you bought an
air conditioning part, I saw an air conditioning part
and I could call the island manager.
           Did you receive the Carrier, whatever, you
know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When did Mr. Epstein
purchase the island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say '96 or
'97, something like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So we're going to
come back and spend more time on the money with --
with respect to Mr. Epstein and -- and his wealth.
           But just so we can finish this, so in
2009, you end your relationship with Ted.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  2009, 2010.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can't remember if it
was '10.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So in that time
period, what happens next with -- as far as your
relationship with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't have one with
him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You don't have one with
Page 37
him, like you don't see him or it's just a different
relationship?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did see -- I maybe
saw him once or twice, maybe even three times.  I
certainly went to his house once, for sure, maybe
twice.  But I was not seeing him.
           The only time that I was in touch with him
was when the things happened.  Like things, I mean,
in the press that affected me or when the CVRA case
was filed and there was like rubbish that went out,
because I needed information.
           Because I didn't know -- I didn't know
anything about what was happening and I needed his
help.  A, to under- -- I -- I-- well, that doesn't
sound right.  Let me rephrase that.  I don't mean his
help.  I meant to have answers, so that I had an
ability to defend myself, that's what I'm talking
about.  I'm not talking any- --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when does that
relationship change?  So -- so you're working -- you
talked about when your -- the physical relationship
stopped and then you're still working for him, or
with him managing his properties and being -- serving
as like a general manager.
           You then start your own relationship with

(Pages 38 to 41)
(Pages 38 to 41)
Page 38
another individual from -- with Ted from 2003 till
2009 or '10.  At what point in that whole period is
there like more of a break, where you're no longer
acting as his general manager?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I -- I wanted to
have a full break when I started dating Ted.  And he
was clever.  I -- I -- I suppose it would be true to
say that I sort of viewed Mr. Epstein, at that point,
as sort of family, if you will.  Like someone I could
rely on.
           And I should have had more confidence in
myself.  I can see that now.  But at the time, given
everything that had happened in my life, I thought
that it would -- and I saw how he was with other
people like Eva, who seemed to be very comfortable
with him, and I thought this would be -- and he
always said, I was like family.
           So he worked hard to make -- maintain a
relationship with me.  He was generous with me.  He
let me use the plane, for instance, which was very
generous, he would check in with my mum.  He did
things that were meaningful to me in that time.
           And then, it may still not have worked,
but that his -- his mother, Paula, had been in a very
serious car crash.  And I -- she had become sort of
Page 39
like a -- a surrogate mother for me, sort of, because
my mum wasn't there.  I could -- I could look after
her the way that I would -- sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  It's all right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The way that I
would've liked to look after my own mum.  So I became
very close to his mother.
           And she had been in a car crash and in
2004, I believe it -- it may have been 2005, I -- I
don't recall exactly.  She took a -- her health took
a serious decline.  And Epstein called me and asked
me if I could look after her.  And by looking after
her, that meant organizing her doctors, making sure
she had new clothes, making sure her house was clean.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Where was she?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She lived in -- in a
retirement establishment in -- outside of Palm Beach,
outside of -- its West Palm.  I want -- I was going
to say something like the Golden Girls, but it's not
called that.  I just don't remember what it's called.
But it was an old age -- it was a retirement home, if
you will.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Todd, I don't know, we've
been going for maybe about an hour now.
           Do you think -- is this a good time to --
Page 40
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah -- yeah.  So we'll
take a -- we'll take a break.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yep.
           SPENCER HORN:  All right.  So we're going
to take a break, the time is 10:56.
         (Break at 10:56 a.m. to 11:07 a.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  We're continuing the
proffer interview with Ms. Maxwell.  The time is
11:07 a.m., on Thursday, July 24th.
           TODD BLANCHE:  All right.  So just picking
up where we just stopped.  So -- so you -- you have
basically a break.  Well, not a break, that's the
wrong word, but your -- your relationship with
Mr. Maxwell [sic] -- professional and other changes
in 2003, '04?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  I mean, and
over the time that I stay with Ted, the more time I'm
with Ted, the more distance I have with him.  And
then when the arrest -- well, let's go back.
           When he -- whatever -- whatever happened
in 2005 and he became arrested in 2006.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when he's charged and
arrested in what we'll call the Florida
Investigations, that's what you're talking about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I am.
Page 41
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I had -- I was not
in -- well --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, were you part of that
investigation?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did law enforcement
ever talk to you as part of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you, like, the feds
never talked to you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- the FBI never talked to
you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never even received
a phone call.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- did you -- so you didn't
receive a subpoena?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did the state law
enforcement ever reach out to you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  As far as you know, did the

(Pages 42 to 45)
(Pages 42 to 45)
Page 42
government, either state or federal, subpoena your
bank records or subpoena anything from your financial
life, during that time?  During the -- that time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Not as far as I'm
aware.  Now, if they did, I don't know it and I have
-- I have no idea about that, to be honest.  But I'm
-- I'm not aware of it and I would say no, but maybe
you guys do things that I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So how did -- how did you
learn of that case?  When Mr. Epstein was arrested,
or did you know that something was happening before
then?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The -- the first thing
I knew was he had told me he was deciding to
redecorate the house in Palm Beach.  It didn't
surprise me, it was like a rolling situation.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And, but by that time are
you doing -- are you -- like he tells you because he
wants your help or your relationship changed by this
time where you were no longer kind of acting his --
as his general manager?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I was -- I was
still around.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wasn't gone.  I was
Page 43
with Ted.  I was traveling.  I wasn't daily -- if you
would ask me where he was in any given time, I'm not
sure I would've known then.  I mean, it was, I -- I
felt like I suppose the relationship moved into sort
of like a long-term friend-family, you know, like --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- like I felt he had
with Eva, if I'm honest.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  So -- so he
says to you he's going to redecorate the Palm Beach
house.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He -- he asked me
specifically which decorator he thinks I -- he should
use, because I had a lot of contacts with decorators
and he was not very good with people.  He was useless
at maintaining relationships with people who worked
for him, I'm not.  So anyways, I recommended -- I
think I recommended.  I can't be a hundred percent
sure, because it's been a long time, but I think I
recommended Mark Zeff at that time.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Mark Zeff --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I believe.  And I
don't know why.  I -- I don't remember.  That's all
Page 44
lost to time.  But anyway, at some point, I think his
mother had died now.  I can't remember the timing of
all of that either.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But I ended up in Palm
Beach and he had asked me to come and look at the
swatches or whatever he was doing, because they had
laid it all out over the house and various things,
and I think he'd asked for my opinion.  That's my
memory of this.
           It may also be that Ted and I were going
to Palm Beach, because Ted had a golf match or
something.  There was a reason I was in Palm Beach.
It wasn't solely -- I don't -- maybe that's not true
either.  I don't know.  So I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- there's a, you
know, sometimes I went to Palm Beach because Ted was
there.  I don't know if that's part of that time --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead -- go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- or Ted went there
and left me.  I don't know, something.
           Anyway, I was there.  No.  That's not how
that went either.  No.  Anyway, at some point in that
time, I saw all the swatches, at some point in 2005,
Page 45
I think that was.  And then I believe, or I don't
remember.  I -- I think I got a phone call actually.
I wasn't in Palm Beach.  I think I got a phone call
that there was a police at his house or something.
There was a --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And would you have gotten a
phone call from him or you think you were just told
by somebody that knew that it had happened or don't
-- or don't you remember?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Definitely not him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it would've
been the houseman.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when that happens,
whenever it was, that's kind of the first time you
know that Mr. Epstein's being investigated for --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I didn't even
know what that -- I didn't even understand.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I didn't have a
context for that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was like, I didn't
even know -- I -- I didn't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So after --

(Pages 46 to 49)
(Pages 46 to 49)
Page 46
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I didn't -- I
didn't -- I didn't -- I'm not sure even what I
thought.  I was like, that's weird.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so after he -- after you
find out about it, what happens with your
relationship with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I asked him.  I asked
him what was going on --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and he said, I --
I -- not to worry.  Nothing, nothing, taking care.
Don't worry about it (indiscernible) and then it all
went quiet.  I didn't -- he didn't say, he didn't
share.  I wasn't part of it at all.  I was off with
Ted and I really just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did he tell you -- well,
why don't we come back to more specifics around that
time period in a few minutes --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I want to just finish
this opening part.
           So that case goes on, ultimately it ends.
What -- what -- what was your relationship like with
him during that case, when he goes, you know, when
he -- when he was sentenced.
Page 47
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He asked -- he -- he
-- he told me, he said, "Listen.  I'm going to jail."
I was like, "Okay."  And he goes, "I would like you
to stay on board to manage the properties, the
animals, this and that, and just stay put and I'll
continue to pay you.  In case there's any emergency,
I don't trust anyone."  And I was like, "Okay."
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, when you said
continue to pay, had he con--- has he --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He had never stopped
paying me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  He never stopped paying
you.  So even when your relationship changes, you're
getting -- does the amount increase from the $25,000
or so a year from the beginning?  Like how much are
you getting paid yearly?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it ended -- at
the time, well, we had different payment structures
and I'm happy to explain how that was, but I think
salary wise, if I'm right, it ended at around a
quarter of a million a year.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How much?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Quarter of a million.
$250,000.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when -- and when did it
Page 48
end?  When was that that it stopped?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  2008, or '09.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  '09.  When did he come
out of jail?  Whenever he came out of jail.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So, and over the
years, it increased from what you said was you
thought about $25,000 to $250,000.  That's between
like '90, early '90s until 2009 or '10, whenever he
stopped; is that right?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes -- yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how were you paid?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  W2.
           TODD BLANCHE:  W2 from which -- from what
company?  Or do you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He, like I -- he just
moved me around over to this company, that, I didn't
care --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and I didn't care
and I didn't think that -- I didn't understand any
rhyme or reason, it doesn't, I just, you know,
whatever --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- so maybe --
Page 49
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so when he's going to go
to jail, he says, "Can you stay around and manage
everything."
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you do that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And then -- and then
we'll come back to that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, not manage
everything, no.  I mean there are other people at
this point.  My specific role then was very, very
diminished.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I reviewed the bill
structure that came from the constructions, that were
still made, the island --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and wherever else I
was going, Paris at this point, because I speak
French, I'm fluent in French.
           And also my relationship with the French
decorator was critical to him.  And in the French
component part of -- of that aspect, that was really
vital and so you would have had to find someone who
was -- well, actually, and the Spanish trilingual,

(Pages 50 to 53)
(Pages 50 to 53)
Page 50
you would've had to find someone who was trilingual
to -- and that he trusted --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- to manage, not
steal from him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- so when he gets
out of jail, between that time 2009 or '10, and 2019,
what's your relationship like with -- with
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Almost nonexistent.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I had just moved
on and I just didn't want to have anything to -- I
didn't want the drama.  I didn't want to be
associated with ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  So do you recall -- when
you say "almost non-existent," does that mean --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It doesn't mean it --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- was it some phone calls,
some visits --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I definitely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- some trips, or what does
it mean?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I -- I don't -- I
don't think there were any trips.  Oh, I don't -- I
Page 51
don't think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Where were you living
during that time period?  Or was it --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Which time period?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Between 2009, '10 and 2019?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was back in
New York.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So you had no -- so
when you -- so -- so your -- you had phone calls with
him on occasion?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Well, I
certainly did when it -- whenever there was any legal
drama or any like, serious press attention, I always
called him to try and find out what was going on.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Okay.  And then --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I did email him at
that time for those types of details.  It was like,
what do I do?  What, I mean, I was like ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  And -- and then when he's
charged in New York federally --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- how did you learn about
that case?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  In the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And had you, as far as you
Page 52
know, been contacted by law enforcement before his
arrest?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I wasn't in an
indictment.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  I know that, but even
as a witness or -- or asking you if you would give
documents or materials?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I had never -- up
until he -- up until when my lawyers said that, I
don't even know.  I -- I had no knowledge of them
being interested in me, honestly.  I don't -- I want
to say until he had died.
           Now I know that my lawyers were in touch
with the Southern District of New York at some point
after his arrest.  I'm pretty sure that had to have
happened, right --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- but I -- my
understanding is that they had not shown any
interest.  I know my lawyers went to see them once, I
believe, and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Went to see him meaning
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, them.  So Southern
District of New York.
Page 53
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  The Southern
District of New York.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.  And that they
had been in regular, in touch with him and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But now you're talking
about after Mr. Epstein died or are you talking about
before he died?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think, I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  If you can remember.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Easily verifiable.  I
-- my memory is that they were in touch with him when
he was arrested.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if
anything happened until after his death, then after
that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think they saw
them -- met with them, Southern District of New York
I'm talking about now, until after he died.  I know
that they were in regular telephone contact with them
and that my lawyers believed that they had been told
that there was no interest in me --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and were absolutely

(Pages 54 to 57)
(Pages 54 to 57)
Page 54
stunned when I was arrested.  But maybe stunned is
too big a word, but surprised.  I certainly was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So let's -- okay.
So that's -- that's -- was a long description of --
of what was a very long life and that was very
helpful.  So I want to go back and talk more
specifically now about particular areas, and, but
that was a -- a very helpful kind of foundation
for -- for us.
           The first -- the first thing I want to
talk about, you talked about earlier on, about
Mr. Epstein's financial success.  What -- you know,
do you know how he -- when you first meet him, at
some point you say, "I got this place for you to
rent, you can't afford it."  And he laughs at you and
says, "Yes.  I can."
           What did you learn about his wealth and
how he was -- and how he accumulated his money?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can tell you what he
told me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I -- I know that he
was hired from working at a private school whose name
eludes me at this point.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Dalton.
Page 55
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Dalton.  He was
working at Dalton, he was a math teacher.  And he
met, I think it was Ace, I'm not sure.  He met
someone from Bear who hired him, because he was very
good at math.  And I believe that he then worked on
creating a trading of, oh, my gosh.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Just describe it.  It's
okay.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He came -- came up
with some new type of trading system.  Not -- not a
system so much, but as a -- as a -- as a --as
vehicle.  A trading vehicle.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm just escaping
right now.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And this is while -- while
he was working at -- at Bear Stearns?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  At Bear Stearns.  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And, well --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And was this before you met
him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So this is what he told
you.
Page 56
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What you learned?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  This is what he
told me --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- himself.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so -- and then
eventually he starts a financial firm?  Do you know
that to be true or no?  J. Epstein & Company.  You
ever heard of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it's, yeah.
Yes.  So hang on a minute.  So I -- this I did not
know, but this I have subsequently learned --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- is that he had some
problem or some issue at Bear Stearns and there was
some, I don't know, disagreement.  He wasn't fired,
because obviously he was still very friendly with Ace
and with Jimmy, at least by the time I met him, but
they were working with him and he ran -- he had cli-
-- money at Bear Stearns, and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- his money, his
client's money.  We'll -- I'll come to that.
           But he started -- he told me himself that
Page 57
he started a business where he looked for stolen
money.  So if somebody -- let's see.  I'm trying to
think of some intelligent way to say it, but I can't
think of anything, I've been with -- not great --
I'll -- I'll give it to you.
           So let's say you have El Chapo, oh God, I
don't know where he comes from.  But anyway, we've
got El Chapo.  And El Chapo's laundering money or
still -- he's working with the Sinaloa Cartel and he
steals money from the Sinaloa Cartel and he moves it
to wherever.  So he's got stolen money from the
Sinaloa, goes to it.  This didn't happen.  I'm just
--
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah -- yeah.  I
understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- just coming up with
something in my head.  And the Sinaloa says to
Epstein, "Can you track down my billion dollars that,
the car- -- the other cartel stole from me?"  And
Epstein will go and find the billion dollars and will
take a portion of the money that was stolen at a fee
and give back the remainder.  That would be on a
percentage basis.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  But like what you just
described, which I appreciate what you said, a

(Pages 58 to 61)
(Pages 58 to 61)
Page 58
hypothetical --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The -- the -- please,
that was completely hypothetical.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- but that -- but that
would involve like, so two kind of drug cartels
stealing from each other.
           Practically speaking, did -- he was a --
more of a businessman, correct?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So here's how I think
that started, is that he had a girlfriend.  It was
always you -- you -- always to the girls.  I guess
there was a girl whose name will come back to me,
maybe not, whilst we're here, but I don't know,
maybe.  There's a woman --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- there's always a
woman.  And he -- she was the daughter of a
billionaire, for instance.  And that billionaire,
whoever his --whatever his name was, had had some
money stolen.  And for some reason this woman
introduced Jeffrey, and Jeffrey, I think that's how
that business started.  That's what I remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And is that something he
told you about or something that happened while you
knew him?
Page 59
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Something he told
me before I met him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so when you meet him
and -- and once you're part of his life in the early
to mid '90s, what is he doing to make money that you
see?  He -- does he have clients?  Does he have rich
clients?  Does he have famous clients?  And -- and
how -- and what -- if he does have clients, what
service is he providing them?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He does have -- well,
obviously there's the one very famous client that
everybody talks about, which is Les Wexner.  That was
a very important client to him.  And he -- I think
it's probably helpful to describe what I imagine --
what I imagine, know -- would I know to be true about
what he managed for Les.  And there's some bits that
I'll be improvising --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I want to just make
you understand, I was not part of Epstein's business
world, except tangentially and obviously.  So what
I'm talking about is I -- what I observed or what I
overheard or what I saw within the business, but I
Page 60
wasn't responsible for any of the client's money or
anything like that.  So it's separate.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Yeah.  I understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So with Les, for
instance, it was really all encompassing.  It could
go from the structure of the business.  So he
would -- he structured or restructured The Limited.
           I know that, and I'll come back to that
because I also traveled with him and Les, and I was
in business meetings with them on the plane when they
were there.  So I could observe and I could hear some
of this.
           And whilst I'm not necessarily terribly
business sophisticated, I'm sophisticated enough to
be able to at least have some knowledge of what was
happening.
           All right.  So then he restructured the
business.  He restructured his entire personal
finances, and would also handle all of the investment
strategy.  I don't know if it was -- if it was a
hundred percent --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Mr.  Wexner is what you're
saying?
Page 61
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.  Yes.  All --
this is all Wexner I'm talking about now.
           So let's say you had a billion dollars to
invest.  So you would, you know, in people's normal
investment portfolios, you would have, you know, some
T-bonds and this and that, but Epstein's strategies
would be much more sophisticated than that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so just staying with
Mr. Wexner.  Does -- from what you heard or saw, is
Mr. Epstein paid by him in percentages?  Like so --
so there would be a deal and he would be paid or
was -- did you understand it to be like a flat fee?
Was he a business partner?  Like how did you
understand him to be paid?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was more ?
la carte.  So let's say this is a conversation I
actually -- Epstein told me.  So all -- illustrated
for me, said if I saved someone $5 billion, he would
take a flat percentage of that $5 billion.  He
wouldn't have $5 billion back, and he would take --
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you say you think
that, is that because you heard him talking about
that or you -- you ...
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It would be a
combination of both.  He certainly told me that and I

(Pages 62 to 65)
(Pages 62 to 65)
Page 62
heard him talk to people like that.  I couldn't --
sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No -- no.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- was there -- did --
did he give -- did Mr. Wexner gift a property in
New York to Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So we're talking about
71st Street.  So I don't know what the business deal
was, because, again, I'm not part of his business
thing, but I think what happened would be that, let's
say Les owed him in, theoretically, for his services,
$100 million or whatever it was.  He could have
traded that against the property.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But do you know that that
happened or that's -- are you -- are you kind of --
do you remember whether there was conversations about
that or are you just thinking that could be one way
that it happened?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not sure.  And I'm
not trying to be -- I just don't remember if that's
something I know or if that's something that I
remember, or if it's something that I subsequently
know.  I believe -- I believe that to be what
happened, but I don't want to tell you that I have --
Page 63
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that make sense?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did Mr. Wexner and
Mr. Epstein -- are you aware of they -- of their
falling out that they ultimately had?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think -- I wasn't
there and I don't know how it happened.  I only know
what Les has said in the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you only know about
their, you know, their falling out or whatever you
want to call it, from what you've kind of read, not
from any firsthand knowledge?  You did -- you weren't
there, you weren't part of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know somebody named
Steven Hoffenberg?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Only from the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And so you don't
know anything about whatever business relationship
they may have had, Mr. Epstein --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never spoke about him,
never mentioned it.  I -- I only learned about that,
whatever that is, even -- I don't even know what the
truth is of that story, from the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How about Leon Black?
Page 64
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, I did meet Leon.
I do know Leon.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When do you remember -- and
again, I know we're talking about a very long time
ago, but do you remember approximately when you met
him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I could have met Leon,
not really -- so I might have met him, nothing to do,
because Leon Black is very good friends with other
friends of mine.  I would've met him, when I say
socially, I might have met him.  How Leon and Epstein
became really good friends, I don't -- I'm not sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But not through you, as far
as you recall?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  Not through me as
far as I know.  No.  I -- in fact, I'm -- I'm sure
that's not through me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know what kind of
work Mr. Epstein was doing for Mr. Black over the
years?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Same as what he did
for Wexner.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So we just talked about two
individuals.  And again, I know we're talking about
a, maybe a 15-year time period or even longer.
Page 65
           How many clients like that did Mr. Epstein
have?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But why don't I just
give you the names that I remember and that's --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Why won't I just give
you the names.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Do you want the names?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Elizabeth Johnson --
Johnson & Johnson.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When did -- as far as you
know, when did the relationship between Ms. Johnson
and Mr. Epstein start?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  '90s.  '90 -- I
don't -- I -- '95, '96.  '90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So during the time period?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  We're talking
'90s.  We're talking when I was there.  When I was
around.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how did the
relationship start?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know how he
became that friendly where he ended up managing her

(Pages 66 to 69)
(Pages 66 to 69)
Page 66
money, I wasn't there.  I mean, he -- I really had a
separate life.  We really had separate lives --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- except where they
synced.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But it wasn't from --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It wasn't from me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- from you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  It was not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And what's your
understanding of what Mr. Epstein did for
Ms. Johnson?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Same as what he did
for Wexner.  And when I -- and you have to
understand, it -- it went down to, in tiny details.
So I remember this -- I remember, this is an actual
memory, that he would make the contracts for the
maids, for the people who worked in their homes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So he would assist his
clients, at times, with -- you're saying with even
small things like contractual relations with --
with --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He said no detail was
too small, because everything that affected how they
lived and how they managed their life, was something
Page 67
that he felt he was -- if they want, he would be
responsible for, to make sure that the contract -- so
that if you had to fire someone, it wouldn't come
back and sue you or if that -- that sort of ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So Mr. Black,
Mr. Werner [sic] -- Ms. Johnson.  Who else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What's the name of the
woman from Ohio (inaudible).
           TODD BLANCHE:  Know someone named
Jes Staley.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  I do know Jes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who's that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He was at Morgan
Stanley and at Barclays.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do -- do you know
whether he and Mr. Epstein had a relationship?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, not a -- not a
physical one.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Business one.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I didn't suggest.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry, I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  I'm saying a -- a
relationship in the broadest sense of word; business,
personal --
Page 68
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- both.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Both.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And do you know when
they met?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I -- no.  I don't
know when they met.  But you can time it.  Well, I
don't know that you can.  No.  I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So, but what was the nature
of their relationship, as far as you know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think they were
friends and I think that they were business partners.
Well, partners, too strong a word, but they were --
they did business together.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So did you -- again, I want
to stay focused on the time where you were the most
involved in his life, so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The '90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- the early '90s through
early 2000s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the beginning --
beginning of the 2000s, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did you -- so we
talked about four people, so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There's more.
Page 69
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- were there more?  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, yes.  There were
more.  There was a lady whose name I just can't --
can I get my book?  Maybe I wrote them down.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  (Indiscernible)
Epstein wouldn't really let me meet his clients.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What book are you using?
What is that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wrote some notes for
the meeting.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Great.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Is that alright?
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  That's fine.  I just
was curious what -- what we're looking at.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, okay.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Not the birthday book.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It's not the birthday
book.  No.  We are going to come to that, I'm sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All right.  I wrote
down some names because I tried to make -- I just
want you to understand my -- my memory's not as good
as it was, because when I was in Brooklyn, I was in
the SHU for almost two years, and I was on suicide

(Pages 70 to 73)
(Pages 70 to 73)
Page 70
watch for almost two years, which meant that they
woke me up every 15 minutes for the entire time.  And
it's -- it really did affect my ability to ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I'm not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you've taken some notes
in anticipation --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just made some names
in -- in advance for this --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  So go ahead.
So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and you're happy to
look at them as well, if you want.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  Go -- go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Oh, well, funny
you say, first two names.  One is Wexner, two is
Staley, three is Leon Black.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Glenn Dubin was a
client.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who's that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Eva Dubin's husband.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  What was their, I
Page 71
mean, if you can -- do you know when -- about when
that relationship started?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Whenever -- well,
wouldn't have been before they got married, for sure.
So if you're going to start -- you're going to date
that from wherever that was.
           And then Epstein was heavily involved with
Highbridge Capital and the financing or selling of
Highbridge to JP Morgan.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Go ahead.
Eva Dubin.  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  You're only
looking for clients, so, all right.  There's a
woman -- well he -- there's a woman in Ohio.  I just
can't think of her name, but it will -- I tried to
remember it yesterday and I can't.
           DAVID MARKUS:  So this is a good thing.
Like, you know, as you think of things, write it
down, and if they have any other names, they'll ask
you.  But you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Just --
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- don't -- don't force it
out.  So -- so you'll have time to think about this,
especially today, this afternoon, overnight --
Page 72
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- because we'll probably
meet tomorrow.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But you can find them.
I mean, if you basically find a billionaire female.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So the woman in Ohio who's
wealthy, that you worked with.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And well, you can
identify her yourself because she had the largest
Klein painting.  That was huge.  So you can find her,
because it'll be in a museum.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So that's her.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so he -- that was one
of Mr. Epstein's clients?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  She was one of
Mr. client -- Mr. Epstein's clients as well?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Who else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I think that
there was people, other people that he would, like,
assist.  I know that he helped Lynn Forester, who
became Lynn de Rothschild.  She'll deny it and she
has, but she -- she can't.
Page 73
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when you say "help,"
the same help in business or what help?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, so-- so -- I
have no idea what he did for her.  I know he helped
her financially.  Her husband was the controller of
New York.  So, but I don't -- again, I'm not inside
his business, but he would've -- his -- his -- this
notion that he black -- blackmailed men or we don't
really have to go there, that he wasn't a businessman
and that everything he did was a fraud or a funk or
what -- I don't believe that to be true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you -- so you say
you don't believe it to be true, but show me why you
think that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Just from -- I know you've
been talking about it, that he was very -- he was
very conscientious.  He was very good at math.  He
was -- took, paid a lot of attention to his clients,
but -- but yes.  You're right.  There's allegations
of -- of blackmail or also that -- that there was
some level of -- of fraud involved in what he did,
and you don't believe it.  Why do you -- why do you

(Pages 74 to 77)
(Pages 74 to 77)
Page 74
say that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I -- let me
rephrase that.  If there was fraud, I never saw it.
What I saw or what I felt when I -- his -- I ran that
office.  I mean, ran.  I didn't -- I was responsible
for the staff.  People worked.  There were lawyers,
there were accountants.  I never heard him -- I never
-- wit- -- I never felt anything, I don't know, icky.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Did -- did you ever see him
blackmail a --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- a client?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Did you ever see him
blackmail a -- an -- a friend or an acquaintance?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, so I think when folks
talk about block -- blackmail, and we can talk about
-- sorry about that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We can talk about that now.
There are a lot of allegations about him, which
we'll -- which we should talk about and we can do
that now.  And the fact that he abused young women.
Page 75
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Full stop.  Okay.  Which
means, the way that I'm defining abuse, as has been
widely reported, is that -- that he would cause young
women in high school to be recruited to come to his
house and give him massages.  And a part of -- and
the -- and the -- and as part of that, he would
sexually abuse them, okay?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I want to talk about
that.  But as it relates to blackmail, the question
is whether you're aware of any time, that any of the
individuals we're talking about, and we'll talk about
others, received massages from women who were under
or may have been under 18.
           And that whether there was any sexual
assaults or sexual contact between any of these
people and those masseuses, which would've allowed
then, Mr. Epstein, potentially, to blackmail them and
say, "You have to continue to work with me or you
have to give me money, or else I'm going to tell the
world that -- that -- that you did this."
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  I -- I think
this is a really good place to start with how this
story began.
Page 76
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So even, let's assume
that that premise is correct, that he was doing that
and he was going to tell everybody, going to say,
"oh, you know, you had inappropriate relations with
an underage girl."  If you don't have a video or
photograph, photographic evidence, because I -- I'm
not sure that even the FBI would take that.  Well,
maybe today, but certainly not back then, would take
that seriously.
           So you have to have something to say,
"Hey, you know, look, I've got this video of you
doing terrible things and you need to."  So I built
those houses, many of them.  I decorated those
houses.  I put the electricians in for the wiring.  I
never wired, nor saw, a single house that had any
type of inappropriate, let's say, video surveillance.
           And I'll define that for you.
Inappropriate surveillance would mean in a bathroom,
in a bedroom, in any private area of a home.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In a room where there were
massages given?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Inappropriate.  I
would say I would define "appropriate" surveillance
to be the front door of a house, or potentially, as
Page 77
in 71st Street, the physical plant.  Anywhere else
would be grotesque.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I just want to come back
to -- I know I'm just hopefully stating the obvious,
but when you say "the houses," you're talking about
his New York --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- brownstone?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You're talking about the
island in -- in the Caribbean?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You're talking about the
residence in Palm Beach?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you're talking about
the ranch in New Mexico?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Anywhere else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Paris.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And in Paris.  And so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the plane.  I saw
some ridiculous thing with the plane --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the plane.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- that was what we're

(Pages 78 to 81)
(Pages 78 to 81)
Page 78
doing.  Yes.  I didn't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I didn't hire any
electrician on the plane.  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so unequivocally,
unequivocally from what you know, and you only know
what you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I only know what I
know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- but from what you know,
you do not believe a camera exists, or a video camera
or a camera that takes pictures, inside any of his
residences?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So even the appropriate
cameras that you just talked about, which would be
kind of exterior security cameras, did you know
whether there was any cameras, that you're aware of,
inside any of the locations?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never, with one
exception.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  What's the
exception?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The exception is
Palm Beach.
Page 79
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the reason -- so
in Palm Beach, Epstein was having money stolen.  He
noticed money was being stolen from his briefcase,
call it his briefcase.  And he called in the
Palm Beach police and they, the Palm Beach police
installed cameras on where he kept his briefcase.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Where was that?  Do you
remember?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  At his desk in -- so
the house on the ground floor was -- he had a desk,
sort of in a corner.  There was that camera.  I think
there was another camera.  I think there were two or
maybe three cameras.  I believe only on the ground
floor, wherever he may have had -- maybe he had
another office in the cabana.  There may have been a
camera there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was this?  I'm not
looking for an exact date, but what time period are
you thinking about when you say this?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  2003.  I think I can
date it for you precisely, actually, 2003.  I'm
pretty firm on that date.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I can be firm
Page 80
because John Alessi, the butler was fired in the end
of 2002 and he was the thief.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So aside from law
enforcement installing a camera, to try to catch
somebody stealing money from Mr. Epstein, you're not
aware of any cameras at the island -- no.  Sorry.
You're -- just so we record it because ...
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry -- sorry --
sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  That's okay.  You were
nodding your head no.
           So what about --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No cameras anywhere,
outside of, possibly, things that would -- I would
consider -- myself, I would consider normal.  So the
garage gate, something like that, a front door.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Outside, like security
cameras?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Security cameras.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  I -- I --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And there were cameras
inside in the 71st Street that did the plant, the
physical plant, because it was a commercial building.
So you had the whole -- that's a real thing there.
It's a commercial building.
Page 81
           And there were -- there was one camera on
the -- on the front door, internal, from the internal
that did the front door, as I recall.  But I -- there
were no other cameras inside the house.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever -- how about
photographs.  Did you ever observe Mr. Epstein, or
anybody around him, take pictures of anybody in
compromising positions with women or with -- or with
anybody?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever hear, when you
were present for conversations that Mr. Epstein was
having, or others were having, anybody accuse him of
blackmailing them or of trying to extort them,
because of something Mr. Epstein knew?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  There have been -- and --
and you -- you -- in the discovery you got in the
New York case, okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And in the civil cases that
you've been part of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- associated with
Mr. Epstein, have you ever been given or ever been

(Pages 82 to 85)
(Pages 82 to 85)
Page 82
told that video exists, like what we're talking
about, or photos were taken that -- that were
compromising?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So in the -- in both
of those, I never received no pictures or anything
from the civil case.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But in the criminal
case, I received videos of Epstein talking to women
and stuff like that.  I did get those.  I also saw
binders, photographs of women and (indiscernible).  I
never saw any, well, I don't know -- I don't know how
old some of these women were.  There were definitely
some of the victims from Palm Beach, the photographs
of them in -- in -- without clothing.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And in that -- in those
photographs, were -- the victims that were
photographed, were there any of the people you've
talked about?  Like, were there men with the victims
or were they just photographs of the victims?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There was no men with
these pictures.  There was no client of his with
those pictures.  They would be standalone, for want
of a better word, like modeling shots.  If you
were -- if you -- if you were, I don't know.
Page 83
           DAVID MARKUS:  Pictures that Epstein had
with the girls, but not Epstein with the clients and
the girls.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- I understand you
said you got those in the discovery.  Did you know
those -- those pictures -- pictures like that
existed?
           So right now I'm talking about photographs
of victims or photographs of women that Mr. Epstein
had on his computer or wherever he had them.  Did you
know that those photos existed before you got them in
discovery?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Some of them,
absolutely, because they were in his house.  Some of
these pictures were on his, you know, credenza or
whatever.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Some pictures I've
simply never seen before.  I mean, there was -- I --
I had never seen some of them.  Some of them I had,
some of them I hadn't, I mean.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- so -- so you're
right, and I -- I accept that having video or
photographs of somebody famous or powerful in a
Page 84
compromising position, would be good blackmail.
           But -- so separate -- putting aside what
you've said about the fact that you don't know of any
existence of those, did you observe, over the years,
the folks we're talking about, or others which we can
talk about, getting massages from young women?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I -- I just -- I
think it's really helpful to understand a few things
that has been missed in this whole mishigas.
           DAVID MARKUS:  That's a technical term.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I'll look it up later.
           Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I thought about this
obviously a lot and I've given it --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- some -- so this is
the benefit of -- some benefit of what I saw and some
benefit of what I now think, so just for clarity's
sake.
           I think -- I just want to say for the
record, that I do believe that Epstein did a lot of,
not all, but some of what he's accused of.  And I'm
not here to defend him in any respect whatsoever.  I
don't want to, and I don't think he requires, nor
deserves any type of protection or -- from me in any
Page 85
way, to sugarcoat what he did or didn't do.  So
there's that.
           However, the man I met and the man he
became, I believe that there is a progression, and I
don't think that the man I met is the man that he
became.  I believe he became that man over a period
of time.
           Now we can discuss anything you want and
I'll tell you everything I know, but I think somebody
who has an interest, however you define that, in
underage people is obviously someone who is unwell.
But I don't think that you wake up one day and you
start doing what he's accused of.  I think this is
something that you develop or you progress to.  I --
I think, because --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Ghislaine, before -- before
you get into all that, let's answer the top line
question and then get into it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  The top line
question is?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Did you ever see any of
these people with underage women?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No -- no.  I -- so the
reason I'm saying that is not -- is not to avoid that
question, but it's because by the time, when you were

(Pages 86 to 89)
(Pages 86 to 89)
Page 86
talking in the '90s, I don't think he was there.
I -- there's that description.  I think that this,
what you were talking about is a later version.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  And --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that -- is that?
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  I understand that and
I do want to talk -- I'm not --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it's just I'm -- I
think you need to separate the periods of time --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- because it --
this -- one of the things that was definitely missing
in my trial, and definitely missing from the
narrative, is this notion, this, everything happened
and he was always but -- no.  I don't -- I don't
believe that to be true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I mean, that --
that's -- that's fine.  And I do want to talk about
that.  I'm not -- I'm not pushing that away.  I'm
just putting it aside for a moment.
           What Mr. Epstein did and -- and, frankly,
what -- what you did, or are accused of doing, is one
thing that I -- that we'll talk about, but what --
right now what I want to understand is -- is whether
one of the ways that Mr. Epstein befriended his
Page 87
clients or -- or took care of them, or some would say
blackmail them, was by encouraging them to have -- to
interact with -- with women, underage or not.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I think in the
'90s, he may have encouraged them, but these were
people who were in their 20s or 30s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- so.  Understand that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  May have -- so he
would have a masseuse, right?  And he did, male and
female, by the way, in the '90s, that's never been
discussed.  Both in yoga and everything, there were
men as well as women.
           And so if he would travel, and I can show
them to you, I highlighted them on the flight record,
so you could see that there really were men that were
also there.  He would say, would you like to do yoga
with Tito?  Or would you like a massage with this
one?  But they would be in their late 20s and
professional masseuses.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I think there's a
distinction.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I want to talk about
actual individuals here.  But -- and I understand the
distinction between somebody who's an adult and --
Page 88
and -- and someone who's underage.
           But even with somebody who's an adult, did
you know Mr. Epstein to encourage folks to do that,
whether it's a client or somebody else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So with a -- with a --
I certainly witnessed him.  So if you were staying
with him and you had a massage that -- he would often
travel with a masseuse.  He would say, hey, would you
like a massage?  And he did do that, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But would you or him or
anybody else follow up with the masseuse afterwards,
to find out if there was any inappropriate sexual
contact?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never did, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So meaning -- and then
coming back to the blackmail issue.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  There's nothing wrong with
getting a massage, Of course not.  Especially, you
know, especially if somebody's obviously an adult, a
masseuse.  There's -- I'm not quibbling with that.
           But my question is that there's a lot of
accusations that -- that one of the way Mr. Maxwell,
I'm sorry, Mr. Epstein was successful, was -- was
through this idea of blackmail.
Page 89
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And yes, young -- young
women and -- and is a crime.  Children are -- is a
crime.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But even women over the age
of 18, if -- if Mr. Epstein encouraged these men or
whomever to get massages and have inappropriate
sexual contact with the masseuses, that's -- that's a
separate issue.  Maybe -- maybe slightly nuanced, but
did you ever know him to do that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I never did
absolutely myself.  I never heard him ask someone.  I
never -- I never heard that.  I never -- no one -- in
the entire time I was with him or friends with him,
or had anyone, no one ever reported to me or came to
me and said that anything inappropriate happened or
was upset by -- I never saw a tear.  I never saw ever
any of that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when you say, "No one
reported to me," meaning like the masseuses --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or any of the house
staff --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.

(Pages 90 to 93)
(Pages 90 to 93)
Page 90
           DAVID MARKUS:  Or the clients.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or the clients
themselves?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- so let's --
again, I want to stay -- and -- and coming back now
to what you were talking about a moment ago with
Mr. Epstein's kind of progression or -- or -- or
getting worse.  So just staying within the '90s.
           What role -- what did -- what role did you
have or what did you observe -- which are two
different issues, but both important -- with respect
to recruiting masseuses to come to either, I guess,
Palm Beach or to travel, or eventually New Mexico.
What role did you have in that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He asked me to find
masseuses for him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He asked me if I could
find him masseuses.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Like, as part of --
like you said, you were his general manager.  As part
of all your -- your duties, that was one of them?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I did do that.  So
the first person I believe that I introduced him to
Page 91
as a masseuse was somebody called 
.  She
was, I don't know, mid, late 20s.  Professional
masseuse.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And was this something that
happened early on in your relationship or -- and
again, I know we're talking about the '90s, but are
we talking about early '90s or is this later on?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So in terms of
massage, I am a -- I have a lot of injuries.  I do a
lot of dangerous sports and have had multiple serious
accidents, and walk without any lameness, because of
physical therapy and massage.  I've -- that to me is
a very -- it's medicinal for me.
           So Epstein, whatever his massage
situation, whatever -- he loved massage.  And if I
met somebody who I thought was a good masseuse or
masseur, I introduced them.
           And he -- because I got them, and he asked
me if I did, and I said yes.  And that's -- I'm
pretty sure that would've -- well, I don't remember.
'93, '92, from the beginning.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- so go ahead.  So then
what happens over the next, you know, like there's
been -- there's a ton of writing and a ton of, I
guess, testimony as well, but also public reporting,
Page 92
about how the recruiting was a very aggressive effort
that you were a part of, that he was a part of, and
others, to try to find more and more masseuses.
           What -- is that -- is that true, and what
role did you have in that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That was partially
true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it is true that I
found masseuses and he became more insistent.  He --
he -- he liked new all the time.  He got bored.  So
he would be bored with a masseuse and he would say,
find me a new masseuse.
           I am the entire opposite.  If I find
someone that I like, I stay with them.  I'm like, I
don't want new.  He would drive for new.  So that is
true.
           And in my effort to find them, I would go
to massage spas, like legitimate spas.  Not -- we're
not talking, you know, funky ones that people have.
           So -- and I -- if I got a massage from
somebody in a spa, that was -- I liked -- I liked, I
asked them if they would do home visits.  If they
said yes, I would ask them to come to the house and
he would see if he liked them or not.  But these were
Page 93
people who worked in spas.  I never, ever checked
their age and I never checked their credentials.  I
never asked for a certificate.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What --
           DAVID MARKUS:  But just to be clear, you
never thought anybody was under 18?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never crossed -- I
never -- no.  That was never my -- that was never a
drive.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- what did you know
at the time about him, Mr. Epstein, requiring
masseuses to be naked or requiring masseuses to
either perform sexual favors for Mr. Epstein or to be
there if Mr. Epstein masturbated or things like that.
           And again, I'm asking you about a 15-year
period or whatever, 10-year period.  So I appreciate,
it's a very broad question.  So answer it in a way
that, you know, addresses what you've been charged
with doing, but also what's been said about you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So I don't --
the '90s, I don't think that I ever thought -- that
never would cross my mind.  I'm not sure that I
thought about that in those contexts at all, until
his arrest and those papers came out.  But I believe
the -- the subject of the -- the question that you're
DOJ REDACTION


(Pages 98 to 101)
(Pages 98 to 101)
Page 98
they don't take off their clothes.  Basically
suggested they had to watch him masturbate.  Like the
things that have been publicly said about what he
did.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  For now I'm not -- I'm not
distinguishing adults or -- or -- or young or
underage women for that.  I'm saying abuse.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm -- I'm going to
think that that would've been a habit.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm going to say that
the massage game was a habit.  And I think --
           DAVID MARKUS:  What does that mean?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That means that I'm
sure that he didn't suddenly start having relations
with masseuses in 2002.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I am sure he must have
had relations with masseuses, who knows when.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you're saying, as far
as you -- I -- I used the word abuse.  You're saying
that as far as you sit here today, you would describe
that more as consensual?  Meaning the masseuse did
those -- did this willingly?
Page 99
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I saw him with
lots of masseuses.  I never saw a single masseuse
ever look unhappy or not come back or whatever.  So
based on my observation, I don't think that if you
are being raped, as now he's like this prolific -- I
just -- I just can't imagine why you would return.
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's not what you
observed at the time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not what I observed at
the time, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I want to -- we're -- we're
going to spend a little -- we're going to spend more
time on this issue, because I -- I think it's
important.  But just going back to kind of the -- the
question that I started with in this area, which is
that it ties into the blackmail issue.
           So we talked about people that were his
clients, and you've mentioned President Clinton, and
then early on --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, I never said he
was a client.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I -- I did not say you
said.  I'm saying when you talk about his clients.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, okay.  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  And puts his clients
Page 100
off the side.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then you mentioned some
other people.  You mentioned President Clinton --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- you mentioned President
Trump early on.
           Who were other famous/politicians, who
were other individuals in Mr. Epstein's life during
that time period?  So the early '90s --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was the '90s.
Let's -- should we just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Congressman
McMillen.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  McMillen.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Henry Rosovsky, who
was the provost of Harvard.  Hang on (Indiscernible).
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.  You're looking at
your -- your -- your notes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Joe Pagano, Jerry
Page 101
Goldsmith, Joe Roberts, Kenny Lipper, Dan Abramson.
           I don't know if in the '90s Tom Pritzker,
Ace, Jimmy Cayne, Lou Ranieri.  I mean, there were --
           TODD BLANCHE:  What about the royal
family?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  He didn't know
them in the '90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What about the -- the --
what about Prince Andrew?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Didn't know him in the
'90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When did --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, well -- is that
right?
           TODD BLANCHE:  I wouldn't know.  I do not
know.  So I don't want you to have -- to worry about
exact dates.  You're -- you're not positive about
that.  But you don't have a specific recollection of
that being in the '90s?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I can -- I can
date it for you, I think, but I can't give you --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's okay.  I think
that's fine.

(Pages 102 to 105)
(Pages 102 to 105)
Page 102
           So with respect to just -- and we'll --
we'll take a break in a minute to get some food.  But
just with respect to Mr. -- with respect to the
individuals you just talked about.  So again, focus
on the '90s.
           And so the people that I'm talking about
right now, and we might add some names later.  So
we're talking about the -- the clients that he worked
with, which you've mentioned several of.  And I know
that that wasn't exhaustive, but you mentioned
several of them.
           And then the -- the kind of what -- what I
called famous friends, but the -- the prominent
individuals that were in his life in the '90s.
Did -- did -- does any stick out in your mind as
having received massages?  All of them.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Henry Rosovsky
received a massage.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And why do you -- why does
that stick out in your memory?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because I saw him in a
bathrobe at 71st Street, and he had received a
massage, he told me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether
that -- whether there was any -- whether the masseuse
Page 103
was naked during that massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wouldn't have any
idea.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether he --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I doubt it.  He was
like in his 80s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I doubt it.  He was
like in his 80s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- but do you
know -- notwithstanding his age --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Minsky, sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say that again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Minsky was another
person.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether, for
example, President Clinton ever received a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't believe he
did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what makes you say you
don't believe he did?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, because I
don't -- so that's a good question.  The time that
Epstein and President Clinton spent together, the
only times I believe -- well, obviously they
Page 104
traveled.  There was that, you know, the plane, they
went on the plane 26 times or whatever.  That would
be one journey.
           So they spent time on the plane together,
and I don't believe there was ever a massage on the
plane.  So that would've been the only time that I
think that President Clinton could have even received
a massage.  And he didn't, because I was there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you mentioned that
early -- in the very beginning of the conversation,
you mentioned President Trump in the early '90s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- what's -- what did
you observe, as far as President Trump, and his
relationship with you or Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I just want to
say for my relationship with President Trump --
relationship's a big word -- but I just want to say
that I met him or I believe I may have, because of my
father in the '90s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yep.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So my father liked him
very much, and he was loved -- really liked his wife
as well, because we were both Czechoslovakian.
           And as far as I'm concerned, President
Page 105
Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me.
And I just want to say that I find -- I -- I admire
his extraordinary achievement in becoming the
President now.  And I like him, and I've always liked
him.  So that is the sum and substance of my entire
relationship with him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What about Mr. Epstein's
relationship with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know how they
met, and I don't know how they became friends.  I
certainly saw them together and I remember the few
times I observed them together, but they were
friendly.  I mean, they seemed friendly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was that in social settings
or was that in private settings?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe I only ever
saw them in social settings.  I don't recall any
private settings.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever -- have you
ever been to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In what time period are you
thinking about when you say yes?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't remember when
the President purchased Mar-a-Lago.  So from whenever

(Pages 106 to 109)
(Pages 106 to 109)
Page 106
it turned into the club, I went there and I was --
loved going there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- did you go there
alone or with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Mostly alone.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know where --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the times I went
there it was for an event, maybe once or twice.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether
Mr. Epstein ever went there?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I believe he did,
but again, we really were -- he -- he didn't take me
with him all the time.  So he would go and -- oh,
right.  He never -- I never -- well, he did from time
to time, but he would go alone.  I think he would
maybe go himself to the spa.  I certainly did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe
President Trump receive a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe -- you
said that you -- you were -- I mean, have you seen
the -- there's photographs, public photographs of
Mr. Epstein and President Trump together.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And there's photographs
Page 107
of -- I think you're -- you're in some of the
photographs --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- as well.  Those all
appear to be social settings.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's -- that's my
memory.  They were social settings.  I don't know
Epstein's -- if he had -- whatever the nature of the
President's friendship, if you will, or however you
want to define that with Epstein, I was -- never
witnessed.
           I think they were friendly like people are
in social settings.  I don't -- I don't think they
were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the
President in any of -- I don't recall ever seeing him
in his house, for instance.
           I actually never saw the President in any
type of massage setting.  I never witnessed the
President in any inappropriate setting in any way.
The President was never inappropriate with anybody.
In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman
in all respects.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When's the last time you
Page 108
think you saw, in person, President Trump?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Um, it was -- it's --
it's been a long time.  Probably not -- sometime in
the -- beginning -- mid -- mid 2000s maybe.  And it
would only have been a social setting, as far as I
recall.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did you ever hear
Mr. Epstein or anybody say that President Trump had
done anything inappropriate with masseuses or with
anybody in your world?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely never, in
any context.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
masseuses from Mar-a-Lago's spa ended up giving
massages to -- private massages to Mr. Epstein?  I'm
not asking for what you may have read, but from -- at
the time, from your personal knowledge, do you know
whether that's true?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I don't -- I
don't recall.  Is it possible?  Yes.  But I don't
remember -- I don't remember that.  So I don't want
to -- I don't recall that, but it's possible.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you have a recollection
of you ever recruiting a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago spa
to give -- to go give a private massage to
Page 109
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I've never recruited a
masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I
remember.  I can't ever recollect doing that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So what -- what I
think we should do now, it's about 12:15.  We'll take
a -- we'll take a break and we will come back in a
little bit.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           (Break at 12:15 p.m. to 12:59 p.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  Good afternoon.  We are
continuing the recorded proffer interview of
Ms. Maxwell.  The time is 12:59, Thursday, July 24th.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So just to continue
what we're talking about, Ms. Maxwell, still focused
on the '90s time period with -- understanding that
could spill over in the early 2000s.  But still that
part of your -- of your life with Mr. Epstein.
           There's been public reporting about
conduct by Mr. Epstein and others at Little Saint
James.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So can you talk about the
frequency with which you went there, and address some

(Pages 110 to 113)
(Pages 110 to 113)
Page 110
of those -- some of the reporting, namely around
young masseuses or young women who would be present
and what you observed --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- relating to them, and
then I'll ask questions around that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So if I'm right, he
purchased the island in 1996 and he was friendly with
the owners.  And originally, we went to the island as
guests of the owners.  And then I guess at some point
the owners told him -- he -- they wanted to sell and
he decided to purchase it.
           So the island was very rustic.  I loved
it.  He, of course, had completely different ideas.
And I would say there was none of what you were
describing at that early period of time.
           So the frequency was -- was often.  We're
often on the island, because he loved it.  He really,
really loved it.  And we would, -- we would go all
the time.  Mostly all the early phase was based on
improvements that could be made on the island.
           Always going with new architects, new
designers, new construction people.  I'd say the
first two years, almost every trip, not every one,
but almost every trip contained some -- an individual
Page 111
who would be brought on board to have an opinion as
to how to -- I don't want to use the word "improve
the island," because I don't think you could improve
it, but to -- I can't think what the word would be.
To -- what's the word I'm looking for?  To develop
it.  Sorry.  That's the word.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Develop -- develop the
island.  That's the word I'm looking for.
           So -- so there were trips, constant trips
with that in mind.  And I would say now if we are
moving to the late '90s, '96, '97 I definitely
witnessed a progression in Mr. Epstein's behavior,
and a modification, if you will.
           Where in the past, in the early '90s, I
don't remember traveling so much with other people.
There would be a masseuse or a yoga person, but now
he started to travel with more, always a masseuse.
Whereas in the past it wasn't always a masseuse or
always an instructor.  There was now starting to be
always an individual or a friend or whatever.
           There's always a, like, maybe the word
would be entourage, but these were always people in
their 20s, late 20s, early 30s in my -- as my memory
sees it, as I -- as I observe that time.
Page 112
           And he tasked me with finding a local
masseuse for him in St. Thomas, because sometimes,
even though I say he would always travel with an
entourage, sometimes he didn't, and he wanted to have
a massage locally.
           So I visited the mass- -- the spas that
were local in St. Thomas and in St. John.  And if I
met someone, a man or a woman, actually, because it
was difficult to find somebody in St. Thomas, it's
not exactly, you know.  So, and I did find a couple
of people who would come.
           So that's how they came, because also it
was a schlep.  So if you had somebody who came, it
would be -- you would have to, you know, boat ride
and you -- several hours.  It wasn't just a -- it's
not like arriving with your massage table and stuff.
So there was that.  So I did do that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So did, over the years,
males also give massages to Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  I did say, I
don't think -- at the beginning, definitely.  And I
would say towards sort of, again, late '90s, I don't
remember any men.  They were at the beginning, I
think in that -- towards the late '90s, I cannot
think of any men.  I only think of women.
Page 113
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- well, you talk
about entourage flying, right now we're talking about
to the island.  Did you observe any sexual, I was
going to say misconduct, but any sexual -- any sex at
all whatsoever on the plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never on the plane,
no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was there a part of the
plane that was closed off from others where
Mr. Epstein could go and get a massage or whatever?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  Okay.  So
that's a good question.  So there were two planes.
So you had the -- there was a Gulfstream, and that's
open plan.  So anything -- I mean, there was a sofa
that turned into a bed.  And he did sleep on that.
           And then -- but in the Boeing, which he
flew on a lot, there was -- his area could be closed
off with a door.  And behind that door there would
be -- there was a bedroom and an office.  So if that
door was shut, you wouldn't see it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But do you -- so if you
never -- so -- but you never observed Mr. Epstein
engaging in sex or getting a massage with somebody --
with whether the masseuse was not clothed on the
plane?

(Pages 114 to 117)
(Pages 114 to 117)
Page 114
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can't say that.  I
might have --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I definitely might,
either both in the Gulfstream or in the --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- in the -- I'm sure
I did, but it's not -- I can't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's fair.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I'm absolutely
sure I did.  I must have, because, you know, he was
so obsessed of someone rubbing his feet or -- just --
when you ask me about massages, I want to be clear.
           I generally -- what I think of that is
somebody on a massage table, but other people might
think of it as something different.  You know, you
could have someone rubbing his feet or his shoulder.
I saw that all the time.  That I did.  But sep- --
that's separate from being on a massage table.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How -- again, I know we're
talking about a decade-long period, but during the
period we're talking about, in a seven-day week, how
often would Mr. Epstein get a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  In the '90s, when
we're talking, he would get one every day.  I think,
Page 115
as that time progressed, he would get one, maybe
twice a day.  I do want to say that there was maybe a
reason that things altered or morphed or progressed,
and it is maybe part of the reason, also, that I --
he and I, our relationship or have a, somebody wants
to call it altered.
           And he started doing testosterone and that
altered his character.  And I believe that started in
the late '90s.  And I believe that the FBI has his
medical records and you may see that on his medical
records.  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you believe that he
started taking testosterone in the '90s, and when you
say that altered his behavior, you're saying it
wanted to -- made him get more massages or that was
just one part of what changed about him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, he became more
aggressive.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I see.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I think that he
maybe -- well, now I'm just imagining that the
testosterone altered his desires or something, does
that --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so when, given what
you've said the past couple hours about his kind of
Page 116
progression or change, let's focus on that time
period, so the more towards the late '90s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The testosterone.
Yeah, okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So '96, '97, '98, you know,
toward --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- when you've said that he
changed.  Did you know flat out that he was having
sex or otherwise some sort of sexual conduct with
masseuses regularly?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Flat out?  No, I
denied that.  I couldn't imagine that he would but I
think looking back now, that -- I did not.  But I
started to suspect that he was not faithful.  Seems
ludicrous but that's what I thought.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But if -- look, if -- if
he's flying from Palm Beach to -- to St. Thomas or if
he's flying all over the country to New Mexico or to
New York, or even in Palm Beach and there's young
women, putting aside whether they're under the age of
or in their 20s, every day at the house, multiple
masseuses -- multiple massages on some days, you're
interacting with the masseuses constantly.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Huh?
Page 117
           TODD BLANCHE:  Or maybe that's not right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's not right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let me take back what I
just said.  Ignore that part.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you understand that he
is getting massages every day, sometimes multiple
times a day.  The -- by the late '90s, it's all
women, presumably they're -- some of them are new,
but they're also repeat masseuses.
           What did you -- I mean, you had to know at
that point that there was something going on beyond
just, he really needed to get massaged.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So -- very fair
question.  There's two things.  The first is the
person that he saw the most at that period of time
was in her 40s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And she was with him
all the time.  And I'm, like, married as well --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And as -- I'm square.
And it never occurred -- well, I don't believe it
occurred to me at the time that with this woman, he
would be having relations.  And he was with her --

(Pages 118 to 121)
(Pages 118 to 121)
Page 118
that was the person he had the most massages, yoga,
and that -- with -- at that time in the '90s period.
           The second thing is that -- is he told me
he didn't -- he had difficulty having an erection,
and I believed him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you said he said that,
you mean he regularly told you that?  Like he --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  When I first --
because when I didn't have sex with him after the
first time, and it took -- so I asked him, was it me?
And he told me it was him.
           And I had never, up until this moment in
my life, I -- as if I'm not stupid.  I'm very bright.
I've had an excellent education.  I traveled all over
the world.  I had had boyfriends, but I had never met
or understood that somebody could be so -- would lie
to me about -- I could -- it never occurred to me.
           I didn't have a frame of context within my
life experience where somebody would be so
manipulative and devious with me.  I just -- and
plus, I just didn't have -- I just -- and I was happy
not to have sex, because I have a condition that
doesn't lend itself to that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Does -- when you learned --
so fast forward just for a moment to the 2007, '08,
Page 119
'09 time period and he's arrested and charged and
there's all kinds of press around his purported
contact, at that point -- at that point, did you
accept that that was true?  Meaning, did it make
sense at that point?
           When you were reading about women who
claimed that they had been abused, even underage
and -- at that point, did you think to yourself,
well, geez, that makes sense now that I think about
it or no?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  First of all, I
didn't -- that's -- I only read what was in the
newspapers.  I didn't have any other thing.  And I'm
embarrassed to say it, I didn't -- I didn't believe
it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Right.  I mean, you
didn't believe that the accusations were true at the
time.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  So let's --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And sorry, I need to
say, even if they were true, I believe that he was
duped and he didn't know that they were -- whatever
that was in the papers at that time, whether they
said that they were 17 or, I didn't -- it didn't
Page 120
register, because --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- along with all of
those -- well, not in 2006, but later when the more
salacious and other allegations came out, I knew were
utterly false, which then just reinforced my belief
that the rest was not true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let me ask you a question
about the age of the masseuses over the years.  It --
I think in my mind, there's a difference between you
knowing or not knowing that a masseuse is under the
age of 18 and coming to give a massage, and you
knowing that Mr. Epstein, you know, sexually abused
the underage person or made her strip or something
like that, meaning -- and I want to understand
whether you believe that nobody that came to give
massages, none of the women were under 18 or that you
didn't focus on their age, but you -- you were more
focused on whether any underage woman was abused by
him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it's better to
answer this question with corroborating evidence and
then go back and explain, so that I frame --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- your understanding
Page 121
of what I'm saying.  Of the -- my understanding is
that in 2000 and, let's say 2008, they had
interviewed 44 women, let's say, or around that
number.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  You have to
understand, not a single one of those 44 women
mentioned me in a single report.  And it's not
because -- go back.
           They didn't mention me in their report
because they never met me, they never saw me, and
they never interacted with me.  So to go back to your
question, it's not that I thought one way or another,
it's that I didn't see them.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  I see.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, no, that's helpful.
So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not -- and but
when I say not one, not single one of those reports
talked about me.  And I just want to clarify exactly,
because I'm obviously aware that one of those girls
is -- was one of the witnesses in my trial,
specifically 
           To use her own testimony so that you don't
DOJ REDACTION

(Pages 122 to 125)
(Pages 122 to 125)
Page 122
have to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- hear my point of
view.  It's better if it comes from her own words and
that way there's no second-guessing whether -- what
I'm saying.
 herself said that 
recruited her, 
 brought her and 
trained her.  Those are 
 own words.
           Where was I going with this?
           TODD BLANCHE:  That you were -- that you
didn't know.  I mean, I assume you were saying that
you weren't --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh yeah, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  That's okay --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm trying to remember
where I was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- that's all right.  It's
okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I really do have some
slow cognition issues.
           The --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So she says -- she
testifies that it was 
 that recruited her
Page 123
and trained her and not you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So wait.  So then in
her first FBI meeting, she reports seeing a woman
with short dark hair at the house, which then is used
as evidence that that person was myself.
           But the maid, lady that who helped keep
the house, John Alessi's wife -- oh, and with an
accent, I believe she said.
           John Alessi's wife had short, dark hair
and an accent.  I'm sorry, but I find -- and you can
ask yourselves this, I mean, I've obviously modified
my accent.  I've been in America a long time, but I'm
British.  I've been brought up with a very strong
British accent.
           And I don't believe there's an American on
planet Earth that doesn't recognize this to be
British or Australian, maybe, if you really don't
know.  But it's not some random accent.
           Now the Hispanic, maybe.  Okay.  That was
John's wife that she saw, not me.  And I'd like to
point out further how you -- potentially her own --
through her own words.  She identify --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Why don't we -- why don't
we --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
Page 124
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- stop there and let him
ask the next question.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You're good.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So it's -- so just -- and
look, I want to -- I want to try to -- I think
probably tomorrow we will -- I want to talk more
about kind of the evidence against you and how to
address that.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, don't apologize.
That's -- so that's helpful but --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I don't want you to be
burdened.  I want you to just tell the truth the best
you can, so I don't want you to be burdened by what
people said at trial or what you know the press says
about you, so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just thought it was
illustrative when you asked the question --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And it was.  It was.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- because it
doesn't -- I did not -- I absolutely have no memory
at any -- now I'm leaving 
 separate
Page 125
to this obviously --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- so that's a
separate story.  I'm not going to pretend -- well,
we'll come to her.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We'll get to her.  Go
ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, she -- but in the
terms of the scheme or whatever, however you want to
determine what you're calling that, I have no -- no
memory, no active anything of having seen anybody
that resembles a young -- a child, let's call it what
it is, at that house giving him a massage at all.
           It's not even like I did this.  It's an at
all.  And 44 people didn't see me or talk about me
either, including 
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- and when you say
"that house," I --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry.
Palm Beach.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, no, I understand what
you mean but, and I -- does the same memory or lack
thereof, apply to on planes, at -- in New Mexico, in
New York, in --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, with some other

important caveats.  Well, on that -- but Julian --
Jane, in my trial, was clearly underage, clearly a
child.  And I only saw her in Palm Beach and I only
saw her with her mother.
           The other person who's clearly also not an
adult or even close, 
, I believe, I
remember her now.  That would be the only two or
three, whatever that is.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So did you ever know
Mr. Epstein to communicate with FBI agents, either
like intelligence FBI agents, like as a source or
just generally with FBI agents?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you think if he had done
that, you would've known, like he would've told you
something like that?  Like if I said to you,
Mr. Epstein was a source for the FBI, would you say,
that's crazy, no, he wasn't or maybe he was, I
would -- he wouldn't have told me that anyway.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have two answers for
that.  I think if he was for real, I think he
would've bragged about it to me as a show off,
because he could be a show off.  And if he wasn't, he
might have dropped it like he was cool.  And I don't
think -- I don't remember him doing either.
Page 127
           Now, with, again, the caveat that in
his -- before I met him finding money, I think he may
have suggested that there was some people who helped
him, but that's the only context that I recall that
in.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do you mean by that?
When you said "finding money," what do you mean?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, his business
where he -- remember I told you --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I think in that
context, he made -- he showed me a photograph that he
had with some African warlords or something that he
told me.  And, you know, I get -- I don't remember if
I -- that's what I interpreted the -- like that kind
of thing or whether it was something like that.
           That's the only actual active memory I
have of something nefarious -- not nefarious.  I
don't even know if it was nefarious, but covert, I
suppose would be the word.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what about any other
intelligence agency, like the CIA or Defense
Intelligence or any other law enforcement agency?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I don't think
so.  I think that -- I don't remember anything like
Page 128
that.  I just don't think he had the wherewithal and
I think that whole aspect of that is -- can I use a
bad word?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Bullshit.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And what do you --
you think it's bullshit, meaning?  What do you mean?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Would you have known if he
was -- would he have been bragging to you?  Would he
have been saying these things.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think he was because
I -- I think, well, sorry.  I think that -- I think
one of the reasons why he liked me was because of my,
you know, my family connections and why he liked
other people was because they were cool or whatever.
           And I think that, certainly, early in when
I met him, he would've tried to impress me or tried
to show off, if you will.  Like he was that guy, you
know, and he wasn't that guy.  And so -- and I think
that he would've tried to bullshit me and he didn't,
so I think it's --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, he may have
tried to bullshit me, but no, I couldn't.
Page 129
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I want to just shift for
a few minutes to talk about post-2000.  2000 to kind
of when your relationship changed over the years with
him.
           Did there come a time when he,
Mr. Epstein, did meet members of the Royal Family?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I need to go back,
because I think I may have misspoke --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I didn't misspeak
but I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- it's something that
I have forgotten.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Of course.  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Before I met Epstein,
he lived in London for a period of time, I don't know
for how long.  And he met and knew some truly fancy
people, like people -- high society people, that
included Princess Diana's best friend.  Her name was
Rosa Monckton.  And Rosa's husband, Dominic Lawson,
DOJ REDACTION

(Pages 130 to 133)
(Pages 130 to 133)
Page 130
who's a famous journalist, actually is a very well
known journalist.
           And when I -- and he had -- he was friends
with the Barings, Barings Bank and he had like, sort
of --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That was, you're talking
about --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Before he met me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Before, so in the --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  '80s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- '80s.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  He was dating
Eva Andersson, Miss Sweden, I think.  I don't know
when she became Miss Sweden.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So earlier when you
said that he met them later --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- you think he may have
met some members of the Royal Family or certainly
British high society.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He met -- I don't know
about the Royal Family, but certainly high society.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And the reason why I
know this is because, sometime we can -- this is a
Page 131
documentable thing.  Docu -- whatever.  There's a
photograph that can give you the date, because I
don't remember what the date is of this, so there's
something that will peg whatever this date is.  I
don't remember when that is.
           Epstein went to London without me.  He
often went everywhere without me, but he was in
London without me, which was decently unusual because
London's my hometown.
           But anyway, he went without me.  And he
went to a big event in, I think it was in the --
anyway, it was a big event.  It's on -- it's on --
it's on -- it's on the news.  It's like a -- there's
photographs of it.  And he, I don't know if he sat
with Diana or he met Diana and he'd already met her.
I don't know, but this, I believe was organized by
Rosa.
           And so there's -- I don't know if she was
being set up as a date for him, maybe because she --
I don't want to speak bad of Diana, but -- I'm not
going to do that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So that was
pre-meeting you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, that was -- that
event happened when we were --
Page 132
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh, okay.  That was
(Inaudible).
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and I would --
sometime --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understood.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  - - no, it's when we
were --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I'm not going to
say together, but when -- how about this?  When I was
his employee, that's a bit better.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So now moving back
to the 2000s, did there come a time when Mr. Epstein
met Prince Andrew?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And others in the
Royal Family or just Prince Andrew as, far as you
know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, so as -- as much
as I can piece it together, all right, first of all
let's just state, I did not introduce him to
Prince Andrew.  I did not introduce him to Prince
Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson.  That is a flat untruth.
I'll start with that.
           So now I'm going to tell you how he did
Page 133
actually meet him.  So I -- if you find me that
photograph, I can date that time when he met
Princess Diana at that event.  I -- and based on
that, I'll be able to tell you if it's pre or post
that event, because I haven't looked it up and I've
never bothered to check.
           So Lynn Forester, who was a client or some
type of client, or I think she actually tried to date
him or might have dated him, for the record.  She was
in -- do you want to ask me something?
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  She was -- she
had a house or she rented a house in the Vineyard.  I
think it was in the Vineyard or Nantucket, I can't
remember now which one it was.  It was one of those.
It was either in Nantucket or the Vineyard, and
invited Epstein to go, and I believe that's when he
met Prince Andrew.
           However, I believe that before that event,
he had gone to the Bahamas and had hung out with
Sarah Ferguson.  And Sarah had called Epstein and had
arranged with Lynn, or I don't know.  I don't know.
Now I'm speculating.  Anyway, long and short, he met
Andrew up there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I'm not holding you to

(Pages 134 to 137)
(Pages 134 to 137)
Page 134
an exact date, but when, approximately, was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, we can date it
from that picture, if you find me the picture.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But do you know, I --
without looking at a photo, in your mind,
approximately, when was that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say it was
the 2000 -- no, probably 2001, 2002.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Early 2000s?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I think it was actually
Prince Andrew himself who suggested that he met
Jeffrey Epstein through you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think that's true.
So -- well --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  It's true that Andrew said
that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, no, I'm sure
it's true, because I -- I'm English and my close
friends are all close friends with Sarah and Andrew.
And I would not say that I was close friends with
Andrew before, but certainly we were friendly and
certainly his best friends, some of them, are very
close with me.
           And I think that my friendship, my -- me
Page 135
being present or me is what made Andrew like Jeffrey
more, like, trust him or I think that's the idea.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you don't dispute that
you're -- that you kind of had a role in them getting
together.  You're just saying you didn't say, Prince,
here's Jeffrey.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would never have
introduced them.  It would never have occurred to me
to introduce them.  I couldn't imagine them being
friends.  Two chalk and cheeses would never -- I
mean, for real, there's nothing there to connect
them.
           So he met Prince Andrew and then he had a
really good relationship.  I don't like that word.
It sounds clunky.  They had a friend --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Acquaintanceship.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.  And --
through Sarah, actually.  I think Sarah is the one
that pushed that.  And they met and hung out, I want
to say two or three times that had nothing to do with
me.  I wasn't communicating with Andrew, I wasn't in
touch with him.
           And I know this because I was annoyed and
I felt left out, and I felt disrespected and I was
like, this is weird.  I couldn't even imagine Epstein
Page 136
and Andrew together.  And I thought that Sarah was
trying to put the moves on Jeffrey, if I'm being
honest, and I thought the whole thing was annoying
and I was pissed off.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So what happened with their
relationship?  Putting aside the publicity around
Prince Andrew's purported relationship with
 what happened, as far as you know, with
Prince Andrew and Mr. Epstein's relationship, from
the times you just described or you give me --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So after that,
at some point Jeffrey told me -- Epstein told me that
Andrew was coming to New York and I needed to
organize the whole thing.  That's classic by the way,
classic Epstein.
           Of course, if someone -- I'm like, all
right, fine, whatever.  And because he wanted to make
sure that Andrew was taken care of and that he was
comfortable, he had whatever he needed, yada, yada,
yada.
           And I'm like, well, am I going to meet him
or are you just going to have me do all the job?  And
he said, well, you know, you can come and say hello.
Like, wow.  Well, that's so nice of you, for real.
           Because you have to understand, like, I
Page 137
don't know if I told you this before, but I did not
have the keys to his -- I was not allowed to go to
his house, unless I was summoned or told.  I was not
allowed to answer his phones.  We can go there, but
anyway.  So this -- you can tell there's a bit of a
sore point, perhaps.
           Anyway, so Andrew came, and of course the
minute we got together I was like, yay.  Hi.  And
then it was so nice, because the difference of being
in England with Prince Andrew versus being in
New York without all the bullshit was insane.
           And our friendship just like lit up like
this, because first of all, he knew that I'm safe.  I
mean safe as in I'm not, yeah, you know, Nigel
Dempster or taking a picture.
           I mean, not in a million years would I do
something so gross.  And we honestly got on like a
house on fire.  I really liked him a lot and he's --
it was so nice and we just became really, really good
friends, much more so than when we were in London, if
I'm honest.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then with respect to
 and Prince Andrew, what do you know about
that relationship?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Would you like to ask
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDACTION

(Pages 138 to 141)
(Pages 138 to 141)
Page 138
that again?  Relationship is a big word.  Like I
said, I don't like the word.  Let's just start there.
Okay.
           So I have read -- I just want to like
piece together.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, but don't say --
before you say what you read, because that's one of
the problems is that we're all kind of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All right.  What, I
know --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- we're all formed by like
all the publicity and information around what
everybody else has said, but like, what do you --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- what do you think or
what did you see?  What did you hear?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What's an even bigger
word than bullshit?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Why?  Well, go ahead
just -- but finish that thought.  Why do you think
that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm going to tell you
right now.  I'm so happy to tell you.  I'm like
excited.  I'm beyond excited.
           Okay.  So there's been a mixture of what
Page 139
I've actually seen and know from the evidence and
versus what I've put together.  Impossible for me at
this point to separate everything, but I'll tell you
what I know versus what I saw and what I physically
have in here, but it's helpful for you to know.
           So the allegation, I have to go with the
allegation.  The allegation was that at my house in
London, in March, whatever that was, 2001 I believe,
we went to London, especially so that 
 could
have a -- or 
could have a relationship with
Prince Andrew and she was paid a vast amount of money
for that purpose.
           Okay.  And that she then got in the -- in
my bathroom in my house in London and had sex, sexual
relations with him and then went into my guest room
and had full blown sex and then left my house, or he
left, and she felt used and disgusting.
           And a photograph was taken of them just
before all these events took place in my study.  That
is what is the story.
           Oh, and then after that she met him
several other times.  But we'll come to that.  We'll
come -- this is where it will -- allegedly started.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  And they went to Tramp.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, right.  We went to
Page 140
nightclub that night.  Oh, we went to dinner, right?
We went to dinner and then to Tramp.  Okay.  So the
first thing about that weekend, that specific
weekend, was it's my mum's 80th birthday and I was in
the country.
           And I have some corroborating evidence for
that and a lot of testimonial that you can check.  So
that takes care of the reason why I -- one of the
reasons why her story doesn't hold water.
           The second reason why -- so -- by the way,
when I say that, my mum turned 80th, that actual
weekend was, her birthday is on March the 11th.  And
the reason why I went to London, and I presume, but
I -- this I don't remember, is why when we were -- so
the whole trip started because of Alberto Pinto, who
is the decorator for the island and for -- and for
New York as well.
           And he had wanted Epstein to go to see a
house in Marrakesh, if I remember rightly, and went
via the Alhambra, it was also for New Mexico.  So
there's architectural pieces that -- paint.  And that
was the basis of that trip.
           And I suspect now, that that trip was
planned all around the fact that I had to be in --
wanted to be in -- was going to be in London no
Page 141
matter what for my mum's 80th birthday at my
brother's house in the country, which is
approximately an hour outside of London, an hour and
a half --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  An hour and a half.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- an hour and a half
outside of London, in my brother's home.  And we all
congregated on the Saturday for her birthday
celebration on the Sunday, and then we left.  So
that's that.
           The second reason why -- probably maybe
even the more important reason than my mum's
birthday, that I think it's absolute rubbish, is that
Prince Andrew.  The idea of him doing anything of
that nature in my house, that's the size of this
room, is so mind-blowingly not conceivable to me, as
the man or what -- I just can't -- I can't even --
I -- no.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Is there any way that it
could have happened?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Describe the physical plan.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, the physical -- so
the -- my house was tiny.  I think it's 900 square

Page 142
feet in total.  Well, maybe that; is that right?
Maybe nine --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It is on three floors,
however.  So you're talking about a little -- it's a
jewel.  It used to be a stable for a horse.  It was
the stables for the big house.  It was a little poor
man's home behind the rich man's home.  It's a jewel.
           It's a -- was a gorgeous little place, but
it is the size of a nut.  If you make a noise, let's
say, a little burp or something you don't want to --
you'd hear it.  It just --
           Where she says that they had relations in
a bathroom, I -- first of all, the bath is an old
Victorian bath.  I could -- I'm quite -- quite small,
it's tight for me.  I put my brother in there to see
what would happen.  And it looks like a blivet, which
is a sausage in like a very tight skin.
           So her description of whatever the two
people were doing in the tub, that wouldn't work.
The bathroom itself is so small, you can't lie flat
on the floor.  So it couldn't happen on the floor,
because you physically, physically can't.  This
bathroom is too small to even be on the floor.
           And then the kicker of all kickers, is
Page 143
that because the bathroom was so small, I decorated
it to try make it look huge, which meant that I put
mirrors the whole way around it.  And what was so fun
about being in there is that if you stood in the
bathroom, you saw like a hundred of you, like you do
if you were in --
           DAVID MARKUS:  A fun house.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, well, Alice in
Wonderland or one of those things that you would see
yourself going, stretching everything.  And the
image.  If you said you were -- let's say you were,
let's say that 
 was telling the truth.
           She could say she was having sex with
5,000 generations of the Royal Family, because that's
how far back you could see yourself.  There is no way
in God's green earth if that had taken place, that
this is something that you would miss, because it's
-- you couldn't miss it.
           If you were standing there, you'd see the
whole -- the FBI, the whole Department of Justice
standing behind you.  It's like, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  And also -- let me just --
also explain where the tap was in the bathtub.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, well it's an old
Page 144
Vic- had a tap.  So if you were in -- if you were in
the top, right, it might -- this is the tub.  My tap
would be here, I think -- no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you think it's kind of
logistically and physically not something that could
have happened.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, there's that.
And there's just -- Andrew would -- he's so English.
He's so -- he had a tie on.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Do you think there's any
way it could have happened or no?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely on -- no
way -- no how, absolutely not.  Wait, I haven't
finished.  So on her --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry.
           DAVID MARKUS:  No, go ahead.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Go ahead.  Go, go, go.
Finish.  Please, go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.  Can I finish?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  When all this
nonsense took place, where this whole story with the
picture and the this and the that and this bullshit,
Page 145
I believe that this whole thing was manufactured, and
I can point you to some potentially corroborating
evidence of this.
           So when she gave the photograph to the FBI
in Australia --
           DIEGO PESTANA:  Just to be clear, the
photo, you're talking about, you're talking about the
famous one where --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, I have a image
of it here.  Who wants to look at it?
           DIEGO PESTANA:  -- where Prince Andrew is
holding 
 and you're in the background?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The fake, just to be
clear.  So on the back of that, and this is in the
discovery by the way.  I don't know if it's in -- I
don't know where, which discovery I saw it in now.
           But this -- she wrote, she, 
wrote in the back that it was a picture that was
taken in January of 2000 and -- on 2000 or 2001, I
don't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So now in her
handwriting, that she's giving the FBI this picture,
suddenly now it's March.  So how do you go from her
writing it's January to March.  It's because it

Page 146
only -- it's the only one that fit with the flight
logs, that when she could be in London and this took
place.
           The second thing is that -- oh, I'm so
excited to tell you this.  There is a journalist, I
know you guys are quite -- well, I don't know.  The
fake news is at work here.
           So there's a journalist called Sharon
Churcher.  There is a lawyer called Brad Edwards.
These two -- and there is a Southern District of
Florida prosecutor called Villafana.
           I would very much look forward to showing
you the relationship between these three parties that
created that story.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why?  Well, without --
putting aside the relationship, why do you think they
created that story?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe that story
was created for the purposes of -- well, there are
multiple.  The first one is financial, the second one
is for the purposes of the CVRA case.  The third one
was for the serialization, both of her book and in
the papers, for the story to attack the Royal Family.
           And just as a --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I think when -- when you
Page 147
were just asked about the photo, you said you
actually thought the photo was fake.
           Do you think it was just misdated or do
you think it's a fake -- literally a fake photo?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe it's
literally a fake photo.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you think that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, first of all, I
don't remember it.  We'll start --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  Okay.  But the
outfit I'm wearing --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- is the outfit from
my mum's birthday party.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So but you don't have
any -- do you dispute that they've met each other?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Do you know whether they've
met each other?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not know that
they met.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So -- so you not
only -- so you think the photograph is fake, but you
also are not even positive they actually ever met
each other.
Page 148
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you don't have a
specific recollection of kind of being at an event or
a party or your apartment, or you know, you're flat
in London with Prince Andrew and 
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not.
           DAVID MARKUS:  She doesn't know one way or
the other.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understand that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm just -- I want you
to know that --
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, I know.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- the reason why --
I'm not hesitant.  I'm not -- I don't have any memory
of that, so that -- that's not the issue.  The issue
is, could Andrew have come to the house to see me or
see Epstein, and say hi and she had been there?  Yes.
I can't say that that didn't happen.
           But what I can absolutely, categorically
say is that I never, at any time, set Andrew up to
have relations with her or any other human being
ever.
           And I can categorically state that her --
her characterization of whatever may or may not have
happened, could -- physically would just no.  And
Page 149
plus, I was in the country, so all of that's just not
conceivable.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you attend -- did you
attend social parties over -- and again, I really,
now I'm focused on 2000 plus, so not -- not the
earlier, where Mr. Epstein would host a party or be a
big part of the hosting of the party and some of, or
many of the young women who were masseuses would be
invited to the party, as guests or his entertainment?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I certainly went to
his house when he would have people who would be
there that were -- I call them -- I would -- the way
I would think of it and I would characterize it, were
his entourage.  That's how I thought about it.  And
that certainly was in the later 2000s, Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did you attend any
weddings of famous people with Mr. Epstein?  Again,
I'm mostly focused on post -- plus -- post 2000, but
if there's something that comes to mind in the '90s,
that's fine as well.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  A wedding?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Weddings.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  With Epstein?  I don't
think I ever went to a wedding with Epstein.  I can't
think of a wedding that I ever went to with him.

           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- so you don't
remember -- you didn't attend President Clinton's
daughter's wedding --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- Chelsea Clinton's.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But that wasn't with
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, it was with
Ted Waitt, my boyfriend.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Say it again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  With Ted Waitt, my
boyfriend.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein was at that wedding?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He was not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And how did you --
did you have a relationship -- well, why did you get
invited to that wedding?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because Ted and
Clinton were very close.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And why -- how were you
close to them?  Like what was the reason you were
close to them?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met President
Page 151
Clinton -- well, I first of all, I went to the
White House with Epstein once for, I think it was for
a historical, like one of those benefits and I met
the President then, but like a thousand other people
shook his hand.
           Then after that, I had a very -- a good
friend of mine that was the mayor -- known to be the
Mayor of Miami Beach, Philip Levine, and Philip and
the President were very good friends.  And Philip was
a very -- and I were very good friends, and so I
actually was introduced to the President post his
coming out of the White House and became friendly
with him, because of Philip Levine.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Because of what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Philip Levine.
           TODD BLANCHE:  There's some names that
have been publicly associated with Mr. Epstein that I
just want to ask you if you know about:  Piers
Morgan?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Is friendly with who?
           TODD BLANCHE:  With Mr. Epstein.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have no idea.
Never.  I doubt it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  There's no trick
question.  I'm not trying to --
Page 152
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I'm not suggesting that
I know the answer to it.  I'm generally just asking.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I would be
astonished.  I can't imagine they'd have anything in
common either.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How about --
           DIEGO PESTANA:  Were you friends with
Piers Morgan?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I've met him.  I've
met him.  I met him at an event in Manhattan.  I
can't remember what -- in more recently, so probably
in 2012, '13, something in that, and we had a very
nice conversation.  So I remember -- I remember that.
           I remember thinking -- I'd never -- I
don't remember if I'd ever met him before, but I
remember thinking how nice he was and I was
surprised.  So I liked him.  What can I tell you?
           So that's the only one -- that's the only
memory I have of that.  I'm not sure if that's
correct but that's what I think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I don't have a correct or
incorrect answer.  I just want you to tell the truth.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I just don't know.
I just want to try and...
Page 153
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, but I don't -- I want
you to believe me and -- because I mean this.  There
is so much information in the public sphere --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- about you and
Mr. Epstein and others around, and some of it is
definitely true and some of it is definitely false --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  All right.  I
just -- I guess that's --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so when I ask a question
--
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- if I think that you're
not being honest or that you're missing something,
I'm not going to -- this isn't got you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I'll say that to you.
           Did you ever meet JFK, Jr.?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm sorry?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever meet JFK, Jr.?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I will -- I met him at
Andrew Cuomo's wedding?  No, Kerry -- Kerry's
wedding.  Kerry's wedding.  Who did Kerry marry?

(Pages 154 to 157)
(Pages 154 to 157)
Page 154
Andrew Cuomo.  Yes.  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Andrew Cuomo's wedding
in --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when would that have
been, approximately?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  1990.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So before --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  1999.  I don't -- I --
something like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But would that have been
before you met Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Or maybe -- yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you have a -- any sort
of professional or social relationship with John F.
Kennedy, Jr.?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I fancied him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I thought he was very
attractive.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh, you fancied him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Besides him -- finding him
attractive and fancying him, did you have any sort
of, you know, social relationship with him?
Page 155
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, we knew each
other.  I thought he was wonderful and fun and I
enjoyed meeting him, but I -- we went out -- I want
to say we had a dinner or two, but obviously I was
very excited, but that was it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then Alan Dershowitz.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- what's the
question with Alan?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you -- say that again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What's the question?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know Mr. Dershowitz?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether he knew
Mr. Epstein?  Do you know the nature of their
relationship?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I definitely do
know Alan.  I want -- I'm just trying to remember if
I knew him -- I am trying to remember how I met him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and if I met him
separate from -- I don't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So that I have no
recollection.  I remember -- I know that he was
Epstein's lawyer.  I don't know if they had any
Page 156
relationship prior to that.  I don't remember.  Oh, I
do actually.  Sorry.
           I think they met at the same
Martha's Vineyard through Lynn Forester.  I think
that's what happened.  I think that's it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And why do you think that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because it just popped
into my head.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And did you -- did
you -- you said that Mr. Dershowitz was Mr. Epstein's
attorney.
           Do you know whether they also socialized?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So my personal memory
of when I remember two -- I have two distinct
memories with Alan.  One is with him and his wife at
the island, and I actually remember that.  And I
remember, I think, going to his house in Boston, if
he had a house in Boston, that's -- it was only two
times I remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe
Mr. Dershowitz doing anything inappropriate with
young women around Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever hear
anybody -- did anybody ever tell you that he had done
Page 157
anything inappropriate?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever -- did you --
do you know one way or the other, whether
Mr. Dershowitz ever got a massage at the island or
any of the locations that he was at with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't remember
anything about him ever getting massaged.  I don't
ever have any recoll- -- I don't believe I ever even
saw him in a bathrobe.  I have no knowledge of that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I'm jumping around a little
bit.  You mentioned, I think briefly the TerraMar
Project.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What is that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I founded TerraMar
in -- well, the idea of TerraMar came, I think in
2010.  So I want to just explain TerraMar a little
bit.
           So Ted and I bought a boat -- well, Ted
bought the boat.  And its -- basis of the boat was to
do explorations and sea -- sea exploratory stuff.
This really started because I have, and have had
since I was a child, a love of the ocean and
everything aquatic.  And I've always been, I just --

(Pages 158 to 161)
(Pages 158 to 161)
Page 158
I'm nervous about the state of the ocean.
           When Ted and I, we worked with National
Geographic and we did exploratory work and the most
exciting -- we did many exciting things, but one of
the most fabulous ones that we did was we looked for
Amelia Earhart twice.  I did two expeditions to look
for Amelia Earhart, as an example of an -- of a
exploration that we did.
           And he had a foundation for the ocean and
we worked with Nat Geo, we worked with Woods Hole.
We did amazing things.
           We bought-- he bought the Remus 6000, so
when the plane went missing, the plane that went --
was it Air France?  From Brazil to Paris that went
down, it was the Remus 6000 that found that plane.
It's one of those deep sea explorers.
           Anyway, when I broke up with Ted, I
just -- one of the things I did not want to give up
was the -- my love of the ocean and everything that
we did and TerraMar, the genesis of TerraMar came
from that.  So TerraMar obviously means land, sea.
           And the story of the ocean is that earth
really shouldn't be called earth, it should be called
ocean because three quarters is the ocean.
           So -- and so I wanted to not clash with
Page 159
anything to do with Ted, because it was a bit awkward
between us and I -- so he took all the part of the
ocean that was close to land, so within 200 miles.
           And so I decided I would focus on all the
part of the ocean that was outside of national
borders, TerraMar.  And that's how that -- that's the
genesis of TerraMar.  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So what was the time period
of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That -- I think after
I broke up with Ted, so 2010, '11 is when it started.
And then I ran it all the way up until whenever the
Epstein drama struck and then I just shut it down.
           Not -- I shut it down because I didn't
want what was happening to hurt any -- the
Smithsonian or Nat Geo or the -- I just couldn't let
everything be hurt by what was happening to me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know Jean-Luc
Brunel?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met him -- so
when -- I told you I was working for the European,
for my dad --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
Page 160
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and I was in
charge.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So back in like '90, early
'90s?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  And I was
running a magazine.  One of the things in the
magazine is fashion.  And so I was going to some
fashion shows and I was looking for fashion
sponsorship.  And in fact, when I came to America,
one of the first sponsors that I got for it was Ron
Perelman at Revlon, who was great.  And I met
Jean-Luc through just in Paris like that.  But
socially not ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did Mr. Epstein know him as
well?  Did you later learn whether they knew each
other?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not sure I -- I
don't -- he would've -- Epstein had his own fashion
situation, so he would've -- I don't -- he didn't
meet Jean-Luc through me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe them
together over the years?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely.  Yeah, I
saw them many times together.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did he visit the
Page 161
island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did he go to Palm --
meet -- go to Palm Beach House?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, he went -- yeah,
he went everywhere.  I saw him in every place.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did do you ever observe him
getting a massage or do you ever know whether they
got a massage?  Maybe you didn't observe him
personally?  You don't remember.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know.  I mean,
I don't -- I never -- I have no conscious memory of
Jean-Luc.  I would imagine that he did, but I
never -- I don't see it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How about Mr. Weinstein,
Harvey Weinstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What would you like to
know?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know him?  Like,
I guess when I say "how do you know him," is it a
relationship you had kind of separate from
Mr. Epstein or did you guys -- did you meet him
through Mr. Epstein or both?

(Pages 162 to 165)
(Pages 162 to 165)
Page 162
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wouldn't say --
first of all, I wouldn't say I had any type of
relationship with Harvey Weinstein --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- in any context.
           Socially, I would meet him because I would
go to events that Harvey would be at and also his
wife was English back then, Georgina.  And I was, I
mean, friendly also, would be a big word, more
acquaintance.
           So we would see each other and I would go
to Miramax events, be -- there was a couple of people
who worked for Harvey who I was friendly with, his
primary producer whose name is Meryl Poster, who I
was friendly with, and yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein had his own relationship with
Mr. Weinstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did they socialize together
at the island or in Palm Beach, or in New Mexico?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw Harvey at
any of Epstein's houses.  So socialize -- I don't
know that they were friends.  I mean, I can't see
them together, either.  I mean, literally.
Page 163
           But I know that they certainly do that.  I
would imagine -- and in fact, I think I have a
memory, but I can't -- that when Harvey was trying to
raise money for whatever his business was called, I
can't remember what his business was called.
           Maybe he went there, because Epstein was
good at raising money.  I just don't know.  But I
never saw them.  I don't -- I don't recall seeing
Harvey in any of the properties.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let's just go a few more
minutes and take a break, I know it's after lunch.
           So do you -- we talked several hours ago
about your father and his business a little bit.
           After your father passed, do you know
whether Mr. Epstein was involved in your family
business, that you know of?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not, in any
respect.  First of all, there was no family business
left.  Start with that problem.  And the second one
is, my family didn't like him very much.  And they
were busy dealing with their own problems and there
was no relationship whatsoever.
           Oh, I mean, he -- my mum and he got along
quite well.  That was it.  But that was -- she's an
old lady and, you know, he was nice to her.
Page 164
           TODD BLANCHE:  We're repeat -- we're now
being a little repetitive, but you're confident that
before you met Mr. Epstein, he didn't know your
father, and so there's no -- he wouldn't have done
business with your father's companies in the '80s
either.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely not.  I'm a
hundred percent sure of that.  I never met him.  I
never saw him.  I never heard his name.  No.
Nothing.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So there's been a lot of
conversations about whether Mr. Epstein maintained,
like, a list of people, like a book of famous people
that he knew.  Like a, it's called a black book or a
client list or a list.
           Did you know of the existence of any such
list?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There is no list.
We'll start with that.  The genesis of that story, I
can actually trace for you from its absolute
inception, if that is what you're interested in.
           TODD BLANCHE:  It is.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Well, first, you know, to
be short, there is no list, there's no client list.
Nothing like that.
Page 165
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, there is nothing
like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  That you know of.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That I -- obviously.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  So
you say you think you know the genesis, so go ahead.
Tell us.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'd like you to know
that I have brought some supporting corroborative
evidence to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, tell me what it is,
too, and then we'll get the corroboration.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Well, why don't you tell
him first.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Is this -- is this -- do
you want to take a break here because this is a
long --
           TODD BLANCHE:  It's a long story.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, this is long.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, let's take a break.
           SPENCER HORN:  All right.  The time is
2:03 and we're going to take a break right now.
           (Off the record at 2:03 p.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  All right.  We're resuming
the recorded proffer of Ms. Maxwell.  It is 2:16 on

(Pages 166 to 169)
(Pages 166 to 169)
Page 166
Thursday, July 24th.  And the recording device is now
on.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when we stopped to take
a break, we were talking about what has been publicly
discussed as a black book or the Epstein list.  And
that's where we are.
           So you said you think you might know or
that you're aware of kind of the origin of this
narrative.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  I just want to
reiterate again, there is no list that I am aware of.
I've never, at any time, at least during the period
of time when I was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- present.
           The origin of this story, I believe,
begins -- or it has a beginning in 2009, and then it
has a prequel but we have to start in 2009.
           In 2009, there is -- Epstein is, I think,
out of jail, and there are civil suits taking place.
Many of these are coming out of a disgraced law firm,
Rothstein Adler -- Rothstein, Rosenfeldt & Adler.
           At that law firm is a lawyer who started
there in April, May, 2009, called Brad Edwards.  In
2009, allegedly the FBI gets a call in October of
Page 167
2009 from Brad Edwards, and he allegedly tells them
that he has come across a piece of evidence that
belongs to Epstein, that contains a list of all of
his clients and victims, underage girls, massage
therapists, and his -- and the men who are having sex
with them.  And he becomes -- he, Brad Edwards
becomes a cooperating witness -- cooperating --
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Confidential.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- confidential
informant, sorry.  Confidential informant for them.
           And in a sting operation obtains the list
from a former butler of Epstein's called Alfredo
Rodriguez.  And it becomes evidence in the civil
suit.
           In the -- Alfredo Rodriguez is
subsequently prosecuted for having an AK-47 or
something weird, some guns or something, and goes to
trial.  And there's a criminal complaint that the FBI
produced.
           And in that criminal complaint, it says
that Brad Edwards became aware of the list, but --
we'll call it the list for the purposes of this.
After Alfredo Rodriguez's two depositions that are
held in Epstein's civil suit.
           It's in the FBI's affidavit that the
Page 168
evidence was collected, and Brad Edwards became aware
of it after the second deposition.  It's in the
criminal complaint.  The truth is different from
what's in both the criminal complaint and in that FBI
affidavit, and in Brad Edward's own statements on the
subject.
           The truth is that Alfredo Rodriguez was
deposed twice, once in July and once in August.  And
in the July deposition, told Brad Edwards that he had
handwritten notes or a journal, whatever, in the
deposition.
           And Brad Edwards replies, well, we're
going to come back for a second deposition.  And the
second deposition takes place in August.
           What this means is that Brad Edwards had
access to the list from sometime between July and
August, until when he actually called the FBI in
October.  So we're talking six months or so.
           Rothstein's firm was raided a few days
after the list went into the FBI's hands, and,
subsequently, Rothstein himself was prosecuted for
RICO, and I believe went to jail for 50 years.
           As part of that RICO case, he admitted to,
on the record, and was -- I don't know whether he was
prosecuted for creating fake settlements and fake
Page 169
evidence in Epstein's case.
           In 2009, simultaneously whilst this was
going on, my boyfriend, Ted Waitt, was asked for
$10 million to keep me out of any of Epstein's civil
suits.  Up until then, I had not been in any of
Epstein's civil suits.  In fact, I wasn't even sure,
save for the first time I was mentioned was by
, I hadn't been -- I was basically nowhere.
           And then Ted was called for this
$10 million and had been shown -- his people had been
shown evidence that included the list, the flight
logs and various other pieces of evidence.
           Now, we're going to the prequel part of
this story, so then it can tie to how this starts.
           In 2007, Epstein signs the non-prosecution
agreement.  He then fights the prosecution agreement
or debates it through the DOJ or whatever happened
there, and is -- goes to the court in 2008, when it's
accepted or whatever that is.
           Villafana was the lead prosecutor or the
lead -- yes, in that case.  And she, I think, was not
happy or with the outcome and utilized, at that time,
Brad Edwards, to file the CVRA case.
           Now, what is -- what I have managed to
understand from this is, within the OPR itself, there
DOJ REDACTION

(Pages 170 to 173)
(Pages 170 to 173)
Page 170
is evidence.  There it says that Brad Edwards was the
only lawyer that she was allowed to talk to.  So I
just want to preface that.
           The reason why I know that she went behind
Acosta's back, and everything else to do this, is
because Brad Edwards in a podcast made the
revelation.  What he says is that he'd never heard of
the CVRA case before, and Villafana called him and
told him to file it.  The sole purpose of the CVRA
was to overturn the non-prosecution agreement.
           So what I believe is that Villafana worked
with Brad Edwards, who she had also been -- he was
the lawyer that she had selected as a pro bono lawyer
for some of the victims.  And he was also working for
Rothstein's firm, that was under RICO investigation
for that entire time, creating fake evidence in
Epstein's case.
           And she had just filed hidden secret using
Edwards to overturn the NPA by filing the -- this
CVRA case, that sole purpose was to overturn it.  And
so when he approached her with the list, this was
part of the effort to utilize and find new evidence
to support the overturning, either of the NPA and/or
a new case against Epstein.
           Because Brad Edwards -- or I don't know it
Page 171
was Brad Edwards.  Because Rothstein's firm asked my
then boyfriend for $10 million, to kick me out of
suits that I had no knowledge of at that time
whatsoever, I now know that the base of this story
was a blackmail of a billionaire, because Ted Waitt
was a multi-billionaire.
           He had everything.  He was way, way more
wealthy than Epstein, if anyone cares.  And that is
the reason why Ted and I broke up, was the basis of
that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And that list was
created -- so then the -- the masseuses that were on
that list, I have never heard of some of them.  I --
not even from the civil suits that had come up since
I've seen it.  And this is me now knowing what's in
the list today.
           And I believe that -- oh, Alfredo
Rodriguez, so there's a metamorphosis of this list.
So the original statement that Brad Edwards makes,
that's in the documents contemporaneously, is that
it's pieces of paper that Alfredo has.
           It then morphs into something that Alfredo
took a book, that Alfredo took from Epstein's
computer, but there's no computer I know.  Certainly
Page 172
not in 2005 when this was allegedly taken, that came
out as a book.
           And then it morphed into, at the civil
time -- my civil case, into a book that was taken
from my computer.  And then it morphed into the
Southern District of New York as a combination list
of mine and Epstein's.  That is a metamorphosis
through documents that you can trace.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So the -- in your mind, or
from what you just described, there is a list, it's
just manufactured.  Meaning, have you seen the list,
even fake?  Like do you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I haven't seen it, but
what I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So just -- I was confused
--
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I guess my thing is
that what Brad Edwards says in all of these things
is -- in the paperwork and whatnot.  And in -- so all
this story is basically controlled by five people.
           There's four alleged victims that speak
about the list and the blackmail and the men and the
sex and whatnot -- And the lawyers and now the
prosecutors, sorry.  The Southern District of
New York for sure.  But no one else.
Page 173
           None of these stories carry from any of
the 44, alleged, original victims.  They never ever
say that they were farmed out to anybody.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But the list itself --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- where is it?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There is no list, but
Brad Edwards said that he created the list.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So that's what I was a
little  confused about.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.  He created a
list.  He -- so in that book that Alfredo Rodriguez
produced, that became evidence, Exhibit 52 in my
trial, has markings all over it.  Circles and dots
and whatnot.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And Brad Edwards says
that he got Alfredo Rodriguez to mark up the book of
all the people who were involved.  It includes Alan
Dershowitz, for the record, who's marked.  I don't
remember what it does with Donald Trump.  I don't --
I don't know.  You'd have to look.  I don't have it.
           But I believe --
           TODD BLANCHE:  I see.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So what he did, he

(Pages 174 to 177)
(Pages 174 to 177)
Page 174
marked up -- I don't know who.  Somebody marked up
that book of names, and I think all the names of the
people that they went for were originally selected
between two sources.  One was this alleged book of
names, and one was also from the telephone logs that
were collected from the house in Palm Beach.
           And just to finish it off, there is a
note -- I have some papers for you if you wanted
them, where Brad Edwards says that he has a list of
men that he got money off --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- okay.  So the list
that everybody, the black book, the list, what you're
saying is that your -- your Exhibit 52 from your
trial, which is like a -- more of an address book, a
Rolodex type thing, that Mr. Rodriguez -- Alfredo
Rodriguez, your understanding, is that somewhere
along the way he went through and kind of marked that
list to say --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know where
that book actually comes from.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know what that
book is.  That book is some type of a compilation,
but what it is, is it's just pieces of paper with
type.  So if you had -- you could have made a list.
Page 175
I could put --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you're referring to
something that's been public for a long, if we're
thinking about the same thing.  You're talking about
the -- you're right, it's like a bunch of different
types of paper or whatever.  I only have a copy of
it, but with big parts of it redacted publicly,
because there was people's addresses and whatnot on
it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  That's what I'm
talking about.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it -- oh, perfect.
Yes.  So you will find --
           TODD BLANCHE:  We're looking at Exhibit 52
now.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So you're
looking at Exhibit 52.  So the one they produced,
they, the Southern District of New York actually
produced a book for me to see it as evidence, the
actual thing it was.
           And I -- it has marks, it has tabs, it has
things, it has names I've never seen.  It had -- like
that list -- those -- that list was basically the
names that they choose to produce at trial.  Now, in
Page 176
Rothstein Adler's firm, I also have some documents
where Rothstein -- his original scheme, Rothstein
Adler, was to place prostitutes.  He had a bar, a
dance bar where he had girls.  And I believe he would
use them and put them as fake secretaries in people's
offices, and then she might touch him or he might
touch her or something, and boom, he got $25,000 for
that.
           And those girls --now, I'm not saying that
those are the girls that came in Epstein's case
necessarily, but the --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- but again, let's --
like, so we're separating the evidence that came in
at your trial and what you just talked about with
Brad Edwards and Mr. Rodriguez.
           During the time that you were with
Mr. Epstein, and even in the 2000s when you were
around less frequently, you never observed or you
never saw any sort of list or black book or a list of
individuals who, you know, linked to certain
masseuses or --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- anything like that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely no.  There
is no list.  There is no -- I'm not aware of any
Page 177
blackmail.  I never heard that.  I never saw it and I
never imagined it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  While we're on this topic,
just -- and again, I know we're jumping around and
we've been going on it for a while, so I apologize.
           But there's recently been reports about a
birthday book that you assembled for Mr. Epstein, I
think, for his 50th birthday in 2003.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do you know about
that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So, my mum did a
birthday book for my father at his 60th.  And when
I -- Epstein would talk about his 50th, he said, I
don't know what I'm going to do.  And I said, well,
these are nice things, my mom did this book for my
dad.  He said, I love that idea.
           He said, can you help coordinate it?  And
he organized who -- he called a lot of the people
himself.  I coordinated the putting together of the
book.  And some -- in some instances, I called people
that asked them to contribute --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what was in the book?
Like what was the ask of the people you called?
            GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It's his 50th

(Pages 178 to 181)
(Pages 178 to 181)
Page 178
birthday, say anything you want on a piece of paper.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, nothing more
than that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.  I mean, it was an
obvious question.  But you basically -- his folks
were invited to send something to you to celebrate
his birthday.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  To say happy
birthday with like, have a wonderful day or something
else.  There was no -- there was no ask, but I wasn't
responsible for everybody in that book.  And there
were people that he would ask himself to contribute.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you remember some --
do you remember specific names of individuals who did
send letters or who did contribute?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It's been so long.  I
want to tell you, but I don't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I honestly don't
remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  The article talks about
several names, but including the folks -- the
article, which is on Donald Trump.  Do you remember
President Trump submitting a letter or a card or a
Page 179
note?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you think the
articles -- well, do you remember seeing that book or
any portion of the letters in your discovery in
New York?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  What do you remember
seeing?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I remember there
was -- there were some portions of that book.  But
what surprised me -- yeah.  What surprised me was how
few there were, because I thought if you had those,
where are the rest?  There was none of Mr. Trump.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In your discovery?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, in my discovery,
sorry.  President Trump, there was nothing from
President Trump.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you remember -- but
separate and apart from your discovery, do you
remember one way or the other whether President Trump
submitted a letter for his 50th birthday?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the article that
references the letter talks about like a -- sounds
Page 180
like either a naked -- a picture of a naked woman or
something like that.
           Do you have any recollection of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not.  But just --
no, I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember -- so what
do you remember seeing from your discovery around the
book?  Like you said, portions of it or some of the
pages.
           What do you remember.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I remember there were
maybe -- so I just want to say about the discovery
that I had about -- maybe this is an exaggeration,
I'm not sure, but in my mind it's about close to 5
million page -- 5 million documents.  It was a lot.
           And of that giant document dump that I
received, I was only -- maybe as much as 30 to 35
percent, I was never able to access.  And this is
documented on -- at the court.  And so I cannot say
that I saw everything, because I didn't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just want you to
know that.  And I think that that was by design.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you -- but you do
remember --
Page 181
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do remember some
pages.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- seeing some pages of the
book?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Do you remember what
pages you saw?  Like from -- it was from -- who had
written those letters or no?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I really don't
remember.  I'm sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  It's okay.  Did you
-- did you and/or -- so the same questions we've
asked about some other individuals.
           Did you have -- did you meet Bill Gates
over the years?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Because of your
relationship with Mr. Epstein or separate?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That one -- well, I
met Mr. Gates -- I went to the TED conference.  I
gave -- I went to the TED conference and I actually
spoke at the TED Conference, not the main stage, the
substage.  And I also gave several TEDx's.
           But -- and I met him there, but we were
friendly and I actually did meet him, because I knew

(Pages 182 to 185)
(Pages 182 to 185)
Page 182
his -- I don't know if he was chief of staff or
whoever, Boris.  And I met him, I think, once.  I may
have met him actually at 71st Street.  I may have
once.  I don't remember if I met him there or at a
restaurant, I don't remember.  And that would've been
because of Epstein, because Epstein was friendly with
Boris and Boris -- that's all I remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Gates traveled with Mr. Epstein on his plane to
any of his houses?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So if that -- that
friendship was after, you know, it was in the late
2000s.  So if I met him -- like I said, I went to
Epstein's house maybe once or twice.  Maybe I met him
there.  I don't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you don't --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I wouldn't know if
he had been on Epstein's plane.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you weren't -- you
don't recall ever being on the plane with him flying
to the island or to anywhere?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know somebody named
Reid Hoffman?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
Page 183
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who's that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Reid is a Silicon
Valley guy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Is what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Silicon Valley.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how do you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Through my friends in
San Francisco.  I have a -- I used to have a very
close friend who is in San Francisco who's part of
that whole -- I have several, actually, or had.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So is that a relationship
you had kind of separate and apart from Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Separate.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein had a relationship with Reid Hoffman?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe
Mr. Hoffman flying anywhere with you or Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Or getting massages?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So there was -- there's a
list of multiple masseuses that is floating around.
I think you had in your discovery.  I think you were
just talking about that.
Page 184
           That list, do you know how that list was
created?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  That -- all that
stuff that came out of that book, I now find suspect.
           TODD BLANCHE:  As far -- as part of the
story you just told us?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Now, I'm not
saying it's all fake.  I don't know what's real and
what's not.  I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understood.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- know what name is
true.  Now that it's been to my mind anyway, now that
it has been, without a doubt, contaminated and
possibly fraudulent, I'm not -- I don't know.  I
mean, obviously the numbers that I recognize are my
own, those are real.
           But how it was actually ended up put
together and compiled and the purposes for it, for
which then they blackmailed my boyfriend, now I'm
just -- no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Over the years when you
were serving as like the general manager, so the mid
'90s all the way into the 2000s.  Did you or do you
know whether anyone maintained a list of all the
masseuses, like a running list?
Page 185
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So there would've --
so there's two things -- well, three ways.  So I know
that the house itself, John Alessi had a Rolodex that
he kept the names and numbers of all the people that
came to the house so that he could call.
           So --because I only was with Epstein, even
at best, half the time.  So when I was there, he had
like his chief of staff who could find whatever he
needed.  And when I wasn't there, he had to rely on
somebody else, right?  So it'd be that John Alessi or
whoever else.
           So everybody -- whoever was traveling with
him or wherever he was, he needed somebody else to
access information.  So he had an assistant chief who
was his secretary, who would be the one that would
update his computer, you know, like everybody has an
address book.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But was what you're
describing, which I'm not -- it makes sense.  I'm
just -- was that a list of masseuses or a list of
people that might need to be contacted, which would,
necessarily, include a lot of masseuses?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's -- the latter.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did you update that?
Like were you part of -- were you one of the people

(Pages 186 to 189)
(Pages 186 to 189)
Page 186
that would add names to it?  Like if a masseuse came
and leaves and Mr. Epstein says yes, she was good,
would you be part -- like, how, how was the list kind
of maintained or who maintained it?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Typically, no --
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- because there would
be an assistant who would do that.  Plus, Epstein
would not allow me to answer the telephone ever.  So
-- or maintain or keep any of his messages in the
office or at the house.
           So typically that wouldn't be, because I
wouldn't be the one.  Could I say to you I never did
it?  No, of course not.  Because that just seems
ludicrous.  But as a rule of thumb, the answer would
be no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  During the 2007, '08, '09,
investigation -- the investigation out of the
Southern District of Florida.  So you said that you
weren't contacted by law enforcement.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  After Mr. Epstein was
charged, did you have conversations with him about
the investigation?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He never talked to me
Page 187
about it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, I can't --
let's put it this way.  If he did, I have no
recollection of it.  I mean, I'm sure he must have
said, this is all -- whatever he said or it's nothing
or whatever.
           I mean, I just don't have any -- I just
don't have any memory.  I mean, I just -- I was with
Ted.  My -- I was like gone.  I mean, plus I just
didn't want to know either, I suppose.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you don't know,
firsthand, why the U.S. Attorney in Florida made the
deal that he did?  Meaning you weren't part of that
discussion along the way.
           Like Mr. Epstein didn't say, I'm getting a
good deal or, you know, I -- something is happening
with the case that's very good.
           You were -- to the extent you know
anything about it, it's just from what you've heard
or read from others, not from Mr. Epstein; is that
right?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He never talked about
the non-prosecution directly with me, no.  But he did
--
Page 188
           DAVID MARKUS:  But it's still enforceable
as to her.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, he never said,
hey, do you -- are you happy with this deal like
that.  But I understood.  He never -- he never
enjoined me to the NPA, but I understand that he
included me, specifically, and I'll tell you why.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Well, it's okay.  You don't
need to get into that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, no.  Yeah.  I'm not --
I don't want to talk about the legal -- the -- what's
on appeal.  I'm just --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I -- well, I
wasn't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  The reason for my question,
just to be -- I'm not trying to hide something, but
there's a very strong belief that he got a very good
deal.  And that he should -- she -- he should have
been sentenced to more time or got a different
sentence from the feds than a non-prosecution
agreement.
           And I'm not asking you to opine on that,
but I'm wondering whether he ever talked to you about
that.  But it sounds like he didn't.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That he got a good
Page 189
deal.  No.  I think actually -- well, his comments
that I've read was that he didn't get a good deal.
And I think that the, you know, when he fought it so
hard is because he didn't think he did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When he was serving his
sentence, were you ever -- were you around during
that time, like when he was allowed to leave during
the day or travel during the day?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never called him.  I
never saw him and I never went to the jail.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I'm going to ask you
questions that you shouldn't read into them.  I just
want to know whether you -- whether they resonate
with you.
           Have you ever had any contact with any
representative, that you know of, from Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence agency.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Can you ask me that
again.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Has -- have you ever had
any contact with an individual that you understand to
be from Mossad, an Israeli intelligence agency?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, not
deliberately.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Pardon me?

(Pages 190 to 193)
(Pages 190 to 193)
Page 190
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not deliberately.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And did you know --
we asked this -- we talked about this a little bit
earlier, but just to put a finer point on it.  Did
you ever know that Mr. -- did you ever -- were you
ever told -- did you ever think that Mr. Epstein was
getting any money from any intelligence agency,
including Mossad?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I don't believe
so, but I wouldn't know.  I mean, I would be very
surprised if he did.  I don't think so.  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We've talked about a lot of
names and I'm sure we've -- there's some that we
haven't covered.  Are there any foreign nationals --
so right now we've talked about some British, the
Royal Family a little bit, and maybe high society
folks in Britain.
           Were there any international businessmen
or politicians that had a very close relationship or
a close relationship with Mr. Epstein, that we
haven't already talked about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Off the top of my,
head, I can think of Ehud Barak.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You said that Mr. Epstein
at some point in the mid to late '90s he started
Page 191
taking testosterone.  Did you ever know him to take
any other drugs?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I mean, he took
pills for his heart, I think, but I don't -- no
other -- no substances.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- do you know
anything about his heart condition?  I know we talked
about this at, you know, 9:45 this morning.  But do
you know anything about his heart condition, beyond
that you understood he had a heart condition that
affected his ability to have sex?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Other than what he
told me, no.  He never shared anything, but he did
take pills.  I don't know what -- I don't know
anything above that.  And like I said, he did the
testosterone, which made him mean.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And we're jumping around a
little bit.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sorry.  Do you know someone
named Donald Barr?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  He is -- I can represent to
you, was a former headmaster of the Dalton School,
which you mentioned earlier.
Page 192
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember any
conversations with Epstein about a book that Mr. Barr
wrote called Space Relations?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I've never heard of
that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  About aliens and sex?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether --
well, have you ever met the former Attorney General
of the United States Bill Barr?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember whether
Mr. Epstein knew him or whether his name ever came up
in conversations you had with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't recall any.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Did you have a
relationship or know -- I'm using "relationship," but
I appreciate you don't like that word.
           Do you have -- did you know Mr. Epstein's
brother Mark Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How did you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Through Jeffrey.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How would you describe your
Page 193
relationship; close, friendly?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My personal?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not that close, but
friendly enough.  I mean, you know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How was Jeffrey Epstein's
relationship with his brother Mark from what you
observed?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, they were
brotherly, but I think that -- I don't know.  I don't
know.  They had periods when they were closer and
then when they weren't.  I think sometimes Epstein
found his brother irritating.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I think I know the
answers, given what you just said about Bill Barr,
but did you ever hear any -- from Mr. Epstein or
anybody else -- that Bill Barr had any role in
Mr. Epstein getting a good plea deal in Florida, or
any role in that process with Mr. Acosta?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never heard that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I think you said this in an
interview, but if I'm wrong forgive me.  Do you have
a view of Mr. Epstein of whether he committed suicide
or whether something else happened?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Can we take a break?

(Pages 194 to 197)
(Pages 194 to 197)
Page 194
           TODD BLANCHE:  Want to take a break?
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yeah, sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  We can take a break.
Yeah.  Sure.  Actually, it's a good time to take a
break anyway, because it's to be the last one of the
day.
            SPENCER HORN:  All right.  So we're going
to take a break at -- it's 2:53, Thursday, July 24th.
            (Off the record at 2:53 p.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  We are continuing with the
recorded proffer of Ms. Maxwell.  The time is now
3:10 p.m., Thursday, July 24th.
           TODD BLANCHE:  My colleagues alerted me to
a couple questions I think I may have forgotten to
ask you.  One is -- sorry, I'm just going through my
notes.
           Well, we talked few minutes ago about this
birthday book that there's press about.  I understand
you don't remember anything with President Trump or a
lot about the book anyway.
           Do you remember asking President Trump to
submit a letter for that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you remember --
would you have been the one to do that or could
Page 195
somebody else -- would somebody else have done that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did ask some people.
I don't remember Mr. Trump.  I don't remember who I
did ask, but Epstein also asked people himself
directly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it could have
happened that way, if it happened at all.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Where is that?
           DIEGO PESTANA:  You mentioned Ehud Barak.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           DIEGO PESTANA:  What was his involvement?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  This would've been in
the later 2000's.  So I do not know how they met, but
I do know that they -- I don't know if friendly would
be the right word.  I don't know that, but I know
that they saw each other and only because my
father -- you know, anything that touches Israel or
the state of Israel, I'm always interested in,
because my father loved Israel and so I pay attention
to it and we have ties to, you know, to Israel.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you said it was later
though --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Ties meaning friends
and family relations.
Page 196
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was the Prime Minis- was
Mr. Barak, Prime Minister Barak, do you know what the
nature of his relationship was with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- were you
ever with them together?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think I met -- I
have a memory of meeting Ehud, but I don't know if he
was with Epstein or -- I don't remember.  I just know
that I did see him and I'm trying -- struggling to
remember the context around it, but if I -- if -- I'm
sure it happened, but it must have been very brief.
Because I don't have any serious memory of it.  Any
like, deep memory of that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And maybe this is
obvious --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And maybe it comes
also because I've read it in the press.  That may be
something that brought it to my memory.  So that's
also -- I mean, I'm also -- I think the press has
been very contaminating, so I just -- it's hard
sometimes to separate those stories from your memory
sometimes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know a British
gymnast by the name of Heather Mann?
Page 197
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did she --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I didn't know she was
a gymnast.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh, okay.  I'm reading
something that says she was a gymnast, but please
don't assume that that's correct.  This is based upon
my words.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did she ever travel with
you and/or Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think, yeah, she did
actually.  I think that she might have been one of
Mr. Epstein's girlfriends at some point.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- again, I know we're
talking about time periods that are vast.  What time
period would that have been?  Like after you --
like since 2000?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say -- I
don't know, it could be the '90s -- could be the
'90s, I don't know.  But I mean, listen, there are
people that pop out of the woodwork all the time.  I
just saw one on TV saying she was his girlfriend in
'93 and '94.  So I mean, he obviously was very busy.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Or she's lying.

(Pages 198 to 201)
(Pages 198 to 201)
Page 198
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Or there's that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did - someone named Mark
Middleton --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, I remember him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He was in the --
Mr. Clinton's administration -- President Clinton's
administration, I think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how do you -- do you
know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I met him and
that is -- I met him through Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you -- was he, from
what you observed, was he a friend or business
acquaintance of Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, I only saw him
a handful of times, but I did see him with him.  I
mean, he seemed friendly.  I don't know if I would
characterize -- I mean, only having seen him briefly,
I don't know how to characterize that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether he like
flew on airplanes with Mr. Epstein?  Did he visit the
island?  Do you know anything about that or their
relationship as it relates to that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never -- I don't
Page 199
have any recollection of seeing Mark Middleton at the
island.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How about former US Senator
George Mitchell?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, I do remember
George.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do you remember about
him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I traveled with him.
We went to -- the most memorable affair I went to --
well, I was friendly with his wife.  Start with that,
with Heather.  And Heather was in New York, so I hung
out with her a few times.  We had dinner and I was
just friendly, I would say separately with --
separately from her husband.  I was friends with
Heather.  I met Heather through her husband, but we
became friends.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You became friends with
Heather?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Heather, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was Mr. Epstein friends
with, Mr. Mitchell?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did they travel together
besides New York?  Did they travel to the island or
Page 200
to New Mexico?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't -- I don't
remember George ever at the island.  But the most
memorable trip I do recall with Senator was to Italy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was to where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  To Italy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Ah, okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  We went to Rome.
           TODD BLANCHE:  As the four of you.  So
Heather and Mr. Mitchell, and you and Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's my
recollection.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what were you there
for?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, the most
memorable aspect of that trip is we went to the
Vatican.  It was extraordinary, the most
extraordinary thing was going to the archives and
holding Henry VIII's document to the Pope asking for
his divorce.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know the former
president of Colombia, Andr?s Pastrana?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met Andr?s Pastrana
Page 201
in a pub in Dublin.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did he travel with
Mr. Epstein, that you know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't -- I don't
know if -- I don't know if he ever was ever on the
plane.  I don't know if he ever -- I don't think he
ever came to the island.  But, I went to places with
Andr?s Pastrana.  One was to Colombia and Epstein
came to that, and the other was to Cuba and Epstein
and Andr?s Pastrana was -- I think was there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what were the purposes
of traveling to Colombia, then Cuba?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I am a helicopter
pilot and Andr?s is a helicopter pilot.  And we just
became friends and I flew a Blackhawk in Colombia.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how about to Cuba?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My -- I have a friend
of mine who was the cigar distributor for Montecristo
maybe, I can't remember which cigar it was.  And so
we went there, and he organized the trip and we met
Fidel Castro.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that,
approximately?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Had to be -- it had to
be 2002, 2003.

(Pages 202 to 205)
(Pages 202 to 205)
Page 202
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Something like that, I
think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  There's some more names
that we might talk about tomorrow with the same type
of questions, just -- but as far as a catchall,
there's been a tremendous amount of public
information about all kinds of names, including some
of the folks we talked about today and their
relationship with Mr. Epstein and or you.
           For any of the folks that we've talked
about today, did you observe them doing anything
improper with Mr. Epstein, whether with masseuses or
with women who were -- or girls who were traveling or
at the residence that they were at or at the parties
that they were at?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did not ever, at any
time, see that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And for any of the names
we've talked about today, and then tomorrow we'll
talk about some more, but for today, do you recall
having any conversations with anybody else, where
they reported to you that they had seen something
that one of these individuals had done, whether
someone else that works with Mr. Epstein or somebody
Page 203
that observed something?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  If anybody had ever
reported anything -- first of all, the answer to that
is no.  And also, I just want to be clear that had
anybody ever reported anything illegal or disgusting
like that, I would've immediately done something.
And I never heard it.  I never saw it.  And no one
ever, ever, ever complained to me or tears, nothing
like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  All right.  So we
took a break when we were talking about Mr. Epstein
and his death.  Oh, bless you.  That's okay.  Take
your time.
           So Mr. Epstein and his death.  So you were
not, obviously, at the MCC during that time, correct.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Oh, thanks.  I thought you
were giving it to him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I've got something
that blew up my nose.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So just take some water.
It's okay, no problem.
           You were not at the MCC during that time,
correct?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was not.
Page 204
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you're going to tell us
what you believe, but just to -- I just want to make
sure I understand, your basis for belief is kind of
what you've read and seen and your knowledge of
Mr. Epstein for the many years you knew them -- knew
him, right?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And actually there's a
third component.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The answer to that is,
yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And there's a third
component to that, which is having experienced now,
the mismanagement and inefficiencies and total
dereliction of duty at the Bureau of Prisons.
           TODD BLANCHE:  From BOP.  From the Bureau
of Prisons.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Fair.  Okay.  So,
you know, I want to -- what I do want to be careful
about is -- you know, asking you to speculate,
because anybody can do that.  And I don't think
that's fair to you or anybody else to ask you to give
us your kind of opinion.
Page 205
           But, do you think that -- the third point
you say, which is kind of a failure by the BOP,
there's been a lot of -- there's an OIG report,
there's SDNY investigation about that.  Do you -- so
you think he was -- he did not die by suicide, given
all the things we just talked about.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not believe he
died by suicide, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you believe that --
do you have any speculation or view of who killed
him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- no, I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I ask that because, if
you don't believe that there's any truth to the
allegations of blackmail or that he had kind of a
list, or that he had reasons to have people hate him,
why would somebody kill him in prison?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  In prison, where I am,
they will kill you or they will pay -- somebody can
pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of
commissary.  That's about the going rate for a hit
with a lock today.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So that goes to the third
reason, which is kind of the mismanagement.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.

(Pages 206 to 209)
(Pages 206 to 209)
Page 206
           TODD BLANCHE:  Or the shortfallings or
shortcomings of the Bureau of Prisons.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Which is a little bit
different than my -- from my question is, which is,
do you think there was somebody on the outside of
prison, so putting aside, what could happen on the
inside on the outside of prison, who would -- who
wanted him dead so badly that he would've, or she
would've, you know, caused him to be killed on the
inside?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think that's -- I
don't see that.  I think, is it possible?  Of course
it's possible.  But I don't know of any reason why,
and I don't believe in the blackmail or in any of
this, I don't think Epstein had a hit on like that.
If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal
situation.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  So you're not -- you
don't have any reason firsthand knowledge or even
speculation, it sounds like, to think that he was --
if -- that he was killed to kind of silence him or to
keep him from going public about people he knew
about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't, no, because I
Page 207
think that is just part of the story that's been
created that started back in 2008, '09.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Yeah, I mean, that's
the point.  Like, I don't want -- I don't think
there's value in talking -- you know, there's been a
lot of -- there's a lot of information about what
happened, you know, at the MCC and -- but what is
important to me is whether, you know, if -- is the
idea that he didn't die by suicide, that's one thing.
But if to the extent that folks believe that he was
murdered to keep him quiet or because he had
information on rich and powerful people, that's what
I -- do you have any reason to believe that that's
true?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not have any
reason to believe that.  And I also think it's
ludicrous, because if that -- I also happen to think
if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty
of opportunity when he wasn't in jail.  And if they
were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he
would've been a very easy target.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In the time -- so we've
talked about a lot of time, all the way up through
2009, '10, and then your -- the time that after
Mr. Epstein was arrested, when's the last time you
Page 208
spoke with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Maybe 2016, 2017,
maybe 2016 -- 2015, 2016, 2017 in that area, I
believe.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what -- when you're
thinking about that last time was that you had
talked -- been talking to him a lot, and then you
stopped, or was that a one-off time and it was
infrequent at that point?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I really wasn't in
communication.  The only communications I had with
him was in -- with regards to the civil suits, the
civil suit that I found myself in, the defamation
suit I found myself in.  I needed help, I needed
information, and I didn't have what I needed.
           And so that was really what it was -- that
what drove it, was me trying to get myself out of
this situation, which I -- ultimately led to where I
am today.
           And so when -- when all that -- when
that -- I don't remember even if I stopped talking to
him before that, I think he was -- I thought he was
angry with me anyway.  He didn't like what I did, and
he -- I wasn't interested in what he had to say to
me, and --
Page 209
           TODD BLANCHE:  What did you think he was
angry with you about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think he was angry
that I had even said that I had referred to her being
a liar.  He said I should have not said anything but.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When the civil suits that
were ongoing before Mr. Epstein's death?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did your lawyers coordinate
with his lawyers, like in discovery and things like
that or anything?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think we
coordinated in -- I don't -- I'm not sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't want to
misspeak.  I don't -- I -- there was some degree of
communication for sure.  I just don't know the degree
that that took place.  So definitely -- I mean, I was
definitely hoping for him to be more helpful.  And I
was definitely, coordinating is not a good word,
because that sounds like I was trying to make --
align myself.
           That's not where we were going here, but I
was definitely trying to get help.  As in documents
or information that I could use to defend myself.

(Pages 210 to 213)
(Pages 210 to 213)
Page 210
That's a hundred percent true.  And the degree to
which that took place, I'm not -- I don't recall.
There was definitely some of that, though.  I don't
want to mislead you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And we touched on this
earlier, but I just want to -- I don't think we
really ran it to ground maybe as much as we could
like.  Going up through that time, you know, so in
the '16, '17, '18, up until the time he's arrested,
had your view or your understanding of what had
happened changed?
           Meaning did you believe that in the late
'90s or early 2000s when he started, you know,
behaving much differently.  Did you believe what you
were hearing about him at that point?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My views, I didn't
like the people he was with anyway.  So I don't find
-- how do I say this?  I don't like -- I like people
who my age or older, and I don't find the society of,
or the companionship of younger people who are young
people, I suppose, is really that enjoyable.  So I
don't like the company that he chose to be with, and
so I just was -- I find it boring and fundamentally
uninteresting.  That's probably the nicest way I can
say it.
Page 211
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  So I think
what we should do is just spend a few minutes talking
about tomorrow.  Everything was great today.  I think
that we -- it was very helpful and I appreciate you
trying to be as complete as you can.
           I think tomorrow -- you've said a few
things today about materials that you brought.  When
we're done, we will give you a few minutes with Mr.
Markus to -- if there's things that you want to show
him that you think we should see.
           Like I said, I'm not asking you to
corroborate anything.  If I was asking you to
corroborate something, I would tell you, but if
there's something you think that you don't think that
the government has seen or you think that is
important for me to see, let Mr. Markus know and he
can share it with me.
           Tomorrow we'll certainly have some
follow-on questions when we all think about tonight.
And I think you will too.  You know, we can all think
about stuff we've talked about.  We covered a lot of
different areas.  We are -- I do want to talk about
more about you.
           So by design today we wanted to focus on
Mr. Epstein and talk about, you know, kind of, well,
Page 212
everything under the sun that we've gone through
today.  I do think it's important when we all
evaluate what you've said today, and kind of your
story to understand, to also understand your -- why
you're here, right?
           So you were indicted, you were charged,
you went to trial.  And I want to do that in a way
that gives you an opportunity to say -- to kind of
say your piece or to say what you haven't said
before.
           But also understanding that there was
people who took the witness stand and swore to tell
the truth and testified about you, and what you did,
and what they think you saw and what they heard you
say.
           And I'm not -- I said to Mr. Markus, I'm
not trying to create a kind of a she said, she said
situation or he said, she said situation.  But I do
want to hear from you about your conduct, because
it's important, I think, for when we evaluate what
you say and how you say it and your recollection of
things to also to talk about that.
           So we're going to -- we'll do that
tomorrow.  I want to talk about, you know, the
circumstances leading up to your arrest.  There's a
Page 213
lot of, I think, misinformation or there's a lot of
information out there that -- I don't know whether
there's misinformation, but about the time from, you
know, 2019 up until the time that you were -- that
you were arrested.
           And then, like I said, that'll take us
through lunch tomorrow and then we'll be done.  I'm
not -- I don't have a plan.  I didn't know that I was
coming here until this week, okay?  So I'm not --
there isn't like a -- we don't have like a schedule
of what happens next or what happens.
           But the -- but that's not a negative
thing.  I'm just saying that that's -- so you
shouldn't take the lack of a next step as anything
other than, we don't have a next step yet, so.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  May I say something?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Of course, yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I just would like to
put out there that I also focused on how I think the
president got swept into some of this unnecessarily,
by the way.  And I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and I
certainly don't subscribe to all the -- all of
everything that I see.
           But I do believe that there is animus in
some areas that may have contributed to how the use

(Pages 214 to 215)
(Pages 214 to 215)
Page 214
of the president to harm him, that I find deeply
offensive.  And whilst I can't obviously say
definitively that that is what it is, I would like to
show you what I see so that you can evaluate it and
do with that as you see fit if it needs to be
addressed.  I've seen it, it struck me, and I would
like to give it to you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  For what it's worth.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that seem
something that I can --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, that's fine.  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Of course.  I don't
like that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  That's fine.
That's great.  Okay, so why don't we stop for today.
I'll give you a little bit of time to chat and then,
see you in the morning.
            SPENCER HORN:  This will conclude the
recorded proffer interview for Thursday, July 24th.
We will continue tomorrow, Friday, July 25th.  The
time is 3:34.

                        ***
           SPENCER HORN:  Good morning.  It is
Friday, July 25th, the time is 9:24 a.m.  My name is
Spencer R. Horn.  I'm the Assistant Special Agent in
Charge of FBI New York.  And we are here for a
recorded proffer agreement with Ms. Maxwell.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Good morning, Ms. Maxwell.
How are you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Good morning.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Good.  So the proffer
agreement we signed yesterday, I just -- there's a
place on it for us to all kind of initial.  It's
exactly the same document and you'll see your
signature.  If you can just initial right to the left
of -- right here.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Here?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right there.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, it's okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then Mr. Markus will --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- initial as well.  Thank
you.
           And just to kind of -- before we get
going, I'll just say that exactly the same folks that

Page 218
were here when we met yesterday are here today.  So
there's no -- I'm not going to do formal
introductions, because it's exactly the same group of
folks.
           So we're continuing, Ms. Maxwell, our
discussion of yesterday.  And the same -- the same
kind of rules apply.  If you -- we'll take breaks, if
you need to talk to Mr. Markus or your lawyers, no --
absolutely no problem.  Just let me know.  I'll try
to ask my questions in a coherent manner, but if
there's anything that I say that's confusing,
definitely interrupt me.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I will.  Thank you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I think the easiest
thing to start with is, is there anything that we
talked about yesterday that -- we're going to go
through some more names.  I think that we -- that's
one of the places that we -- that we interrupted,
just because there's a lot of names.
           But aside from additional names, is there
anything that you wanted to kind of follow up on that
we talked about yesterday or anything that you
thought maybe you remember more of or not?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Some more names did
come to me in the night, and I did have some

Page 219
additional memories just for clarity.  I believe I
said that I couldn't think of anybody who I may have
asked from Mar-a-Lago, but then I realized that I
was -- the allegation at least is that I met 
in Mar-a-Lago and so I felt that I needed to address
that.  And I didn't want to leave that hanging
because that seems weird under the circumstances.
           And also -- but I couldn't remember anyone
and -- maybe, you know, it's a long period of time.
So the issue is not that I'm trying to not say, but I
just don't -- I don't remember anybody that I would
have.  But it's not impossible that I might have
asked someone from there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I don't -- I don't know
exactly what you said yesterday, but I don't think
what you said yesterday is different than what you
just said.  So, yes.  There's --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I just wanted
to be -- I just didn't want to feel that I had said
no to something and that it -- and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  
 definitely had
has said that she was working at Mar-a-Lago and that
you received a treatment of her -- from her at some
point, and that you recruited her to meet
Mr. Epstein.

           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know, affirmatively,
whether that's true or false, or do you just not have
a memory either way?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I really don't believe
it's true.  But I know that I did go to spas and if I
met someone, I did ask if they're (indiscernible) --
so I don't -- in the realms of possibility, it could
have, but I have no memory of it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I don't believe
that that it's how it went down, but I don't want
to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So I want to talk
about -- we talked a little bit yesterday about the
financial part of your relationship with Mr. Epstein,
kind of being on payroll, for lack of a better word,
for many, many years, starting around $25,000 and
ending up at around $250,000 per year.
           There's -- as you know, from your trial,
there's banking information that shows a ton of money
being sent to you from Mr. Epstein over the years.
           And I think totaling something like
$30 million, something like this.  What's -- what's
the -- why was that money sent to you?  Like, what

Page 221
was that for?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, first of all, I
don't -- I dispute the characterization that the
money was sent to me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So tell me what -- I
am stuck with the witnesses at trial and what was
said at trial on that issue.  So what -- what -- what
is the -- what do you dispute about that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I believe -- I
don't have full recollection.  I'm not even sure I
ever saw what they accused me of, but my belief is
that that money also contained money that was for a
helicopter, for instance, that I never owned and I --
was never mine.  And --
           DAVID MARKUS:  In other words, money was
sent to you that you then used to purchase things
or...
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I'm not even
sure that I purchased it.  So the accounts -- those
accounts would be controlled by his accountants.
And --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Even accounts in your name,
you're saying, or one of your entities?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I'm not even
sure I knew of all the entities.  I'm not -- I

Page 222
don't -- it -- maybe I did, contemporaneously, but I
simply wouldn't know today.  So if there was an
entity, let's say account X, if I really set that up
myself or whether they said, we're doing this and the
money's coming or whatever.  But in no substantive
way -- I can't think of the right word.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Did you have control
over --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I had no control, is
what I'm saying.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when -- when the
government -- when there was testimony or the
government admitted evidence that showed, for
example, $5 million in 2002 coming from Epstein to
you, okay, what you're saying is that that may --
that happened, but that the you there, wasn't money
that -- he wasn't giving you money.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not going to say
that for everything, because maybe there were
accounts that money was sent to me.  But I can say
that I know -- like the helicopter, I can
definitively say.  I'd have to look at all of them to
be accurate for you.
           But to explain how or why I could be
receiving monies, and I certainly did.  So I'm not

Page 223
disputing all of it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But when you said -- let's
go back and look.  Why would -- why did money have to
go into your accounts or account that was controlled
by others, but in your name to, like, purchase a
helicopter?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, that's a very good
question.  I don't -- I'm not sure I know the answer
to that.  I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So let me ask this maybe a
different way that gets to the issue, right?  So the
accusation by the government, based upon the evidence
they collected, is that Epstein paid you millions and
millions of dollars over the years.
           And the reason why he paid you that is
because you were performing an extraordinary service
for him by recruiting young women, many of whom were
underage to -- so that he could sexually abuse them.
Okay.  That's their -- that's their allegation.
Okay.
           From what you said yesterday and from what
I've reviewed about you and Mr. Epstein, he paid for
a lot in your life.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Your flights, where you

Page 224
stayed with him.  I mean, he didn't expect you to
reimburse him along the way for food and, you know,
so he took care of you for many years.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That is true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  On top of that, he actually
paid you a salary as we talked about $25,000 to
$250,000.  What else did he give you?  Or what
purchase -- like, was there a time when he gave you a
million dollars or $500,000 as a bonus?  Or what --
what financial benefit did you receive from him,
besides what we've already talked about.  We don't
have to talk about what, you know, so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I got it.  I got it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So my goal, always,
was to become independent, independently, financially
secure and work for myself.  I've never been one to
not work.  And in that regard, over the course of my
friendship and my working relationship with Epstein,
I expressed to him my desire to be independent of him
everywhere, just to be freestanding.
           And the -- in -- with that in mind, I
wanted to have my own businesses or my own money
coming in independent and separate from any salary
that I received from him.

Page 225
           And I needed that for my self-esteem.
I've never been -- I mean, obviously salary and it
was a very generous one.  Please, I'm not belittling
the sum of money, because it's huge, but I was
brought up to work and I was brought up to be my own,
you know.
           The first time -- so I would either
propose businesses to him or he would actually
suggest why didn't I do something in the first deal
that we did, or the first business that we had or I
had and that he financed for me.
           So he gave -- he loaned me all the money
to enable me to do this and then I reaped the
profits, which I don't remember now, because we
varied over the deals that we did, that I would give
him 50 percent or 25.
           It was sort of -- it was random.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I can tell you
what it is, so we can compare it.
          TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it was in Palm
Beach actually, and it was in real estate.  And they
sold what was the grounds originally of an estate
called the Phipps Estate.  And then they converted

Page 226
the land that came with that estate into houses.  And
I did, I think, two or maybe -- I can't remember now,
but certainly one and maybe two, possibly three.  I
don't think so.  I think two, that then were flipped
and there was a profit.
           So that would be an example of that.  But
I didn't have the money, so he lent me the funds to
do that business transaction and then I reaped the
profits.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so -- but when --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And that's millions of
dollars.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- when a financial
investigator like, the FBI looks at accounts, they
don't know kind of the conversations you're having.
They just see the money.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So in those cases, when
that happened, when he would -- when he financed that
with you, would he send money to you?  So does that
explain some of the money?  Like, I guess --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe -- I think
it does.  I think, for instance, there were two
Gullwing Mercedes that they did with Mercedes and
Aston Martin.  You can look it up, I think, if I'm

Page 227
right.  That had the doors that would come up like
this --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There were only a very
limited number that were made.  So I knew that we
could get those and flip them right within 24 hours,
for example.
           Also my -- here's another example of
something that you guys wouldn't have known about is
I became a banker.  I got my Series 63, Series 67
banking license and became a broker for like a new
(inaudible).  And then -- because I was day trading.
Everything I had I day traded with -- through an
account.
           And I think I was lucky more than smart,
but I made quite a lot of money doing that.  And so
--
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that?  Like what
-- approximate time --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Again, that's in the
'90s again.  I don't -- oh, wait.  I think -- well,
you can find it, because it'll be my banking license,
right?  That'll be something that you can look up,
probably.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.

Page 228
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So what whatever that
is -- and I just don't remember when that is.  I'm
sorry.
         TODD BLANCHE:  So -- okay.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And so for an example,
I was -- I was doing really, really, really well.
And so he was like, how do you do that?  Well, how
are you -- what are you -- why are you investing in,
I don't know, Apple when nobody liked Apple.  This
is, you know, before Apple or Microsoft.  I didn't
know Bill Gates, so this is not related to him.
           But my family --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Don't charge her with
insider trading.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Please -- no.  I'm not
trying to suggest that.  Oh, goodness.  Please, no.
I had no --
           DAVID MARKUS:  It was just a joke.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  It was a joke.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  No.  All right.
           But my -- going back to my family, my dad
had given me an account when I was 12 and I had
always an interest in business and finance, not --
not very sophisticated.  I'm not suggesting that.

Page 229
           And so I like to trade and so I did and I
did well.  And so then I would tell him what I was
doing.  Now, whether he did or he didn't, he told me
he matched me in some other accounts that he had.
Because he did a lot of -- he -- my observation, to
go back to what he did, I observed him personally and
have recollection -- personal recollection of him
trading this money, lots.  Tens of millions, hundreds
of millions of dollars.
           TODD BLANCHE:  That was -- that he was
trading for other people --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or that was his own
money?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want also to clarify
something for you or clarify or underline.  Wexner
was, in my opinion, his closest friend in this time
period from when I met him in '91, right, all the way
until-- well, 'til, I don't know.
           Because I wasn't that friendly with --
well, I did travel with Mr. Wexner, but Epstein told
me that Wexner didn't want to be seen too much with
me, because of my family problems.  You know, whether
that was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  You mean the problems that

Page 230
your father's company had with --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- embezzlement or
allegations of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Yes.  That's
what I'm talking about.
           And now, actually today -- not
contemporaneously, but today I don't believe that
that's even true.  I think it was used as a means to
not have me travel with him to Ohio or whatever.  It
was just a way to park me.
           And I believe that now, because within the
discovery there was a lot of -- well, not a lot, but
there was some indications that he would actively
tell other people to lie to me or conceal things from
me, and that he never loved me and I wasn't his type.
That's in the discovery somewhere.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- okay.  So the
government had evidence that, even as late as 2007,
he paid you a lot of money.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What was that?  What
was the money?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like several -- millions of
millions of dollars in 2007.  $7.4 million, I think.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What was that for?

Page 231
Was it -- was that the helicopter?
           TODD BLANCHE:  That was -- that's my
question for you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I don't know.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So in 2007 --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think that was
probably the helicopter.  That could have been --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That was what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That could have been
the helicopter, the Sikorsky.  Those big chunks like
that, I don't -- I didn't -- I don't personally have
any memory of receiving a check from him for
$7 million.  I just -- I just don't.  But I would
have to -- I know I -- so the answer to your
question, to be precise --
           DAVID MARKUS:  You would remember if it
went into your pocket --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would remember if it
went -- I would -- he never paid me to -- for
services that you just described, $7 million, to --
for any nefarious reason.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  I think I understand
what you've said about being on the payroll and

Page 232
helping -- him helping you with businesses, and
giving you a lot of life things along the way.  You
travel with him, you ate with him.  He's, you know,
but there is the -- these massive amounts of money,
one-time payments that I --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I don't -- you'd
have to trace that, right?  So I don't believe that
came into my account or I had any control.  I have no
memory of that.  I have no -- no --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, but if there's
records that show it coming into your account, it
sounds like what you're saying is that not -- putting
aside your -- you have no memory of that money being
yours.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like you didn't -- that
money is not somewhere --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I wouldn't be
like, oh, yippee, let me go.  I got $7 million.  I'm
going to go buy myself a yacht.  No.  Or I don't
know, something else or move it to some other -- no.
           I don't think -- I don't think, if you
look -- you'll have to check, obviously you will.  I
don't think you'll find that money moving in any --
to any account, either of mine or it shouldn't show,

Page 233
I don't believe anyway.  As far as I recollect, it
wouldn't show me spending it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that make sense?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Yeah, that makes
sense.  I mean, I think if -- I don't think there's
any dispute by anybody, even your lawyers at trial,
that -- that that the money went in.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, $7 million in
when, what year?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, there's several
years; in 2007.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And?
           TODD BLANCHE:  2002, there was $5 million
that you were paid in 2002.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, well, I'd have
to -- I don't -- I don't remember.  But -- okay.  So
there's -- there would be another large sum, but it
wouldn't have come from him later.  But it had
nothing to do --
           TODD BLANCHE:  The biggest one was in
1999.  There's over $18 million.  $18.3 million.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know what that
is.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So what -- but you --

Page 234
you're -- but what you're saying, it sounds like, and
if you don't know, we're going to -- we can move on.
           But when we're talking about $18.3 million
in '99, $5 million in -- three years later in 2002,
$7.4 million in 2007.  That -- those -- that money
adds up to around $30 million.
           You were not paid that by Mr. Epstein.
Meaning, that's not money you received for your
benefit, even if it was put into your accounts.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't believe any of
that was my money.  Now, I do -- I just -- like I
said, we did do these things --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.  I understand that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  - - with the cars.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I understand that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And as --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if any of
that money, some of it -- if it moves, some of that
may have come from the car or a house that was sold
that I had an interest in with him.  That's possible.
But I don't think this money is mine.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  But also, the record should
reflect, too, that there were times Ghislaine's name
was used, for example, Air Ghislaine.  Her name was

Page 235
in the name of the entity.  It had nothing to do with
her.  And if you pull signatures --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  -- there's no evidence for
that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  My -- what I'm trying
to just make sure I -- that I understand, is that the
idea that you were paid $30 million between '99 and
2007, in order to -- by Mr. Epstein to reward you for
recruiting young women.  That is in your -- you're
saying that is categorically, completely false?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That is categorically
false, correct.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So I want to just --
we went through several individuals yesterday and I
want to go through just a couple of more names and
ask if you -- if you know them.  And if you do know
them, how you know them.
           Do you know Elon Musk?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how did you meet
Mr. Musk?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met him in -- I
don't remember the year, but it's going to be in
2010, '11, something like that, I think, if my memory

Page 236
serves.
           And I was at an event for Sergey Brin, the
co-founder of Google.  And Sergey had arranged for --
it was for his birthday.
           And we were -- or a bunch of us, I don't
even remember how many we were, but not many of us.
           Maybe -- I don't know.  If I say 40, I
could be wrong.  If it was 30 or 50, I don't
remember.  I'm sorry.
           Went to another friend's island.  Somebody
called Mr. Pigozzi in the Caribbean and -- not with
Epstein, he was not there, to celebrate Sergey's
birthday.  And we were there together for, I want to
say, three or four days, something like that in my
memory.  And Mr. Musk was present for that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And that was the first time
you met him, as far as you know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  As far as I remember,
yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you meet -- did you
know his brother, Mr. Musk's brother?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if I've
ever met him.  I know that he has a brother and I
don't think I met him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Aside from that time in --

Page 237
around 2010, on the island in the Caribbean for a
couple days, did you -- have you seen -- do you know
Mr. Musk beyond that time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  We met at -- I was at
the Oscars and we met at the Oscars.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What year was that, earlier
or later?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was post that
event, I believe.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether
Mr. Epstein knew Mr. Musk?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe they did.
And the only reason I say that is not from my memory,
but because I saw -- I think I saw -- my memory is
that in discovery, they were communicating on email.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you have no personal
knowledge of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have no --
           TODD BLANCHE:  It's just what you've --
what you've seen from the press or from discovery?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I believe his
brother as well, actually.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Excuse me?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Mr. Musk's brother as
well.  But I don't -- my -- like I said, my memory is

Page 238
not -- it's not as good as I would like it to be.
And I just want to say that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you -- you mentioned, I
think, yesterday in passing -- well, not in passing,
but as part of another answer, Andrew Cuomo.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you know Mr. Cuomo?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, only because he
was married to Kerry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I think I knew his
brother as well.  What's -- he has a brother, right?
He's on TV.  What's his name?
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Chris.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  Christopher.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Christopher Cuomo.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Chris.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Chris.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You mean the TV -- the
former TV anchor or the TV anchor, Chris Cuomo?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So -- but I would say
just socially, not -- I'm not close friends or
anything, but because we -- I was friends with Kerry

Page 239
and I met him a few times and I certainly met his
brother as well a few times.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the same questions that
I asked about Mr. Musk, do you know whether
Mr. Epstein knew Andrew Cuomo or Chris Cuomo or
Ms. Kennedy, your friend?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so you never -- you
don't recall any of those three individuals, like,
flying on Mr. Epstein's plane --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or visiting him in
Palm Beach or at the island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I think you mentioned
former Secretary of State John Kerry yesterday.  But
if not, do you know Mr. Kerry or no?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have met him, but I
don't know if Mr. Epstein ever met him.  I met him
only -- well, really I can't even probably
characterize that as a meeting, but I was very, very
involved in the Ocean at Work, through the -- you
asked me yesterday about TerraMar.
           And if I recall right, I met Mr. -- the
Secretary that way through the Ocean, but he wouldn't

Page 240
know who I am, I doubt.  I don't think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether --
well, do you know former Senator Ted Kennedy?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And does -- is that through
your own life or through Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My life.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein knew Senator Kennedy?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't believe so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so for the folks we
just talked about, so former Secretary of State John
Kerry, Ted Kennedy, did -- you don't know whether
Mr. Epstein knew them, so I take that to mean you
have no recollection of them flying on his planes--
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh God, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh.  But Bobby Kennedy
knew him.  Bobby, the health --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sorry.  Say that again
about Bobby Kennedy.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Bobby knew
Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because we went on a

Page 241
trip together.  Was -- we went to -- dinosaur bone
hunting in the Dakotas.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that, you know,
approximately?  I'm not looking for an exact date,
but when was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That was early -- that
was in the early -- well, let me back up.  I knew
Bobby's wife, Mary, pretty well, actually.  And
before he met her.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And just to help us, I know
we're talking about a wide span of time, but what are
you -- when are you talking about that you knew
Mr. Kennedy's wife before they were married.
           So when are talking about the --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- in 19 -- all
right.  I guess, let's get my head straight.  In --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, would this have been
before you met Mr. Epstein --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or after?  Okay.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met him before I
met.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So we're talking about the
1980s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Thank

Page 242
you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  The '80s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So we're talking
about the 1980s.  And then --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The -- I was the -- I
had a very, very longstanding boyfriend and he had --
his brother was dating Mary at the time, and we were
all very good friends.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then Mr. Epstein -- did
Mr. Epstein meet Bobby Kennedy through you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't -- I don't
think so, because Mr. Epstein, surprisingly, everyone
says everything happened through me.  That's just not
true.  I mean, I think yesterday I explained that he
had friends from London, and those are very -- they
were what the people would call "fancy."
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  They were fancy
people.  And -- but he had the same types of
relationships before I met him in America.  So when I
met him, he was already, you know, Wexner and he had
Henry and he had -- he was --I don't know if then he
was at the -- in the Council of Foreign Relations,
but he was friends with Ace and, you know, like he

Page 243
was -- he was well established.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He didn't need me.
And he was, you know, his -- Eva was, you know, major
model.  So he had all these modeling connections and
friends in that business, long before I met him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so the trip that you
went on with Mr. Epstein and Bobby Kennedy, was that
in the '90s and 2000s when --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was in
the -- it would've been in the -- I want to say '93,
'94.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So a very long time
ago.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  A very, very long time
ago.
           TODD BLANCHE:  A few years into the --
your relationship -- a few years into the time that
you knew Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  I mean, I don't
want to hold myself to the dates because I really --
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, no.  I'm not holding
you to dates.  I think --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because I really don't
--

Page 244
           TODD BLANCHE:  I've said that a lot,
because I appreciate we're talking about the '80s and
'90s and even the 2000s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I just want you to
know, I haven't had any -- I don't have anything to
review, so I haven't had any ability to -- the short
of my legal material, obviously, which you can -- you
know I have, because I came with a box worth, but
short of that, I have nothing with which to
refresh -- or very limited stuff, I should say, I
don't want to say nothing -- to refresh my mind.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I understand that.  Do you
have any recollection of Mr. Kennedy -- of there
being anything inappropriate with Mr. Kennedy and
masseuses or young women on the trip you just talked
about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw anything
inappropriate with Mr. Kennedy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether he
ever got a massage from one of the masseuses?  Do you
know either way?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But not something you
remember?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, absolutely

Page 245
not.
           I mean, he -- well, I mean, yesterday, if
I didn't make it clear, I will reiterate it.  I
never, ever saw any man doing something inappropriate
with a woman of any age.  I never saw inappropriate
habits.
           Now, I'm not -- I'm not going to say hands
or -- I mean, that to me is not inappropriate.  Now,
somebody's inappropriate and mine may be different,
but --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- we're not talking
about anything that's -- resembles the accusations
that we've discussed here.  So that would be an -- a
flat no to any man.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did your or Mr. Epstein's
relationship with Mr. -- with Bobby Kennedy continue
into the 2000s, as far as you know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would say yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Um --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, mine, yes.  I
don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Your's -- with you.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  With me, for sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether

Page 246
Mr. Epstein and Mr. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, continued
to have relationships into the 2000s?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have no personal
knowledge of that.  I mean, I would -- because --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, no personal knowledge
is fine.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Another thing is that
everyone puts us together like a monolith.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He literally had a
separate life from me.  I literally had a separate
life from him.  Now, did they say?  Well, of course
they did.  I'm not-- that's -- I'm not crazy.
           But he kept a lot to himself and he didn't
like to share.  He was not a sharer.  Well, at least
not with me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Mr. Epstein didn't share,
you're saying?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not with me, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- do you know
somebody named Cheryl Mills?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Used to work in the White
House as a lawyer?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, I do.  Yes.

Page 247
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know Ms. Mills?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met Ms. Mills
through President Clinton.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember a --
generally, the timeframe that you -- you met her?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do, actually.  Hang
on.  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to remember -- I'm
trying to get my dates right.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Approximately.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, okay.  I can't
get my dates right.  But it's something you probably
can -- going to be in the early 2000s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So what I don't
recall --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say 2002.
I'm going to say 2002, 2003.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So it was after President
Clinton left office?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so it was in the 2000s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Definitely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how -- what -- how did
you meet her?  What were the circumstances under

Page 248
which you met Ms. Mills?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I went on a trip with
the President to South America.
           TODD BLANCHE:  With which president?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry.
President Clinton.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  Just, you
know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- just wanted -- it was --
I just wanted to make sure it was clear.
           Okay.  So you went on a trip to -- to
where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Latin America.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And who -- and so Ms. Mills
was on that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And President Clinton was
on that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who else was on that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Doug Band.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who worked with President
Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.

Page 249
           TODD BLANCHE:  And was Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what was the purpose of
that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, the President
had -- I don't know.  I mean, I -- the President met
with -- I can't even remember every -- all the, I
know, presidents and we were in --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was this part of President
Clinton's work after he left office with the -- with
his foundation?  Or was -- meaning what --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think the
foundation, when did the --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- was it something for him
or was it --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  When did the -- I
don't remember when the Clinton Global Initiative
started.
           So if you date me -- if you give me that
date, I can tell you if it was pre or post.  Because
without that, I can't pin the reason.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Do you remember what it was
for or not?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I don't recall.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.

Page 250
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, that's -- don't over
think or under think the reason for my questions.
           I don't -- I don't have any idea why you
went on that trip, so I don't know an answer that I'm
getting from you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I'm just trying to
be as accurate as possible and give you the
information that you seek.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why would you -- do you
remember why you were invited to go?  Like were you
-- were you friends with somebody?  What was your
role going on that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I didn't have a role.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So do you remember why --
do you remember who invited you to go?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  If -- probably
Doug Band.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how did you know Doug?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because Doug and --
again, back with Philip Levine.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Got it.  And do you know
whether he had a relationship with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Who?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Doug.

Page 251
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I don't know.  I
mean, nothing.  He -- I don't believe there was any
relationship, other than I helped -- well, without
me, I don't think there would've been those flights,
because I was the one who asked Epstein to provide
the plane for -- well, certainly I remember the one
to Africa, of course, that big trip.
           And I thought it was an honor and a
privilege to be part of something so amazing and to
have an opportunity to spend time with a man that I
found truly extraordinary.
           And please, I don't mean it in any other
way, other than as a former fantastic ex-president.
I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I was asking around the
question, but I'll just ask it:  like, were you
basically asked to go because you were kind of
responsible for the plane?
           Responsible is the wrong word.  They use
you -- they were able to use you to make sure that
they could -- you helped them get Mr. Epstein's plane
for the trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I don't even know
if when I was on that -- in fact, I think -- I think,
that trip, I'm not even sure that Epstein had met the

Page 252
President.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think this is -- but
if I'm right, and I think I am, I think that trip
happened when Epstein and Clinton had never even --
not that they'd never met, because Epstein had gone
to the White House, but they had not met.
           I'd never asked Epstein for the plane then
because they'd never met and it would be weird.  But
they met because of me and the plane was because of
me.  But that trip was the first, I think, the first
trip I took with the ex-president.  And I don't
believe Epstein and he had met.
           And we're talking a time period when I was
trying to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- leave.  Not very
successfully obviously, but I was branching out on my
own and being more independent of Mr. Epstein and
trying to -- all kinds of businesses that I was into.
           I was trying to start the first telehealth
medicine with the Cleveland Clinic.  I mean, I'm not
going to bore you, because I don't think that's what
you guys are interested in, but those were the sorts
of things that I was looking for him to finance, so

Page 253
that I could stop being, you know, a general manager
of a hotel.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- so did you take
other trips with some or all of those individuals,
kind of without Mr. Epstein in later years?  Like,
you said that was the first time that you had kind of
been on something like that and it was an honor and
you were spending time with former President Clinton
and others.
           Were there other -- over the years, did
you do that more than once?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We'll talk about those.
Like multiple times, like too many to count or there
three or four times.  Like how many times?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  A lot.  A lot.  I went
on a lot of trips.  Now I don't recall all of them.
Not because I'm trying to be evasive or anything, but
I just don't remember them all.
           And after a while, you know, in the
incredible job that you have, all of you, that when
you're so high pressured and you're spending so much
time with extraordinary people like you do with
President Trump, it -- it can blur.  It just does.
           And those few things that stand out,

Page 254
because at the end it's all just extraordinary as
cars and sirens and president.  It's like, whoa,
okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So, I understand, but
talk -- so don't give me spec- --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I understand you can't
give specific numbers.  What -- describe more about
kind of your, that part of your life and your
relationship.  I'm using "relationship."  You don't
like relationships.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right, right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And your -- sorry.  And
your --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My employer.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.  Just describe your --
what you were doing with those individuals.  So when
I say "those individuals," I'm talking about former
President Clinton, Doug, other folks that worked with
him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All of them.  Yes.
There were loads of them.  And just all of them, you
know the team, I don't need to give you all the
names.  You have them at your fingertips and I can
confirm.  If you give me names, I'll say yes, because

Page 255
they're not all going to pop into my head, so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So I started
spending a lot of time.  I don't want to characterize
that, but I started spending time with the former
President and with Doug and his team.
           And then it -- I had no purpose, really,
other than I had -- I obviously offered something, I
don't know, ideas of -- I don't know.
           Anyway.  And he started to travel.  I
don't remember if the first trip was Africa or how it
went, but at some point, I think there was actually
two trips, but I'm not sure.  So there was to Europe
and then to Africa, I think maybe it was all one
trip.
           And at some point, Mr. Epstein said he
didn't want to go on the trip and he was going
somewhere else and he just left.  And I was like,
well, okay.  And so I ended up doing the whole trip
without Mr. Epstein or his plane.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when you were traveling
with them, what were the purposes of the trips?  Like
is this one --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think these were
all -- I think actually it was the AIDS, was one of

Page 256
the primary ones, for his AIDS Foundation, when he
was working to do that.  And there were always a
humanitarian side to the trips.
           And we went to Egypt and to, there was --
oh, yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So there -- so it sounds
like you're describing one -- right now, one trip
with lots of stops.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It could be, but I
have a feeling that I went on other trips, but I
can't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you -- when you went
on these --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I went to London.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Went to London.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if that's
the same trip.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you went on these
trips, that -- were you always on Mr. Epstein's
plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- Or did you sometimes
accompany them on a different plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How many were on

Page 257
Mr. Epstein's plane?  Again, I'm not holding you to
exact, but --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That was a full, that
was packed.  Because it was a lot of secret service.
It took all the Secret Service as well.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it was whatever the
detail is for Secret Service, it's a lot.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And on how many occasions,
besides the trip you just described, were there other
times when they used -- when President Clinton and
the folks he was with, used Mr. Epstein's plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was --
there was twice, maybe.  There was that.  But it will
reflect on the logs.  There won't be anything that's
not on the logs that you have already.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Were you, by the way,
responsible for the logs in any way?  Like, you've
seen the logs and they're public and you have them in
discovery.
           But over the years when you were working
with or for Mr. Epstein, did you have access to the
logs?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was, not.  No,
never.  The pilots -- the logbook was their personal

Page 258
logbook.
           I never even saw them have it.  I never
saw them fill it in.  And then there was a second set
of logs, the -- the flight manifests.  And I never
saw those either.  I was never -- I was never
allowed, I suppose.  Because he didn't want me to
see.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- so do you
know whether Mr. Epstein had a separate relationship
with -- with President Clinton, different from the
what you just described?  So different than being
with him, with respect to his foundation or something
like this?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would say no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When's the last time that
you went on a trip or saw President Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was in -- was late
2000 and, I don't know, '16, '17, '18, something
in -- it was in Los Angeles.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what was the purpose of
that meeting?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think he was hosting
something or he was at an event and I was in L.A. and
I had dinner with him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Had -- did you ever meet

Page 259
Secretary Clinton, Hillary Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When did you meet her?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say --
again, please don't hold me to it, but I want to say
that it was on a flight that came from the island
from -- not from the island, from the Nantucket or --
or Martha's Vineyard back to New York, is what I
think.  I might be wrong.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So some -- an East
Coast island, like Nantucket --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- Or something like this?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  No, -- the
Clint- -- the ex-president never came to the island.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did you -- is that the
only time that you met Hillary Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I went to the
house in Chappaqua a few times.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And why did you go to the
house?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was invited.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Just to see
President Clinton or Hillary Clinton or both or --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, I mean, as a

Page 260
friend, not for -- I don't -- there was no -- I don't
remember any reason, either was somehow I
communicated that was in coming, driving back past
Chappaqua or if they were home and stop in.
           And it's -- I know it sounds a little
flippant, but it could -- it could have even
something as --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether
Mr. Epstein had -- knew or had any sort of visit
dealings or -- associated with Hillary Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would say no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did you ever see
them together?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- do you know whether
Mr. Epstein ever did any business transactions with
the Clintons?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would -- well, I'm
not sure I can.  I'm not sure how to quite -- I don't
know the answer to that strictly, because, I was -- I
was part of the beginning process of the Clinton
Global Initiative.
           And that was something that I helped with
and that was me, and Epstein may have helped me help
them.  And in that context, he may well have involved

Page 261
himself, but only in the context of something that I
was trying to do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when you say "involved
himself," meaning like, give money to the Clinton
Global Initiative or something like this?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, so there's that.
I think he did do that.  And that, I believe, the
money that he may have given could have been
independent of me.  But I think it's just easier if I
just tell you how it happened, rather than --
otherwise it sounds all odd and funky.  I went to
Davos with a former president and I -- have you been
to Davos?
           TODD BLANCHE:  In what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Have you been to
Davos?
           TODD BLANCHE:  I have not.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Well, you know,
it's a -- you know what it is, right?  Okay.  So --
and I was -- I thought the former president should
have his own Davos, because it would be -- and they
had -- it turned out, that they had been thinking
about it anyway.
           And so we were talking about it and, you
know, it's a very heavy lift to get something like

Page 262
that to go.  And I was friendly with one of the
people who had -- I don't know if he was at the
beginning of Davos or -- but he was running Davos.
           It was just -- I don't know, hard to
describe his actual role at Davos and had
conversations with him about what did he think, you
know?  Oh, just because I was having dinner with him
about if Clinton could get something like that to go,
what was his thoughts?
           And he was very, very enthusiastic.  I
mean, he was like, that's just an incredible idea.
So I put them together.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who -- what's that person's
name?  Do you remember?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I knew you were going
to ask me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can -- I can --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Just -- you said -- I
didn't know if you knew his -- if you remember his
name.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do know.  I do, but
I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Can't remember his name.
Okay.

Page 263
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It will come to me.
It may come to me tomorrow, but eventually these
things, like, surface from -- like in the middle of
the night, I was scribbling names --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- that I couldn't
remember from yesterday.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But his name will come
to me, and if not, we can find it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So you -- when
the -- just still stay -- staying on your
relationship with -- sorry, the -- your association
with the Clintons.
           You were part of the ramp up or the
startup of the Clinton Global Initiative --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- and helping them in
supporting that effort.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I would say very
central to that, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And Mr. Epstein, was he
part of the work around that or just in support of
you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He supported me to

Page 264
help them, but then I think he may have tried to use
that to insert himself in some way, that would not
have surprised me at all.
           And I know that he was annoying, in terms
that I could catch him on the phone and he wouldn't
always agree with what I wanted to do.  And I was
like, it's not your idea.  I don't really care what
you think, but that didn't go over so well.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, I just want to
say, it wasn't my idea for his CGI.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Wasn't your -- say it
again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It's not my idea.
They had had that idea before.  I just helped bring
key personnel to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  You're saying the idea of
President Clinton kind of having his own Davos
like --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not -- I'm not
owning.  I didn't -- that's not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understood.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't want anyone --
I don't try to elevate myself in any form of
importance here.

Page 265
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, I understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you go to Davos with
President Clinton more than once or just once?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can't remember.
Once for sure.  And I think maybe twice, but I don't
remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- and you're not, I
think you said, you don't -- you're not aware of
President Clinton ever going to the island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He never.  Absolutely
never went.  And I can be sure of that because
there's no way he would've gone -- I don't believe
there's any way that he would've gone to the island,
had I not been there.  Because I don't believe he had
an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein.
           Did they speak?  Did he go?  Yes, but
that's very different from going to spend time on an
island.
           And plus, the story as told is so patently
absurd that I flew him in the helicopter.  I am a
helicopter pilot, that is true.  But the notion of me
flying an ex-president in a machine.  That would
terrify me.  I would never even take that
responsibility.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, no.  I'm not

Page 266
-- I'm -- no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did you ever go with
President Clinton to any of Epstein -- Mr. Epstein's
properties?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so like New Mexico,
Palm Beach, or in New York?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have no memory of
him in any of those places.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you were in London
with President Clinton, did you -- did you ever go to
your -- to your flat with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think he did.
I don't -- I don't think so, because this, like, it's
like -- he wouldn't even -- he wouldn't even be able
to carry all his Secret Service with him.  I don't
think so, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Do you know -- we
talked a little about the Duchess of York, about
Sarah Ferguson yesterday.
           Did -- when's the -- when the last time
you, like -- when's the last time you, you saw her?
Like, were you -- were you -- do you have a -- were
you with her or hang out with her, socializing with
her, in the '90s, 2000s?  Both?

Page 267
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She's -- well, I had
a -- I don't know if she liked me very much.  I think
my friendship with her ex-husband -- well, sometimes
she really did like me and sometimes she didn't.  So
maybe a frenemy, I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- it was always
friendly when we were together, but I think that
there was some latent hostility.  And I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Is that something you've
heard since everything came out or along the way you
felt that way?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, that's how I felt.
That -- that is a characterization of myself.  That's
how I felt about her.  I would never -- I was always
friendly with her.  I mean, she's -- I mean, I've
seen her many, many times and she's also super, super
close with other people I'm very good friends with in
England.  I think that -- I think that she liked
Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you think that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My female intuition.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Discovery.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh.

Page 268
           LEAH SUFFIAN:  The letter.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't remember it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  It's okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I don't -- it's
possible that there's things -- well, I know -- it's
not possible.  I know that there is discovery, but I
don't recall.  But I think she had a thing for him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- there's some actors
or some folks from Hollywood that I want to ask you
about, just to understand whether you knew them or
Mr. Epstein knew them.  Chris Tucker?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How did you know
Mr. Tucker?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think only from that
flight to Africa.  But I do think that they met --
           TODD BLANCHE:  You say that flight to
Africa, the one we were just talking about with --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- President Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sorry, go ahead.  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But I also think that
they kept a little bit in touch and I think we met,
or I have a memory of him maybe in L.A., I don't

Page 269
know.  I think they sort of loosely stayed in touch.
I wouldn't -- I don't think it -- I don't know.  I
don't know how to say that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know Mr. Tucker
besides that flight?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether --
when you say you think that they kept in touch, you
mean you think that Mr. Epstein and Mr. Tucker --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  They may have.  I
didn't, but he might have.  I'm not sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Kevin Spacey?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I know him also from
that same flight.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Aside from that flight, do
you know him from any other thing?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Naomi Campbell?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, I do know Naomi,
and I knew her before I met Mr. Epstein and Mr. --
former President Clinton.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein separately knew Ms. Campbell?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think she -- he
probably met her through me, that I imagine.

Page 270
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so for those three,
Mr. Tucker, Mr. Spacey, and Ms. Campbell, did they
ever travel to any of Mr. Epstein's properties; the
island or New Mexico?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not Mr. Tucker --
well, not to my knowledge Mr. Tucker or Mr. Spacey.
           Naomi Campbell may have.
           TODD BLANCHE:  To where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She may have gone --
well, she certainly -- well, I believe she visited
him in Palm Beach, and I believe she may have gone to
the island and she may have gone to see his house in
New York.  Whether she went to New Mexico or Paris as
well, maybe.  They were friends or friendly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Were you -- what you just
said "she may have," were you on those trips?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't have any
independent memory of that, so I'm not sure.  I don't
think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Her relationship, her
friendship, her -- I think you're making me use your
word.  Her -- her friendship, whatever, with
Mr. Epstein was independent of me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  But you also had a

Page 271
separate friendship with her before you met
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Larry Summers, the
former Secretary of the Treasury.
           Do you know that person?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met Mr. Summers
through Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the same question, just
generally time period, are you talking about early
2000s, '90s, a little after that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I honestly really
don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did want to say
something.  I forgot that there was -- yesterday.
You asked me about Mr. Epstein's properties.  He had
a rental in Boston as well, but it -- not for very
long, but it was another place that I had to put
together.  And I only went with him once and he would
go there independently of me.  No, I would not go
with him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was that in the '90s?

Page 272
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Mr. Summers, do you know
why -- do you know what his relationship was with
Mr. Epstein; business, personal, both, or don't you
know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think he spoke to
Mr. Epstein about business a lot, but I think they
were friends.  They were friendly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Summers ever traveled on Mr. Epstein's planes to
any of the properties that Mr. Epstein owned?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He may have, but I
don't think, if he did, I was on any of the flights.
I mean, those are another issues.  I mean, I went --
I traveled so, so much that I really -- the flights
just blur.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I understand.
           George Soros?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think he knew
him.  I did, but I don't think he did.  I don't
think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How did you know Mr. Soros?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was friends with his
kids.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- which kids?

Page 273
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Jon and -- I can't
think of his other child.  I can't think of -- I
mean, I've lost his name.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Alexander.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Who?
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Alexander.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met him, but just
socially.  He may not remember even having met me.  I
was excited to meet him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When are you thinking --
when would you have met him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  If I met him it -- I
think it was either at an event or at his kids -- it
wouldn't have been at his house.  An event, I
think -- or I think actually, no, in the Hamptons I
met him.  He was staying at somebody's house.  If --
if my memory serves.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what was your
relationship?  How did you know his kids?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was out and about in
New York a lot.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So just socially?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Just socially, yes.
And -- yeah, just socially, I think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- do you know

Page 274
whether Mr. Soros or his kids ever traveled on
Mr. Epstein's planes?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Ever visit either the
island or New Mexico or --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I don't think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Paris?  No?
           Okay.  So I -- we tried to -- to identify
names that have come up, either publicly or in -- in
other lawsuits.  Are there any names that you -- that
come to mind that we haven't, we've talked about a
lot of names.  A lot of names.
           Are there some folks that you think we've
forgotten to ask you about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, you asked me
about names and I have some names, and I just want to
give you some context for the names as well.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So we talked about
Elizabeth Johnson yesterday.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She had a boyfriend
and he was Frederic Fekkai, the hairdresser.  And he
and Epstein were friendly, very friendly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then what time period

Page 275
are you talking about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like '90s, or 2000s, or
both?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think the 2000s,
actually, for that.  You can date that because it was
from when he -- I think he probably knew Frederic
before he dated Elizabeth.  But --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when you say they were
very friendly, did they go -- did they travel
together?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if they
traveled together, I mean, Epstein didn't go out very
much or -- I mean, he did go out, but not -- and
sometimes if he did, I think he would go out and
maybe see Fred- -- Frederic.
           And then there was -- I mean, he had a
bunch of guys that he would -- I would know that he
would see or meet, but he really -- I guess now -- so
he had new friends.  I -- I don't know, but --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  What other names?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay, so Henry
Jarecki, who had an island near his.  Henry was a
financier who was the guy who cornered the silver
market back in the day.

Page 276
           TODD BLANCHE:  He had an island in the
Caribbean -- in the Caribbean near Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  In the British
Virgin Islands.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And there was
Branson's island there.  Now I know that there's an
allegation that they met.  I -- I think -- I think I
remember that I went to Richard Branson's island with
Mr. Epstein, and maybe he went another time, but I
don't -- I wouldn't characterize Richard Branson and
him as friends, but he did go and I think I went with
him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Branson ever came to Mr. Epstein's island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  If he did, I was not
there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So -- but it's
possible, so --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understood.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I wanted to ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Marvin Minsky.  He had
a group of scientists that he was very, very friendly

Page 277
with, all centered around Harvard.  So I remember
him.
           Martin Nowak, who's a mathematician.
Stephen Jay Gould.  I don't know if Stephen Jay Gould
was -- came through the Harvard angle, but I know
that there was a -- he would -- excuse me, Epstein
would have dinners at the house that I was tasked to
organize and the scientists were a very major
component of that.
           They weren't social dinners as much as
they were scientific.  He would discuss whatever he
would discuss.  But if you were in the area of brain
cognition or -- he would invite them to the house and
they would come, all of them.  All -- any name you
can name, they would be there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So let's talk about that
top -- that relation -- those -- those associations
or relationships he had with the mathematicians or --
and with Harvard, and I think with MIT, to some
extent as well.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Official
(indiscernible) MIT too, yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- from what you
observed, what's the reason behind him having --
developing those ties with Harvard, with MIT, and

Page 278
with certain professors and others associated with
those institutions?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He really was
profoundly interested in that area of science and in
the brain, and in -- I mean, if you were in --
Stephen Jay Gould or the major scientist on
happiness, I mean, it -- it came, I believe, from a
genuine area of interest, not from anything ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how did he -- how did
he become friends with them?  How -- how was he able
to spend time with them?  Meaning, did he donate to
the university and then they were kind of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Certain --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- it was mandatory fun for
them or did he have relations with them where he
would, you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know the
chicken --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- host them or --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't if the chicken
or the egg came first.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But -- but when I met
him first, I mean, he was already doing a lot of this
stuff.  This is not -- I -- I've read, so this is why

Page 279
I'm saying this.  I was not responsible for these --
for this area of interest.  I mean, I certainly --
sorry, just to bounce a second before it slips my
mind and I leave something out.
           There was an institute in New Mexico
called -- anyone?  The institute of -- it's very
famous.  We're not talking to the Alamos.
           Anyway, all right.  There's a very famous
institute in New Mexico, so you can look it up.
You'll -- it'll come to you at the minute you put it
in your computer.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And there had some of
the biggest brains ever.  Those -- that relationship
came through me, so I -- that's me.  And that is
because my father was -- one of the major scientific
hit up my family fortune, when I had one, came from
scientific publishing.
           And when it started from the thing that
you were asking me yesterday, my father was in the
Second World War, I told you, and he won the military
cross, and then he actually did become what was part
of intelligence back in the war.  And his job was to
interrogate German scientists and prisoners of war.
           And then that parleyed into business with

Page 280
Springer-Verlag and then into Pergamon Press, which
was the scientific journals business.  And he had an
interest -- he believed that it's -- knowledge is
what would prevent war.
           And the biggest scientific discoveries --
well, not all of them, but many of them are coming
from the Eastern block and that's how we have the
relationship with Santa Fe Institute.
           And Murray Gell-Mann, specifically.  And I
introduced Epstein to Murray Gell-Mann.  Sorry, to go
off on a tangent.
           TODD BLANCHE:  This is at the Santa Fe
Institute?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, thank you.  And
Murray Gell-Mann was there, and Murray Gell-Mann and
Epstein got along very, very well.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And he was the man of
the (unintelligible).  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So do you know whether --
so while you -- when you meet Mr. Epstein in the
early '90s continuing on, so not what he had done
before, did he -- why do you think, from what you saw
or what you heard, he had the relationship or wanted
to have the relationships that he had with Harvard

Page 281
and with -- and with MIT?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I think that that
may have come with Wexner.  I'm not sure, but that's
something that I think that Wexner maybe had a
relationship with Harvard, and that he used that
relationship to, I believe, he funded a lot.
           And if he didn't, that his clients of
which Wexner obviously was one, would fund.  And he
would -- he would then make -- he would arrange the
fund or --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- organize the fund,
or I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I'm going to take -- we'll
take a break in a -- in a minute, but just to kind of
set us up for what we're going to talk about next.
           Mr. Ep- -- we talked yesterday morning
about Mr. Epstein's kind of business and how he had
money.  Did he seem to live beyond his means, as far
as what he was making?
           So did you ever get the sense while you
were with him, that it was suspicious or curious how
he was able to have the funds to, you know, buy, you
know, two planes, you know, an island, and
New Mexico, you know, the ranch, almost -- almost

Page 282
unlimited funds?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  You said it perfectly.
I thought it was astonishing, but I didn't have any
reason to believe that it came from anything
nefarious.
           I saw him work.  I never saw him really do
anything, other than be on the phone, there's that,
and he had a lot of meetings, but he had a lot of
accounts.
           And he dealt with pretty much every
financier that you could care to mention.  And if I
could have access to the names, I'd be able to tell
you which ones you -- I just don't remember them all.
           But in every bank, Goldman, Lehman, all of
them, to my mind anyway.  And most of the major
businessmen at that time, he was in the Council of
Foreign Relations, so you had access.  That's an
extraordinary list of people.  It just is.
           And then he -- you asked me about his, but
I -- so I thought about it last night, how to try and
explain what it was and I think the best thing is to
focus only on Wexner's business.
           So I was present for some of their
meetings in some of their business, and I listened.
And so things that I personally recollect, and I know

Page 283
I heard, was that he would -- when I told you
yesterday, I think, that he would, no detail was too
small, so he would do the contracts with the staff, I
think, and I saw that myself.
           And he also organized all the trusts for
all the children, so if Wexner had kids -- and
Wexner -- I don't know if he did, he did have
children.  So every time there was a child, he would
create a trust for that child.
           And I don't -- these were complex
financial structures that would contain stocks of the
various businesses.  He restructured, when I was
there, Wexner's business in its entirety, as I
recollect.
           And then not only that, but there were
business interests, so Wexner owned or build, or
designed, or I don't quite know how to characterize
it, but New Albany, which is a center outside of
Ohio, Columbus, Ohio, specifically.
           And he built -- I remember this
conversation, he built himself a very large house,
like truly enormous and it's one of the biggest
private homes I've ever been to.
           And he built all the houses around him,
and I'm like, this is so random, why would you do

Page 284
that?  And he said to me, well, because I want to
make sure that the people around me are my friends --
I want my friends around me and my neighbors.  And I
was like, well, whatever.  Okay, you know.  I've been
around enormous wealth my whole life, and I've like
-- at some point I just say, okay, whatever.  I get
it, and I don't.  And so that's what he did.
           But Epstein ran New Albany, which included
a country club and a golf club and a -- I mean, gosh,
your boss is one of the all-time great, you know,
businessmen in this area.  You know what that is.
And he certainly does.
           So there'd be that, and there was a
business business that Epstein -- well, he told me he
owned it, but of course, I can't say that for sure,
because I don't know, but it's a sports thing.
Riddell, is that a business?  Riddell's?  I thought
about it last night.  It's red and had hats, helmets.
Riddell's?
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Riddell.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Riddell.  Yeah,
Riddell's.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Now, how he owned
that -- well, he told me he owned it, but how he

Page 285
owned that, I -- but that was before I think I came
in and he had it, or he said he did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Got it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And he had other
businesses.  He had -- I know this notion that he did
nothing and he just was a grifter and whatnot.
           Okay.  I'm not going to say that's not
true, but it's not what I saw and it's not what I
believe is true.  Not because it couldn't have been
that he didn't grift or whatever the word is off --
off people, but I saw where I thought looked like
real work.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, why don't we take
a -- take a break.  Okay.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yeah.  Thank you.
           SPENCER HORN:  All right.  The time is now
10:35 and we'll take a break.
           (Off the record at 10:35 a.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  We are resuming from break.
The time is 10:49 on Friday, July 25th.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  All right.  So we've
talked around this issue, but -- talked about it a
little bit.  I want to spend the next hour or so or
however long it takes.
           When you -- when we -- I want to talk,

Page 286
focus kind of exclusively on Epstein and like his
criminal conduct with respect to women.
           Do you -- you said yesterday a couple
times that, like, you now kind of recognize or think
that there was things that he did that you didn't
know about, and that he kept from you or that you
didn't see.
           What did you see?  So you said yesterday,
and I'm not -- I'm not trying to put words in your
mouth, but at some point he was getting massages
seven days a week, sometimes multiple massages a day.
Women have said that -- that were there -- that say
they were there giving him massages, said that those
included some sort of sexual conduct, however, you
define that in the broadest sense, not just a
traditional massage, regularly.
           So what do you -- what did you see and
hear at the time?  And then I think, aside from what
you saw and heard at the time, now that you've been
through what you've been through and heard people say
what they've said, and read what they read, what do
you -- where does that leave you in your mind with
what happened?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So I saw
Epstein with women.  I mean, what I mean by that is

Page 287
he would have women around him, or women on the
plane, or women in his house, or -- that's how I'm
explaining that.
           Those women were very interested.  What --
my characterization of the interest -- the
relationships between all women that I saw with him
and him, was characterized by -- excuse me, their
interest in him as I would see it.
           And by that, I mean, I never saw anybody
who didn't want to be with him and be with him, maybe
socially or whatever.  I never saw anybody, not under
any form of duress in any type of situation where
they were, as I would characterize it, looking
uncomfortable or in any way distressed.
           In the entire time I was with him or
traveled with him, I never saw that.  So any time I
saw anybody with him, they were happy to be with him.
He would ask people all the time, whoever you were,
to massage his feet.
           It just was -- he'd be sitting there, and
he'd have somebody massage his feet, or squeeze his
shoulders, or -- I saw that a lot.  It was an
ubiquitous interaction, if you will.
           So I did see that.  I saw physicality, but
not anything that was -- I don't know how to

Page 288
characterize it, anything that looked aggressive, I
suppose, to define that.  So I never saw an
aggressive move.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw anything
that was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Non-consensual.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.  Okay.  I
never saw anything that was non-consensual.  So if
he -- well, maybe they didn't -- I never saw anything
that looked like they didn't like the hug, or I never
saw what I would characterize as anything that was
unconsensual.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you see -- did you see
him either receiving or participating in sexual
conduct during massages?  Understanding you never saw
something nonconsensual.
           Did you see him engage in sexual conduct
during massages?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, you could define
sexual conduct as in, I did see women who could have
been, you know, less than normally clad for massage,
but especially on the island where they would be in a
bikini or possibly even topless, yeah, I did see
that.  So you would --

Page 289
           TODD BLANCHE:  But what about in -- so --
yes, I agree, that's one area.  Like -- so women who
were either not clothed or topless with just a bottom
on.  But beyond that, did you see as part of that him
touching them?
           And again, I'm not talking about consent
or not consent or age or -- you know, I'm saying like
there's multiple, multiple, you know, dozens and
dozens of women who have said that they were -- that
they engaged in sexual contact.  And I agree, there's
a broad range of what that can -- how that can be
defined, but defining it in the broadest of terms.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So him being physical
with women?  I did see that, but nothing that was not
consensual.  And to address the issue of the large
number of women who today say that he was
non-consensual coercive with them.  I'm not sure.
I -- in my mind I sort of have to characterize the
two distinct areas.  There's one where is the women
who are not of age.  Therefore, anything with them is
immediately unconsensual.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Correct, yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So let's start -- I
want to define anyone who's underage versus anybody
who's over age, because I do think that there's a

Page 290
very significant differential between the two.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So does the law.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Okay.  So --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't mean that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, no.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not trying to be
smart.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I agree with you.  Yes, I
agree with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So I want to
deal with the thing, which is really why we're here.
I mean, not that I'm not going to deal with the
other, but I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- want to make a
distinction with underage situation, because there's
nothing about that that's right.
           I never saw anything with anybody who was
certainly to be categorical in my -- from my trial.
           Let's deal with that, because that's
something that I can say in -- I never saw that with
them at all.  And I would say that as -- as
described, anyway, in my trial did not happen as
described.

Page 291
           I'm not saying that Mr. Epstein did not do
those things.  I'm not casting those -- I'm not going
to say -- I don't feel comfortable saying that today,
given what I now know to be true.  So I am not here
to defend him.
           But what I can say is that I did not
participate in that activity.  And --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So let's divide this into
two areas.  Maybe there's more, but we'll start with
two areas.  One is there was testimony and there's
certainly been depositions and public statements,
that some of these young women had conversations with
you about their age.
           So, for example, conversations about the
fact that they were in high school or conversations
about the fact that they wanted to go to college one
day, which would necessarily mean -- well, not
necessarily, but would be more likely to mean that
they were in high school when they talked to you
about that.
           And so, were there times -- were there
women that you knew were underage?  And I say that
because that's different than whether they were
sexually abused in any way by Mr. Epstein, just
merely their age and going to give him a massage?

Page 292
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I never knew that
and I can categorically state that had any child said
to me that they were 14, 15, 16, maybe not 17,
because 17 in England, I mean, if someone had said
they were 17, I don't -- but I've read so much that
that did happen.
           I mean, I just -- I had no -- I would
never have permitted such a thing, I would not -- I
don't even know what I would have done.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So some of the -- I think
even someone who testified at trial, but certainly
have publicly talked about, was as young as 14 when
she was introduced to Mr. Epstein.
           In -- in your mind today, you don't -- you
kind of reject that that happened, that you saw that,
meaning you don't recall any obviously under 18 woman
coming to give him a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I believe you're
talking about Jane, and I'm --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- very happy to
address that.  I actually don't think that the
testimony is correct.  I don't believe --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, look, I don't --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  No, no, I'm

Page 293
not -- I just wanted to tell you how --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, yeah, I don't want to
get into --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, no, no, I'm not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- he said, she said.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- no, no.  Absolutely
not.  I'm not -- I don't want to go there either.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not going to do
that.  But I believe that what took place, with a lot
of these people, is that there was a slide, right?
           So there was a zone and I -- he did meet
her and I did meet her, and I knew that she was a
young child and I knew that she was not an adult,
because -- but I don't believe he met her 'til she
was 16.
           So I'm not -- I'm not doing a he said, she
said, I'm not doing that, because nobody will.
That's not what we're here for.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But he didn't meet her
'til she was 16, and the entire testimony of the 14,
15, and 16-year-old is, therefore, not accurate.
           Did I meet her when she was 16 with her
mother?  I absolutely did.  And did I know that she

Page 294
was young?  I absolutely did.
           But everything that took place that was
alleged at trial at the 14, and 15, and 16, is not
accurate.  And -- I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  There's testimony or
there's -- and again, I'm using testimony in the
broadest sense.  Some of this is just public
statements or something that's come out in civil
lawsuits about you and Mr. Epstein giving, like an
-- you're turning 18 birthday card to somebody,
which again, if true would, by definition mean you
knew that she was under 18.
           Do you recall doing that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not.  I mean, no
memory of that at all.  And I believe that would be
the person that called herself Kate has now announced
herself in her own podcast for who she really is.
           Her name is 
.  So I did not meet
 until actually, she was either 20 or 21.  So
it would be very hard for me to have given her an 18
birthday card.  And the testimony -- there's also --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you accept --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- that slid back.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- do you accept that at
some point, and we talked about this yesterday about
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDACTION

Page 295
how Mr. Epstein changed, but at some point,
Mr. Epstein definitely preferred younger women?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I accept.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I think you said
yesterday, but say it again since we're talking about
it.  Is that something that you, in your mind, one of
the areas where he changed from when you first met
him until later?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I -- when -- I just
also want it to be clear, I never understood that
change to encompass children.  I did see from when I
met him, he was involved or -- involved or friends
with or whatever, however you want to characterize
it, with women who were in their 20s.  And then the
slide to, you know, 18 or younger looking women.  But
I never considered that this would encompass criminal
behavior.  It never ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so when you read, I
guess, two different times, right?  One was during
the Florida investigation, when --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- there were eventually
public statements from some of these now women who
testified about what they did with Mr. Epstein when
they were under 18.

Page 296
           At that point, did you realize or did you
think to yourself, this happened or this could have
happened, I missed it, or were you at that point
still in the mindset that they were either not
telling the truth or were not remembering what
happened the way that -- accurately?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's a very fair
question.  So I think that my view of this at that
time, to call it as contemporaneously as it did,
because I don't think that stuff came out in public,
right?  I mean, I may have read things, but I
don't -- my first real ---
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, that's fair.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- memory of that is
at the trial.  But my viewpoint, if you will, was set
from the minute that 
 lied in her civil
deposition.  And I could never recover from that,
because --
           TODD BLANCHE:  What are you -- what are
you -- which lie, what are you referring to?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Her entire
characterization --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- of -- no, I don't
remember how she came and whether I did, --
DOJ REDACTION

Page 297
           TODD BLANCHE:  I see.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- but I'm talking
about the first time she came to Epstein's house,
which I knew --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- to be false.  So
from that first lie of that description, I could
never recover from that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I understand.  Okay.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And that tainted --
sorry.  Just so that we clear it, tainted, then, the
testimony of everybody else that I saw that came post
that, because I had my own personal experience, which
I knew to be false.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  And the reason why I
think -- and I said to Mr. Markus that -- this
morning that we were going to talk about this,
because when I think about you and the public's
perception of Mr. Epstein, the public is left with
the view that nobody in the world knows what really
happened except for you, okay?
           And now you've explained, the last day and
a half, how some of that's just a misperception,
because you weren't -- you didn't have a key to his
house, you weren't around as much as maybe everybody

Page 298
claims you were, okay?
           But there still is this perception out
there that, oh my gosh, if -- if we could talk to
Ms. Maxwell, we would know how horrible Mr. Epstein
was or how misperceived he was.  Whatever the truth
is about Mr. Epstein.
           And the challenge in my mind, just to
be -- I told you I would tell you when I had
issues -- and the challenge in my mind is that so
many women have -- have said that Mr. Epstein
sexually assaulted them, whether juveniles or adults,
that I don't find it -- you know, at some -- that's
persuasive, right, that that happened.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so if that's persuasive
then -- and I think it's without -- beyond
contestation that he preferred younger women --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I --
           TODD BLANCHE:    -- and it's also beyond,
I think at this point, there were certainly
circumstances that underage women -- well, I don't
want to say that you agree with me on that.
           I certainly believe that there were
younger age women that were abused by him, okay?  And
so -- and then so the layer that I want you to --

Page 299
that I really want to have a frank discussion about,
is some of these women have said, oh, yes, you know,
Ms. Maxwell was there, you know, to varying degrees.
She saw me there, she -- the door was open when I was
there.  And then much more egregious, right?  That
you participated and that you were part of it.
           And so what I really want you to have an
opportunity to say to us, is where on the spectrum
the truth is.  Whether it's somewhere in the middle,
whether it's one extreme or another extreme,
understanding.  In my mind, I'm talking about 1994 or
'5, to whenever, late '90s or early 2000s.
           DAVID MARKUS:  And let me just interrupt.
All I would say is, we're not here to say anything
one way or the other about Epstein.
           I agree with you that the evidence is
overwhelming against him, and he -- he is his own
person and has to deal with that.  But Ghislaine can
speak about what she knows --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- and from her point of
view and what she did.
           And that's what you can talk about,
Ghislaine.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.

Page 300
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I think it's
helpful to put this on -- the time on the calendar,
because I think without that we, we're lost.  So I
would say we'll go from the beginning '91?  No.  '2?
No.  '3?  No.  '4?  No.  '5?  No.  '6?  No.
           In that time frame, you have the
allegations of Jane, who I dispute.  I don't think he
met her until she was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let's not talk about
individuals.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, no, no, I'm just
saying.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm with you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But there's only --
but there's only -- so in that time period, I am only
aware of her.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm aware of a girl,
, who said, but -- and 
 and 
,
those -- I don't know of any others.
           And if there are other people who are
making allegations about, I don't -- I'm not even --
I'm not actually aware of them.  I may have read them
in the -- but I don't know.
           So I think in the early '90s period, I
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDACTION

Page 301
think I'm fairly confident, and I can say that at
least as characterized, it's just -- it's just false.
It's just -- it didn't happen as said.
           Now, did it -- did it happen -- did he --
did he involve himself?  I knew about Jane, because I
saw her come to the house.  But I saw her with her
mother.  I know that her allegations are that there
were orgies, for instance.  But the people that she
suggests were in her orgies, didn't even work for
Epstein until '98 or '99.
           Did he do orgies with those people?  I
don't know anybody who was there who said that they
did.  I certainly didn't see it.  I can't say that
that happened.  Did she do it with someone else?  I
don't know.
           The stories really start -- the
allegations really begin with 
.  And I think
that you have to shift his behavior, such as it was
bar, there was one in California who made an
allegation.
           There was a woman who said that she -- and
she's -- I didn't know about.  So I think I would
call her the first person.  I'd be aware of him using
his position to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But -- and sorry to
DOJ REDACTION

Page 302
interrupt you.  But I just want to -- I don't want --
I don't want to have you -- I don't think it's
helpful for us --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- have you kind of address
each allegation.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I want you to clear your
mind and just tell the truth about it.  So I'm not
saying you're not telling the truth.
           I'm saying just putting aside what other
people have said, or what their lawyers have said, or
what they testified to or, you know, the rumors in
the press, push those aside, you were there.
           And so when you go back to that time
period, '92, '93, '99, 2000, 2001, during that time
period, what did you see when it comes to young women
and massages?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All right.  Sorry.
           All right.  So I saw him receive massages.
He had regular masseuses in the '90s, people who were
standard and who traveled with him, and I saw that.
           He was living in the Iranian house, and
now that I look back, he had -- I didn't stay there,
but I would go to manage the house.  I would see

Page 303
women, models, or people that he would have come to
the house.
           I -- I know that I thought that he was
with Eva still at that time.  That's what I believed.
           And then subsequently believed that even
though she married him, I actually subsequently
believed that the baby that she had was his.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Can I interrupt for one
second?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Of course.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Can I just ask some basic
top line questions?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Were you ever in a massage
room with him and a masseuse?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.  Who -- when was
that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, he would come in
sometimes, and he would say, like, give her a massage
here, or he would grab my -- you know, but not often.
I mean, he did come in from time to time.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Were you ever in a massage
room with him with a masseuse that was naked or
giving him any sexual favors?

Page 304
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw that.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That I remember.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.  Did you -- did you
ever -- did any of the masseuses ever discuss with
you giving -- that they gave sexual favors to
Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.  Did you ever see an
underage girl go into a massage room with
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           DAVID MARKUS:  If you had seen that, what
would you have done?  Would you have left?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can't even conceive.
I can't even conceive of -- I can't imagine what I
would have done.
           DAVID MARKUS:  All right.  I'm sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  That's okay.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe
Mr. Epstein masturbating during a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  I mean, when I'd
seen him on a massage table, I had seen him
masturbate.  I don't know if there was a masseuse

Page 305
present, but I've seen him on a massage --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry, I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever see him
masturbate with a masseuse -- you know, with a naked
woman, either giving him a massage or reporting to
give him a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't remember
seeing that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you give him massages
by the way?  I mean, there's a photo of you rubbing
his feet, and I think, but --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never -- I certainly
have been in the massage room with him, and I have
certainly rubbed his feet when he was -- we're
talking, but I was not a masseuse and I didn't
perform massage on him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- along -- during
the -- over the years, did you pay the masseuses?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was typically not
my job, but if there was nobody else, normally -- so
in Palm Beach, the houseman would give the money.
           And in New York, he would do that, because
I wouldn't be in New York when he -- I mean, I don't
remember ever paying a masseuse in New York.

Page 306
           TODD BLANCHE:  So it wasn't --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But maybe --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- your -- it wasn't your
job --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- on a regular math --
basis to pay the masseuse.  So if there was a
masseuse seven days a week, it wasn't expected that
seven days a week you would be the one handing them
money?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- mostly I would
not.  I'm not saying I never did it, because that
wouldn't be true.  But it was not my job to pay them.
I mostly recall he would either pay them himself, he
would have money or the houseman, and I think some of
them would have probably received checks.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so just picking up on
what Mr. Markus was just asking you, did you
participate in sexual activity with him with a
masseuse, like at the same time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so the testi- -- I
don't know if there's testimony, but the women who
have said that that happened, categorically, that's
not true?

Page 307
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That is categorically
not true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- moving past
the -- and moving into the 2000s --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, I just want to
say that I have been -- I mean, I remember there'd be
times when he'd be getting a massage and I would be
in the room, I could be on his feet, and somebody
else could be on his feet, and we could be talking.
So there is that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But that's not -- you're --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- not talking about
something that's sexual, you're talking about
literally just rubbing his feet?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But I mean --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But that's not what I'm
talking about, I'm saying --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Well, they
could be -- the -- sometimes the women might be
topless who were giving that.  So you could say that
was sexual in that context.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, I'm talking about the

Page 308
repeated reports of certain sex acts happening with
you present and even participating?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- did -- in the
2000s time period, so moving a little more recently
when you talked about it yesterday, about how your
relationship with Mr. Epstein changed and was
changing and you ultimately met somebody else.
           Did you observe any, you know, massages or
young women giving him massages later on?  So after
2000, 2001 time period?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm sure I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And was there anything
different about what you observed during that period
and the '90s, as far as the frequency, his conduct
towards them?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think the frequency
increased.  I think he went from one to two in that
time period.  And -- but I did not see -- I have no
recollection of ever seeing a child entering the
house and giving him a massage.  I -- at that time,
he had moved me out of the main house.
           I had moved into an office with John
Alessi, the former butler, under the stairs.  So I
had an office where I would be that was not part of

Page 309
that -- part of the house.
           If I saw people, and I'm not saying I
didn't see people come to give him a massage, that
wouldn't be true either.  But if I saw someone, let's
say, I wouldn't -- I don't remember ever seeing
anybody that I would characterize as a child, no.
Specifically someone who accused me of seeing her at
the time when she came.
           If I did see her, and I don't believe I
did see her or meet her at all, but if she did, she
was as her -- she's described herself now, was very
mature and looked in her 20s.
           So could somebody have come that was more
mature looking than the allegation of what she did
look like, with a photograph that was produced as
evidence?  Yes.  But I never recall at any time
seeing what I would characterize as a child coming to
give him a massage and going upstairs.  Did I see
people come?  I absolutely did.
           Did I -- I just didn't see children.  I
didn't see anybody I would think of as a child.  And
if I had seen a child, I wouldn't -- I'm not sure
what I would have done.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, did you -- just
talking, like coming out a little bit of just bigger

Page 310
picture, do you -- at the time that you were in his
life, did -- do you -- was he a -- did he seem to you
to be a sexual deviant or, I don't know what the
right way to describe it.
           But when you say to me, he was getting
massages every single day, right?  So young women
were everywhere.  Multiple massages on some days.
Flew with the women to the island, to New York,
Paris.  There's always women, they're always rubbing
him, giving him massages.  I think it's -- it would
be an understatement to say that that's not normal?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I agree.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We've all kind of been part
of the Epstein story over the past several years, but
you were there at the time.  Okay?
           What was it like at the time?  I mean, was
he a creepy guy when it came to that sort of thing?
Was he protective of how he looked publicly, image
wise?  Like at the time, what was it like?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think if he had been
creepy, like, as you would define, and you would
expect someone who was living that lifestyle to be
creepy, I don't think the women would have been
there.
           I don't think that they thought of him as

Page 311
creepy.  And if they did, I never saw them behave
like he was being weird.  Was it a lot?  Yes, it was
for sure.  I found it overwhelming, and I couldn't
understand why it was interesting, because to me,
it's not interesting.
           But he, as he defined it, he found it
invigorating.  He liked being with younger people and
not just younger people.  I'm just saying because
they gave him ideas, and they were up to date on
music and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, but that's different,
like, a masseuse coming every day.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm just telling you
what he was saying to me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, to me, I just
found it a drag and difficult and annoying.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But understand I
wasn't the only person present.  So this time in the
2000s, you're talking about other people, like Sarah
Kellen, who was around, who interfaced with him.
           I didn't have to -- she was really
interfacing with Epstein at this point in time in his
life.  She was running his -- she was his assistant.

Page 312
And so I didn't have to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's a fair point.  But
move beyond the -- his assistants or the folks that
work with him.  What about his friends and the people
that were associated with him?
           It couldn't be -- it doesn't -- I don't
understand how that -- how this is an after fact of
Mr. Epstein.  So once he's arrested in Florida, it
becomes part of his story.  And then later on he's
charged in Southern District, and then here we are
now in 2025.
           But he was a very successful, hardworking
guy, and he had a lot of clients, and he flew with
them on vacations and went to the island.  It
doesn't -- I don't understand how he was able to hide
this, what seems to me to be some sort of sexual
fixation or issue --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- from -- from others?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think he did
hide it.  I -- that's the answer.  And I think that
the people around him, I think, myself included --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- obviously,
normalized his behavior on a number of fronts.  One,

Page 313
I think it -- because it was a self -- because so
many people saw it of so many -- of such a high
caliber down that never seemed to think it would --
well, if they thought it was strange probably, they
never said it at the time.  So it became sort of like
it was his thing, right?  He was always around with
women.
           Now, you don't -- I understand that it's
very unattractive, especially in light of everything
that we know today.  But at the time, the only way I
can sort of try and describe it is through Sex and
the City, the movie, the show on telly, where the --
this is -- that lifestyle is described on the TV show
constantly.
           There are always these women around and
men who like it.  And a lot of the men that I know
like women, and so maybe not as overtly as Epstein,
but he was overt, not covert, except obviously in the
context of the criminal behavior.
           So what we're discussing now, there's a
difference between the criminal behavior and the
non-criminal.  But you don't like the lifestyle, I
concur.
           I agree.  Especially now.  And I -- I own
my side of that fence that I was there and that I saw

Page 314
his behavior with women and didn't challenge him or
do something.
           But I don't -- I don't think back in the
'90s or the 2000s, we've had a cultural shift.  And
the cultural shift, I think is a very important part
of the analysis here.  Not because I'm trying to
justify this, because I'm not, and I'm not trying to,
and I absolutely am not here to do the poor me
program.  So please, don't misunderstand this.
           However, in the 19- -- 2000s, when this
behavior was going down, in the initial blush of the
Palm Beach investigation, the women who brought the
women who were underage 17, 16, I believe if I'm --
my memory serves, were actually targets of the
investigation and could have been charged with
prostitution and trafficking, I would -- if
trafficking was even a law.
           So you're taking -- you're taking
behavior.  And I did introduce him to women, I did,
but not underage women.  I understand that there are
allegations.  I have read them about myself going to
schools.  I can categorically tell you that I have
never, in my life, gone to a school to pick up a
child.  Well, not for this purpose.  I mean, like my
stepchildren, and all, but okay.  Sorry, just --

Page 315
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, I understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Thank you.  I
just want to be clear that I'm not trying to be cute
or anything.
           But -- and I did look for masseuses, I --
I did.  I went to spas and if I met somebody who said
she was a masseuse, I did not check their
credentials.  And of course, if she was attractive, I
did introduce her, yes.
           If I met friends who were interested, he
was constantly asking me for -- to meet new and
interesting people.  I did -- I did do that.
           At the time, I viewed it as -- well, first
of all, part of my job, I think, or part of my
responsibility, if you were, to introduce -- because
it wasn't just women.  If I met somebody who was
interesting, like Murray Gell-Mann or who I thought
he would like, I did that.  So it's not exclusively,
but he did.  And I did do that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- but then -- so I want
to layer on top of what you just said, what we talked
about yesterday more, but a little bit today already,
which is everybody that was around him besides you,
like his friends.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.

Page 316
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I accept the lifestyle.
I've seen the photos, the fact that everybody is --
we're all going to go to the island for a couple of
days, or we're flying on a private plane and there's
beautiful women everywhere.
           Is there any -- I mean, do you, as you sit
here today, think that the people around him didn't
also -- weren't also of the same place where they
were also getting massages where there was sex going
on during them, or things like that?  And I'm
obviously asking this because that's what the --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- that's what everybody
has said.  And when you just described what it was
like, the very next step from that is everybody's
going to Vegas for the weekend, you know.  And so --
and so you -- it seems kind of far-fetched to say
that, yes, that was his lifestyle.
           But then when he's taking groups of folks
to the island or groups of folks to New Mexico or
whatever, that they're all, you know, going to church
in the morning while he's getting a massage.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I hear you.  I was
there, though.  And --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.

Page 317
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and you're talking
about very substantial people.  And you are
extrapolating because the narrative that started
in -- by the way, not until 2009, is when it really
started.
           So that narrative that was created and
then built upon, and it just mushroomed into what --
basically this is like a Salem witch trial.  People
have gone and lost their minds for this thing.  I
understand that.
           But the issue is, how do you satisfy a mob
who can't understand the lifestyle because it's like
P. Diddy in Redux on TV with Clintons and Trump.  I
mean, it's -- it's bananas.  And while some of it is
real, he did do those things.  I'm definitely not
disputing that.
           But this was a man, they didn't even
believe he had a real business.  I happen to believe
he did.  Did he grift?  I don't -- I don't know,
because I wasn't really in his business.  But this is
-- this is one man.
           He's not some -- they've made him into
this -- he's not that interesting.  He's a disgusting
guy who did terrible things to young kids.  You're
not going to hear me say what he did to people who

Page 318
are over the age 18.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to go
there.  That's just not what I'm here to -- I mean, I
-- okay?
           But to suggest that Larry Summers or
Clinton would certainly go, oh my gosh, this is like
a guy I'm going to get my body rubbed and have some
sex.  They're men that went and had a massage and
maybe did something sexual, they're men, I wasn't in
the room.  I cannot tell you if that happened.
           And if it did, not -- I never paid for
that.  Just so that we're clear.  Nobody ever said to
me, oh, you know, we had sexual intercourse and that
was a three, uh-uh (negative).  I'd be like, okay.
TMI, no, not my business.  You want to -- it's just
not.  And I didn't want to know.  Maybe there's that.
           But did I, like, think these guys were
coming for that?  I really don't.  If you met
Epstein, there is no way that this cast of
characters, of which it's extraordinary, and some are
in your cabinet, who you value as your coworkers, and
you know, would be with him if he was a creep or
because they wanted sexual favors.  A man wants
sexual favors, he will find that.  They didn't have
to come to Epstein for that.
           Now did some?  Okay.  I don't know.  I

Page 319
wasn't there.  I didn't see it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when's the last time you
think you were with Mr. Epstein when he got a
massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say 2007.
           TODD BLANCHE:  2007?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the frequency at that
point, so 2007, is that when it was at its peak,
would you say?  Meaning the number of interactions he
was having daily with women and masseuses?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wasn't really in his
life.  I happened to be in the Caribbean in 2007.  I
was with Ted.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And we -- I was still
speaking with Epstein, because I was still involved
in his -- you know, loosely with his -- the houses
and the staff and some of the billing.  And he -- and
I was going back from being with Ted in the Caribbean
to New York, and Epstein offered me a ride.  And so
Ted dropped me off in Saint Thomas, and I was on the
island, I believe, for one day and one night only.
           On that visit, I believe -- well, I know
he would have gotten a massage, but I have -- there

Page 320
were people there, but I did -- that were women.  And
I was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- just relieved not
to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- be leaving the next
day.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let's take a break.
           SPENCER HORN:  Well, we're going to take a
break.  The time is 11:31.
        (Break at 11:31 a.m. to 11:49 a.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  We are resuming the audio
recorded proffer agreement with Ms. Maxwell, and the
time is 11:49 a.m.
           TODD BLANCHE:  All right.  I wanted to
follow up about former President Clinton's
relationship with Mr. Epstein, not you.
           Can you -- we touched on it, but can you
just to set the -- I have a couple questions about
it, but what's your understanding of their
relationship from what you observed?  Meaning former
President Clinton and Mr. Epstein.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I saw them talk.  I
saw them sit down and have chats about, I don't know,

Page 321
because I wasn't either a party or didn't listen and
I know -- I would characterize, originally anyway,
Mr. Epstein's interest in him because obviously he's
the former president.
           But I never saw him -- other than that, I
saw them be friendly on the plane, but I never -- I
don't believe -- I don't recollect, anyway, ever
seeing them in any other context.
           I don't remember him at his house in New
York.  Like I said, I don't believe he ever went to
that island.  I think that was just a -- that was a
story that 
 did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know one way or the
other, whether their relationship continued without
you, like, when you kind of moved on past
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't believe so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you say that you
don't believe so?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because I don't think
they had a relationship even when I was there.  I was
-- I -- President Clinton liked me, and we got along
terribly well.  But I never saw that warmth or that
-- that warmth or however you want to characterize
it, with Mr. Epstein and cert- -- so I didn't see
DOJ REDACTION

Page 322
that.  I didn't see any interest in -- I didn't see
President Clinton being interested in Epstein.  He
was just a rich guy with a plane.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When -- when the Southern
District of New York case kind of became public and
there was a search warrant of Mr. Epstein's house,
there was like a -- there was some sort of painting
or picture with Mr. Clinton in like a blue dress that
had been signed.
           Did you know -- do you know where he got
that picture or that painting?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The first I saw it was
in the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you never observed that
in his --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- brownstone?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I thought it was
hideous.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What's that again?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I thought it was
hideous.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And -- but you had never --
so you don't know, sitting here today, where
Mr. Epstein got it?

Page 323
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  The circumstances in which
he got it?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know of any other
gifts or paraphernalia or art or pictures that former
President Clinton gave to Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I mean, did he
maybe get him a gift?  I don't know.  I have no
knowledge of that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then going back to the
topic we were talking about before our last break.
           Well, when you said something yesterday at
the very beginning of our conversation that when you
first met Mr. Epstein and you ultimately have sex
with him, that he had -- I'll use the word erectile
dysfunction, but he had issues having sex?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's what he told
me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's what he told you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And then over the
years, you said sometime in the '90s he started
taking testosterone?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  But I don't know

Page 324
if it was in the '90s.  I don't remember when he
started, but it wasn't -- he had patches --
testosterone patches --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- dermal.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like on his arm?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And then he was
ridiculous, because you shouldn't take more than one.
But sometimes he had, like -- I'm like, what are you
doing?  It's like unhealthy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  From what you
observed or saw or heard, did he continue to have
challenges sexually over the years or do you think
that whatever he told you -- whatever issue he told
you he had was fixed?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was a lie.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You think he was lying
about what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  About his erectile
dysfunction.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh, you mean you never --
you don't think he ever had any issues?  You think he
just told you that?

Page 325
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  That is what I
believe today, yes.  But given -- if any of the
stories are true, even if he had erectile
dysfunction, the thing had a priapism, for Christ's
sake.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, that's -- that's one
of the reasons for my questions.  I mean, you're
right.  I mean -- and again, we're -- we've talked
about this a fair amount, but what did -- like the
stories of what masseuses, underage and overage have
said about him is, are, you know, and what he liked,
what he demanded that they do.  Whether it's watching
him masturbate or pinching his nipples, you know,
kind of things that are unusual.
           Do you believe that?  Like, do you -- from
what you saw, from what you observed, from what you
did when you were in a relationship with him, is that
true?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- well, the bulk of
what I read, he did not have sex.  So that is
consistent with what he told me, actually.
           And his masturbating, that is also
consistent with what I knew myself.  And I'm going to
use a bad word for --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Please, you can use

Page 326
whatever words you need.  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Blowjob.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He liked blowjobs.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That I did observe.
And he didn't seem to have any erectile dysfunction
for blowjobs, but sex, he didn't have.  So when I
read the stories about all the allegations of sexual
rape, I find that challenging, because that was not
his modus operandi, from my perspective.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But when you read about
blowjobs, that -- does that -- that would be
consistent with kind of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That would be
consistent, as would masturbation, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you talk to masseuses
or women that either he was in a relationship with or
who asked you about working with him?  Did you tell
them, yes, he likes blowjobs, yes, he'll masturbate
in front of you?
           Like, did you have conversations with any
of those -- with women about what Mr. Epstein liked
or what would make him happy, or things like that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't have any

Page 327
memory of telling anybody about that.  I think I may
have joked like saying, oh my God, you know, like
from a Sex and the City scene that, you know, he's --
but not -- I never instruct -- the question you're
asking me, sorry, let's just be clear.
           Did I ever instruct anyone how to
pleasure, Mr. Epstein, your question?  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you said this earlier,
but I want to just -- you kind of said it on your
own.  I want to ask the question, just so I'll make
sure that there's no confusion.
           When -- when you over the years --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry, can I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- yeah.  Of course.  Yeah,
yeah, please.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Right.  I just
want to say, the idea that I would have to explain to
a woman how to satisfy Mr. Epstein is patently
absurd, because he clearly was able to explain
himself.
           He didn't need an interlocutor to explain
what he liked.  He's been doing this obviously or
this -- some version of this story his whole life and
did not require any help from me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Then -- so did you ever

Page 328
observe him having sex with a masseuse?  Regular
intercourse, not a blowjob, nothing else, where you
either walked in or you were in the room?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw him have
sex with any person.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so how about oral sex?
Did you ever observe a woman giving him oral sex,
whether you were in the room or walked in, or --
                   GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw
anyone give Epstein a blowjob.  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you said earlier you
did see him masturbating in front of masseuses.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if I said
that.  I don't know --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Sorry.  I don't
want --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- if I said that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let me ask you a question.
Sorry.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know for sure
I said that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, that's fair.  That's
fair.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I said I saw him --
I'm sure I saw him in a -- what some people could

Page 329
define as sexual contact.  Because if somebody could
not have their clothes or topless, I would say maybe,
I could say that.
           If I saw him having -- masturbating when
someone was there, I don't recall that, I don't have
a specific memory of it.  I'm sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But no, I'm not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I didn't say that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  I understand, that's
fair.  Sorry.  I'm not ---
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- certainly not trying to
put words in your mouth.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, no.  That's --
absolutely no.  That's fine.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- and you said, I think
in passing -- maybe not in passing.  I'm sorry.
           About -- about, you know, whether other
people who travel with him would get massages or --
so that would -- when I say that I'm referring mostly
to the island or, potentially, New Mexico.  But also
his Palm Beach residence or even in New York.
           Do you know of -- do you have a list of

Page 330
names in your head or names that come to mind of
people that you know did get massages when they were
with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, there's no list.
There's no list of people getting massages.  I don't
have -- I can barely recall all the people.  I can
barely recall.  I struggle to recall actual people
that I met.  And I may have met a long time that I
had even forgotten that -- about Mr. Kennedy, or I
probably brought it up yesterday.  It just came to my
mind now.
           So I don't have, and there's no list.
There was never a list.  There was no -- or certainly
none that I ever saw.  None I ever heard of, none
that I ever witnessed, none that I -- there's no
list.  Has never been a list.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you never heard
Mr. Epstein talk about such a list?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you never heard
Mr. Epstein suggest that he had some sort of control
over somebody because of what he knew about what they
had done or had photos of him or anything?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never heard him --
no, I never heard him ask questions about that.  I

Page 331
never heard him.  So I've been present many times
with masseuses.  I never -- who presumably could or
maybe did massage somebody, I'm not saying whether
they did or not just (indiscernible).
           I never heard him ask any question of any
masseuse who may have given a massage to a friend
that was on the island, or in Palm Beach or anywhere
else for that, any details about that massage.  Like,
does he have a funky foot?  No, I never heard that
because it -- weird.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I think at one of the
breaks today, your lawyer may have showed you
something that just came out in the paper, I think
this morning or last night.  A letter that you --
that is attributed to you, associated with this
birthday book from 2003 that we talked about
yesterday.
           Is -- did you see that letter.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did see the letter.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Is that, in fact -- look
like your handwriting or something you wrote?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So, I don't remember
the letter.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But it does look like

Page 332
my handwriting.  And it does look like my name.  And
it looks like it could be real, but I have no memory
of writing that, and I don't remember it at all.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember what the
birthday book, as they're calling it, what it, like,
looked like?  Like how it was put together?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do you remember about
it?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I remember it.  It was
leather-bound, and I remember it being about yea big.
It was big.  Right like --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you're saying it looks
like -- it's like over 12 inches, 14, 15 inches?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  It was like sort
of like a folio size, I guess, or something like
that.  And like this.  And it was brown and thick,
about this thick.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So just -- so you -- so I
understand --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  On heavy stock paper.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Heavy stock paper, like 14
inches high?

Page 333
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's about right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then around like --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  A4.  A4.  We had A4,
because it was done on heavy stock paper, but I can't
remember if it was folio size paper, or it could have
just been A4.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh I see.  So it could have
just been letter size, or it might have been legal
size --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- heavy stock paper.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the -- so the folks
that submitted letters were given the stock paper or
how were the letters -- or did you, like, glue or
something the letters to the stock paper?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Every which way.  Some
were given the paper and they did their own thing.
Some would send me some scrap of paper and I would
put it on the thing.  Some I didn't get because they
went straight to Epstein, and I was just told to put
them in, like I said.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how was it bound?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It went to a
professional binder, who did it like a book that

Page 334
you'd see in the library.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So like the glue that keeps
a regular book, a novel that you would read together,
it was bound that way?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Like a -- I believe
so.  I don't think it was stitched, but I don't
remember.  I mean, it was professionally done by a
professional bookbinder.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then after you
presented it, or after it was presented to him when
he turned 50, did you see the leather-bound book, did
he keep it somewhere in particular?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was in his bookcase
in 71st Street.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In Manhattan?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  In Manhattan.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did you see it over the
years until you stopped going to the brownstone?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I saw it -- I know I
did see it, because it was right behind his desk.
And after I stopped going, I don't know what happened
to it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- do you
remember being told or knowing where the book is now?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  But I -- when I

Page 335
received in discovery those pages, I assumed that it
had been found when either New York or the island was
searched, and I assumed that the Southern District of
New York had it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But I think you said
yesterday.  But just to go over it again, in case you
remember anything differently.  You recall seeing
some of the letters in discovery.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you don't recall kind
of seeing the leather book, start to finish?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, but remember, I
didn't see all discovery because they were very
clever about, you know, I didn't receive all
discovery, period.  And in fact, very important items
were not given to me at all, including witness
testimony from grand jury.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So whether -- so you don't
know one way or the other, whether it was part of
discovery, you just know that you didn't get it.  It
wasn't part of the discovery that was given to you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.  But there's
a -- I am absolutely sure that the Southern District
of New York hid very important pieces of evidence
from me.

Page 336
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I assumed that
they leaked it because where else would it be, if
that's what it is.  If it's true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So I've -- just so I
put -- I'll say it to you as I've talked a little bit
to your lawyer about it.  I said to you yesterday
that the purpose of what we did yesterday and today
was -- was exactly what we did, which is to have a
conversation about Mr. Epstein and about you.
           And I think it's very challenging to talk
about everything we talked about.  And, you know, in
one and a half days or in just a period of hours.  So
I'll talk to Mr. Markus about kind of what we're
going to do next, if anything.
           There's no -- and I don't -- I'm not being
coy or -- I just -- I don't know yet.  I don't know.
So we -- I have a lot of -- we have some work to do.
We'll do it with your lawyers to the extent we have
questions or follow-up.
           And this has been very helpful.  I think
it's -- it was you, you know, who kind of said you
wanted to talk, but we gladly accepted it.  So I do
appreciate you being willing to meet with us.  And I
expect that we'll be in touch soon.  All right.

           SPENCER HORN:  Good morning.  It is
Friday, July 25th, the time is 9:24 a.m.  My name is
Spencer R. Horn.  I'm the Assistant Special Agent in
Charge of FBI New York.  And we are here for a
recorded proffer agreement with Ms. Maxwell.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Good morning, Ms. Maxwell.
How are you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Good morning.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Good.  So the proffer
agreement we signed yesterday, I just -- there's a
place on it for us to all kind of initial.  It's
exactly the same document and you'll see your
signature.  If you can just initial right to the left
of -- right here.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Here?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right there.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, it's okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then Mr. Markus will --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- initial as well.  Thank
you.
           And just to kind of -- before we get
going, I'll just say that exactly the same folks that
Page 218
were here when we met yesterday are here today.  So
there's no -- I'm not going to do formal
introductions, because it's exactly the same group of
folks.
           So we're continuing, Ms. Maxwell, our
discussion of yesterday.  And the same -- the same
kind of rules apply.  If you -- we'll take breaks, if
you need to talk to Mr. Markus or your lawyers, no --
absolutely no problem.  Just let me know.  I'll try
to ask my questions in a coherent manner, but if
there's anything that I say that's confusing,
definitely interrupt me.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I will.  Thank you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I think the easiest
thing to start with is, is there anything that we
talked about yesterday that -- we're going to go
through some more names.  I think that we -- that's
one of the places that we -- that we interrupted,
just because there's a lot of names.
           But aside from additional names, is there
anything that you wanted to kind of follow up on that
we talked about yesterday or anything that you
thought maybe you remember more of or not?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Some more names did
come to me in the night, and I did have some
Page 219
additional memories just for clarity.  I believe I
said that I couldn't think of anybody who I may have
asked from Mar-a-Lago, but then I realized that I
was -- the allegation at least is that I met 
in Mar-a-Lago and so I felt that I needed to address
that.  And I didn't want to leave that hanging
because that seems weird under the circumstances.
           And also -- but I couldn't remember anyone
and -- maybe, you know, it's a long period of time.
So the issue is not that I'm trying to not say, but I
just don't -- I don't remember anybody that I would
have.  But it's not impossible that I might have
asked someone from there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I don't -- I don't know
exactly what you said yesterday, but I don't think
what you said yesterday is different than what you
just said.  So, yes.  There's --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I just wanted
to be -- I just didn't want to feel that I had said
no to something and that it -- and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  
 definitely had
has said that she was working at Mar-a-Lago and that
you received a treatment of her -- from her at some
point, and that you recruited her to meet
Mr. Epstein.
Page 220
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know, affirmatively,
whether that's true or false, or do you just not have
a memory either way?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I really don't believe
it's true.  But I know that I did go to spas and if I
met someone, I did ask if they're (indiscernible) --
so I don't -- in the realms of possibility, it could
have, but I have no memory of it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I don't believe
that that it's how it went down, but I don't want
to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So I want to talk
about -- we talked a little bit yesterday about the
financial part of your relationship with Mr. Epstein,
kind of being on payroll, for lack of a better word,
for many, many years, starting around $25,000 and
ending up at around $250,000 per year.
           There's -- as you know, from your trial,
there's banking information that shows a ton of money
being sent to you from Mr. Epstein over the years.
           And I think totaling something like
$30 million, something like this.  What's -- what's
the -- why was that money sent to you?  Like, what
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDACTION

(Pages 221 to 224)
(Pages 221 to 224)
Page 221
was that for?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, first of all, I
don't -- I dispute the characterization that the
money was sent to me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So tell me what -- I
am stuck with the witnesses at trial and what was
said at trial on that issue.  So what -- what -- what
is the -- what do you dispute about that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I believe -- I
don't have full recollection.  I'm not even sure I
ever saw what they accused me of, but my belief is
that that money also contained money that was for a
helicopter, for instance, that I never owned and I --
was never mine.  And --
           DAVID MARKUS:  In other words, money was
sent to you that you then used to purchase things
or...
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I'm not even
sure that I purchased it.  So the accounts -- those
accounts would be controlled by his accountants.
And --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Even accounts in your name,
you're saying, or one of your entities?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I'm not even
sure I knew of all the entities.  I'm not -- I
Page 222
don't -- it -- maybe I did, contemporaneously, but I
simply wouldn't know today.  So if there was an
entity, let's say account X, if I really set that up
myself or whether they said, we're doing this and the
money's coming or whatever.  But in no substantive
way -- I can't think of the right word.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Did you have control
over --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I had no control, is
what I'm saying.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when -- when the
government -- when there was testimony or the
government admitted evidence that showed, for
example, $5 million in 2002 coming from Epstein to
you, okay, what you're saying is that that may --
that happened, but that the you there, wasn't money
that -- he wasn't giving you money.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not going to say
that for everything, because maybe there were
accounts that money was sent to me.  But I can say
that I know -- like the helicopter, I can
definitively say.  I'd have to look at all of them to
be accurate for you.
           But to explain how or why I could be
receiving monies, and I certainly did.  So I'm not
Page 223
disputing all of it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But when you said -- let's
go back and look.  Why would -- why did money have to
go into your accounts or account that was controlled
by others, but in your name to, like, purchase a
helicopter?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, that's a very good
question.  I don't -- I'm not sure I know the answer
to that.  I don't.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So let me ask this maybe a
different way that gets to the issue, right?  So the
accusation by the government, based upon the evidence
they collected, is that Epstein paid you millions and
millions of dollars over the years.
           And the reason why he paid you that is
because you were performing an extraordinary service
for him by recruiting young women, many of whom were
underage to -- so that he could sexually abuse them.
Okay.  That's their -- that's their allegation.
Okay.
           From what you said yesterday and from what
I've reviewed about you and Mr. Epstein, he paid for
a lot in your life.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Absolutely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Your flights, where you
Page 224
stayed with him.  I mean, he didn't expect you to
reimburse him along the way for food and, you know,
so he took care of you for many years.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That is true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  On top of that, he actually
paid you a salary as we talked about $25,000 to
$250,000.  What else did he give you?  Or what
purchase -- like, was there a time when he gave you a
million dollars or $500,000 as a bonus?  Or what --
what financial benefit did you receive from him,
besides what we've already talked about.  We don't
have to talk about what, you know, so --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I got it.  I got it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So my goal, always,
was to become independent, independently, financially
secure and work for myself.  I've never been one to
not work.  And in that regard, over the course of my
friendship and my working relationship with Epstein,
I expressed to him my desire to be independent of him
everywhere, just to be freestanding.
           And the -- in -- with that in mind, I
wanted to have my own businesses or my own money
coming in independent and separate from any salary
that I received from him.

(Pages 225 to 228)
(Pages 225 to 228)
Page 225
           And I needed that for my self-esteem.
I've never been -- I mean, obviously salary and it
was a very generous one.  Please, I'm not belittling
the sum of money, because it's huge, but I was
brought up to work and I was brought up to be my own,
you know.
           The first time -- so I would either
propose businesses to him or he would actually
suggest why didn't I do something in the first deal
that we did, or the first business that we had or I
had and that he financed for me.
           So he gave -- he loaned me all the money
to enable me to do this and then I reaped the
profits, which I don't remember now, because we
varied over the deals that we did, that I would give
him 50 percent or 25.
           It was sort of -- it was random.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I can tell you
what it is, so we can compare it.
          TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Go ahead.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it was in Palm
Beach actually, and it was in real estate.  And they
sold what was the grounds originally of an estate
called the Phipps Estate.  And then they converted
Page 226
the land that came with that estate into houses.  And
I did, I think, two or maybe -- I can't remember now,
but certainly one and maybe two, possibly three.  I
don't think so.  I think two, that then were flipped
and there was a profit.
           So that would be an example of that.  But
I didn't have the money, so he lent me the funds to
do that business transaction and then I reaped the
profits.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so -- but when --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And that's millions of
dollars.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- when a financial
investigator like, the FBI looks at accounts, they
don't know kind of the conversations you're having.
They just see the money.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So in those cases, when
that happened, when he would -- when he financed that
with you, would he send money to you?  So does that
explain some of the money?  Like, I guess --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe -- I think
it does.  I think, for instance, there were two
Gullwing Mercedes that they did with Mercedes and
Aston Martin.  You can look it up, I think, if I'm
Page 227
right.  That had the doors that would come up like
this --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  There were only a very
limited number that were made.  So I knew that we
could get those and flip them right within 24 hours,
for example.
           Also my -- here's another example of
something that you guys wouldn't have known about is
I became a banker.  I got my Series 63, Series 67
banking license and became a broker for like a new
(inaudible).  And then -- because I was day trading.
Everything I had I day traded with -- through an
account.
           And I think I was lucky more than smart,
but I made quite a lot of money doing that.  And so
--
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that?  Like what
-- approximate time --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Again, that's in the
'90s again.  I don't -- oh, wait.  I think -- well,
you can find it, because it'll be my banking license,
right?  That'll be something that you can look up,
probably.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
Page 228
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So what whatever that
is -- and I just don't remember when that is.  I'm
sorry.
         TODD BLANCHE:  So -- okay.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And so for an example,
I was -- I was doing really, really, really well.
And so he was like, how do you do that?  Well, how
are you -- what are you -- why are you investing in,
I don't know, Apple when nobody liked Apple.  This
is, you know, before Apple or Microsoft.  I didn't
know Bill Gates, so this is not related to him.
           But my family --
           DAVID MARKUS:  Don't charge her with
insider trading.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Please -- no.  I'm not
trying to suggest that.  Oh, goodness.  Please, no.
I had no --
           DAVID MARKUS:  It was just a joke.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  It was a joke.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  No.  All right.
           But my -- going back to my family, my dad
had given me an account when I was 12 and I had
always an interest in business and finance, not --
not very sophisticated.  I'm not suggesting that.

(Pages 229 to 232)
(Pages 229 to 232)
Page 229
           And so I like to trade and so I did and I
did well.  And so then I would tell him what I was
doing.  Now, whether he did or he didn't, he told me
he matched me in some other accounts that he had.
Because he did a lot of -- he -- my observation, to
go back to what he did, I observed him personally and
have recollection -- personal recollection of him
trading this money, lots.  Tens of millions, hundreds
of millions of dollars.
           TODD BLANCHE:  That was -- that he was
trading for other people --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or that was his own
money?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want also to clarify
something for you or clarify or underline.  Wexner
was, in my opinion, his closest friend in this time
period from when I met him in '91, right, all the way
until-- well, 'til, I don't know.
           Because I wasn't that friendly with --
well, I did travel with Mr. Wexner, but Epstein told
me that Wexner didn't want to be seen too much with
me, because of my family problems.  You know, whether
that was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  You mean the problems that
Page 230
your father's company had with --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- embezzlement or
allegations of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Yes.  That's
what I'm talking about.
           And now, actually today -- not
contemporaneously, but today I don't believe that
that's even true.  I think it was used as a means to
not have me travel with him to Ohio or whatever.  It
was just a way to park me.
           And I believe that now, because within the
discovery there was a lot of -- well, not a lot, but
there was some indications that he would actively
tell other people to lie to me or conceal things from
me, and that he never loved me and I wasn't his type.
That's in the discovery somewhere.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- okay.  So the
government had evidence that, even as late as 2007,
he paid you a lot of money.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What was that?  What
was the money?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like several -- millions of
millions of dollars in 2007.  $7.4 million, I think.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  What was that for?
Page 231
Was it -- was that the helicopter?
           TODD BLANCHE:  That was -- that's my
question for you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I don't know.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So in 2007 --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think that was
probably the helicopter.  That could have been --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That was what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That could have been
the helicopter, the Sikorsky.  Those big chunks like
that, I don't -- I didn't -- I don't personally have
any memory of receiving a check from him for
$7 million.  I just -- I just don't.  But I would
have to -- I know I -- so the answer to your
question, to be precise --
           DAVID MARKUS:  You would remember if it
went into your pocket --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would remember if it
went -- I would -- he never paid me to -- for
services that you just described, $7 million, to --
for any nefarious reason.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  I think I understand
what you've said about being on the payroll and
Page 232
helping -- him helping you with businesses, and
giving you a lot of life things along the way.  You
travel with him, you ate with him.  He's, you know,
but there is the -- these massive amounts of money,
one-time payments that I --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I don't -- you'd
have to trace that, right?  So I don't believe that
came into my account or I had any control.  I have no
memory of that.  I have no -- no --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, but if there's
records that show it coming into your account, it
sounds like what you're saying is that not -- putting
aside your -- you have no memory of that money being
yours.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like you didn't -- that
money is not somewhere --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I wouldn't be
like, oh, yippee, let me go.  I got $7 million.  I'm
going to go buy myself a yacht.  No.  Or I don't
know, something else or move it to some other -- no.
           I don't think -- I don't think, if you
look -- you'll have to check, obviously you will.  I
don't think you'll find that money moving in any --
to any account, either of mine or it shouldn't show,

(Pages 233 to 236)
(Pages 233 to 236)
Page 233
I don't believe anyway.  As far as I recollect, it
wouldn't show me spending it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Does that make sense?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Yeah, that makes
sense.  I mean, I think if -- I don't think there's
any dispute by anybody, even your lawyers at trial,
that -- that that the money went in.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, $7 million in
when, what year?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, there's several
years; in 2007.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And?
           TODD BLANCHE:  2002, there was $5 million
that you were paid in 2002.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, well, I'd have
to -- I don't -- I don't remember.  But -- okay.  So
there's -- there would be another large sum, but it
wouldn't have come from him later.  But it had
nothing to do --
           TODD BLANCHE:  The biggest one was in
1999.  There's over $18 million.  $18.3 million.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know what that
is.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So what -- but you --
Page 234
you're -- but what you're saying, it sounds like, and
if you don't know, we're going to -- we can move on.
           But when we're talking about $18.3 million
in '99, $5 million in -- three years later in 2002,
$7.4 million in 2007.  That -- those -- that money
adds up to around $30 million.
           You were not paid that by Mr. Epstein.
Meaning, that's not money you received for your
benefit, even if it was put into your accounts.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't believe any of
that was my money.  Now, I do -- I just -- like I
said, we did do these things --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.  I understand that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  - - with the cars.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I understand that.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And as --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if any of
that money, some of it -- if it moves, some of that
may have come from the car or a house that was sold
that I had an interest in with him.  That's possible.
But I don't think this money is mine.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  But also, the record should
reflect, too, that there were times Ghislaine's name
was used, for example, Air Ghislaine.  Her name was
Page 235
in the name of the entity.  It had nothing to do with
her.  And if you pull signatures --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  -- there's no evidence for
that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  My -- what I'm trying
to just make sure I -- that I understand, is that the
idea that you were paid $30 million between '99 and
2007, in order to -- by Mr. Epstein to reward you for
recruiting young women.  That is in your -- you're
saying that is categorically, completely false?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That is categorically
false, correct.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So I want to just --
we went through several individuals yesterday and I
want to go through just a couple of more names and
ask if you -- if you know them.  And if you do know
them, how you know them.
           Do you know Elon Musk?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how did you meet
Mr. Musk?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met him in -- I
don't remember the year, but it's going to be in
2010, '11, something like that, I think, if my memory
Page 236
serves.
           And I was at an event for Sergey Brin, the
co-founder of Google.  And Sergey had arranged for --
it was for his birthday.
           And we were -- or a bunch of us, I don't
even remember how many we were, but not many of us.
           Maybe -- I don't know.  If I say 40, I
could be wrong.  If it was 30 or 50, I don't
remember.  I'm sorry.
           Went to another friend's island.  Somebody
called Mr. Pigozzi in the Caribbean and -- not with
Epstein, he was not there, to celebrate Sergey's
birthday.  And we were there together for, I want to
say, three or four days, something like that in my
memory.  And Mr. Musk was present for that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And that was the first time
you met him, as far as you know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  As far as I remember,
yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you meet -- did you
know his brother, Mr. Musk's brother?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if I've
ever met him.  I know that he has a brother and I
don't think I met him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Aside from that time in --

(Pages 237 to 240)
(Pages 237 to 240)
Page 237
around 2010, on the island in the Caribbean for a
couple days, did you -- have you seen -- do you know
Mr. Musk beyond that time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  We met at -- I was at
the Oscars and we met at the Oscars.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What year was that, earlier
or later?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was post that
event, I believe.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether
Mr. Epstein knew Mr. Musk?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I believe they did.
And the only reason I say that is not from my memory,
but because I saw -- I think I saw -- my memory is
that in discovery, they were communicating on email.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you have no personal
knowledge of that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have no --
           TODD BLANCHE:  It's just what you've --
what you've seen from the press or from discovery?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I believe his
brother as well, actually.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Excuse me?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Mr. Musk's brother as
well.  But I don't -- my -- like I said, my memory is
Page 238
not -- it's not as good as I would like it to be.
And I just want to say that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you -- you mentioned, I
think, yesterday in passing -- well, not in passing,
but as part of another answer, Andrew Cuomo.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you know Mr. Cuomo?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, only because he
was married to Kerry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I think I knew his
brother as well.  What's -- he has a brother, right?
He's on TV.  What's his name?
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Chris.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  Christopher.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Christopher Cuomo.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Chris.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Chris.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You mean the TV -- the
former TV anchor or the TV anchor, Chris Cuomo?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So -- but I would say
just socially, not -- I'm not close friends or
anything, but because we -- I was friends with Kerry
Page 239
and I met him a few times and I certainly met his
brother as well a few times.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the same questions that
I asked about Mr. Musk, do you know whether
Mr. Epstein knew Andrew Cuomo or Chris Cuomo or
Ms. Kennedy, your friend?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so you never -- you
don't recall any of those three individuals, like,
flying on Mr. Epstein's plane --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or visiting him in
Palm Beach or at the island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I think you mentioned
former Secretary of State John Kerry yesterday.  But
if not, do you know Mr. Kerry or no?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have met him, but I
don't know if Mr. Epstein ever met him.  I met him
only -- well, really I can't even probably
characterize that as a meeting, but I was very, very
involved in the Ocean at Work, through the -- you
asked me yesterday about TerraMar.
           And if I recall right, I met Mr. -- the
Secretary that way through the Ocean, but he wouldn't
Page 240
know who I am, I doubt.  I don't think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether --
well, do you know former Senator Ted Kennedy?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And does -- is that through
your own life or through Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My life.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein knew Senator Kennedy?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't believe so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so for the folks we
just talked about, so former Secretary of State John
Kerry, Ted Kennedy, did -- you don't know whether
Mr. Epstein knew them, so I take that to mean you
have no recollection of them flying on his planes--
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh God, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh.  But Bobby Kennedy
knew him.  Bobby, the health --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sorry.  Say that again
about Bobby Kennedy.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Bobby knew
Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because we went on a

(Pages 241 to 244)
(Pages 241 to 244)
Page 241
trip together.  Was -- we went to -- dinosaur bone
hunting in the Dakotas.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When was that, you know,
approximately?  I'm not looking for an exact date,
but when was that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That was early -- that
was in the early -- well, let me back up.  I knew
Bobby's wife, Mary, pretty well, actually.  And
before he met her.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And just to help us, I know
we're talking about a wide span of time, but what are
you -- when are you talking about that you knew
Mr. Kennedy's wife before they were married.
           So when are talking about the --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- in 19 -- all
right.  I guess, let's get my head straight.  In --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, would this have been
before you met Mr. Epstein --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- or after?  Okay.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met him before I
met.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So we're talking about the
1980s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Thank
Page 242
you.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  The '80s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So we're talking
about the 1980s.  And then --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The -- I was the -- I
had a very, very longstanding boyfriend and he had --
his brother was dating Mary at the time, and we were
all very good friends.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then Mr. Epstein -- did
Mr. Epstein meet Bobby Kennedy through you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't -- I don't
think so, because Mr. Epstein, surprisingly, everyone
says everything happened through me.  That's just not
true.  I mean, I think yesterday I explained that he
had friends from London, and those are very -- they
were what the people would call "fancy."
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  They were fancy
people.  And -- but he had the same types of
relationships before I met him in America.  So when I
met him, he was already, you know, Wexner and he had
Henry and he had -- he was --I don't know if then he
was at the -- in the Council of Foreign Relations,
but he was friends with Ace and, you know, like he
Page 243
was -- he was well established.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He didn't need me.
And he was, you know, his -- Eva was, you know, major
model.  So he had all these modeling connections and
friends in that business, long before I met him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so the trip that you
went on with Mr. Epstein and Bobby Kennedy, was that
in the '90s and 2000s when --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was in
the -- it would've been in the -- I want to say '93,
'94.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So a very long time
ago.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  A very, very long time
ago.
           TODD BLANCHE:  A few years into the --
your relationship -- a few years into the time that
you knew Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  I mean, I don't
want to hold myself to the dates because I really --
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, no.  I'm not holding
you to dates.  I think --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because I really don't
--
Page 244
           TODD BLANCHE:  I've said that a lot,
because I appreciate we're talking about the '80s and
'90s and even the 2000s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I just want you to
know, I haven't had any -- I don't have anything to
review, so I haven't had any ability to -- the short
of my legal material, obviously, which you can -- you
know I have, because I came with a box worth, but
short of that, I have nothing with which to
refresh -- or very limited stuff, I should say, I
don't want to say nothing -- to refresh my mind.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I understand that.  Do you
have any recollection of Mr. Kennedy -- of there
being anything inappropriate with Mr. Kennedy and
masseuses or young women on the trip you just talked
about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw anything
inappropriate with Mr. Kennedy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether he
ever got a massage from one of the masseuses?  Do you
know either way?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But not something you
remember?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, absolutely

(Pages 245 to 248)
(Pages 245 to 248)
Page 245
not.
           I mean, he -- well, I mean, yesterday, if
I didn't make it clear, I will reiterate it.  I
never, ever saw any man doing something inappropriate
with a woman of any age.  I never saw inappropriate
habits.
           Now, I'm not -- I'm not going to say hands
or -- I mean, that to me is not inappropriate.  Now,
somebody's inappropriate and mine may be different,
but --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- we're not talking
about anything that's -- resembles the accusations
that we've discussed here.  So that would be an -- a
flat no to any man.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did your or Mr. Epstein's
relationship with Mr. -- with Bobby Kennedy continue
into the 2000s, as far as you know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would say yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Um --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, mine, yes.  I
don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Your's -- with you.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  With me, for sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Page 246
Mr. Epstein and Mr. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, continued
to have relationships into the 2000s?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have no personal
knowledge of that.  I mean, I would -- because --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, no personal knowledge
is fine.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Another thing is that
everyone puts us together like a monolith.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He literally had a
separate life from me.  I literally had a separate
life from him.  Now, did they say?  Well, of course
they did.  I'm not-- that's -- I'm not crazy.
           But he kept a lot to himself and he didn't
like to share.  He was not a sharer.  Well, at least
not with me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Mr. Epstein didn't share,
you're saying?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not with me, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- do you know
somebody named Cheryl Mills?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Used to work in the White
House as a lawyer?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, I do.  Yes.
Page 247
           TODD BLANCHE:  How do you know Ms. Mills?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met Ms. Mills
through President Clinton.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember a --
generally, the timeframe that you -- you met her?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do, actually.  Hang
on.  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to remember -- I'm
trying to get my dates right.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Approximately.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, okay.  I can't
get my dates right.  But it's something you probably
can -- going to be in the early 2000s.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So what I don't
recall --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say 2002.
I'm going to say 2002, 2003.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So it was after President
Clinton left office?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so it was in the 2000s.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Definitely.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how -- what -- how did
you meet her?  What were the circumstances under
Page 248
which you met Ms. Mills?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I went on a trip with
the President to South America.
           TODD BLANCHE:  With which president?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, sorry.
President Clinton.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Okay.  Just, you
know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- just wanted -- it was --
I just wanted to make sure it was clear.
           Okay.  So you went on a trip to -- to
where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Latin America.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And who -- and so Ms. Mills
was on that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And President Clinton was
on that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who else was on that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Doug Band.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who worked with President
Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.

(Pages 249 to 252)
(Pages 249 to 252)
Page 249
           TODD BLANCHE:  And was Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what was the purpose of
that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, the President
had -- I don't know.  I mean, I -- the President met
with -- I can't even remember every -- all the, I
know, presidents and we were in --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was this part of President
Clinton's work after he left office with the -- with
his foundation?  Or was -- meaning what --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think the
foundation, when did the --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- was it something for him
or was it --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  When did the -- I
don't remember when the Clinton Global Initiative
started.
           So if you date me -- if you give me that
date, I can tell you if it was pre or post.  Because
without that, I can't pin the reason.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Do you remember what it was
for or not?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I don't recall.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
Page 250
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, that's -- don't over
think or under think the reason for my questions.
           I don't -- I don't have any idea why you
went on that trip, so I don't know an answer that I'm
getting from you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I'm just trying to
be as accurate as possible and give you the
information that you seek.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why would you -- do you
remember why you were invited to go?  Like were you
-- were you friends with somebody?  What was your
role going on that trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I didn't have a role.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So do you remember why --
do you remember who invited you to go?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  If -- probably
Doug Band.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how did you know Doug?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because Doug and --
again, back with Philip Levine.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Got it.  And do you know
whether he had a relationship with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Who?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Doug.
Page 251
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I don't know.  I
mean, nothing.  He -- I don't believe there was any
relationship, other than I helped -- well, without
me, I don't think there would've been those flights,
because I was the one who asked Epstein to provide
the plane for -- well, certainly I remember the one
to Africa, of course, that big trip.
           And I thought it was an honor and a
privilege to be part of something so amazing and to
have an opportunity to spend time with a man that I
found truly extraordinary.
           And please, I don't mean it in any other
way, other than as a former fantastic ex-president.
I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I was asking around the
question, but I'll just ask it:  like, were you
basically asked to go because you were kind of
responsible for the plane?
           Responsible is the wrong word.  They use
you -- they were able to use you to make sure that
they could -- you helped them get Mr. Epstein's plane
for the trip?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I don't even know
if when I was on that -- in fact, I think -- I think,
that trip, I'm not even sure that Epstein had met the
Page 252
President.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think this is -- but
if I'm right, and I think I am, I think that trip
happened when Epstein and Clinton had never even --
not that they'd never met, because Epstein had gone
to the White House, but they had not met.
           I'd never asked Epstein for the plane then
because they'd never met and it would be weird.  But
they met because of me and the plane was because of
me.  But that trip was the first, I think, the first
trip I took with the ex-president.  And I don't
believe Epstein and he had met.
           And we're talking a time period when I was
trying to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- leave.  Not very
successfully obviously, but I was branching out on my
own and being more independent of Mr. Epstein and
trying to -- all kinds of businesses that I was into.
           I was trying to start the first telehealth
medicine with the Cleveland Clinic.  I mean, I'm not
going to bore you, because I don't think that's what
you guys are interested in, but those were the sorts
of things that I was looking for him to finance, so

(Pages 253 to 256)
(Pages 253 to 256)
Page 253
that I could stop being, you know, a general manager
of a hotel.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- so did you take
other trips with some or all of those individuals,
kind of without Mr. Epstein in later years?  Like,
you said that was the first time that you had kind of
been on something like that and it was an honor and
you were spending time with former President Clinton
and others.
           Were there other -- over the years, did
you do that more than once?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We'll talk about those.
Like multiple times, like too many to count or there
three or four times.  Like how many times?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  A lot.  A lot.  I went
on a lot of trips.  Now I don't recall all of them.
Not because I'm trying to be evasive or anything, but
I just don't remember them all.
           And after a while, you know, in the
incredible job that you have, all of you, that when
you're so high pressured and you're spending so much
time with extraordinary people like you do with
President Trump, it -- it can blur.  It just does.
           And those few things that stand out,
Page 254
because at the end it's all just extraordinary as
cars and sirens and president.  It's like, whoa,
okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So, I understand, but
talk -- so don't give me spec- --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- I understand you can't
give specific numbers.  What -- describe more about
kind of your, that part of your life and your
relationship.  I'm using "relationship."  You don't
like relationships.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right, right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And your -- sorry.  And
your --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My employer.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.  Just describe your --
what you were doing with those individuals.  So when
I say "those individuals," I'm talking about former
President Clinton, Doug, other folks that worked with
him.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All of them.  Yes.
There were loads of them.  And just all of them, you
know the team, I don't need to give you all the
names.  You have them at your fingertips and I can
confirm.  If you give me names, I'll say yes, because
Page 255
they're not all going to pop into my head, so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Right.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So I started
spending a lot of time.  I don't want to characterize
that, but I started spending time with the former
President and with Doug and his team.
           And then it -- I had no purpose, really,
other than I had -- I obviously offered something, I
don't know, ideas of -- I don't know.
           Anyway.  And he started to travel.  I
don't remember if the first trip was Africa or how it
went, but at some point, I think there was actually
two trips, but I'm not sure.  So there was to Europe
and then to Africa, I think maybe it was all one
trip.
           And at some point, Mr. Epstein said he
didn't want to go on the trip and he was going
somewhere else and he just left.  And I was like,
well, okay.  And so I ended up doing the whole trip
without Mr. Epstein or his plane.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when you were traveling
with them, what were the purposes of the trips?  Like
is this one --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think these were
all -- I think actually it was the AIDS, was one of
Page 256
the primary ones, for his AIDS Foundation, when he
was working to do that.  And there were always a
humanitarian side to the trips.
           And we went to Egypt and to, there was --
oh, yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So there -- so it sounds
like you're describing one -- right now, one trip
with lots of stops.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It could be, but I
have a feeling that I went on other trips, but I
can't remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you -- when you went
on these --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I went to London.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Went to London.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if that's
the same trip.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you went on these
trips, that -- were you always on Mr. Epstein's
plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- Or did you sometimes
accompany them on a different plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How many were on

(Pages 257 to 260)
(Pages 257 to 260)
Page 257
Mr. Epstein's plane?  Again, I'm not holding you to
exact, but --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That was a full, that
was packed.  Because it was a lot of secret service.
It took all the Secret Service as well.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So it was whatever the
detail is for Secret Service, it's a lot.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And on how many occasions,
besides the trip you just described, were there other
times when they used -- when President Clinton and
the folks he was with, used Mr. Epstein's plane?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was --
there was twice, maybe.  There was that.  But it will
reflect on the logs.  There won't be anything that's
not on the logs that you have already.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Were you, by the way,
responsible for the logs in any way?  Like, you've
seen the logs and they're public and you have them in
discovery.
           But over the years when you were working
with or for Mr. Epstein, did you have access to the
logs?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was, not.  No,
never.  The pilots -- the logbook was their personal
Page 258
logbook.
           I never even saw them have it.  I never
saw them fill it in.  And then there was a second set
of logs, the -- the flight manifests.  And I never
saw those either.  I was never -- I was never
allowed, I suppose.  Because he didn't want me to
see.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- so do you
know whether Mr. Epstein had a separate relationship
with -- with President Clinton, different from the
what you just described?  So different than being
with him, with respect to his foundation or something
like this?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would say no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When's the last time that
you went on a trip or saw President Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was in -- was late
2000 and, I don't know, '16, '17, '18, something
in -- it was in Los Angeles.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what was the purpose of
that meeting?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think he was hosting
something or he was at an event and I was in L.A. and
I had dinner with him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Had -- did you ever meet
Page 259
Secretary Clinton, Hillary Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When did you meet her?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say --
again, please don't hold me to it, but I want to say
that it was on a flight that came from the island
from -- not from the island, from the Nantucket or --
or Martha's Vineyard back to New York, is what I
think.  I might be wrong.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So some -- an East
Coast island, like Nantucket --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- Or something like this?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  No, -- the
Clint- -- the ex-president never came to the island.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did you -- is that the
only time that you met Hillary Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I went to the
house in Chappaqua a few times.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And why did you go to the
house?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was invited.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Just to see
President Clinton or Hillary Clinton or both or --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah, I mean, as a
Page 260
friend, not for -- I don't -- there was no -- I don't
remember any reason, either was somehow I
communicated that was in coming, driving back past
Chappaqua or if they were home and stop in.
           And it's -- I know it sounds a little
flippant, but it could -- it could have even
something as --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether
Mr. Epstein had -- knew or had any sort of visit
dealings or -- associated with Hillary Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would say no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did you ever see
them together?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- do you know whether
Mr. Epstein ever did any business transactions with
the Clintons?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I would -- well, I'm
not sure I can.  I'm not sure how to quite -- I don't
know the answer to that strictly, because, I was -- I
was part of the beginning process of the Clinton
Global Initiative.
           And that was something that I helped with
and that was me, and Epstein may have helped me help
them.  And in that context, he may well have involved

(Pages 261 to 264)
(Pages 261 to 264)
Page 261
himself, but only in the context of something that I
was trying to do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when you say "involved
himself," meaning like, give money to the Clinton
Global Initiative or something like this?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, so there's that.
I think he did do that.  And that, I believe, the
money that he may have given could have been
independent of me.  But I think it's just easier if I
just tell you how it happened, rather than --
otherwise it sounds all odd and funky.  I went to
Davos with a former president and I -- have you been
to Davos?
           TODD BLANCHE:  In what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Have you been to
Davos?
           TODD BLANCHE:  I have not.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Well, you know,
it's a -- you know what it is, right?  Okay.  So --
and I was -- I thought the former president should
have his own Davos, because it would be -- and they
had -- it turned out, that they had been thinking
about it anyway.
           And so we were talking about it and, you
know, it's a very heavy lift to get something like
Page 262
that to go.  And I was friendly with one of the
people who had -- I don't know if he was at the
beginning of Davos or -- but he was running Davos.
           It was just -- I don't know, hard to
describe his actual role at Davos and had
conversations with him about what did he think, you
know?  Oh, just because I was having dinner with him
about if Clinton could get something like that to go,
what was his thoughts?
           And he was very, very enthusiastic.  I
mean, he was like, that's just an incredible idea.
So I put them together.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who -- what's that person's
name?  Do you remember?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I knew you were going
to ask me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can -- I can --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Just -- you said -- I
didn't know if you knew his -- if you remember his
name.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do know.  I do, but
I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Can't remember his name.
Okay.
Page 263
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It will come to me.
It may come to me tomorrow, but eventually these
things, like, surface from -- like in the middle of
the night, I was scribbling names --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- that I couldn't
remember from yesterday.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But his name will come
to me, and if not, we can find it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So you -- when
the -- just still stay -- staying on your
relationship with -- sorry, the -- your association
with the Clintons.
           You were part of the ramp up or the
startup of the Clinton Global Initiative --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- and helping them in
supporting that effort.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- I would say very
central to that, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And Mr. Epstein, was he
part of the work around that or just in support of
you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He supported me to
Page 264
help them, but then I think he may have tried to use
that to insert himself in some way, that would not
have surprised me at all.
           And I know that he was annoying, in terms
that I could catch him on the phone and he wouldn't
always agree with what I wanted to do.  And I was
like, it's not your idea.  I don't really care what
you think, but that didn't go over so well.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh, I just want to
say, it wasn't my idea for his CGI.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Wasn't your -- say it
again.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It's not my idea.
They had had that idea before.  I just helped bring
key personnel to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  You're saying the idea of
President Clinton kind of having his own Davos
like --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not -- I'm not
owning.  I didn't -- that's not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understood.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't want anyone --
I don't try to elevate myself in any form of
importance here.

(Pages 265 to 268)
(Pages 265 to 268)
Page 265
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, I understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you go to Davos with
President Clinton more than once or just once?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can't remember.
Once for sure.  And I think maybe twice, but I don't
remember.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- and you're not, I
think you said, you don't -- you're not aware of
President Clinton ever going to the island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He never.  Absolutely
never went.  And I can be sure of that because
there's no way he would've gone -- I don't believe
there's any way that he would've gone to the island,
had I not been there.  Because I don't believe he had
an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein.
           Did they speak?  Did he go?  Yes, but
that's very different from going to spend time on an
island.
           And plus, the story as told is so patently
absurd that I flew him in the helicopter.  I am a
helicopter pilot, that is true.  But the notion of me
flying an ex-president in a machine.  That would
terrify me.  I would never even take that
responsibility.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, no.  I'm not
Page 266
-- I'm -- no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- did you ever go with
President Clinton to any of Epstein -- Mr. Epstein's
properties?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- so like New Mexico,
Palm Beach, or in New York?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I have no memory of
him in any of those places.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When you were in London
with President Clinton, did you -- did you ever go to
your -- to your flat with him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think he did.
I don't -- I don't think so, because this, like, it's
like -- he wouldn't even -- he wouldn't even be able
to carry all his Secret Service with him.  I don't
think so, no.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Do you know -- we
talked a little about the Duchess of York, about
Sarah Ferguson yesterday.
           Did -- when's the -- when the last time
you, like -- when's the last time you, you saw her?
Like, were you -- were you -- do you have a -- were
you with her or hang out with her, socializing with
her, in the '90s, 2000s?  Both?
Page 267
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She's -- well, I had
a -- I don't know if she liked me very much.  I think
my friendship with her ex-husband -- well, sometimes
she really did like me and sometimes she didn't.  So
maybe a frenemy, I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- it was always
friendly when we were together, but I think that
there was some latent hostility.  And I --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Is that something you've
heard since everything came out or along the way you
felt that way?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, that's how I felt.
That -- that is a characterization of myself.  That's
how I felt about her.  I would never -- I was always
friendly with her.  I mean, she's -- I mean, I've
seen her many, many times and she's also super, super
close with other people I'm very good friends with in
England.  I think that -- I think that she liked
Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you think that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  My female intuition.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Discovery.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Oh.
Page 268
           LEAH SUFFIAN:  The letter.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't remember it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  It's okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  I don't -- it's
possible that there's things -- well, I know -- it's
not possible.  I know that there is discovery, but I
don't recall.  But I think she had a thing for him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did -- there's some actors
or some folks from Hollywood that I want to ask you
about, just to understand whether you knew them or
Mr. Epstein knew them.  Chris Tucker?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How did you know
Mr. Tucker?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think only from that
flight to Africa.  But I do think that they met --
           TODD BLANCHE:  You say that flight to
Africa, the one we were just talking about with --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- President Clinton?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sorry, go ahead.  Yep.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But I also think that
they kept a little bit in touch and I think we met,
or I have a memory of him maybe in L.A., I don't

(Pages 269 to 272)
(Pages 269 to 272)
Page 269
know.  I think they sort of loosely stayed in touch.
I wouldn't -- I don't think it -- I don't know.  I
don't know how to say that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know Mr. Tucker
besides that flight?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And do you know whether --
when you say you think that they kept in touch, you
mean you think that Mr. Epstein and Mr. Tucker --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  They may have.  I
didn't, but he might have.  I'm not sure.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Kevin Spacey?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I know him also from
that same flight.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Aside from that flight, do
you know him from any other thing?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Naomi Campbell?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, I do know Naomi,
and I knew her before I met Mr. Epstein and Mr. --
former President Clinton.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Epstein separately knew Ms. Campbell?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think she -- he
probably met her through me, that I imagine.
Page 270
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so for those three,
Mr. Tucker, Mr. Spacey, and Ms. Campbell, did they
ever travel to any of Mr. Epstein's properties; the
island or New Mexico?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Not Mr. Tucker --
well, not to my knowledge Mr. Tucker or Mr. Spacey.
           Naomi Campbell may have.
           TODD BLANCHE:  To where?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She may have gone --
well, she certainly -- well, I believe she visited
him in Palm Beach, and I believe she may have gone to
the island and she may have gone to see his house in
New York.  Whether she went to New Mexico or Paris as
well, maybe.  They were friends or friendly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Were you -- what you just
said "she may have," were you on those trips?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't have any
independent memory of that, so I'm not sure.  I don't
think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Her relationship, her
friendship, her -- I think you're making me use your
word.  Her -- her friendship, whatever, with
Mr. Epstein was independent of me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  But you also had a
Page 271
separate friendship with her before you met
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Larry Summers, the
former Secretary of the Treasury.
           Do you know that person?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met Mr. Summers
through Mr. Epstein.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the same question, just
generally time period, are you talking about early
2000s, '90s, a little after that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I honestly really
don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did want to say
something.  I forgot that there was -- yesterday.
You asked me about Mr. Epstein's properties.  He had
a rental in Boston as well, but it -- not for very
long, but it was another place that I had to put
together.  And I only went with him once and he would
go there independently of me.  No, I would not go
with him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Was that in the '90s?
Page 272
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Mr. Summers, do you know
why -- do you know what his relationship was with
Mr. Epstein; business, personal, both, or don't you
know?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think he spoke to
Mr. Epstein about business a lot, but I think they
were friends.  They were friendly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Summers ever traveled on Mr. Epstein's planes to
any of the properties that Mr. Epstein owned?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He may have, but I
don't think, if he did, I was on any of the flights.
I mean, those are another issues.  I mean, I went --
I traveled so, so much that I really -- the flights
just blur.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I understand.
           George Soros?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think he knew
him.  I did, but I don't think he did.  I don't
think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  How did you know Mr. Soros?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was friends with his
kids.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- which kids?

(Pages 273 to 276)
(Pages 273 to 276)
Page 273
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Jon and -- I can't
think of his other child.  I can't think of -- I
mean, I've lost his name.
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Alexander.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Who?
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Alexander.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I met him, but just
socially.  He may not remember even having met me.  I
was excited to meet him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When are you thinking --
when would you have met him?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  If I met him it -- I
think it was either at an event or at his kids -- it
wouldn't have been at his house.  An event, I
think -- or I think actually, no, in the Hamptons I
met him.  He was staying at somebody's house.  If --
if my memory serves.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And what was your
relationship?  How did you know his kids?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I was out and about in
New York a lot.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So just socially?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Just socially, yes.
And -- yeah, just socially, I think.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- do you know
Page 274
whether Mr. Soros or his kids ever traveled on
Mr. Epstein's planes?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Ever visit either the
island or New Mexico or --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I don't think so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Paris?  No?
           Okay.  So I -- we tried to -- to identify
names that have come up, either publicly or in -- in
other lawsuits.  Are there any names that you -- that
come to mind that we haven't, we've talked about a
lot of names.  A lot of names.
           Are there some folks that you think we've
forgotten to ask you about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, you asked me
about names and I have some names, and I just want to
give you some context for the names as well.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Sure.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So we talked about
Elizabeth Johnson yesterday.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Uh-huh.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  She had a boyfriend
and he was Frederic Fekkai, the hairdresser.  And he
and Epstein were friendly, very friendly.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then what time period
Page 275
are you talking about?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like '90s, or 2000s, or
both?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think the 2000s,
actually, for that.  You can date that because it was
from when he -- I think he probably knew Frederic
before he dated Elizabeth.  But --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And when you say they were
very friendly, did they go -- did they travel
together?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if they
traveled together, I mean, Epstein didn't go out very
much or -- I mean, he did go out, but not -- and
sometimes if he did, I think he would go out and
maybe see Fred- -- Frederic.
           And then there was -- I mean, he had a
bunch of guys that he would -- I would know that he
would see or meet, but he really -- I guess now -- so
he had new friends.  I -- I don't know, but --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  What other names?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay, so Henry
Jarecki, who had an island near his.  Henry was a
financier who was the guy who cornered the silver
market back in the day.
Page 276
           TODD BLANCHE:  He had an island in the
Caribbean -- in the Caribbean near Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.  In the British
Virgin Islands.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And there was
Branson's island there.  Now I know that there's an
allegation that they met.  I -- I think -- I think I
remember that I went to Richard Branson's island with
Mr. Epstein, and maybe he went another time, but I
don't -- I wouldn't characterize Richard Branson and
him as friends, but he did go and I think I went with
him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know whether
Mr. Branson ever came to Mr. Epstein's island?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  If he did, I was not
there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So -- but it's
possible, so --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Understood.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I wanted to ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  Who else?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Marvin Minsky.  He had
a group of scientists that he was very, very friendly

(Pages 277 to 280)
(Pages 277 to 280)
Page 277
with, all centered around Harvard.  So I remember
him.
           Martin Nowak, who's a mathematician.
Stephen Jay Gould.  I don't know if Stephen Jay Gould
was -- came through the Harvard angle, but I know
that there was a -- he would -- excuse me, Epstein
would have dinners at the house that I was tasked to
organize and the scientists were a very major
component of that.
           They weren't social dinners as much as
they were scientific.  He would discuss whatever he
would discuss.  But if you were in the area of brain
cognition or -- he would invite them to the house and
they would come, all of them.  All -- any name you
can name, they would be there.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So let's talk about that
top -- that relation -- those -- those associations
or relationships he had with the mathematicians or --
and with Harvard, and I think with MIT, to some
extent as well.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Official
(indiscernible) MIT too, yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What -- from what you
observed, what's the reason behind him having --
developing those ties with Harvard, with MIT, and
Page 278
with certain professors and others associated with
those institutions?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He really was
profoundly interested in that area of science and in
the brain, and in -- I mean, if you were in --
Stephen Jay Gould or the major scientist on
happiness, I mean, it -- it came, I believe, from a
genuine area of interest, not from anything ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how did he -- how did
he become friends with them?  How -- how was he able
to spend time with them?  Meaning, did he donate to
the university and then they were kind of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Certain --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- it was mandatory fun for
them or did he have relations with them where he
would, you know --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know the
chicken --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- host them or --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't if the chicken
or the egg came first.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But -- but when I met
him first, I mean, he was already doing a lot of this
stuff.  This is not -- I -- I've read, so this is why
Page 279
I'm saying this.  I was not responsible for these --
for this area of interest.  I mean, I certainly --
sorry, just to bounce a second before it slips my
mind and I leave something out.
           There was an institute in New Mexico
called -- anyone?  The institute of -- it's very
famous.  We're not talking to the Alamos.
           Anyway, all right.  There's a very famous
institute in New Mexico, so you can look it up.
You'll -- it'll come to you at the minute you put it
in your computer.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And there had some of
the biggest brains ever.  Those -- that relationship
came through me, so I -- that's me.  And that is
because my father was -- one of the major scientific
hit up my family fortune, when I had one, came from
scientific publishing.
           And when it started from the thing that
you were asking me yesterday, my father was in the
Second World War, I told you, and he won the military
cross, and then he actually did become what was part
of intelligence back in the war.  And his job was to
interrogate German scientists and prisoners of war.
           And then that parleyed into business with
Page 280
Springer-Verlag and then into Pergamon Press, which
was the scientific journals business.  And he had an
interest -- he believed that it's -- knowledge is
what would prevent war.
           And the biggest scientific discoveries --
well, not all of them, but many of them are coming
from the Eastern block and that's how we have the
relationship with Santa Fe Institute.
           And Murray Gell-Mann, specifically.  And I
introduced Epstein to Murray Gell-Mann.  Sorry, to go
off on a tangent.
           TODD BLANCHE:  This is at the Santa Fe
Institute?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes, thank you.  And
Murray Gell-Mann was there, and Murray Gell-Mann and
Epstein got along very, very well.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And he was the man of
the (unintelligible).  Sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So do you know whether --
so while you -- when you meet Mr. Epstein in the
early '90s continuing on, so not what he had done
before, did he -- why do you think, from what you saw
or what you heard, he had the relationship or wanted
to have the relationships that he had with Harvard

(Pages 281 to 284)
(Pages 281 to 284)
Page 281
and with -- and with MIT?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I think that that
may have come with Wexner.  I'm not sure, but that's
something that I think that Wexner maybe had a
relationship with Harvard, and that he used that
relationship to, I believe, he funded a lot.
           And if he didn't, that his clients of
which Wexner obviously was one, would fund.  And he
would -- he would then make -- he would arrange the
fund or --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- organize the fund,
or I don't know.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I'm going to take -- we'll
take a break in a -- in a minute, but just to kind of
set us up for what we're going to talk about next.
           Mr. Ep- -- we talked yesterday morning
about Mr. Epstein's kind of business and how he had
money.  Did he seem to live beyond his means, as far
as what he was making?
           So did you ever get the sense while you
were with him, that it was suspicious or curious how
he was able to have the funds to, you know, buy, you
know, two planes, you know, an island, and
New Mexico, you know, the ranch, almost -- almost
Page 282
unlimited funds?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  You said it perfectly.
I thought it was astonishing, but I didn't have any
reason to believe that it came from anything
nefarious.
           I saw him work.  I never saw him really do
anything, other than be on the phone, there's that,
and he had a lot of meetings, but he had a lot of
accounts.
           And he dealt with pretty much every
financier that you could care to mention.  And if I
could have access to the names, I'd be able to tell
you which ones you -- I just don't remember them all.
           But in every bank, Goldman, Lehman, all of
them, to my mind anyway.  And most of the major
businessmen at that time, he was in the Council of
Foreign Relations, so you had access.  That's an
extraordinary list of people.  It just is.
           And then he -- you asked me about his, but
I -- so I thought about it last night, how to try and
explain what it was and I think the best thing is to
focus only on Wexner's business.
           So I was present for some of their
meetings in some of their business, and I listened.
And so things that I personally recollect, and I know
Page 283
I heard, was that he would -- when I told you
yesterday, I think, that he would, no detail was too
small, so he would do the contracts with the staff, I
think, and I saw that myself.
           And he also organized all the trusts for
all the children, so if Wexner had kids -- and
Wexner -- I don't know if he did, he did have
children.  So every time there was a child, he would
create a trust for that child.
           And I don't -- these were complex
financial structures that would contain stocks of the
various businesses.  He restructured, when I was
there, Wexner's business in its entirety, as I
recollect.
           And then not only that, but there were
business interests, so Wexner owned or build, or
designed, or I don't quite know how to characterize
it, but New Albany, which is a center outside of
Ohio, Columbus, Ohio, specifically.
           And he built -- I remember this
conversation, he built himself a very large house,
like truly enormous and it's one of the biggest
private homes I've ever been to.
           And he built all the houses around him,
and I'm like, this is so random, why would you do
Page 284
that?  And he said to me, well, because I want to
make sure that the people around me are my friends --
I want my friends around me and my neighbors.  And I
was like, well, whatever.  Okay, you know.  I've been
around enormous wealth my whole life, and I've like
-- at some point I just say, okay, whatever.  I get
it, and I don't.  And so that's what he did.
           But Epstein ran New Albany, which included
a country club and a golf club and a -- I mean, gosh,
your boss is one of the all-time great, you know,
businessmen in this area.  You know what that is.
And he certainly does.
           So there'd be that, and there was a
business business that Epstein -- well, he told me he
owned it, but of course, I can't say that for sure,
because I don't know, but it's a sports thing.
Riddell, is that a business?  Riddell's?  I thought
about it last night.  It's red and had hats, helmets.
Riddell's?
           LEAH SAFFIAN:  Riddell.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Riddell.  Yeah,
Riddell's.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Now, how he owned
that -- well, he told me he owned it, but how he

(Pages 285 to 288)
(Pages 285 to 288)
Page 285
owned that, I -- but that was before I think I came
in and he had it, or he said he did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Got it.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And he had other
businesses.  He had -- I know this notion that he did
nothing and he just was a grifter and whatnot.
           Okay.  I'm not going to say that's not
true, but it's not what I saw and it's not what I
believe is true.  Not because it couldn't have been
that he didn't grift or whatever the word is off --
off people, but I saw where I thought looked like
real work.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, why don't we take
a -- take a break.  Okay.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Yeah.  Thank you.
           SPENCER HORN:  All right.  The time is now
10:35 and we'll take a break.
           (Off the record at 10:35 a.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  We are resuming from break.
The time is 10:49 on Friday, July 25th.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  All right.  So we've
talked around this issue, but -- talked about it a
little bit.  I want to spend the next hour or so or
however long it takes.
           When you -- when we -- I want to talk,
Page 286
focus kind of exclusively on Epstein and like his
criminal conduct with respect to women.
           Do you -- you said yesterday a couple
times that, like, you now kind of recognize or think
that there was things that he did that you didn't
know about, and that he kept from you or that you
didn't see.
           What did you see?  So you said yesterday,
and I'm not -- I'm not trying to put words in your
mouth, but at some point he was getting massages
seven days a week, sometimes multiple massages a day.
Women have said that -- that were there -- that say
they were there giving him massages, said that those
included some sort of sexual conduct, however, you
define that in the broadest sense, not just a
traditional massage, regularly.
           So what do you -- what did you see and
hear at the time?  And then I think, aside from what
you saw and heard at the time, now that you've been
through what you've been through and heard people say
what they've said, and read what they read, what do
you -- where does that leave you in your mind with
what happened?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So I saw
Epstein with women.  I mean, what I mean by that is
Page 287
he would have women around him, or women on the
plane, or women in his house, or -- that's how I'm
explaining that.
           Those women were very interested.  What --
my characterization of the interest -- the
relationships between all women that I saw with him
and him, was characterized by -- excuse me, their
interest in him as I would see it.
           And by that, I mean, I never saw anybody
who didn't want to be with him and be with him, maybe
socially or whatever.  I never saw anybody, not under
any form of duress in any type of situation where
they were, as I would characterize it, looking
uncomfortable or in any way distressed.
           In the entire time I was with him or
traveled with him, I never saw that.  So any time I
saw anybody with him, they were happy to be with him.
He would ask people all the time, whoever you were,
to massage his feet.
           It just was -- he'd be sitting there, and
he'd have somebody massage his feet, or squeeze his
shoulders, or -- I saw that a lot.  It was an
ubiquitous interaction, if you will.
           So I did see that.  I saw physicality, but
not anything that was -- I don't know how to
Page 288
characterize it, anything that looked aggressive, I
suppose, to define that.  So I never saw an
aggressive move.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw anything
that was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Non-consensual.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Thank you.  Okay.  I
never saw anything that was non-consensual.  So if
he -- well, maybe they didn't -- I never saw anything
that looked like they didn't like the hug, or I never
saw what I would characterize as anything that was
unconsensual.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you see -- did you see
him either receiving or participating in sexual
conduct during massages?  Understanding you never saw
something nonconsensual.
           Did you see him engage in sexual conduct
during massages?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, you could define
sexual conduct as in, I did see women who could have
been, you know, less than normally clad for massage,
but especially on the island where they would be in a
bikini or possibly even topless, yeah, I did see
that.  So you would --

(Pages 289 to 292)
(Pages 289 to 292)
Page 289
           TODD BLANCHE:  But what about in -- so --
yes, I agree, that's one area.  Like -- so women who
were either not clothed or topless with just a bottom
on.  But beyond that, did you see as part of that him
touching them?
           And again, I'm not talking about consent
or not consent or age or -- you know, I'm saying like
there's multiple, multiple, you know, dozens and
dozens of women who have said that they were -- that
they engaged in sexual contact.  And I agree, there's
a broad range of what that can -- how that can be
defined, but defining it in the broadest of terms.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So him being physical
with women?  I did see that, but nothing that was not
consensual.  And to address the issue of the large
number of women who today say that he was
non-consensual coercive with them.  I'm not sure.
I -- in my mind I sort of have to characterize the
two distinct areas.  There's one where is the women
who are not of age.  Therefore, anything with them is
immediately unconsensual.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Correct, yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So let's start -- I
want to define anyone who's underage versus anybody
who's over age, because I do think that there's a
Page 290
very significant differential between the two.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So does the law.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  Okay.  So --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't mean that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, no.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not trying to be
smart.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I agree with you.  Yes, I
agree with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So I want to
deal with the thing, which is really why we're here.
I mean, not that I'm not going to deal with the
other, but I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- want to make a
distinction with underage situation, because there's
nothing about that that's right.
           I never saw anything with anybody who was
certainly to be categorical in my -- from my trial.
           Let's deal with that, because that's
something that I can say in -- I never saw that with
them at all.  And I would say that as -- as
described, anyway, in my trial did not happen as
described.
Page 291
           I'm not saying that Mr. Epstein did not do
those things.  I'm not casting those -- I'm not going
to say -- I don't feel comfortable saying that today,
given what I now know to be true.  So I am not here
to defend him.
           But what I can say is that I did not
participate in that activity.  And --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So let's divide this into
two areas.  Maybe there's more, but we'll start with
two areas.  One is there was testimony and there's
certainly been depositions and public statements,
that some of these young women had conversations with
you about their age.
           So, for example, conversations about the
fact that they were in high school or conversations
about the fact that they wanted to go to college one
day, which would necessarily mean -- well, not
necessarily, but would be more likely to mean that
they were in high school when they talked to you
about that.
           And so, were there times -- were there
women that you knew were underage?  And I say that
because that's different than whether they were
sexually abused in any way by Mr. Epstein, just
merely their age and going to give him a massage?
Page 292
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, I never knew that
and I can categorically state that had any child said
to me that they were 14, 15, 16, maybe not 17,
because 17 in England, I mean, if someone had said
they were 17, I don't -- but I've read so much that
that did happen.
           I mean, I just -- I had no -- I would
never have permitted such a thing, I would not -- I
don't even know what I would have done.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So some of the -- I think
even someone who testified at trial, but certainly
have publicly talked about, was as young as 14 when
she was introduced to Mr. Epstein.
           In -- in your mind today, you don't -- you
kind of reject that that happened, that you saw that,
meaning you don't recall any obviously under 18 woman
coming to give him a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, I believe you're
talking about Jane, and I'm --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- very happy to
address that.  I actually don't think that the
testimony is correct.  I don't believe --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, look, I don't --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  No, no, I'm

(Pages 293 to 296)
(Pages 293 to 296)
Page 293
not -- I just wanted to tell you how --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, yeah, I don't want to
get into --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, no, no, I'm not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- he said, she said.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- no, no.  Absolutely
not.  I'm not -- I don't want to go there either.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm not going to do
that.  But I believe that what took place, with a lot
of these people, is that there was a slide, right?
           So there was a zone and I -- he did meet
her and I did meet her, and I knew that she was a
young child and I knew that she was not an adult,
because -- but I don't believe he met her 'til she
was 16.
           So I'm not -- I'm not doing a he said, she
said, I'm not doing that, because nobody will.
That's not what we're here for.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But he didn't meet her
'til she was 16, and the entire testimony of the 14,
15, and 16-year-old is, therefore, not accurate.
           Did I meet her when she was 16 with her
mother?  I absolutely did.  And did I know that she

was young?  I absolutely did.
           But everything that took place that was
alleged at trial at the 14, and 15, and 16, is not
accurate.  And -- I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  There's testimony or
there's -- and again, I'm using testimony in the
broadest sense.  Some of this is just public
statements or something that's come out in civil
lawsuits about you and Mr. Epstein giving, like an
-- you're turning 18 birthday card to somebody,
which again, if true would, by definition mean you
knew that she was under 18.
           Do you recall doing that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do not.  I mean, no
memory of that at all.  And I believe that would be
the person that called herself Kate has now announced
herself in her own podcast for who she really is.
           Her name is 
.  So I did not meet
 until actually, she was either 20 or 21.  So
it would be very hard for me to have given her an 18
birthday card.  And the testimony -- there's also --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you accept --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- that slid back.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- do you accept that at
some point, and we talked about this yesterday about
Page 295
how Mr. Epstein changed, but at some point,
Mr. Epstein definitely preferred younger women?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I accept.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I think you said
yesterday, but say it again since we're talking about
it.  Is that something that you, in your mind, one of
the areas where he changed from when you first met
him until later?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I -- when -- I just
also want it to be clear, I never understood that
change to encompass children.  I did see from when I
met him, he was involved or -- involved or friends
with or whatever, however you want to characterize
it, with women who were in their 20s.  And then the
slide to, you know, 18 or younger looking women.  But
I never considered that this would encompass criminal
behavior.  It never ...
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so when you read, I
guess, two different times, right?  One was during
the Florida investigation, when --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- there were eventually
public statements from some of these now women who
testified about what they did with Mr. Epstein when
they were under 18.
Page 296
           At that point, did you realize or did you
think to yourself, this happened or this could have
happened, I missed it, or were you at that point
still in the mindset that they were either not
telling the truth or were not remembering what
happened the way that -- accurately?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's a very fair
question.  So I think that my view of this at that
time, to call it as contemporaneously as it did,
because I don't think that stuff came out in public,
right?  I mean, I may have read things, but I
don't -- my first real ---
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, that's fair.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- memory of that is
at the trial.  But my viewpoint, if you will, was set
from the minute that 
 lied in her civil
deposition.  And I could never recover from that,
because --
           TODD BLANCHE:  What are you -- what are
you -- which lie, what are you referring to?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Her entire
characterization --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- of -- no, I don't
remember how she came and whether I did, --

Page 297
           TODD BLANCHE:  I see.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- but I'm talking
about the first time she came to Epstein's house,
which I knew --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- to be false.  So
from that first lie of that description, I could
never recover from that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I understand.  Okay.  So --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And that tainted --
sorry.  Just so that we clear it, tainted, then, the
testimony of everybody else that I saw that came post
that, because I had my own personal experience, which
I knew to be false.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  And the reason why I
think -- and I said to Mr. Markus that -- this
morning that we were going to talk about this,
because when I think about you and the public's
perception of Mr. Epstein, the public is left with
the view that nobody in the world knows what really
happened except for you, okay?
           And now you've explained, the last day and
a half, how some of that's just a misperception,
because you weren't -- you didn't have a key to his
house, you weren't around as much as maybe everybody
Page 298
claims you were, okay?
           But there still is this perception out
there that, oh my gosh, if -- if we could talk to
Ms. Maxwell, we would know how horrible Mr. Epstein
was or how misperceived he was.  Whatever the truth
is about Mr. Epstein.
           And the challenge in my mind, just to
be -- I told you I would tell you when I had
issues -- and the challenge in my mind is that so
many women have -- have said that Mr. Epstein
sexually assaulted them, whether juveniles or adults,
that I don't find it -- you know, at some -- that's
persuasive, right, that that happened.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  So --
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so if that's persuasive
then -- and I think it's without -- beyond
contestation that he preferred younger women --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I --
           TODD BLANCHE:    -- and it's also beyond,
I think at this point, there were certainly
circumstances that underage women -- well, I don't
want to say that you agree with me on that.
           I certainly believe that there were
younger age women that were abused by him, okay?  And
so -- and then so the layer that I want you to --
Page 299
that I really want to have a frank discussion about,
is some of these women have said, oh, yes, you know,
Ms. Maxwell was there, you know, to varying degrees.
She saw me there, she -- the door was open when I was
there.  And then much more egregious, right?  That
you participated and that you were part of it.
           And so what I really want you to have an
opportunity to say to us, is where on the spectrum
the truth is.  Whether it's somewhere in the middle,
whether it's one extreme or another extreme,
understanding.  In my mind, I'm talking about 1994 or
'5, to whenever, late '90s or early 2000s.
           DAVID MARKUS:  And let me just interrupt.
All I would say is, we're not here to say anything
one way or the other about Epstein.
           I agree with you that the evidence is
overwhelming against him, and he -- he is his own
person and has to deal with that.  But Ghislaine can
speak about what she knows --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yes.
           DAVID MARKUS:  -- and from her point of
view and what she did.
           And that's what you can talk about,
Ghislaine.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
Page 300
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So I think it's
helpful to put this on -- the time on the calendar,
because I think without that we, we're lost.  So I
would say we'll go from the beginning '91?  No.  '2?
No.  '3?  No.  '4?  No.  '5?  No.  '6?  No.
           In that time frame, you have the
allegations of Jane, who I dispute.  I don't think he
met her until she was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let's not talk about
individuals.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, no, no, I'm just
saying.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm with you.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But there's only --
but there's only -- so in that time period, I am only
aware of her.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm aware of a girl,
, who said, but -- and 
 and 
,
those -- I don't know of any others.
           And if there are other people who are
making allegations about, I don't -- I'm not even --
I'm not actually aware of them.  I may have read them
in the -- but I don't know.
           So I think in the early '90s period, I
DOJ REDACTION
DOJ REDAC
DOJ REDACTION

(Pages 301 to 304)
(Pages 301 to 304)
Page 301
think I'm fairly confident, and I can say that at
least as characterized, it's just -- it's just false.
It's just -- it didn't happen as said.
           Now, did it -- did it happen -- did he --
did he involve himself?  I knew about Jane, because I
saw her come to the house.  But I saw her with her
mother.  I know that her allegations are that there
were orgies, for instance.  But the people that she
suggests were in her orgies, didn't even work for
Epstein until '98 or '99.
           Did he do orgies with those people?  I
don't know anybody who was there who said that they
did.  I certainly didn't see it.  I can't say that
that happened.  Did she do it with someone else?  I
don't know.
           The stories really start -- the
allegations really begin with
.  And I think
that you have to shift his behavior, such as it was
bar, there was one in California who made an
allegation.
           There was a woman who said that she -- and
she's -- I didn't know about.  So I think I would
call her the first person.  I'd be aware of him using
his position to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But -- and sorry to
Page 302
interrupt you.  But I just want to -- I don't want --
I don't want to have you -- I don't think it's
helpful for us --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- have you kind of address
each allegation.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  I want you to clear your
mind and just tell the truth about it.  So I'm not
saying you're not telling the truth.
           I'm saying just putting aside what other
people have said, or what their lawyers have said, or
what they testified to or, you know, the rumors in
the press, push those aside, you were there.
           And so when you go back to that time
period, '92, '93, '99, 2000, 2001, during that time
period, what did you see when it comes to young women
and massages?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  All right.  Sorry.
           All right.  So I saw him receive massages.
He had regular masseuses in the '90s, people who were
standard and who traveled with him, and I saw that.
           He was living in the Iranian house, and
now that I look back, he had -- I didn't stay there,
but I would go to manage the house.  I would see
Page 303
women, models, or people that he would have come to
the house.
           I -- I know that I thought that he was
with Eva still at that time.  That's what I believed.
           And then subsequently believed that even
though she married him, I actually subsequently
believed that the baby that she had was his.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Can I interrupt for one
second?
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.  Of course.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Can I just ask some basic
top line questions?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Were you ever in a massage
room with him and a masseuse?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.  Who -- when was
that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Well, he would come in
sometimes, and he would say, like, give her a massage
here, or he would grab my -- you know, but not often.
I mean, he did come in from time to time.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Were you ever in a massage
room with him with a masseuse that was naked or
giving him any sexual favors?
Page 304
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw that.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That I remember.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.  Did you -- did you
ever -- did any of the masseuses ever discuss with
you giving -- that they gave sexual favors to
Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.  Did you ever see an
underage girl go into a massage room with
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           DAVID MARKUS:  If you had seen that, what
would you have done?  Would you have left?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I can't even conceive.
I can't even conceive of -- I can't imagine what I
would have done.
           DAVID MARKUS:  All right.  I'm sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No.  That's okay.
           DAVID MARKUS:  Okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever observe
Mr. Epstein masturbating during a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  I mean, when I'd
seen him on a massage table, I had seen him
masturbate.  I don't know if there was a masseuse
DOJ REDACTION

(Pages 305 to 308)
(Pages 305 to 308)
Page 305
present, but I've seen him on a massage --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry, I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you ever see him
masturbate with a masseuse -- you know, with a naked
woman, either giving him a massage or reporting to
give him a massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't remember
seeing that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you give him massages
by the way?  I mean, there's a photo of you rubbing
his feet, and I think, but --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never -- I certainly
have been in the massage room with him, and I have
certainly rubbed his feet when he was -- we're
talking, but I was not a masseuse and I didn't
perform massage on him.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- along -- during
the -- over the years, did you pay the masseuses?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was typically not
my job, but if there was nobody else, normally -- so
in Palm Beach, the houseman would give the money.
           And in New York, he would do that, because
I wouldn't be in New York when he -- I mean, I don't
remember ever paying a masseuse in New York.
Page 306
           TODD BLANCHE:  So it wasn't --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But maybe --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- your -- it wasn't your
job --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- on a regular math --
basis to pay the masseuse.  So if there was a
masseuse seven days a week, it wasn't expected that
seven days a week you would be the one handing them
money?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- mostly I would
not.  I'm not saying I never did it, because that
wouldn't be true.  But it was not my job to pay them.
I mostly recall he would either pay them himself, he
would have money or the houseman, and I think some of
them would have probably received checks.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so just picking up on
what Mr. Markus was just asking you, did you
participate in sexual activity with him with a
masseuse, like at the same time?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so the testi- -- I
don't know if there's testimony, but the women who
have said that that happened, categorically, that's
not true?
Page 307
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That is categorically
not true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- moving past
the -- and moving into the 2000s --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, I just want to
say that I have been -- I mean, I remember there'd be
times when he'd be getting a massage and I would be
in the room, I could be on his feet, and somebody
else could be on his feet, and we could be talking.
So there is that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But that's not -- you're --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- not talking about
something that's sexual, you're talking about
literally just rubbing his feet?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But I mean --
           TODD BLANCHE:  But that's not what I'm
talking about, I'm saying --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Well, they
could be -- the -- sometimes the women might be
topless who were giving that.  So you could say that
was sexual in that context.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, I'm talking about the
Page 308
repeated reports of certain sex acts happening with
you present and even participating?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you -- did -- in the
2000s time period, so moving a little more recently
when you talked about it yesterday, about how your
relationship with Mr. Epstein changed and was
changing and you ultimately met somebody else.
           Did you observe any, you know, massages or
young women giving him massages later on?  So after
2000, 2001 time period?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm sure I did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And was there anything
different about what you observed during that period
and the '90s, as far as the frequency, his conduct
towards them?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think the frequency
increased.  I think he went from one to two in that
time period.  And -- but I did not see -- I have no
recollection of ever seeing a child entering the
house and giving him a massage.  I -- at that time,
he had moved me out of the main house.
           I had moved into an office with John
Alessi, the former butler, under the stairs.  So I
had an office where I would be that was not part of

(Pages 309 to 312)
(Pages 309 to 312)
Page 309
that -- part of the house.
           If I saw people, and I'm not saying I
didn't see people come to give him a massage, that
wouldn't be true either.  But if I saw someone, let's
say, I wouldn't -- I don't remember ever seeing
anybody that I would characterize as a child, no.
Specifically someone who accused me of seeing her at
the time when she came.
           If I did see her, and I don't believe I
did see her or meet her at all, but if she did, she
was as her -- she's described herself now, was very
mature and looked in her 20s.
           So could somebody have come that was more
mature looking than the allegation of what she did
look like, with a photograph that was produced as
evidence?  Yes.  But I never recall at any time
seeing what I would characterize as a child coming to
give him a massage and going upstairs.  Did I see
people come?  I absolutely did.
           Did I -- I just didn't see children.  I
didn't see anybody I would think of as a child.  And
if I had seen a child, I wouldn't -- I'm not sure
what I would have done.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, did you -- just
talking, like coming out a little bit of just bigger
Page 310
picture, do you -- at the time that you were in his
life, did -- do you -- was he a -- did he seem to you
to be a sexual deviant or, I don't know what the
right way to describe it.
           But when you say to me, he was getting
massages every single day, right?  So young women
were everywhere.  Multiple massages on some days.
Flew with the women to the island, to New York,
Paris.  There's always women, they're always rubbing
him, giving him massages.  I think it's -- it would
be an understatement to say that that's not normal?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I agree.
           TODD BLANCHE:  We've all kind of been part
of the Epstein story over the past several years, but
you were there at the time.  Okay?
           What was it like at the time?  I mean, was
he a creepy guy when it came to that sort of thing?
Was he protective of how he looked publicly, image
wise?  Like at the time, what was it like?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think if he had been
creepy, like, as you would define, and you would
expect someone who was living that lifestyle to be
creepy, I don't think the women would have been
there.
           I don't think that they thought of him as
Page 311
creepy.  And if they did, I never saw them behave
like he was being weird.  Was it a lot?  Yes, it was
for sure.  I found it overwhelming, and I couldn't
understand why it was interesting, because to me,
it's not interesting.
           But he, as he defined it, he found it
invigorating.  He liked being with younger people and
not just younger people.  I'm just saying because
they gave him ideas, and they were up to date on
music and --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah, but that's different,
like, a masseuse coming every day.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I'm just telling you
what he was saying to me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I mean, to me, I just
found it a drag and difficult and annoying.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But understand I
wasn't the only person present.  So this time in the
2000s, you're talking about other people, like Sarah
Kellen, who was around, who interfaced with him.
           I didn't have to -- she was really
interfacing with Epstein at this point in time in his
life.  She was running his -- she was his assistant.
Page 312
And so I didn't have to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's a fair point.  But
move beyond the -- his assistants or the folks that
work with him.  What about his friends and the people
that were associated with him?
           It couldn't be -- it doesn't -- I don't
understand how that -- how this is an after fact of
Mr. Epstein.  So once he's arrested in Florida, it
becomes part of his story.  And then later on he's
charged in Southern District, and then here we are
now in 2025.
           But he was a very successful, hardworking
guy, and he had a lot of clients, and he flew with
them on vacations and went to the island.  It
doesn't -- I don't understand how he was able to hide
this, what seems to me to be some sort of sexual
fixation or issue --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- from -- from others?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't think he did
hide it.  I -- that's the answer.  And I think that
the people around him, I think, myself included --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- obviously,
normalized his behavior on a number of fronts.  One,

(Pages 313 to 316)
(Pages 313 to 316)
Page 313
I think it -- because it was a self -- because so
many people saw it of so many -- of such a high
caliber down that never seemed to think it would --
well, if they thought it was strange probably, they
never said it at the time.  So it became sort of like
it was his thing, right?  He was always around with
women.
           Now, you don't -- I understand that it's
very unattractive, especially in light of everything
that we know today.  But at the time, the only way I
can sort of try and describe it is through Sex and
the City, the movie, the show on telly, where the --
this is -- that lifestyle is described on the TV show
constantly.
           There are always these women around and
men who like it.  And a lot of the men that I know
like women, and so maybe not as overtly as Epstein,
but he was overt, not covert, except obviously in the
context of the criminal behavior.
           So what we're discussing now, there's a
difference between the criminal behavior and the
non-criminal.  But you don't like the lifestyle, I
concur.
           I agree.  Especially now.  And I -- I own
my side of that fence that I was there and that I saw
Page 314
his behavior with women and didn't challenge him or
do something.
           But I don't -- I don't think back in the
'90s or the 2000s, we've had a cultural shift.  And
the cultural shift, I think is a very important part
of the analysis here.  Not because I'm trying to
justify this, because I'm not, and I'm not trying to,
and I absolutely am not here to do the poor me
program.  So please, don't misunderstand this.
           However, in the 19- -- 2000s, when this
behavior was going down, in the initial blush of the
Palm Beach investigation, the women who brought the
women who were underage 17, 16, I believe if I'm --
my memory serves, were actually targets of the
investigation and could have been charged with
prostitution and trafficking, I would -- if
trafficking was even a law.
           So you're taking -- you're taking
behavior.  And I did introduce him to women, I did,
but not underage women.  I understand that there are
allegations.  I have read them about myself going to
schools.  I can categorically tell you that I have
never, in my life, gone to a school to pick up a
child.  Well, not for this purpose.  I mean, like my
stepchildren, and all, but okay.  Sorry, just --
Page 315
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, I understand.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Thank you.  I
just want to be clear that I'm not trying to be cute
or anything.
           But -- and I did look for masseuses, I --
I did.  I went to spas and if I met somebody who said
she was a masseuse, I did not check their
credentials.  And of course, if she was attractive, I
did introduce her, yes.
           If I met friends who were interested, he
was constantly asking me for -- to meet new and
interesting people.  I did -- I did do that.
           At the time, I viewed it as -- well, first
of all, part of my job, I think, or part of my
responsibility, if you were, to introduce -- because
it wasn't just women.  If I met somebody who was
interesting, like Murray Gell-Mann or who I thought
he would like, I did that.  So it's not exclusively,
but he did.  And I did do that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- but then -- so I want
to layer on top of what you just said, what we talked
about yesterday more, but a little bit today already,
which is everybody that was around him besides you,
like his friends.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.
Page 316
           TODD BLANCHE:  So I accept the lifestyle.
I've seen the photos, the fact that everybody is --
we're all going to go to the island for a couple of
days, or we're flying on a private plane and there's
beautiful women everywhere.
           Is there any -- I mean, do you, as you sit
here today, think that the people around him didn't
also -- weren't also of the same place where they
were also getting massages where there was sex going
on during them, or things like that?  And I'm
obviously asking this because that's what the --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yeah.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- that's what everybody
has said.  And when you just described what it was
like, the very next step from that is everybody's
going to Vegas for the weekend, you know.  And so --
and so you -- it seems kind of far-fetched to say
that, yes, that was his lifestyle.
           But then when he's taking groups of folks
to the island or groups of folks to New Mexico or
whatever, that they're all, you know, going to church
in the morning while he's getting a massage.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I hear you.  I was
there, though.  And --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Yeah.

(Pages 317 to 320)
(Pages 317 to 320)
Page 317
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- and you're talking
about very substantial people.  And you are
extrapolating because the narrative that started
in -- by the way, not until 2009, is when it really
started.
           So that narrative that was created and
then built upon, and it just mushroomed into what --
basically this is like a Salem witch trial.  People
have gone and lost their minds for this thing.  I
understand that.
           But the issue is, how do you satisfy a mob
who can't understand the lifestyle because it's like
P. Diddy in Redux on TV with Clintons and Trump.  I
mean, it's -- it's bananas.  And while some of it is
real, he did do those things.  I'm definitely not
disputing that.
           But this was a man, they didn't even
believe he had a real business.  I happen to believe
he did.  Did he grift?  I don't -- I don't know,
because I wasn't really in his business.  But this is
-- this is one man.
           He's not some -- they've made him into
this -- he's not that interesting.  He's a disgusting
guy who did terrible things to young kids.  You're
not going to hear me say what he did to people who
Page 318
are over the age 18.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to go
there.  That's just not what I'm here to -- I mean, I
-- okay?
           But to suggest that Larry Summers or
Clinton would certainly go, oh my gosh, this is like
a guy I'm going to get my body rubbed and have some
sex.  They're men that went and had a massage and
maybe did something sexual, they're men, I wasn't in
the room.  I cannot tell you if that happened.
           And if it did, not -- I never paid for
that.  Just so that we're clear.  Nobody ever said to
me, oh, you know, we had sexual intercourse and that
was a three, uh-uh (negative).  I'd be like, okay.
TMI, no, not my business.  You want to -- it's just
not.  And I didn't want to know.  Maybe there's that.
           But did I, like, think these guys were
coming for that?  I really don't.  If you met
Epstein, there is no way that this cast of
characters, of which it's extraordinary, and some are
in your cabinet, who you value as your coworkers, and
you know, would be with him if he was a creep or
because they wanted sexual favors.  A man wants
sexual favors, he will find that.  They didn't have
to come to Epstein for that.
           Now did some?  Okay.  I don't know.  I
Page 319
wasn't there.  I didn't see it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So when's the last time you
think you were with Mr. Epstein when he got a
massage?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I want to say 2007.
           TODD BLANCHE:  2007?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the frequency at that
point, so 2007, is that when it was at its peak,
would you say?  Meaning the number of interactions he
was having daily with women and masseuses?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I wasn't really in his
life.  I happened to be in the Caribbean in 2007.  I
was with Ted.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And we -- I was still
speaking with Epstein, because I was still involved
in his -- you know, loosely with his -- the houses
and the staff and some of the billing.  And he -- and
I was going back from being with Ted in the Caribbean
to New York, and Epstein offered me a ride.  And so
Ted dropped me off in Saint Thomas, and I was on the
island, I believe, for one day and one night only.
           On that visit, I believe -- well, I know
he would have gotten a massage, but I have -- there
Page 320
were people there, but I did -- that were women.  And
I was --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- just relieved not
to --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- be leaving the next
day.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let's take a break.
           SPENCER HORN:  Well, we're going to take a
break.  The time is 11:31.
        (Break at 11:31 a.m. to 11:49 a.m.)
           SPENCER HORN:  We are resuming the audio
recorded proffer agreement with Ms. Maxwell, and the
time is 11:49 a.m.
           TODD BLANCHE:  All right.  I wanted to
follow up about former President Clinton's
relationship with Mr. Epstein, not you.
           Can you -- we touched on it, but can you
just to set the -- I have a couple questions about
it, but what's your understanding of their
relationship from what you observed?  Meaning former
President Clinton and Mr. Epstein.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I saw them talk.  I
saw them sit down and have chats about, I don't know,

(Pages 321 to 324)
(Pages 321 to 324)
Page 321
because I wasn't either a party or didn't listen and
I know -- I would characterize, originally anyway,
Mr. Epstein's interest in him because obviously he's
the former president.
           But I never saw him -- other than that, I
saw them be friendly on the plane, but I never -- I
don't believe -- I don't recollect, anyway, ever
seeing them in any other context.
           I don't remember him at his house in New
York.  Like I said, I don't believe he ever went to
that island.  I think that was just a -- that was a
story that 
 did.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know one way or the
other, whether their relationship continued without
you, like, when you kind of moved on past
Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't believe so.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Why do you say that you
don't believe so?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Because I don't think
they had a relationship even when I was there.  I was
-- I -- President Clinton liked me, and we got along
terribly well.  But I never saw that warmth or that
-- that warmth or however you want to characterize
it, with Mr. Epstein and cert- -- so I didn't see
Page 322
that.  I didn't see any interest in -- I didn't see
President Clinton being interested in Epstein.  He
was just a rich guy with a plane.
           TODD BLANCHE:  When -- when the Southern
District of New York case kind of became public and
there was a search warrant of Mr. Epstein's house,
there was like a -- there was some sort of painting
or picture with Mr. Clinton in like a blue dress that
had been signed.
           Did you know -- do you know where he got
that picture or that painting?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  The first I saw it was
in the press.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you never observed that
in his --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- brownstone?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I thought it was
hideous.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What's that again?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I thought it was
hideous.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And -- but you had never --
so you don't know, sitting here today, where
Mr. Epstein got it?
Page 323
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  The circumstances in which
he got it?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know of any other
gifts or paraphernalia or art or pictures that former
President Clinton gave to Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  I mean, did he
maybe get him a gift?  I don't know.  I have no
knowledge of that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then going back to the
topic we were talking about before our last break.
           Well, when you said something yesterday at
the very beginning of our conversation that when you
first met Mr. Epstein and you ultimately have sex
with him, that he had -- I'll use the word erectile
dysfunction, but he had issues having sex?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's what he told
me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  That's what he told you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  And then over the
years, you said sometime in the '90s he started
taking testosterone?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  But I don't know
Page 324
if it was in the '90s.  I don't remember when he
started, but it wasn't -- he had patches --
testosterone patches --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- dermal.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Like on his arm?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And then he was
ridiculous, because you shouldn't take more than one.
But sometimes he had, like -- I'm like, what are you
doing?  It's like unhealthy.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  From what you
observed or saw or heard, did he continue to have
challenges sexually over the years or do you think
that whatever he told you -- whatever issue he told
you he had was fixed?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I think it was a lie.
           TODD BLANCHE:  You think he was lying
about what?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  About his erectile
dysfunction.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh, you mean you never --
you don't think he ever had any issues?  You think he
just told you that?
DOJ REDACTION

(Pages 325 to 328)
(Pages 325 to 328)
Page 325
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Right.  That is what I
believe today, yes.  But given -- if any of the
stories are true, even if he had erectile
dysfunction, the thing had a priapism, for Christ's
sake.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Well, that's -- that's one
of the reasons for my questions.  I mean, you're
right.  I mean -- and again, we're -- we've talked
about this a fair amount, but what did -- like the
stories of what masseuses, underage and overage have
said about him is, are, you know, and what he liked,
what he demanded that they do.  Whether it's watching
him masturbate or pinching his nipples, you know,
kind of things that are unusual.
           Do you believe that?  Like, do you -- from
what you saw, from what you observed, from what you
did when you were in a relationship with him, is that
true?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I -- well, the bulk of
what I read, he did not have sex.  So that is
consistent with what he told me, actually.
           And his masturbating, that is also
consistent with what I knew myself.  And I'm going to
use a bad word for --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Please, you can use
Page 326
whatever words you need.  Yes.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Blowjob.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  He liked blowjobs.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That I did observe.
And he didn't seem to have any erectile dysfunction
for blowjobs, but sex, he didn't have.  So when I
read the stories about all the allegations of sexual
rape, I find that challenging, because that was not
his modus operandi, from my perspective.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But when you read about
blowjobs, that -- does that -- that would be
consistent with kind of --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That would be
consistent, as would masturbation, yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Did you talk to masseuses
or women that either he was in a relationship with or
who asked you about working with him?  Did you tell
them, yes, he likes blowjobs, yes, he'll masturbate
in front of you?
           Like, did you have conversations with any
of those -- with women about what Mr. Epstein liked
or what would make him happy, or things like that?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't have any
Page 327
memory of telling anybody about that.  I think I may
have joked like saying, oh my God, you know, like
from a Sex and the City scene that, you know, he's --
but not -- I never instruct -- the question you're
asking me, sorry, let's just be clear.
           Did I ever instruct anyone how to
pleasure, Mr. Epstein, your question?  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you said this earlier,
but I want to just -- you kind of said it on your
own.  I want to ask the question, just so I'll make
sure that there's no confusion.
           When -- when you over the years --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Sorry, can I just --
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- yeah.  Of course.  Yeah,
yeah, please.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Okay.  Right.  I just
want to say, the idea that I would have to explain to
a woman how to satisfy Mr. Epstein is patently
absurd, because he clearly was able to explain
himself.
           He didn't need an interlocutor to explain
what he liked.  He's been doing this obviously or
this -- some version of this story his whole life and
did not require any help from me.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Then -- so did you ever
Page 328
observe him having sex with a masseuse?  Regular
intercourse, not a blowjob, nothing else, where you
either walked in or you were in the room?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw him have
sex with any person.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And so how about oral sex?
Did you ever observe a woman giving him oral sex,
whether you were in the room or walked in, or --
                   GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never saw
anyone give Epstein a blowjob.  No.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you said earlier you
did see him masturbating in front of masseuses.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know if I said
that.  I don't know --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  Sorry.  I don't
want --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- if I said that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Let me ask you a question.
Sorry.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I don't know for sure
I said that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  No, that's fair.  That's
fair.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I said I saw him --
I'm sure I saw him in a -- what some people could

(Pages 329 to 332)
(Pages 329 to 332)
Page 329
define as sexual contact.  Because if somebody could
not have their clothes or topless, I would say maybe,
I could say that.
           If I saw him having -- masturbating when
someone was there, I don't recall that, I don't have
a specific memory of it.  I'm sorry.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But no, I'm not --
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  -- I didn't say that.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  I understand, that's
fair.  Sorry.  I'm not ---
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's okay.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- certainly not trying to
put words in your mouth.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, no.  That's --
absolutely no.  That's fine.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So -- and you said, I think
in passing -- maybe not in passing.  I'm sorry.
           About -- about, you know, whether other
people who travel with him would get massages or --
so that would -- when I say that I'm referring mostly
to the island or, potentially, New Mexico.  But also
his Palm Beach residence or even in New York.
           Do you know of -- do you have a list of
Page 330
names in your head or names that come to mind of
people that you know did get massages when they were
with Mr. Epstein?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, there's no list.
There's no list of people getting massages.  I don't
have -- I can barely recall all the people.  I can
barely recall.  I struggle to recall actual people
that I met.  And I may have met a long time that I
had even forgotten that -- about Mr. Kennedy, or I
probably brought it up yesterday.  It just came to my
mind now.
           So I don't have, and there's no list.
There was never a list.  There was no -- or certainly
none that I ever saw.  None I ever heard of, none
that I ever witnessed, none that I -- there's no
list.  Has never been a list.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you never heard
Mr. Epstein talk about such a list?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Never.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And you never heard
Mr. Epstein suggest that he had some sort of control
over somebody because of what he knew about what they
had done or had photos of him or anything?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I never heard him --
no, I never heard him ask questions about that.  I
Page 331
never heard him.  So I've been present many times
with masseuses.  I never -- who presumably could or
maybe did massage somebody, I'm not saying whether
they did or not just (indiscernible).
           I never heard him ask any question of any
masseuse who may have given a massage to a friend
that was on the island, or in Palm Beach or anywhere
else for that, any details about that massage.  Like,
does he have a funky foot?  No, I never heard that
because it -- weird.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And I think at one of the
breaks today, your lawyer may have showed you
something that just came out in the paper, I think
this morning or last night.  A letter that you --
that is attributed to you, associated with this
birthday book from 2003 that we talked about
yesterday.
           Is -- did you see that letter.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I did see the letter.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Is that, in fact -- look
like your handwriting or something you wrote?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  So, I don't remember
the letter.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  But it does look like
Page 332
my handwriting.  And it does look like my name.  And
it looks like it could be real, but I have no memory
of writing that, and I don't remember it at all.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you remember what the
birthday book, as they're calling it, what it, like,
looked like?  Like how it was put together?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  What do you remember about
it?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I remember it.  It was
leather-bound, and I remember it being about yea big.
It was big.  Right like --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So you're saying it looks
like -- it's like over 12 inches, 14, 15 inches?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.  It was like sort
of like a folio size, I guess, or something like
that.  And like this.  And it was brown and thick,
about this thick.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And --
           TODD BLANCHE:  So just -- so you -- so I
understand --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  On heavy stock paper.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Heavy stock paper, like 14
inches high?

(Pages 333 to 336)
(Pages 333 to 336)
Page 333
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  That's about right.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then around like --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  A4.  A4.  We had A4,
because it was done on heavy stock paper, but I can't
remember if it was folio size paper, or it could have
just been A4.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Oh I see.  So it could have
just been letter size, or it might have been legal
size --
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  -- heavy stock paper.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Yes.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And the -- so the folks
that submitted letters were given the stock paper or
how were the letters -- or did you, like, glue or
something the letters to the stock paper?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Every which way.  Some
were given the paper and they did their own thing.
Some would send me some scrap of paper and I would
put it on the thing.  Some I didn't get because they
went straight to Epstein, and I was just told to put
them in, like I said.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And how was it bound?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It went to a
professional binder, who did it like a book that
Page 334
you'd see in the library.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So like the glue that keeps
a regular book, a novel that you would read together,
it was bound that way?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Like a -- I believe
so.  I don't think it was stitched, but I don't
remember.  I mean, it was professionally done by a
professional bookbinder.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And then after you
presented it, or after it was presented to him when
he turned 50, did you see the leather-bound book, did
he keep it somewhere in particular?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  It was in his bookcase
in 71st Street.
           TODD BLANCHE:  In Manhattan?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  In Manhattan.
           TODD BLANCHE:  And did you see it over the
years until you stopped going to the brownstone?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I saw it -- I know I
did see it, because it was right behind his desk.
And after I stopped going, I don't know what happened
to it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Do you know -- do you
remember being told or knowing where the book is now?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No.  But I -- when I
Page 335
received in discovery those pages, I assumed that it
had been found when either New York or the island was
searched, and I assumed that the Southern District of
New York had it.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But I think you said
yesterday.  But just to go over it again, in case you
remember anything differently.  You recall seeing
some of the letters in discovery.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  I do.
           TODD BLANCHE:  But you don't recall kind
of seeing the leather book, start to finish?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  No, but remember, I
didn't see all discovery because they were very
clever about, you know, I didn't receive all
discovery, period.  And in fact, very important items
were not given to me at all, including witness
testimony from grand jury.
           TODD BLANCHE:  So whether -- so you don't
know one way or the other, whether it was part of
discovery, you just know that you didn't get it.  It
wasn't part of the discovery that was given to you?
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  Correct.  But there's
a -- I am absolutely sure that the Southern District
of New York hid very important pieces of evidence
from me.
Page 336
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.
           GHISLAINE MAXWELL:  And I assumed that
they leaked it because where else would it be, if
that's what it is.  If it's true.
           TODD BLANCHE:  Okay.  So I've -- just so I
put -- I'll say it to you as I've talked a little bit
to your lawyer about it.  I said to you yesterday
that the purpose of what we did yesterday and today
was -- was exactly what we did, which is to have a
conversation about Mr. Epstein and about you.
           And I think it's very challenging to talk
about everything we talked about.  And, you know, in
one and a half days or in just a period of hours.  So
I'll talk to Mr. Markus about kind of what we're
going to do next, if anything.
           There's no -- and I don't -- I'm not being
coy or -- I just -- I don't know yet.  I don't know.
So we -- I have a lot of -- we have some work to do.
We'll do it with your lawyers to the extent we have
questions or follow-up.
           And this has been very helpful.  I think
it's -- it was you, you know, who kind of said you
wanted to talk, but we gladly accepted it.  So I do
appreciate you being willing to meet with us.  And I
expect that we'll be in touch soon.  All right.

METADATA_FILENAME: Signed Maxwell Proffer Agreement (Redacted).pdf
----------------------------------------
PROFFER AGREEMENT 
With respect to the meeting of Ghislaine Maxwell ("Client") and his attorney, David Oscar 
Markus, Esq., with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to be held at the Office of the United 
States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida on July 24 and 25, 2025 ("the meeting"), the 
following understandings exist: 
(1) THIS IS NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT. The Client has agreed to 
provide the Government with information, and to respond to questions, so that the Government 
may evaluate Client's information and responses in making prosecutive decisions. By receiving 
Client's proffer, the Government does not agree to make a motion on the Client's behalf or to enter 
into a cooperation agreement, plea agreement, immunity or non-prosecution agreement. The 
Government makes no representation about the likelihood that any such agreement will be reached 
in connection with this proffer. 
(2) ln any prosecution brought against Client by this Department, except as provided below 
the Government will not offer in evidence on its case-in-chief, or in connection with any sentencing 
proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, any statements made by Client 
at the meeting, except (a) in a prosecution for false statements, obstruction of justice or perjury 
with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony 
given after the meeting; or (b) if, at any time following the meeting, Client becomes a fugitive 
from justice. 
(3) Notwithstanding item (2) above: (a) the Government may use information derived 
directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which 
evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client by the Government; (b) in any prosecution 
brought against Client, the Government may use statements made by Client at the meeting and all 
evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom for the purpose of cross-examination should 
Client testify; and (c) the Government may also use statements made by Client at the meeting to 
rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of Client (including arguments made or 
issues raised sua sponte by the District Court) at any stage of the criminal prosecution (including 
bail, all phases of trial, and sentencing) in any prosecution brought against Client. 
(4) The Client understands and agrees that in the event the Client seeks to qualify for a 
reduction in sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(f), United States 
Sentencing Guidelines, Sections 2D 1.1 (b)(l 8) or 5Cl .2, or Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b), the Office may 
offer or use at any stage of the criminal proceeding any statement made by Client during the 
meeting, and all evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom, to the extent such use is 
consistent with Section 402 of the First Step Act of 2018. 
(5) To the extent that the Government is entitled under this Agreement to offer in evidence 
any statements made by Client or leads obtained therefrom, Client shall assert no claim under the 
United States Constitution, any statute, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other 
federal rule that such statements or any leads therefrom should be suppressed. It is the intent of 
this Agreement to waive all rights in the foregoing respects. 

(6) lf this Department receives a request from another prosecutor's office for access to 
information obtained pursuant to this Proffer Agreement, this Department may furnish such 
information but will do so only on the condition that the requesting office honor the provisions of 
this Agreement. 
(7) It is further understood that this Agreement is limited to the statements made by Client 
at the meeting and does not apply to any oral, written or recorded statements made by Client at 
any other time. No understandings, promises, agreements and/or conditions have been entered
