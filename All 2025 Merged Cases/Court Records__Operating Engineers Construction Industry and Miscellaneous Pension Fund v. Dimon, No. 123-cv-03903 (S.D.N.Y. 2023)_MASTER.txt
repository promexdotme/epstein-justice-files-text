The allegations of this Complaint are based on the knowledge of Plaintiff as to itself and the 
investigation of counsel, including the review of publicly available information and documents. 
NATURE AND SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 
1.
Most of the world learned of Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific abuses of women and 
children in 2019, when Epstein was arrested for orchestrating a wide-ranging human trafficking 
enterprise.  Others, however—including those that facilitated Epstein’s enterprise—knew of his 
abusive behavior for more than a decade earlier.  JP Morgan was one such facilitator.  JP Morgan 
served as Epstein’s primary bank from at least 1998 to 2013, during which time he operated as 
many as 55 accounts: some in his own name, some in the name of shell companies and sham non-
profits, and some in the names of his victims, associates, and recruiters.   
2.
For nearly fifteen years, Epstein relied on these accounts to abuse women and 
children.  Epstein used his JP Morgan accounts to transfer money to recruiters that trafficked new 
victims and to withdraw vast amounts of cash to pay off his victims.  During certain periods, 
Epstein reportedly withdrew up to $80,000 in cash multiple times a month; he once withdrew more 
than $750,000 in cash in a single year.  Epstein is now infamous for using cash to pay his victims, 
and his extraordinary cash withdrawals were obviously suspicious even without knowledge of his 
abusive conduct. 
3.
But JP Morgan knew of Epstein’s abusive conduct many years before his arrest, 
and internally held deep concerns about precisely why Epstein was withdrawing vast amounts of 
cash and transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to “modeling” agencies.  As early as 2006, 
when Epstein was arrested for solicitation of a minor, JP Morgan knew not only that Epstein was 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 2 of 53

abusing young women and children, but that he paid his victims in cash—something that one of 
JP Morgan’s top executives has admitted.  In 2008, in 2010, and multiple times in 2011, JP 
Morgan’s employees internally shared reports about Epstein’s abuses and expressed concern about 
the Bank’s ongoing relationship with him.  In 2011, JP Morgan employees explicitly questioned 
whether a previous payment to a “model management” agency was “payment for services as a 
procurer.”  
4.
Knowledge of Epstein’s abusive conduct extended to the very top of the Company’s 
C-suite.  Most notoriously, Jes Staley (who, until 2013, served as the chief executive officer 
(“CEO”) of JP Morgan’s Investment Bank) shared a deep personal friendship with Epstein.  
Although JP Morgan is now attempting to lay all blame for its institutional failures on Staley alone 
in an attempt to escape legal and reputational harm, it is clear that Staley could not have sustained 
and concealed a 15+ year banking relationship involving tens of millions of dollars without the 
knowledge and assistance of others within JP Morgan.  Mary Erdoes (who has served as CEO of 
JP Morgan’s Asset & Wealth Management division) paid numerous visits to Epstein’s home and 
has admitted that she and JP Morgan knew of Epstein’s abuses by 2006.  Erdoes is known as a top 
lieutenant to the Bank’s longtime CEO, Jamie Dimon.  And Dimon himself appears to have been 
personally involved in sanctioning the Bank’s relationship with Epstein: one August 2008 
document references Epstein’s $120 million with JP Morgan being in question “pending Dimon 
review.”  
5.
Despite this top-to-bottom knowledge, JP Morgan’s Board did nothing.  JP Morgan 
knew that Epstein was a serial abuser that relied heavily on cash payments, and that Epstein 
regularly withdrew vast sums of cash from his JP Morgan accounts.  But upon information and 
belief, JP Morgan consistently failed to file suspicious activity reports (“SARs”) that it was 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 3 of 53

required to file when it suspected potential criminal activity—as it clearly did.  This failure 
persisted through Epstein’s entire 15+ year history with the Bank, and persisted for years even 
after JP Morgan terminated Epstein’s accounts in 2013.  This failure persisted, in fact, through the 
time of Epstein’s final arrest in 2019, until which time Epstein continued to commit his prolific 
abuses.   
6.
This failure to file SARs and otherwise comply with similar anti-money laundering 
(“AML”) and know-your-customer (“KYC”) regulations is nothing new for JP Morgan.  Rather, 
it is a symptom of a broader, years-long failure of governance and oversight by JP Morgan’s board 
of directors—a failure for which JP Morgan was previously cited and penalized by regulators, in 
2013 and 2014.  In 2013, both the OCC and the Federal Reserve accused JP Morgan of failing to 
comply with federal AML laws and regulations, including because the Bank failed to file timely 
SARs.  JM Morgan was hit with a $350 million sanction in 2014 due to its continuing AML 
compliance failures.  Not only did the Company face civil penalties, it was faced criminal liability 
as well:  the Bank pleaded guilty in 2014 to two felony counts relating to failures to comply with 
AML rules, including the failure to file SARs. 
7.
Now, JP Morgan is exposed to substantial legal risk due its role in helping conceal 
Epstein’s crimes.  One of Epstein’s victims, identified only as “Jane Doe 1”, has brought several 
claims (on behalf of herself and other victims) against the Bank for its role in Epstein’s abuse of 
her.  The government of the U.S. Virgin Islands has also initiated litigation against the Bank for 
similar reasons, and is seeking significant monetary damages, including punitive and treble 
damages.   
8.
All told, JP Morgan has suffered and will continue to suffer substantial monetary 
and reputational harm for its longstanding role in assisting the most egregious sex trafficker in 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 4 of 53

modern history.  Had JP Morgan’s Board and senior officers taken their oversight responsibilities 
seriously, JP Morgan would have consistently reported Epstein’s suspicious practices and would 
have terminated its relationship with him much sooner than it actually did.  Plaintiff brings this 
action on behalf of JP Morgan to hold these directors and officers to account for their longstanding 
governance failures.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
43.
The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  The Court 
has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims asserted herein pursuant 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1367(a).  This action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on a court of the United States 
which it would not otherwise have.  
44.
Venue is proper in this Court because JP Morgan has its principal place of business 
in this district, Plaintiff’s claims arose in this district, and JP Morgan has suffered and will continue 
to suffer harm in this district.  Venue is further proper in this Court because various actions related 
to the allegations asserted herein, including Doe v. JP Morgan and USVI v. JP Morgan (defined 
below), are currently pending before this Court.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 9 of 53

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
45.
JP Morgan is currently defending allegations from two distinct lawsuits stemming 
from its facilitation and concealment of Epstein’s abuse.  First, a plaintiff identified as “Jane Doe 
1”, on behalf of herself and other victims of Epstein’s abuse, asserted several claims against the 
Company’s primary banking subsidiary, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., in the litigation styled Jane 
Doe 1 v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10019 (JSR) (“Doe v. JP Morgan”).  Second, the 
government of the U.S. Virgin Islands also asserted several claims against JP Morgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. in the litigation styled Government of the United States Virgin Islands v. JP Morgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10904 (CSR) (“USVI v. JP Morgan”).   
46.
In both actions, the plaintiffs broadly allege that for several years, JP Morgan knew 
about Epstein’s abusive conduct and knew about Epstein’s suspicious use of his many accounts at 
the Bank, yet failed to comply with federal regulations to report his suspicious activity.  This failure 
and concealment, in turn, helped Epstein’s systematic abuse to continue unchecked.  Plaintiffs in 
both actions seek monetary damages, including punitive and treble damages in the USVI v. JP 
Morgan action.  JP Morgan therefore faces a material risk of substantial monetary liability, above 
and beyond the significant reputational harm that JP Morgan has already suffered and will continue 
to suffer as a result of its longstanding facilitation and concealment of Epstein’s crimes.  JP Morgan 
also faces the risk of fines or monetary damages as the result of potential governmental 
investigations into its conduct. 
SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS 
I.
EPSTEIN’S DECADES OF ABUSIVE CONDUCT
47.
The shocking extent and gravity of Epstein’s abuses are now well known.  For more 
than two decades, Epstein operated a vast network of shell companies, intermediaries, and enablers 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 10 of 53

for the sole purpose of trafficking and abusing young women at his properties, including in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands.   
48.
Epstein is reported to have begun his systematic exploitation of young women as 
early as the 1990s.  But since at least 2001, Epstein trafficked young girls and women to the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, where he then had them transported to his private island, Little St. James.1  He also 
trafficked women to New York and to other properties he owned.  Epstein and his associates often 
deceived these girls and young women into traveling with promises of modeling contracts, 
employment, or educational opportunities.  Other times, Epstein’s abuse began as a demand for a 
massage, which rapidly evolved into abuse.  Once trafficked to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Epstein 
and others in his network exploited and abused these women, and then ensured their silence with 
both threats and payoffs.  Epstein was infamous for paying his victims in cash, although he on 
occasion also wired money directly to both victims and allies.2
49.
The full scale of Epstein’s abuses is hard to comprehend.  Epstein is accused of 
trafficking and abusing girls as young as 11 years old, reflecting his repulsive preference of the 
“younger the better.”3  Air traffic controllers and other airport personnel in the U.S. Virgin Islands 
reported seeing Epstein disembark from his plane with girls that appeared to be between 11 and 
years old.  In one harrowing instance, a 15 year old victim that Epstein abused on Little St.

Compl. (Nov. 30, 2022) at ¶49 (hereinafter “USVI State Complaint”).

Jane Doe 1 v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10019 (JSR), First Am. Compl. (Jan. 13, 
2023) at ¶126 (hereinafter “Doe Complaint”). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 11 of 53

James attempted to escape by swimming off the island.  Epstein organized a search party, found 
the victim, confiscated her passport, and threatened her with physical harm if she did not submit.4
50.
Epstein trafficked many of his victims from Eastern Europe and sometimes kept 
the same girls and women in servitude for several years.  For example, Epstein is accused of having 
flown one victim to his island dozens of times between 2004 and 2017; and another more than 50 
times between 2000 and 2002.  This meant that Epstein eventually had to grapple with immigration 
concerns.  To address this problem, Epstein forced some of his victims to marry his American 
citizen associates (or even other victims), and then helped finalize arrangements with immigration 
authorities.5  Epstein is accused of having forced at least three victims into marriages, and then 
threatening them with harm if they attempted to leave. 
51.
Epstein’s appetite for abuse was seemingly insatiable.  Epstein is reported to have 
regularly abused up to 3-4 victims each day—a demand that even Epstein’s extensive network 
struggled to supply.  Epstein therefore demanded that his victims themselves help deceive and 
recruit other victims.  To this end, Epstein often instructed his victims to go to night clubs or on 
shopping trips to help identify other unsuspecting women and girls that they might be able to 
entrap.  Epstein paid an additional fee for each new victim that an existing victim lured in. 
52.
The frequency and duration of his crimes make clear that Epstein could not have 
orchestrated his abuse without both an extensive network of allies and enablers, and steady, 
unquestioned access to large amounts of cash.  In JP Morgan, Epstein had both.

II.
JP MORGAN ENABLED EPSTEIN’S CRIMES FOR YEARS
53.
Epstein was a JP Morgan client from at least 1998 through 2013.  Over this time, 
JP Morgan serviced roughly 55 accounts that belonged or were related to Epstein, collectively 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  In addition to accounts in his own name, Epstein also 
operated many JP Morgan accounts in the names of other companies and non-profit entities that 
often had no legitimate business purpose.  These entities included 2013 Butterfly Trust, Coatue 
Enterprises, LLC, C.O.U.Q. Foundation, Enhanced Education, Financial Trust Company, Inc., 
HBRK Associates, Inc., Hyperion Air, Inc, JEGE, Inc., JEGE, LLC, NES, LLC, Plan D, LLC, 
Southern Financial, LLC, and Southern Trust Company, each of which had accounts with JP 
Morgan.  Epstein used many of these entities to make and conceal payments to his victims and his 
associates or, as the U.S. Virgin Islands alleges, to help shield his assets from judgment. 
54.
Over the many years that Epstein served as a star JP Morgan client, he used his 55+ 
accounts with the Bank extensively to facilitate his abuse.  According to the U.S. Virgin Islands 
government, Epstein paid at least 20 of his victims through JP Morgan accounts, and these victims 
collectively received in excess of $1 million.  Epstein also used his JP Morgan accounts to pay his 
associates and enablers: the U.S. Virgin Islands government alleges that Epstein paid nearly $1.5 
million to known recruiters.  
55.
The details of these enormous payments are deeply troubling.  Epstein paid the 
plaintiff identified as Jane Doe 1, for example, more than $600,000 through his JP Morgan 
accounts between 2003 and 2013.  Epstein’s abuse of Doe 1 began when she was only 14 years 
old.6  In an obvious sign that something was amiss, Doe 1 listed Epstein’s New York City 
townhouse as her address for purposes of the many payments she received from Epstein.   
USVI Complaint, ¶66. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 13 of 53

56.
More troublingly, Epstein also regularly withdrew millions of dollars from his JP 
Morgan accounts—in cash.  As early as 2006, a JP Morgan Rapid Response Team noted that 
Epstein routinely withdrew $40,000 to $80,000 in cash from his accounts several times each 
month, and more than $750,000 per year.  In each of 2004 and 2005, Epstein withdrew more than 
$800,000 in cash.  Epstein also used his JP Morgan accounts to make at least 95 foreign remittances 
to unknown payees—another blatantly suspicious pattern of conduct.   
57.
Some of Epstein’s use of cash is so obviously illegitimate that it almost defies 
belief.  For example, the company that owned and operated Epstein’s private plane (Hyperion Air, 
Inc.) issued more than $547,000 in checks—payable to cash—for “fuel expenses when traveling 
to foreign countries.”7  Apart from the absurdity of paying for hundreds of thousands of dollars’ 
worth of jet fuel in cash, some of these checks were issued when Epstein was under house arrest,8
and plainly unable to travel anywhere.   
58.
Similarly, between January 2012 and June 2013, Hyperion converted more than 
$120,000 into foreign currency, with the constituent cash withdrawals either exceeding the typical 
$10,000 reporting threshold, or being structured in a way to avoid meeting this threshold.  Epstein 
also used other entities under his control to funnel payments to his victims and associates.  For 
example, Epstein used a charitable organization he controlled (and which had an account with JP 
Morgan) to pay $29,464 to three young women, and used another organization to pay $124,232 to 
Leslie Wexner, who is now known to have been a vital part of Epstein’s network.  
USVI Complaint, ¶67. 
As discussed further below, Epstein was arrested in Florida in 2006 on charges of soliciting a 
minor for prostitution, and entered into a plea agreement in 2008.

III.
JP MORGAN WILLFULLY IGNORED AND FAILED TO REPORT EPSTEIN’S 
HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS PRACTICES 
59.
JP Morgan knew of Epstein’s true nature at least as early as 2006.  The previous 
year, press reports emerged that claimed that Epstein paid a 14-year old girl in Palm Beach, Florida 
for a massage and then proceeded to abuse her.  These press reports prompted other Epstein victims 
to come forward with similar allegations.  In 2006, Epstein was arrested and indicted in Florida 
for solicitation of a minor, amidst additional extensive press reports about his crimes. 
60.
JP Morgan was immediately aware of Epstein’s arrest.  In 2006, the same year 
Epstein was arrested, JP Morgan’s Global Corporate Security Division found “[s]everal newspaper 
articles … that detail the indictment of Jeffrey Epstein in Florida on felony charges of soliciting 
underage prostitutes”9 (i.e. raping children).  Despite these reports and Epstein’s indictment, JP 
Morgan decided to retain Epstein as a client—while concluding that his account “should be 
classified as high risk” and require special approval.10
61.
JP Morgan’s knowledge of Epstein’s crimes at this time was not limited to lower-
level employees, but extended all the way to the top.  At her deposition in the USVI v. JP Morgan 
action, Mary Erdoes (who was CEO of JP Morgan Private Bank from 2005 until she became CEO 
of the Asset & Wealth Management Division in 2009) admitted that JP Morgan was aware in 2006 
not only that Epstein was abusing women and underage girls, but that Epstein paid these victims 
in cash.  Crucially, this was the same year that a team at JP Morgan made an internal report that 
Epstein was withdrawing up to $80,000 in cash at a time, multiple times a month.
USVI Complaint, ¶44. 
USVI Complaint, ¶44. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 15 of 53

62.
In 2008, Epstein pled guilty to several of the charges that he faced in Florida, 
including solicitation of a minor for prostitution.  As part of his plea arrangement, Epstein was 
sentenced to serve 18 months in jail and was required to register as a sex offender.11  To the extent 
JP Morgan had any doubts about the allegations against Epstein in 2006, Epstein’s guilty plea in 
2008 erased them.  
63.
Internally, Epstein’s guilty plea led some of JP Morgan’s employees to assume that 
the Bank would immediately terminate its sprawling relationship with the now-convicted sex 
trafficker.  But they would be mistaken, as JP Morgan’s senior-most executives decided to 
maintain this lucrative, if problematic, relationship.  In August 2008, a JP Morgan employee wrote 
that she “would count Epstein’s assets as a probable outflow for ’08 ($120mm or so?) as I can’t 
imagine it will stay (pending [Jamie] Dimon review).”12
64.
Given that JP Morgan continued to service Epstein’s accounts for at least five more 
years, the “Dimon review” evidently resulted in a decision not to take any action against Epstein 
following his guilty plea but, rather, to retain the lucrative relationship.  The same year, in a 
reflection of JP Morgan’s decision to brush off Epstein’s known crimes, Erdoes received an email 
asking her whether Epstein was at an event “with miley cyrus”—who was only 16 years old at the 
time.13
65.
Press reports about Epstein’s abusive conduct continued to emerge in subsequent 
years, and JP Morgan compliance employees continued to express concerns about the Bank’s 
Epstein’s full non-prosecution agreement with Florida became public in 2009.  This agreement 
alleged that Epstein trafficked and engaged in illicit sexual conduct with minors, including across 
state lines.   
USVI Complaint, ¶51. 
USVI Complaint, ¶95. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 16 of 53

continued patronage of someone with Epstein’s history.  In 2010, JP Morgan learned of even more 
allegations in the press against Epstein, detailing his trafficking of women and minors for abuse.  
In an internal email, an employee in JP Morgan’s risk management division referred to “new 
allegations of an investigation related to child trafficking,” and asked whether the Bank was “still 
comfortable with this client who is now a registered sex offender.”14  Other JP Morgan compliance 
employees decided that Epstein “should go.”15  But reflecting the Bank’s fundamental attitude to 
Epstein’s crimes, a different JP Morgan risk management employee dismissed these disturbing 
reports as routine: “In my short tenure working on the account these stories pop up including these 
from the summer.”16
66.
The next year, in January 2011, JP Morgan once again was made keenly aware of 
yet more allegations of human trafficking against Epstein.  And yet again, JP Morgan brushed off 
the allegations.  That month, JP Morgan conducted a review of Epstein’s accounts because a “few 
news stories during 2010 connect[ed] Jeffrey Epstein to human trafficking.”17  The U.S. Virgin 
Islands alleges that JP Morgan’s coverage team “met to discuss the situation and agreed to enhance 
monitoring and document a discussion with the client.”18  Unsurprisingly, Defendant Jes Staley—
the CEO of JP Morgan’s Investment Bank who seemingly participated in Epstein’s crimes, as 
discussed in Section IV below—was the JP Morgan executive that the Bank entrusted to hold this 
“discussion” with Epstein.  Also unsurprisingly, Epstein claimed “there was no truth to the

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 17 of 53

allegations” against him and “no evidence.”19  JP Morgan internally concluded that it would 
“continue to monitor the accounts and cash usage closely going forward.”20
67.
In other words, JP Morgan knew that Epstein was a convicted sexual offender who 
heavily relied on his cash to pay his victims and his associates.  JP Morgan also knew that Epstein 
regularly withdrew huge amounts of cash from his many accounts with the Bank.  Yet JP Morgan’s 
response was to simply “monitor” Epstein’s already-extraordinary “cash usage,” rather than take 
any measures to report his blatantly suspicious transactions to the authorities.  In a hint that Epstein 
was too large of a client for JP Morgan to take action against, the Bank had granted Epstein a new 
$50 million line of credit only weeks earlier, in December 2010. 
68.
Only two months later, JP Morgan’s Global Corporate Security Division internally 
circulated even more devastating reports about Epstein’s abuses.  In March 2011, this division 
reported that “[n]umerous articles detail various law enforcement agencies investigating Jeffrey 
Epstein for allegedly participating, directly or indirectly, in child trafficking and molesting 
underage girls.”21  Even more damningly, this report also noted that Epstein had “settled a dozen 
civil lawsuits out of court from his victims regarding solicitation.”22  This made it abundantly clear 
to JP Morgan that Epstein was not a one-off offender—he was a prolific, serial abuser of women 
and girls that he paid through his many JP Morgan bank accounts. 
69.
This same March 2011 report also noted that a company named “MC2 Model 
Management and Jeffrey Epstein engaged in racketeering that involved luring in minor children

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 18 of 53

for sexual play for money,” and that MC2’s owner was a “frequent passenger on Epstein’s private 
jet and often visited Epstein in jail.”23  Worse, the report noted that Epstein paid MC2 $1 million 
in 2005, and that it was “unknown if the money was given as a secret investment or payment for 
services as a procurer.”24
70.
JP Morgan was plainly concerned that Epstein was using his accounts with the Bank 
to “procure” ever more victims.  This concern within the Bank soon also spread to others within 
Epstein’s orbit.  Although most of the public learned of Ghislaine Maxwell’s key role in Epstein’s 
abuses only after her arrest in 2019, JP Morgan suspected her involvement years earlier.  In August 
2011, Maxwell applied to open a new account with JP Morgan for a “personal recruitment 
consulting business.”25  Internally, JP Morgan’s AML director asked: “What does she mean by 
personal recruitment?? Are you sure this will have nothing to do with Jeffrey? If you want to 
proceed, I suggest that we flag this as a High Risk Client.”26  While it is unclear how JP Morgan 
may have treated Maxwell internally, the Bank plainly did not ever report Maxwell’s suspicious 
“recruitment” activities to regulators.  
71.
Also in 2011, a senior JP Morgan compliance official who reviewed the Bank’s 
relationship with Epstein warned that there was “[l]ots of smoke” and “[l]ots of questions” 
surrounding Epstein’s criminal behavior.27  According to the U.S. Virgin Islands’ complaint 
against JP Morgan, these included that:


Epstein “is alleged to be involved in the human trafficking of young 
girls and law enforcement is also allegedly investigating his 
involvement in this activity.” 

“He is also an alleged personal associate of the CEO of the 
Investment Bank (Jes Staley).”

“AML Operations went to a [Private Bank] risk meeting late last 
week requesting that we exit this relationship.”

impact.”

“The one new concerning thing is the one article about the DOJ 
investigation is saying they brought under age girls to the US via a 
modeling agency M2 that is owned by a guy named Brunel. Turns 
out the banker said today we extended Epstein a loan in relation to 
this modeling agency.”  The writer claims that the agency is “legit” 
and that “it would be hard for us to tell” if “girls were exploited via 
their contract or arrangement.”  The loan was a letter of credit 
provided by JP Morgan to MC2 Model Management. 

In 2004, Epstein sponsored private bank accounts and credit cards 
for two 18 year olds “that appear to be part of his inner entourage.  
One is mentioned in many of the recaps of the escapades as a willing 
participant and assistant when hosting visitors.  She has received 
about 450,000 since opening from Epstein . . . . Both can be put in 
Palm Beach during 2004, by way of debit charges, which was when 
most allegations were from . . . . He did pay other girls, many models 
no huge amounts.  Sugar Daddy!” 

“His foundation account did pay donations to the Palm Beach Police 
Dept as reported just before the case started.  The same foundation 
account did pay monies direct to models and payments direct to 
specialty schools (massage, culinary) and university’s on behalf of 
models/aspiring actresses.  Nothing was astronomical.”

“His business accounts Fiduciary we saw no client activity.  I know 
his biggest client, Wexner parted ways when he was convicted.  His

money but never says who.  I would like to know if in fact he is 
managing anyone’s money at this point or is it all his money.  We 
saw no evidence of disbursements even in the rocky years 08-09.  
When the well to do were running to their mattresses, he did not 
have any distributions from his accounts at Bear or JP.  He does have 
money at other institutions so maybe it happened there.”

USVI v. JP Morgan Complaint, ¶98. 
72.
Despite unequivocally knowing that Epstein was a serial sex offender, and despite 
the obviously suspicious nature of Epstein’s activity with the Bank, JP Morgan took no corrective 
action against Epstein for years.  Finally, in 2013, JP Morgan terminated its relationship with 
Epstein; it continued to do business with him for several years afterward (as detailed below).  The 
year that JP Morgan terminated Epstein’s accounts, the Bank noted that “[p]er bank policy, felons 
are considered high risk and require additional approval.”28  Epstein had been a convicted felon 
for almost a decade before his banking accounts were terminated.  That the Company left the 
accounts in place for so long, despite such deeply troubling, public accounts of his crimes, suggests 
either that the Bank’s senior-most executives reviewed and approved Epstein’s ongoing 
relationship with the Bank despite knowing about his crimes; or the Bank’s oversight system 
failed, allowing Epstein’s abusive conduct to continue unchecked.   
IV.
JP MORGAN’S SENIOR-MOST EXECUTIVES SUPERVISED THE BANK’S 
RELATIONSHIP WITH EPSTEIN, EVEN YEARS AFTER JP MORGAN 
TERMINATED EPSTEIN’S ACCOUNTS 
73.
JP Morgan was clearly fully aware of Epstein’s abusive conduct, and its lower-level 
employees held deep concerns about the Bank’s ever-deeper relationship with Epstein.  But JP 
Morgan’s senior-most executives did not share this concern—and this extends far beyond just 
Defendant Staley, Epstein’s close friend and apparent fellow abuser (as discussed infra), whom JP 
Morgan is now attempting to hold solely responsible for its longstanding failures.  Mary Erdoes—
who currently serves as the CEO of JP Morgan’s Asset and Wealth Management division—visited 
Epstein at his New York home in both 2011 and 2013.  Erdoes is also reported to have exchanged 
USVI Complaint, ¶50. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 21 of 53

“dozens of emails” with Epstein, including with regard to a charitable fund that JP Morgan 
considered launching together with Epstein.29  Similarly, John Duffy—who served as Vice 
Chairman of JP Morgan and as the CEO of JP Morgan’s private bank for ultrawealthy clients—
also visited Epstein at his New York home in April 2013.  Just one month later, the private bank 
that Duffy ran re-authorized Epstein to borrow money against his accounts, despite JP Morgan’s 
compliance officials’ repeated warnings about Epstein’s suspicious practices and criminal 
behavior.  Another senior JP Morgan executive who worked at the private bank, Justin Nelson, 
visited Epstein’s New York home around six times between 2014-2017—after the bank 
supposedly terminated Epstein’s accounts.  Nelson also visited Epstein at his ranch in New Mexico 
in 2016.  Defendant Kessler—who was a member of the Board from 1995 to 2007⸺was former 
college classmates, close friends and business partners with Epstein’s main benefactor, Leslie 
Wexner (“Wexner”), with whom Kessler co-founded a real estate development business.  Wexner, 
a multibillionaire, has been called Epstein’s “biggest client” and likely helped provide Epstein with 
a substantial part of the wealth that enabled his scheme of sexual abuse and predation.  
74.
These ties pale in comparison, however, to Defendant Staley’s intimate—and 
potentially criminal—relationship with Epstein.  Staley led JP Morgan’s Private Banking division 
(which was later run by Duffy) from 1999-2001, during which time he formed a close relationship 
with Epstein.  Staley later served as the CEO of JP Morgan’s Asset Management division from 
2001 until 2009, and was then promoted in 2009 to serve as the CEO of JP Morgan’s Investment 
Bank.  Staley left JP Morgan in 2013: the same year that the bank terminated Epstein’s accounts.  
75.
Between 2008 and 2013, Staley used his JP Morgan email account to exchange 
some 1,200 emails with Epstein, reflecting the deep bond the two men shared.  Some of these 
WSJ Article. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 22 of 53

emails suggest that Staley may have participated in or taken advantage of Epstein’s criminal 
trafficking operation.  In December 2008, for example, Epstein and Staley discussed Staley visiting 
Epstein at his residence in Palm Beach.  Although Epstein was not going to be in Palm Beach at 
the time, Epstein invited Staley to use his house.  In early January 2009, around the time that Staley 
was staying at Epstein’s house in Palm Beach, Epstein wired $2,000 from his JP Morgan account 
to a woman with an Eastern European surname.  (Many of the women that Epstein trafficked were 
from Eastern Europe).  
76.
Later that same year, Epstein and Staley again discussed getting together, this time 
in London.30  In late August 2009, Epstein asked Staley whether he would need anything while he 
was in London; Staley said yes.  Just two days later, Epstein again used his JP Morgan account to 
wire $3,000 to the same woman he had paid while Staley was in Palm Beach.  This, of course, was 
after Epstein’s 2008 plea agreement related to his charges for solicitation of a minor in Florida.  
77.
Just months later, in November 2009, while Epstein was in jail, Staley again took 
advantage of Epstein’s hospitality—but this time at Epstein’s now-infamous private island, Little 
St. James.  While there, Staley wrote Epstein via email: “So when all hell breaks lo[o]se, and the 
world is crumbling, I will come here, and be at peace.  Presently, I’m in the hot tub with a glass of 
white wine.  This is an amazing place.  Truly amazing.  Next time, we’re here together.  I owe you 
much.  And I deeply appreciate our friendship.  I have few so profound.”31
78.
The following month, Staley made clear that he was fully aware of Epstein’s crimes 
and the risk that his ongoing relationship with Epstein posed to him.  On December 4, 2009, Staley 
seemingly met with Epstein in New York, and then wrote to him via email: “I realize the danger

USVI Complaint, ¶56. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 23 of 53

in sending this email.  But it was great to be able, today, to give you, in New York City, a long 
heartfelt, hug.”32
79.
The next day and later that same month, Epstein sent pictures of young women to 
Staley, to which Staley responded with cryptic commentary.  Staley again visited Little St. James 
the following month, in January 2010.  Later that year, in July, Staley had the following exchange 
with Epstein via email, strongly suggesting that Epstein was procuring victims for Staley:  
Staley: “Maybe they’re tracking u? That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.”  
Epstein: “[w]hat character would you like next?”  
Staley: “Beauty and the Beast” 
Epstein: “[W]ell one side is available.”33
80.
After the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sued JP Morgan in this Court, JP 
Morgan filed its own complaint against Staley, effectively alleging that Staley was solely 
responsible for the Bank’s longstanding relationship with Epstein, and that Staley concealed 
Epstein’s criminal activity from JP Morgan.  But the allegations detailed above, and those brought 
by Doe 1 and the U.S. Virgin Islands government, make clear that employees and senior executive 
officers across JP Morgan were fully aware of Epstein’s abusive conduct, and fully aware that 
Epstein was using his many JP Morgan accounts in a manner that was highly suspicious, if not 
obviously illegitimate.  JP Morgan’s effort to paint Staley as the sole wrongdoer is little more than 
an attempt to evade legal and reputational responsibility for knowingly failingly to report—and 
thereby enabling—Epstein’s criminal conduct for more than a decade.

V.
BY FAILING TO TAKE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO NUMEROUS RED FLAGS 
CONCERNING EPSTEIN’S CONDUCT, THE DIRECTOR DEFENDANTS 
BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES 
81.
The Board’s most fundamental responsibility is to ensure that the Company is 
operating within the law.  JP Morgan, which operates a national bank, is subject to stringent 
requirements with respect to detecting and reporting potentially criminal activity.  But instead of 
conducting effective oversight of JP Morgan’s operations, the Board sat idly by while the 
Company was used to facilitate a massive sex trafficking enterprise.  Instead of ensuring that the 
appropriate reports of suspicious activity were filed with federal authorities, for years the Board 
allowed the Bank to continue to rake in fees from Epstein’s dozens of accounts.  Even after the 
Company closed Epstein’s accounts, the Board continued to abdicate its responsibility to file 
SARs.  Finally, the Board failed to act with respect to its own executive, Staley, who knew about 
and participated in Epstein’s pernicious sex-trafficking ring. 
A.
COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL BANKING LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS MISSION 
CRITICAL FOR JP MORGAN
82.
JP Morgan and its commercial bank subsidiaries are regulated and supervised by 
numerous regulatory agencies, both domestically and internationally, including the U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), as well as other federal 
agencies, state banking and insurance departments, and international financial services authorities. 
83.
JP Morgan acknowledges that the Company is “highly regulated” and represents in 
its Code of Conduct that legal compliance with those laws and regulations “is not just a critical 
part of our business, but fundamental to who we are.”  It advises its employees and directors that 
they must “comply with the letter, spirit, and intent of laws, regulations and Firm policies,” and 
that any violations “may weaken customer confidence, put our reputation at risk, impact market 
integrity, or result in regulator criticism, legal actions, fines or penalties, or other negative 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 25 of 53

repercussions.”  JP Morgan employees and directors are prohibited from engaging in outside 
activities that “reflect adversely on JP Morgan or give rise to a real or apparent conflict of interest 
with [their] duties to the firm.”  Dimon himself has asserted that the Company has “zero tolerance” 
for improper behavior and that the bank complies with “the letter and spirit of the laws and 
regulations everywhere we do business.”34
84.
Financial institutions, like JP Morgan, are susceptible to serving as conduits for 
significant financial crimes, including money laundering.  The federal government has therefore 
established a series of clear AML laws and regulations meant to safeguard the economy by 
ensuring that banks do not engage in, or facilitate, illegitimate activities.  
85.
The primary laws governing banks with respect to AML are the Bank Secrecy Act 
of 1970 (“BSA”) and certain provisions of the USA Patriot Act.35
86.
Congress enacted the BSA to address an increase in money laundering making its 
way through financial institutions.  Together, the BSA and the Patriot Act create mandatory 
reporting and record-keeping requirements to track currency transactions and detect and prevent 
money laundering and the facilitation of other crimes.  The law requires banks to maintain 
compliance programs to prevent, identify, and report suspicious and potentially criminal activity.  
The BSA and its implementing regulations mandate that banks institute policies, procedures, and 
controls to protect against money laundering, oversee monitoring with respect to BSA 
requirements, and test their compliance programs.  Each regulated bank “must have a BSA/AML 
JP Morgan Code of Conduct (2022) at ii., 
 available at https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-
co/documents/code-of-conduct.pdf.

Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001(USA-PATRIOT), Pub. L. 107-56. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 26 of 53

compliance program commensurate with its respective BSA/AML risk profile.”36  And it is the 
board of directors, “acting through senior management,” that is “ultimately responsible for 
ensuring that the bank maintains an effective BSA/AML internal control structure, including 
suspicious activity monitoring and reporting.”37  Yet policies are not enough; as explained by the 
Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Counsel—an interagency group of bank 
regulators⸺“practices must coincide with the bank’s written policies, procedures, and 
processes.”38
87.
Internal controls should (among other requirements): 

Identify banking operations . . . more vulnerable to abuse by money 
launderers and criminals; provide for periodic updates to the bank’s 
risk profile; and provide for a BSA/AML compliance program 
tailored to manage risks. 

Inform the board of directors, or a committee thereof, and senior 
management, of compliance initiatives, identified compliance 
deficiencies, and corrective action taken, and notify directors and 
senior management of [SARs] filed. 

Implement 
risk-based 
[customer 
due 
diligence] 
policies, 
procedures, and processes. 

Identify reportable transactions and accurately file all required 
reports including [SARs], Currency Transaction Reports (“CTRs”), 
and CTR exemptions . . . [and] 

Provide sufficient controls and monitoring systems for timely 
detection and reporting of suspicious activity.39

88.
In addition to the broad requirement for effective, meaningful internal controls, 
federal law also requires that banks promptly notify authorities upon discovering any suspicious 
activity.  These SARs are “the cornerstone of the BSA reporting system” and are “critical to the 
United States’ ability to utilize financial information to combat terrorist financing, money 
laundering, and other financial crimes.”40  The failure to timely file SARs deprives law 
enforcement of essential information it needs to combat serious crimes.   
89.
BSA’s implementing regulations, 12 CFR § 21.11 and 12 CFR § 163.180, specify 
the circumstances under which banks must file a SAR.  Section 21.11 provides that banks must 
file SARs whenever they “detect a known or suspected violation of Federal law.”41  More 
specifically, SARs are required whenever a bank: 
detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal 
violations . . . involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank 
and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets where the 
bank believes . . . that it was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and the bank 
has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect . . .42
Similarly, the bank must file a SAR for any transaction conducted through the bank: 
aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the bank knows, suspects, 
or has reason to suspect that:  . . . (ii) The transaction is designed to evade any 
regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act; or (iii) the transaction has no 
business or apparently lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular 
customer would normally be expected to engage, and the institution knows of no 
reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, 
including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.43

90.
Notably, SARs must be submitted the finding of suspicious activity.  Banks may 
not avoid filing a SAR simply because they are not certain the activity at issue constitutes a crime.   
91.
Banks must file any SARs within 30 days “of the initial detection of facts that may 
constitute a basis for filing a SAR.”44  After filing the SAR, management must “promptly notify” 
the bank’s board or a relevant board committee.45  When the suspicious or criminal conduct is 
ongoing, banks are expected to file a new SAR every 90 days.46
B.
JP MORGAN’S BOARD IS OBLIGATED TO ENSURE AND OVERSEE A ROBUST 
AML PROGRAM
92.
JP Morgan’s directors owe fiduciary duties to the Company to conduct adequate 
oversight to ensure JP Morgan and its subsidiaries are not flouting federal laws and regulations.  
These duties include the duty to develop, implement, and enforce effective internal controls 
throughout the Company, including with respect to compliance with federal anti-money-
laundering laws and regulations.  Federal agencies that supervise the banking industry have 
repeatedly emphasized the importance of board oversight with respect to BSA/AML compliance. 
93.
JP Morgan’s primary banking subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is regulated 
by the OCC.47  OCC-regulated banks are required to “establish and implement a risk governance 
framework to manage and control the covered bank’s risk-taking activities.”48  For this purpose,

the OCC has established a set of “minimum standards,” both for the bank’s compliance systems 
and for its board of directors’ oversight.  The standards require, among other things, that the board 
of the bank establish an effective risk governance framework and “actively oversee the [] bank’s 
risk-taking activities and hold management accountable for adhering to the risk governance 
framework.”49
94.
The OCC’s Handbook on Corporate and Risk Governance explains that it is the 
bank’s board that is responsible, inter alia, for “providing effective oversight” and for confirming:  
(i)
“that the bank has a risk management system, including audit, suitable for the 
bank’s size and activities, and understanding the bank’s material risks,” 
(ii)
“that the bank has an effective system of internal controls,” and  
(iii)
“that management’s actions to correct material weaknesses, including those 
identified by the bank, its auditors and regulators, are timely and effective.”50
95.
The Handbook also provides that the bank’s board must “oversee the bank’s 
compliance management programs.”51  As such, the “OCC expects the board to be responsible for 
confirming that a system of internal controls is in place.”52  Accordingly, the board must “receive 
information about the effectiveness of the bank’s internal controls and information systems” and 
“demonstrate that it has an adequate understanding of the bank’s IT infrastructure, inherent risks,

and existing controls.”53  Significantly, the OCC’s Handbook confirms that “the sophistication of 
[a bank’s] risk management system should reflect the bank’s size, complexity, and risk profile.”54
96.
JP Morgan itself—the parent entity—is regulated by, among others, the Federal 
Reserve.  Federal Reserve regulations require, among other things, that holding companies like JP 
Morgan, which have banking subsidiaries, maintain an enterprise-wide risk management program 
that identifies and manages risk throughout the organization, and that the company’s board ensure 
that the banking subsidiaries have the proper internal controls and risk management systems in 
place: 
One of the primary areas of focus for consolidated supervision of large complex 
[bank holding companies] is the adequacy of governance provided by the board and 
senior management.  The culture, expectations, and incentives established by the 
highest levels of corporate leadership set the tone for the entire organization and 
are essential determinants of whether a banking organization is capable of 
maintaining fully effective risk management and internal control processes. 
97.
Further, Regulation YY of the Federal Reserve (12 C.F.R. § 252.33) requires the 
Board’s risk committee approve and review the bank’s risk-management policies and oversee the 
global risk-management framework.  The framework “must be commensurate with [the bank’s] 
structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size and must include”: 
(i)
Policies and procedures establishing risk-management governance, risk 
management procedures, risk-control infrastructure for its global operations; and  
(ii)
Processes and systems for implementing and monitoring compliance with such 
policies and processes, including: 
(A)
Processes and systems for identifying and reporting risks and risk-
management deficiencies, including regarding emerging risks, and 
ensuring effective and timely implementation of actions to address

emerging risks and risk-management deficiencies for its global 
operations [and]  
(B)
Processes and systems for establishing managerial and employee 
responsibility for risk management . . . 55
98.
Board oversight of those systems is imperative, according to the Federal Reserve, 
because “the board serves a critical role in maintaining the firm’s safety and soundness and 
continued financial and operational resilience of its consolidated operations.”56
99.
Two standing committees of the Board—the Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee—impose additional oversight obligations related to the Company’s risk management 
systems, along with its internal controls.  
100.
The Risk Committee’s purpose, according to its Charter, is “to assist the Board in 
its oversight of management’s responsibility to implement an effective global risk management 
framework reasonable designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm’s strategic, credit and 
investment, market, and operational risks.”  The Risk Committee “oversees reputational risks and 
conduct risks within its scope of responsibility.”  It is required to receive and review reports from 
management concerning significant risks, set qualitative and quantitative limits for risk, and 
approve certain risk policies.  The Risk Committee is required to report periodically to the Board 
concerning any “significant matters” reviewed by the committee. 
101.
The Risk Committee is also responsible for appointing and replacing the Chief Risk 
Officer (“CRO”), and setting the Chief Risk Officer’s compensation.  The Risk Committee must 
also review the CRO’s “proposed priorities, budget and staffing plans annually.”

102.
The Audit Committee’s purpose, in relevant part, is to “assist the Board in its 
oversight of . . . [m]anagement’s responsibilities to ensure that there is an effective system of 
controls reasonably designed to:  . . . [m]aintain compliance with the corporation’s ethical 
standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations.”  The Audit Committee 
“oversees reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of responsibility . . .” 
103.
The Charter of the Audit Committee provides that the committee must receive from 
management—including 
the 
Risk 
and

functions—“communications 
and 
presentations,” including concerning “significant control issues” and “material weaknesses in the 
internal control environment.”  The Audit Committee must also “receive communications and 
presentations from management summarizing the suspicious activity report filing activity of the 
Firm and/or its subsidiaries with the appropriate regulatory and law enforcement agencies.” 
104.
By law, regulation, and the Company’s own policies, directors had a non-delegable 
obligation to conduct sufficient, effective oversight to ensure that the bank was operating in 
compliance with the law.  Instead, the Board ignored a series of glaringly obvious indications that 
Jeffrey Epstein used the bank for years to facilitate a sex trafficking operation and to abuse young 
women and girls. 
C.
THE DIRECTORS FAILED TO RESPOND TO BRIGHT RED FLAGS CONCERNING 
EPSTEIN’S USE OF THE BANK’S SERVICES TO CONDUCT A CRIMINAL 
ENTERPRISE
105.
Despite the clear obligations of the Company’s Board—set forth in federal 
regulation and in the Company’s own policies and committee charters⸺to ensure that JP Morgan 
was conducting its business in compliance with the law, for years the Board sat on its hands as the 
Bank continued to provide services to disgraced sexual offender Epstein.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 33 of 53

106.
Since 2006, the directors serving on the Board had knowledge that Epstein was a 
serial abuser of young women and girls.  Even so, the Bank declined to turned him away, choosing 
instead to rake in fees year after year from servicing the accounts through which he operated the 
most notorious sex trafficking ring in recent history.  The Board also failed to ensure that the 
Company was meeting its obligations under federal anti-money-laundering laws.  Upon 
information and belief, at no point from 2006 onward did JP Morgan submit any SARs concerning 
Epstein, despite the mounds of evidence available to the Bank that Epstein was using his cash to 
fund a criminal enterprise and that he was often attempting to structure his transactions to avoid 
government oversight. 
107.
As discussed above, from 1998 to 2013, the Company serviced more than 4 dozen 
accounts for Epstein worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which he used to facilitate his sexual 
abuse of young girls and women.  
108.
The Board knew about Epstein’s predation no later than 2006.  That year, Epstein 
was arrested and indicted for solicitation of a minor, and the press extensively reported about his 
abuse of that, and other, victims.  The Company’s Global Corporate Security Division flagged 
these press reports, but JP Morgan maintained Epstein’s account, despite concluding that it should 
be “classified as high risk” and require special approval. 
109.
Mary Erdoes, a high-level executive at the Company, admitted in a deposition that 
the Company knew in 2006 that Epstein abused young girls and paid them in cash.  At the same 
time, JP Morgan employees were reporting that Epstein was withdrawing $80,000 at a time 
multiple times a month.  The Bank was also aware that Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008, was 
sentenced to serve 18 months in jail, and registered as a sex offender. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 34 of 53

110.
Despite being aware of Epstein’s arrest and guilty plea, and press reports 
concerning his pedophilia, sexual abuse, and engagement in prostitution, the Bank continued to 
provide Epstein with banking services for seven more years following his arrest, facilitating his 
criminal trafficking enterprise.  The Bank continued doing business with the disgraced, but 
wealthy, Epstein, even after Defendant Dimon’s purported review of Epstein’s account. 
111.
As discussed further above, revelations continued even after Epstein’s guilty plea.  
In 2011, the Company was made aware of more allegations of human trafficking involving 
Epstein.  But while employees discussed “the situation,” they did little more than encourage 
Staley—Epstein’s buddy and co-conspirator—to “discuss” the allegations with him.  When 
Epstein denied the allegations, the Bank continued to do business with him.  Later in 2011, the 
Bank was aware of reports that law enforcement was investigating Epstein for participating in 
trafficking and molestation of children and that Epstein had settled “a dozen” claims regarding 
solicitation.  Even a senior compliance official warned that there were “[l]ots of questions” 
concerning Epstein’s behavior.  But the Bank refused to cut Epstein off until 2013. 
112.
The Board was no doubt aware of the mountain of press reports concerning 
Epstein’s conduct, particularly following his very public arrest in 2006.  Yet the Board did not take 
action to terminate the accounts of the ultrawealthy Epstein or cause management to file timely 
SARs.  In failing to ensure that the Bank ceased doing business with the sexual predator, the 
directors engaged in bad faith, risking liability for the Company and causing untold reputational 
harm.   
113.
The obligation to file SARs concerning Epstein’s conduct did not cease when the 
Company finally, and belatedly, terminated Epstein’s account in 2013.  Yet it appears that the 
Bank continued to fail to submit such reports to authorities from 2013 until at least 2019.  Directors 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 35 of 53

on the Board during this period continued to be responsible for ensuring that the Bank met its legal 
obligations, including the obligation to file reports concerning the criminal activity in which 
Epstein engaged while he maintained a banking relationship with JP Morgan.  By failing to ensure 
that the Bank complied with federal laws concerning suspicious transactions and transactions 
potentially implicating criminal activity, Defendants acted in bad faith and breached their fiduciary 
duties to the Company.57
D.
THE COMPANY HAD A TROUBLING HISTORY OF FAILING TO COMPLY WITH 
BSA/AML REGULATIONS AND THE BOARD SHOULD HAVE EXERCISED 
HEIGHTENED DILIGENCE
114.
Furthermore, no later than January 2013, the Board was fully aware of weaknesses 
in JP Morgan’s AML program and should have exercised heightened diligence conducting 
oversight.  On January 14, 2013, the Company’s main banking subsidiary, JP Morgan Chase, N.A., 
entered into a consent order with the OCC (the “2013 OCC Consent Order”) because the regulator 
had “identified deficiencies in the Bank’s overall program for Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money 
Laundering (‘BSA/AML’) compliance . . . ”  More specifically, JP Morgan had failed to correct a 
previously identified problem and BSA/AML compliance violation, and had also violated 
regulations concerning suspicious activity reports. 
115.
According to the OCC, “[t]he Bank has failed to adopt and implement a compliance 
program that adequately covers the required BSA/AML program elements due to an inadequate 
Indeed, it was just this type of failure with respect to Epstein—i.e., a failure to investigate 
Epstein’s banking activities and to report Epstein’s suspicious transactions—that led Deutsche 
Bank to being hit with a $150 million penalty by the N.Y. State Department of Financial Services.  
The regulator noted that the fact that Epstein’s cash withdraws “were suspicious should have been 
obvious to Bank personnel at various levels.  [Deutsche Bank’s] failure to recognize this risk 
constitutes a major compliance failure.” 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 36 of 53

system of internal controls, and ineffective independent testing.”  Notably, the bank58 had failed 
to “develop adequate due diligence on customers, particularly in the Commercial and Business 
Banking Unit, a repeat problem, and failed to file all necessary Suspicious Activity Reports 
(‘SARs’) related to suspicious customer activity.”  The bank had also failed to remedy weaknesses 
in “the effectiveness of monitoring in light of the customers’ cash activity and business type…” 
116.
According to the OCC, JP Morgan had “an inadequate system of internal controls 
and independent testing, “systemic deficiencies in its transaction monitoring systems [and] due 
diligence processes . . .”  The regulator also noted that the bank had “significant shortcomings in 
SAR decision-making protocols and an ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and alerts are 
properly documented, tracked, and resolved.”  In violation of federal regulations, the bank “failed 
to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity and filed the required SARs concerning 
suspicious customer activities . . .”  As a result of the 2013 OCC Consent Order, the bank was 
required to take a series of remedial steps, including evaluating its systems for monitoring 
transactions and filing suspicious activity reports.  It was also required to refresh its risk 
assessments, at least every year.  In addition, the bank was required to conduct a SAR look-back 
to determine “whether additional SARs should be filed on additional subjects or for continuing 
suspicious activity.” 
117.
The 2013 OCC Consent Order was approved by the bank’s board and executed by 
both Defendants Crown and Dimon, on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
118.
Just as the OCC had done with respect to the Company’s banking subsidiary, 
JPMorgan Case, N.A., the Federal Reserve issued a Consent Order against the Company itself in 
Because the OCC orders discussed in this section deal specifically with JP Morgan Chase, N.A., 
references to the “bank” in this section are to this subsidiary, rather than to the parent entity, JP 
Morgan (as defined above). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 37 of 53

January 2013 (the “2013 Federal Reserve Order”).  The 2013 Federal Reserve Order required the 
Board to submit a plan to improve the Company’s “firmwide compliance risk management 
program with regard to compliance with BSA/AML Requirements.”  In the plan, the Board was 
required to address funding for a sufficient compliance program, policies to ensure risks are timely 
identified and managed, and measures to improve the Company’s policies, procedures and 
standards.  The Company was also required to review and address the “policies, procedures, and 
processes” for “identifying and investigating suspicious activity, and for filing suspicious activity 
reports” and “customer due diligence that consolidates information” on each customer. 
119.
Because JP Morgan’s BSA/AML systems continued to be deficient, in January 
2014 the OCC issued a Consent Order of the Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty (the “2014 
OCC Penalty Order”).  The 2014 OCC Penalty Order indicated that the regulator had discovered 
“additional deficiencies in the Bank’s BSA/AML compliance program.”  In particular, the OCC 
determined that the bank continued to fail to remedy previously identified problems with its 
BSA/AML compliance program and continued to violate regulations concerning SARs. 
120.
The OCC determined that, as in 2013, the bank’s BSA/AML program remained 
deficient and the Bank had failed to “develop adequate due diligence on customers” and to “file 
all necessary SARs related to suspicious customer activity.”  The bank “failed to correct previously 
identified systemic weaknesses” concerning customer due diligence and transaction monitoring.  
More specifically, the bank continued to have “significant shortcomings in SAR decision-making 
protocols and an ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and alerts [were] properly 
documented, tracked, and resolved,” and “failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious 
activity and file the required SARs . . .”  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 38 of 53

121.
As a result of these failures, the OCC ordered JP Morgan to pay $350 million in a 
civil money penalty.   
122.
The 2014 Penalty Order was approved by the bank’s board and was executed by 
Defendants Crown, Jackson, and Weldon.   
123.
On January 7, 2014, the bank entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the 
“DPA”) with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  In the DPA, the 
bank admitted that it had failed to file SARs concerning the activities of another extraordinarily 
wealthy banking client, Bernie Madoff.  In the DPA, the bank pleaded guilty to two felony counts 
of failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and failing to file a suspicious 
activity report. 
124.
The 2013 OCC Consent Order remained in effect until May 2019, and the 2013 
Federal Reserve order remained in effect until December 2019. 
125.
Because the bank had pleaded guilty to two felonies and paid $350 million in 
penalties relating to its failures to file suspicious activity reports and other BSA/AML deficiencies, 
the Board was no doubt aware that the Company’s risk management systems—particularly with 
respect to SARs—required additional oversight and diligence.  Even so, in the years following the 
consent orders, upon information and belief, the Company continued to fail to file SAR reports 
concerning the transactions Epstein had conducted with the bank while his account was open. 
E.
THE BOARD FAILED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST STALEY
126.
The Board also failed to pursue claims against Staley until March 8, 2023.  Staley 
was the CEO of JP Morgan’s Asset Management line of business from 2001 to 2009, and then 
became the CEO of the Corporate and Investment Banking line of business in 2009 until he left 
the Company in 2013. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 39 of 53

127.
The evidence of Staley’s involvement with Epstein was clear.  See ¶¶74-80, supra.  
Staley was close friends with Epstein and knew about his sexual predation of young women and 
girls.  According to Doe, Staley “personally observed Doe as a sex trafficking and abuse victim at 
times including through his departure from JP Morgan in 2013.”59  He also met with young girls 
while visiting with Epstein.  Staley is also credibly accused of using “aggressive force in his sexual 
assault” of plaintiff Doe.60
128.
Despite the clear evidence of Staley advocating on behalf of Epstein to maintain 
his Company accounts, despite having access to over 1,200 emails sent from Staley’s JP Morgan 
company account to Epstein which raised questions about Staley’s possible involvement in 
Epstein’s criminal enterprise, and despite press reports making clear the close relationship between 
Epstein and Staley, the Director Defendants failed to pursue claims against Staley until March 
2023.  At that time, the Company filed claims against him, including for breaching his fiduciary 
duty and violating the “faithless servant doctrine.”  By failing to act in a timely fashion, the Board 
has risked the viability of the claim by subjecting it to a potential statute of limitations defense.  
Indeed, in his April 24, 2023 Motion to Dismiss in the lawsuit JP Morgan belatedly brought against 
Staley, Staley has argued that those claims are time-barred.61
VI.
THE OFFICER DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES 
129.
Officers of Delaware corporations, like directors, have fiduciary duties to the 
companies, including the duties of good faith and due care.  Officers’ duty of good faith includes

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 40 of 53

an obligation to conduct adequate oversight.  Officers are required to “make a good faith effort to 
ensure that information systems are in place” so that “officers receive relevant and timely 
information that they can provide to the directors.”62  Officers must also act on red flags of which 
they are aware, as they are “optimally positioned to identify red flags and either address them or 
report upward to more senior officers or to the board.”63
130.
Officers of banking entities have specific obligations when it comes to protecting 
the companies from risk, including BSA/AML risk. The OCC’s Comptroller’s Handbook explains 
that the “OCC expects senior management to be responsible for developing and maintaining the 
risk governance framework and system of internal controls, which enables management to 
effectively identify, measure, monitor, control, and report risk exposures consistent with the board-
established risk appetite.”64  Moreover, the “CEO and his or her senior management team should 
be responsible for,” among other things, “complying with laws, regulations, and internal bank 
policies, including policies governing ethics and insider activities,” developing and administering 
a risk governance framework that enables management to effectively identify, measure, monitor, 
and control risk,” and “establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal controls.” 
131.
JP Morgan’s policies spell out in particular the obligations of the Chief Risk Officer 
(“CRO”) of the Company.  The CRO is required to attend meetings of the Board’s Risk Committee 
and to discuss with the committee “any concerns that they reasonably believe could be material to 
the Firm or to a line of business,” including any “actions that have been or are planned to be taken

to address such concerns.”  Between meetings, the CRO must “promptly report” any such issues 
to the Risk Committee’s Chair.  The CRO also has full access to communications with and report 
to the Audit Committee “on any matter relevant to risk and compliance.” 
132.
Despite their obligations under federal banking laws and regulations, and the 
Company’s own policies, the Officer Defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary obligations of due 
care and oversight.  Like the Director Defendants, the Officer Defendants ignored the glaring red 
flags concerning the Company’s complicity in a criminal sex trafficking scheme, including 
repeated news reports concerning Epstein’s involvement in the abuse of girls and young women.   
133.
The Officer Defendants—including Defendants Bacon, Hogan, and Zubrow (JP 
Morgan’s CROs)—failed to ensure that the Company was following the law and its own policies 
with respect to the AML compliance.  According to an investigation by the U.S. Virgin Islands 
government, “it does not appear . . . that JP Morgan engaged in any investigation of the source of 
Epstein’s funds.”65  Likewise, the Company also “seemingly did no due diligence on the nature of 
the various business entities for which it held accounts for Epstein, which appear to have no 
legitimate business purpose and, upon information and belief, were part of Epstein’s criminal 
enterprise in the Virgin Islands.”66
134.
The Officer Defendants also failed to ensure that SARs were timely filed 
concerning Epstein’s banking activities.  A convicted felon and sex offender was able to continue 
withdraw tens of thousands of dollars in cash every month from the Bank for years, using those 
funds to abuse young women and girls.  When Company employees finally did start to raise 
alarms—given repeated press reports about Epstein’s activities—management did nothing.

Internal discussions resulted in nothing more than Staley—Epstein’s buddy—feeling Epstein out 
and reporting back to other employees that all was well.  And a review of Epstein’s account that 
was to be conducted by CEO Dimon either never took place or, if it did, Dimon must have 
sanctioned the bank’s relationship with Epstein, as it was not until 2013—some seven years after 
Epstein was arrested—that the Bank closed his accounts.  Because of the Officer Defendants’ 
failure to act in good faith and with due care, the bank thus helped Epstein prey on vulnerable girls 
for almost a decade.

Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation above as if set forth in full 
herein. 
141.
Plaintiff has not made a demand on the Board to pursue the claims set forth herein 
because any pre-suit demand would be futile and is therefore excused as a matter of law. 
142.
The Demand Board consists of twelve directors: Defendants Dimon, Bammann, 
Burke, Combs, Crown, Flynn, Hobson, and Neal, as well as non-Defendants Davis, Gorsky, 
Novakovic, and Rometty.   
143.
A demand on the current Board would be futile because eight of the Demand Board 
Members⸺Defendants Dimon, Bammann, Burke, Combs, Crown, Flynn, Hobson, and 
Neal⸺face a substantial risk of liability for acting in bad faith by knowingly or recklessly 
permitting the Company to continue to serve as a banker for Epstein’s criminal enterprise and for 
failing to ensure that JP Morgan operated in compliance with federal law and Company policy 
concerning the timely filing of SARs.   
144.
Each of the Defendant Demand Board members either served on the Board during 
the time that Epstein maintained his accounts at JP Morgan used them to conduct his sex trafficking 
scheme (i.e., Defendants Dimon, Burke, Crown, and Flynn) and/or served on the Board during the 
time in which JP Morgan was obligated, but failed, to submit SARs regarding Epstein’s 
transactions with the bank (i.e., Defendants Dimon, Burke, Combs, Crown, Flynn, Hobson, and 
Neal). 
145.
Defendants on the Board at the time of the OCC orders face additional risk because 
they were not only aware of Epstein’s conduct, but they were also serving at the time the Company 
was sanctioned because of its history of failing to comply with AML rules, including rules 
concerning SARs.  Defendants Dimon, Bammann, Burke, Crown, and Flynn were each on the 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 44 of 53

Board at the time one or more of the regulators’ orders were issued.  Moreover, Defendants Dimon 
and Crown both executed the 2013 OCC Consent Order, which established that the Company had 
deficiencies in its BSA/AML compliance program in violation of federal law and regulations.  
Despite being fully cognizant of the weakness in the Company’s AML program, Defendants failed 
to act to ensure that timely reports were filed concerning Epstein’s conduct. 
146.
Defendant Dimon, in particular, faces a substantial risk of liability.  He has been 
the Company’s CEO since 2006 and Chairman since 2007, even before Epstein was arrested.  He 
also either failed to review the Epstein accounts over which Company employees had raised 
concerns or, having reviewed them, failed to act to close the predator off from his funds.  He also 
failed to ensure that his management team effectively supervised the Company’s BSA/AML 
compliance system. 
147.
Defendant Bammann also has an increased risk of liability as she, in particular, 
should have been alert to federal requirements concerning an effective BSA/AML program and to 
the Company’s deficiencies in meeting those standards.  When public reports emerged about 
Epstein’s criminal conduct, Bammann should have taken action to ascertain the Company’s 
involvement with Epstein, close his accounts, and file timely SARs.  After all, before joining the 
Board, and during the time that Epstein maintained his accounts at the bank, Bammann served as 
Deputy Head of Risk Management for JP Morgan Chase, N.A., and before that, as Chief Risk 
Management Officer at Bank One.  Indeed, in encouraging shareholders to support her Board 
nomination, the Company touted her “extensive expertise in risk management and regulatory 
issues.”67
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Schedule 14A (2015) at 11. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 45 of 53

148.
Thus, any lawsuit initiated to remedy the wrongs complained of herein would 
expose at least eight of the twelve current Board members to significant personal liability for their 
bad faith breaches of fiduciary duties and other misconduct. 
149.
The Demand Board members also suffer from a lack of independence from 
Defendant Dimon.  The Demand Board directors have demonstrated their lack of independence by 
choosing to pursue its belated claims only against Staley, choosing to pin all of the Defendants’ 
failures on him and to avoid implicating Dimon in JP Morgan’s misconduct concerning Epstein.  
In contrast, an independent Board would have promptly pursued claims against all of those 
individuals—including directors and former directors—who failed to implement and oversee an 
effective BSA/AML system and ignored waving red flags.  Rather that aggressively pursuing 
claims against all involved officers, the Demand Board “circled the wagons” by seeking to tag 
only an executive that conveniently no longer works for JP Morgan. 
150.
In addition, Defendant Bammann is conflicted because she is a former Company 
executive and worked closely with and for Defendant Dimon.  She served under, and reported to, 
Defendant Dimon at Bank One from 2000-2004, where he publicly praised her contributions; she 
followed Dimon to the Company when it acquired Bank One, and worked for him until the end of 
2005, later returning to the Company to join the Board in 2013.  As a spokesman for institutional 
investor CtW Investment Group noted, Bammann was too close to Dimon, and “[b]ringing in 
someone who is a former deputy of Jamie Dimon’s is absolutely the wrong move.”  With her close 
ties to the man under whom she served for half a decade, Bammann could not reasonably be 
expected to pursue litigation against Defendant Dimon.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 46 of 53

151.
For the foregoing reasons, at least eight of the twelve members of the Demand 
Board are incapable of impartially considering a litigation demand against the Defendants, and 
demand is therefore excused as futile.  
CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
COUNT I
Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 
(Against The Director Defendants) 
152.
Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation above as if set forth in full 
herein. 
153.
The Director Defendants, as current and former directors of JP Morgan, all owed 
and owe and owe fiduciary duties to JP Morgan and its stockholders.  By reason of their fiduciary 
relationships, the Director Defendants specifically owed and owe JP Morgan the highest obligation 
of good faith and loyalty in the administration of the affairs of the Company, including, without 
limitation, the oversight of JP Morgan’s compliance with the BSA and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, and laws and regulations governing AML requirements.  
154.
In addition, the Director Defendants owed and owe specific fiduciary duties as 
defined by the Company’s corporate governance documents, including the charters of various 
Board committees (including, but not limited to, those of the Audit and Risk Policy Committees) 
that, had they been discharged in accordance with the Director Defendants’ obligations, would 
have necessarily prevented the misconduct and the consequent harm to the Company alleged 
herein.  
155.
The Director Defendants consciously breached their fiduciary duties and violated 
their corporate responsibilities by affirmatively and repeatedly ignoring red flags related to 
Epstein’s criminal activity and Epstein’s criminal use of his accounts and funds at JP Morgan.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 47 of 53

156.
As a direct and proximate result of the Director Defendants’ conscious failure to 
perform their fiduciary duties and exercise their oversight responsibility, JP Morgan has sustained, 
and will continue to sustain, significant damages—both financially and to its corporate image and 
goodwill.  Such damages to JP Morgan caused by the Director Defendants include and will include, 
substantial penalties, fines, damages awards, settlements, expenses, increased regulatory scrutiny, 
reputational harm, and other liabilities described herein.   
157.
As a result of the misconduct alleged herein, the Director Defendants are liable to 
the Company. 
COUNT II
Breach Of Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty 
(Against The Officer Defendants) 
158.
Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation above as if set forth in full 
herein. 
159.
The Officer Defendants, as current and former officers of JP Morgan, all owed and 
owe fiduciary duties to JP Morgan and its stockholders.  By reason of their fiduciary relationships, 
the Officer Defendants specifically owed and owe JP Morgan the highest obligation of good faith 
and loyalty in the administration of the affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, the 
oversight of JP Morgan’s compliance with the BSA and regulations promulgated thereunder, and 
laws and regulations governing AML requirements.  
160.
In addition, the Officer Defendants owed and owe specific fiduciary duties as 
defined by the Company’s corporate governance documents that, had they been discharged in 
accordance with the Officer Defendants’ obligations, would have necessarily prevented the 
misconduct and the consequent harm to the Company alleged herein.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 48 of 53

161.
The Officer Defendants consciously breached their fiduciary duties and violated 
their corporate responsibilities by affirmatively and repeatedly ignoring red flags related to 
Epstein’s criminal activity and Epstein’s criminal use of his accounts and funds at JP Morgan.  
162.
As a direct and proximate result of the Officer Defendants’ conscious failure to 
perform their fiduciary duties and exercise their oversight responsibility, JP Morgan has sustained, 
and will continue to sustain, significant damages—both financially and to its corporate image and 
goodwill.  Such damages to JP Morgan caused by the Officer Defendants include and will include, 
substantial penalties, fines, damages awards, settlements, expenses, increased regulatory scrutiny, 
reputational harm, and other liabilities described herein.   
163.
As a result of the misconduct alleged herein, the Officer Defendants are liable to 
the Company.  
COUNT III 
Breach Of Fiduciary Duty of Care 
(Against The Officer Defendants) 
164.
Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation above as if set forth in full 
herein. 
165.
The Officer Defendants, as current and former officers of JP Morgan, all owed and 
owe fiduciary duties to JP Morgan and its stockholders.  By reason of their fiduciary relationships, 
the Officer Defendants specifically owed and owe JP Morgan the highest obligation of due care in 
the administration of the affairs of the Company, including, without limitation, ensuring JP 
Morgan’s compliance with the BSA and regulations promulgated thereunder, and laws and 
regulations governing AML requirements.  
166.
In addition, the Officer Defendants owed and owe specific fiduciary duties as 
defined by the Company’s corporate governance documents that, had they been discharged in 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 1     Filed 05/09/23     Page 49 of 53

accordance with the Officer Defendants’ obligations, would have necessarily prevented the 
misconduct and the consequent harm to the Company alleged herein.  
167.
The Officer Defendants consciously breached their fiduciary duties and violated 
their corporate responsibilities by consistently and repeatedly permitting JP Morgan to breach or 
fail to comply with its legal and regulatory reporting and compliance requirements related to 
Epstein’s criminal activity and Epstein’s criminal use of his accounts and funds at JP Morgan.  
168.
As a direct and proximate result of the Officer Defendants’ failure to perform their 
fiduciary duties, JP Morgan has sustained, and will continue to sustain, significant damages—both 
financially and to its corporate image and goodwill.  Such damages to JP Morgan caused by the 
Officer Defendants include and will include, substantial penalties, fines, damages awards, 
settlements, expenses, increased regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, and other liabilities 
described herein.   
169.
As a result of the misconduct alleged herein, the Officer Defendants are liable to 
the Company.

On May 1, 2023, the Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part JP Morgan's motion to dismiss
Doe's First Amended Complaint (Docket #130). The parties are proceeding with certain fact discovery, including
the service of document subpoenas and certain depositions scheduled for May 2023.
The newly-filed litigation and earlier-filed litigation arise from a common nucleus of operative
fact related to Epstein's longstanding history as a client of JP Morgan, and JP Morgan's
concealment and/or failure to report Epstein's suspicious banking practices to regulators.
The earlier-filed litigation asserts that JP Morgan facilitated, concealed, and/or enabled
Epstein's abuse of dozens of victims, in violation of New York and federal law. The newly-
filed litigation seeks to hold the board of directors liable for breaching their fiduciary duties by
failing to properly oversee JP Morgan's relationship with Epstein and JP Morgan's
compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, and thereby allowing JP Morgan's
misconduct related to Epstein to occur.

The Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, U.S.D.J. has ordered that counsel for all parties attend a conference, at 
the time and place fixed below, for the purpose of case management and scheduling pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 16.  You are directed to furnish all attorneys in this action with copies of this notice and enclosures, and to
furnish Chambers with a copy of any transmittal letter(s).  If you are unaware of the identity of counsel for
any of the parties, you should send a copy of the notice and rules to that party personally, informing the party
that any unrepresented party is required to appear at the conference in person. Finally, upon receipt of this
notice, please immediately furnish Chambers with a courtesy copy of your complaint and F.R.C.P.
Rule 7.1 Statement, if applicable.
Since this case has been designated an electronic case, by the date of the initial pretrial 
conference counsel for all parties are required to register as filing users in accordance with the 
Procedures for Electronic Case Filing and file an Notice of Appearance.   
DATE AND PLACE OF CONFERENCE:  6/26/2023, ON A TELECONFERENCE LINE AT

Caller Paid/International Toll: (215) 446-3657; Access Code: 1086415.
No application for adjournment will be considered unless made within one week of the date of 
this notice.  The fact that any party has not answered the complaint does not excuse attendance by 
that party or warrant any adjournment of the conference.
No later than one week prior to the conference, the parties shall furnish the Court with a 
written report of their agreements or disagreements regarding planning of discovery pursuant to Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 26(f).  Enclosed is a form (Form D) for a Case Management Plan that the parties may utilize in
making this report.  In the absence of agreement, the Court, after hearing from counsel, will order a Case
Management Plan and schedule at the conference.  Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Plan shall
provide that the case be ready for trial within five months of the date of the conference.
In addition to the matters covered in Form D, counsel should also be prepared to address at the 
conference the factual and legal bases for their claims or defenses, any issue as to subject matter jurisdiction, 
and any other issue relevant to case management.

VERIFIED AMENDED STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff City of Miami General Employees & Sanitation Employees Retirement Trust and 
Plaintiff Operating Engineers Construction Industry and Miscellaneous Pension Fund 
(“Plaintiffs”), for the benefit of nominal defendant JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPM” or the 
“Company”), bring the following Verified Amended Stockholder Derivative Complaint (the 
“Complaint”) against Defendants James Dimon, Stephen B. Burke, Todd A. Combs, James S. 
Civil Case No: 1:23-cv-03903

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 1 of 69

Crown, Timothy P. Flynn, Mellody Hobson, John W. Kessler, Phebe N. Novakovic, and James E. 
Staley.  The allegations of this Complaint are based on the knowledge of Plaintiffs as to themselves 
and the investigation of counsel, including the review of publicly available information and 
documents. 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
 When an otherwise reputable financial institution learns that a client is using bank 
facilities to further a criminal scheme, the ensuing appropriate steps are clear:  the bank terminates 
its relationship with the client, immediately reports the incident to regulators, and informs the 
board of directors of the problem.  But what should this Court infer when those commonsensical 
– and legally required – actions do not occur?  
2. 
The bank at issue in this stockholder derivative action (the “Action”) is JPM, one 
of the world’s largest financial institutions.  Based on Plaintiffs’ investigation, it appears that the 
Company did have appropriate internal controls in place to identify suspicious activity, such as 
massive cash withdrawals and wires by Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”), a known felon convicted for 
soliciting a minor for prostitution and clouded by allegations of rampant sexual abuse.  Indeed, 
beginning in 2006, JPM’s compliance staff repeatedly flagged the need to end the bank’s ties to 
Epstein, sending distress calls all the way up to the Company’s second most-powerful decision-
maker, Defendant James “Jes” Staley (“Staley”).  
3. 
For instance, in 2011, JPM’s own General Counsel, Stephen Cutler (“Cutler”), 
documented his unambiguous recommendation about Epstein, emailing Staley and CEO of JPM’s 
Asset and Wealth Management business, Mary Erdoes (“Erdoes”), among others:  “This is not an 
honorable person in any way.  He should not be a client.”  Despite these calls to cut ties with 
Epstein making it to the Company’s C-suite – and, some of these cries coming from the C-suite 
itself – Epstein remained a client until 2013, JPM did not report Epstein’s suspicious activity to 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 2 of 69

regulators, and there is no evidence that JPM’s board of directors (the “Board”) ever discussed 
Epstein prior to his death by apparent suicide in 2019.    
4. 
The fundamental question that this Action presents is, why?  Why didn’t Staley, his 
boss, Defendant Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman Jamie Dimon (“Dimon”), and 
the JPM Board fire Epstein and his affiliates after the imperative of terminating the relationship 
was recognized throughout the organization?  JPM has proffered one answer, although it is both 
implausible and unsatisfying.  In recent litigation, the Company has tried to lay all of the blame on 
Staley for the Company’s ongoing relationship with Epstein, which facilitated Epstein’s payments 
to victims and network of enablers.  In particular, JPM faults Staley for not reporting his alleged 
knowledge of – and personal participation in – Epstein’s crimes to the Company. 
5. 
Even assuming that Staley obscured his relationship with Epstein, Staley’s 
misconduct does not tell the whole story.  JPM executives – who presumably attended Board 
meetings and reported to directors – plainly were aware of the Company’s compliance 
department’s urges to fire Epstein.  And, the Board – comprised of intelligent people at the 
forefront of the business world – very likely were aware of rampant allegations of sexual 
misconduct levied against a purported billionaire deeply integrated into the highest reaches of the 
financial and political communities.    
6. 
So, again, why did none of the JPM fiduciaries take action?  As detailed below, 
Epstein was anything but a “regular” counterparty and client.  Independent of the child sex rings 
that made him one of the world’s most notorious criminals, he had a uniquely diverse set of 
connections to the people who shaped the JPM of today and who still control its operations.  These 
connections may explain why these fiduciaries proverbially “put their heads in the sand” and hoped 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 3 of 69

the Company’s (and their own) ties to Epstein would go unnoticed—a far more plausible story 
than JPM’s tale making Staley the lone scapegoat.     
7. 
At bottom, the failure by the individuals at the very top of JPM to do the obvious 
thing their fiduciary duties required, i.e., to cut Epstein off at the very latest by his 2008 guilty plea 
for soliciting a minor for prostitution, likely reflects something worse than a “mere” failure of 
internal controls or poor oversight.  Instead, it reflects, at a minimum, a bad faith disregard for 
their duties.  
*-*-*-*-*-* 
8. 
Epstein was anything but a “run of the mill” JPM client.  After a young Jeffrey 
Epstein suddenly left Bear Stearns in 1980, he audaciously opened a financial advisory firm, J. 
Epstein & Co., premised on only representing billionaires.  Somewhat inexplicably, he succeeded 
in not only advising, but often gaining the full power of attorney over the fortunes of some of the 
world’s richest and most powerful people.  Those (presumably legitimate) connections and the 
banking services needed to cater to that clientele would make him a marquee client that should get 
the attention of any bank CEO and board.   
9. 
Beyond the profits his advisory firm could generate, Epstein also had alleged ties 
to some of the darker corners of the geo-political community, including personal entanglement in 
some of the most notorious financial and political schemes of the 1980s and 1990s.  It is almost 
inconceivable that a person whose entire career implicates so many widely reported scandals (such 
as infamous hedge fund Ponzi schemes, stealing software with national security implications, and 
even financing weapons and drug trade in the Iran-Contra affair) can go through any respectable 
Know Your Customer (“KYC”) bank vetting process without being tagged from the outset as a 
high-risk client.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 4 of 69

10. 
But Epstein’s reach also extended to the events and people who made JPM the 
institution it is today.  In fact, by using his close friendship with apparel giant Leslie “Les” Wexner 
(“Wexner”) as an entryway into the business and social elite circles of Columbus, Ohio, Epstein 
developed direct or one-step-removed financial or personal ties to a range of individuals who 
served or currently serve on the JPM Board.   
11. 
These entanglements start no later than the 1980s, when Epstein salvaged a major 
financing and real estate transaction in which a number of power players in the Columbus, Ohio 
business community participated.  During that period, Wexner worked with prominent local 
executives, including future JPM directors James S. Crown (“Crown”) and John W. Kessler 
(“Kessler”) and the McCoy family (which founded and controlled Bank One Corporation (“Bank 
One”), the largest bank in Ohio), to develop an idyllic community called New Albany, Ohio, which 
sought to house some of the most influential names in American business.   
12. 
The Crown family had inherited via merger General Dynamics Corporation 
(“General Dynamics”), a weapons manufacturer with deep governmental ties, and enjoyed seats 
on the board of First Chicago, another prominent Midwestern bank, before it was acquired by Bank 
One and Crown joined the Bank One board.  Kessler was a well-connected and prominent 
corporate lawyer in Columbus, Ohio, who advised on a wide range of deals for Wexner, the 
McCoys, and the Crowns alike, and enjoyed a seat on the Bank One board. 
13. 
Despite being backed by a marquee lineup of Columbus citizens, the New Albany 
project struggled initially.  Its early development was exceedingly expensive and complex, and 
was mishandled by its original financial leadership.  That changed after Epstein came along.  
Epstein was given a partnership interest in the New Albany project for a nominal investment.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 5 of 69

Epstein promptly re-organized and restructured the New Albany development project so it could 
take hold, be completed, and ultimately flourish.   
14. 
Until 2000, Dimon had established his Wall Street reputation by serving as second-
in-command in helping Sanford “Sandy” Weill (“Weill”) transform his purchase of several 
financial institutions with links to both Epstein and British financier Robert Maxwell (whose 
daughter Ghislaine remains in jail for her critical role in Epstein’s sex trafficking ring) into the 
current-day global banking behemoth Citigroup.  After Dimon and Weill split up in 1998, Dimon 
re-emerged as Bank One’s CEO, replacing a member of the McCoy family.  Crown and Kessler 
both sat on the Bank One board and, as detailed below, had glowing things to say about Dimon.  
Thereafter, Dimon ingratiated himself in and publicly praised the Columbus business community, 
to which Epstein was described as “ubiquitous.”  While Dimon denies ever meeting Epstein, his 
professed ignorance of the man’s existence strains credibility. 
15. 
After JPM’s 2003 acquisition of Bank One, several former Bank One directors and 
officers joined the highest ranks of the Company, including Dimon, Crown, Kessler, Stephen B. 
Burke (“Burke”), and Linda B. Bammann (“Bammann”).  It also appears that even before the 
merger, JPM knew that Epstein was not a “typical” client, be it his line to banking services for 
billionaire clients or more controversial issues.  Staley, the head of JPM’s private bank at the time, 
claims that he was told in 2000 to “get to know” his new (and presumably important) client.   
16. 
Put simply, Defendants may not have known that Epstein catered to the worst 
proclivities of some of the world’s most powerful people.  But it appears that numerous people at 
the apex of Bank One’s, and later JPM’s, decision-making structure not only knew of Epstein, but 
also either had direct dealings with him or understood that they were engaged in significant 
business with no more than a single degree of separation from Epstein.  Epstein got attention from 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 6 of 69

the outset, and any functioning KYC onboarding process would make him a high-risk client 
garnering extra monitoring and attention from the outset.  
17. 
Whether or not he was so designated from the outset, it did not take long for JPM 
employees to begin openly questioning the Company’s ongoing relationship with Epstein.  A 
September 2006 New York Times article about Epstein’s arrest for soliciting a minor for 
prostitution triggered emails among JPM executives, including Erdoes, where she observed 
(sarcastically) that Epstein was “a lovely guy to work with.”   
18. 
By the time of Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea to the solicitation charge, JPM labeled 
Epstein a “high-risk” client, and many employees expressed the obvious need to terminate the 
relationship.  In fact, a mid-July 2008 internal risk function memorandum documented that 
“Catherine [Keating, the CEO of the Company’s Private Bank] will go back to Jes [Staley, then 
the CEO of JPM’s Asset Management Division] to tell him we are uncomfortable with Epstein…”  
19. 
Even more striking, in August 2008, a JPM employee wrote that she “would count 
Epstein’s assets as a probable outflow for ’08 ($120mm or so?) as I can’t imagine it will stay 
(pending [Jamie] Dimon review).”  Whether Staley blocked the expected “Dimon review” or 
someone with authority (such as Dimon or a Board member) provided informal and tacit support 
to Epstein and thus obviated the formal “Dimon review” process, Epstein remained with JPM. 
20. 
Despite Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea and ongoing sex crime allegations, neither JPM 
nor Staley ended their relationship with Epstein.  Between 2008 and 2013, Staley and Epstein 
exchanged 1,200 emails (including pictures of young girls in seductive poses).  Inexplicably, the 
bank’s risk reviews of Epstein’s accounts uncovered precisely zero of his grossly improper 
communications with Staley. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 7 of 69

21. 
By mid-2010, a risk management division employee referred to “new allegations 
of an investigation related to child trafficking,” and asked whether JPM was “still comfortable 
with this client who is now a registered sex offender.”  Other JPM compliance employees decided 
that Epstein “should go.”   
22. 
Far from breaking off relations with the man who served as power of attorney for 
Wexner (a known JPM billionaire client) and unknown other billionaires and who played a role in 
bringing the New Albany, Ohio business elite to the heights of Wall Street and global finance, in 
December 2010, JPM granted Epstein a new $50 million line of credit. 
23. 
As Epstein’s notoriety as an international criminal became more obvious, internal 
efforts to distance the Company from the criminal client only grew louder.  Yet no amount of risk 
management could overcome the failure (or refusal) of senior management and the Board to 
intervene to protect the Company.   
24. 
An internal March 2011 report explained that a company named “MC2 Model 
Management and Jeffrey Epstein engaged in racketeering that involved luring in minor children 
for sexual play for money,” and that MC2 Model Management’s owner was a “frequent passenger 
on Epstein’s private jet and often visited Epstein in jail.”   
25. 
On July 20, 2011, JPM’s General Counsel Cutler emailed Staley and Erdoes, among 
others, writing of Epstein:  “This is not an honorable person in any way.  He should not be a 
client.”  The next day, Cutler emailed Erdoes again, describing Epstein as:  “Not a person we 
should do business with, period.”  Nevertheless, Epstein’s accounts with the bank remained open 
and functional.  
26. 
JPM continued doing business with Epstein personally until 2013, and potentially 
continued to engage with Epstein related entities until his death in jail in 2019.  In fact, the 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 8 of 69

Company actively concealed Epstein’s crimes by failing to file any legally required Suspicious 
Activity Reports (“SARs”), which are mandated for large cash withdrawals and other suspicious 
transactions.   
27. 
The Company’s refusal to timely cut off its relationship with Epstein has harmed 
the Bank already and is continuing to do so.  JPM recently agreed to pay $290 million to settle a 
class action lawsuit brought by Epstein’s victims.  JPM faces an ongoing lawsuit by the 
government of the U.S. Virgin Islands in connection with harm it suffered due to the Company 
financing Epstein’s use of a home base in the U.S. Virgin Islands until his arrest in 2019. 
28. 
In sum, the story of Epstein using Company bank accounts and resources to support 
his child sex trafficking ring was not a single client slipping through the cracks in the system.  
Company fiduciaries knew about Epstein and his admitted and alleged crimes, but Epstein was not 
“just” a client.  He was a business partner and colleague to various members of JPM management 
and the Board.  The bank’s delay and refusal to address (and end) its unacceptable relationship 
with Epstein thus likely reflects a “head in the sand” attitude, with JPM officers and directors 
hoping the world would not discovery the Company’s facilitation of Epstein’s crimes.  
Unfortunately for them, the Company’s ties to Epstein have come to light and caused significant 
damage to JPM.  Demand is excused, and the defendant fiduciaries should be accountable.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
46. 
The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  The Court 
has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims asserted herein pursuant 28 U.S.C. § 
1367(a).  This action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on a court of the United States 
which it would not otherwise have. 
47. 
Venue is proper in this Court because JPM has its principal place of business in this 
District, Plaintiffs’ claims arose in this District, and JPM has suffered and will continue to suffer 
harm in this District.  
48. 
Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 1.6(a), the undersigned believe that this action is 
related to Jane Doe 1 Doe v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10019 (JSR) (the “Jane Doe 
Action”) and Government of the United States Virgin Islands v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-
cv-10904 (CSR) (the “USVI Action”), which are currently pending before this Court.  This Action 
and those actions arise from a common nucleus of operative fact involving JPM’s participation, 
directly or indirectly, in Epstein’s sex-trafficking venture by facilitating payments to women and 
girls, channeling funds to Epstein to fund the operation, and concealing Epstein’s criminal conduct 
by violating federal banking regulations. 
SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS 
I. 
COMPLIANCE WITH BANKING LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS MISSION-
CRITICAL TO JPM’S BUSINESS 
49. 
As a global financial institution, compliance with banking laws and regulations is 
mission-critical to JPM’s business.  The Company acknowledges that it “is subject to extensive 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 14 of 69

and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of 
the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.”1   
50. 
JPM’s national bank subsidiary, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., “is supervised and 
regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (‘OCC’) and, with respect to certain 
matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the ‘FDIC’).”2 
51. 
Failure to comply with this “extensive and comprehensive regulation” could have 
severe consequences on JPM’s business.  Indeed, the first “Risk Factor” that the Company 
identifies in its annual report is “Regulatory,”3 and JPM proceeds to warn that “[r]esolving 
regulatory investigations can subject JP Morgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral 
consequences,” including “greater exposure to litigation” and damage to JP Morgan Chase’s 
reputation.”4  Accordingly, JPM – and each of the Defendants – knew that regulatory compliance 
(including with the laws and rules discussed herein) was “mission-critical” to the Company.   
52. 
Because financial institutions like JPM are susceptible to serving as conduits for 
significant financial crimes, the federal government has established a series of anti-money 
laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations.  The primary federal laws governing banks with respect

adversely affect the Firm’s business, financial condition or results of operation, or cause it serious 
reputational harm.”). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 15 of 69

to AML are the Federal Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and certain provisions of the USA Patriot Act 
(the “Patriot Act”).5 
53. 
The BSA and Patriot Act require financial institutions to implement adequate risk-
based AML policies and systems to detect and prevent money laundering and other uses of a bank’s 
services and resources to facilitate criminal activities.  Such requirements include maintaining a 
due diligence program, filing SARs after detecting suspicious behavior, filing currency transaction 
reports (“CTRs”) for currency transactions or series of currency transactions that exceed $10,000 
in a 24-hour period, preventing structuring or assistance with structuring of transactions 
undertaken for the purpose of evading federal reporting requirements, and maintaining systems to 
prevent money laundering. 
54. 
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) – a formal U.S. 
government interagency body of banking regulators that is empowered to prescribe uniform 
principles, standards, and report forms to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial 
institutions – has published a Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual 
(the “FFEIC Manual”) to provide further guidance to financial institutions on BSA / AML 
compliance.6  FFIEC is comprised of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the 
FDIC, the National Credit Union Administration, the OCC, and the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau.     
55. 
The FFEIC Manual makes clear that ultimate responsibility for regulatory 
compliance lies with the financial institution’s board of directors:  “The board of directors, acting 
United Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and 
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272. 
FFIEC regularly updates the FFEIC Manual.  Given the relevant period for this Complaint, cites 
herein are to the 2006 edition of the FFEIC Manual.     
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 16 of 69

through senior management, is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the bank maintains an 
effective BSA/AML internal control structure, including suspicious activity monitoring and 
reporting.”7  Such controls should include:8 
 “Identify[ing] banking operations . . . more vulnerable to abuse by money 
launderers and criminals; provid[ing] for periodic updates to the bank’s risk profile; 
and provid[ing] for a BSA / AML compliance program to manage risks.” 
 “Inform[ing] the board of directors, or a committee thereof, and senior 
management, of compliance initiatives, identified compliance deficiencies, and 
corrective action taken, and notify directors and senior management of [SARs] 
filed.” 
 “Implement[ing] risk-based customer due diligence (CDD) policies, procedures, 
and processes.” 
 “Identify[ing] reportable transactions and accurately file all required reports 
including SARs, [CTRs], and CTR exceptions.” 
 “Provid[ing] sufficient controls and monitoring systems for timely detection and 
reporting of suspicious activity.” 
56. 
The FFEIC Manual explains that effective CDD policies are “critical” because they 
are needed for: (a) “[d]etecting and reporting unusual or suspicious transactions that potentially 
expose the bank to financial loss, increased expenses, or reputational risk”; (b) “[a]voiding 
criminal exposure from persons who use or attempt to use the bank’s products and services for 
illicit purposes”; and (c) “[a]dhering to safe and sound banking practices.”9   
57. 
With respect to “high-risk customers,” the FFEIC Manual instructs that 
“[e]nhanced due diligence . . . is especially critical in understanding their anticipated transactions

and implementing a suspicious activity monitoring system that reduces the bank’s reputation, 
complaint, and transaction risks.”10  Moreover, “due diligence is an ongoing process” and risk 
profiles should be adjusted as necessary.11 
58. 
Closely related to a bank’s CDD policies is its suspicious activity reporting, which 
the FFEIC Manual calls “the cornerstone of the BSA reporting system.”12  Banks are required to 
file a SAR with respect to, among other things:13 
 “Criminal violations aggregating $5,000 or more when a suspect can be identified.” 
 “Criminal violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of a potential 
suspect.” 
 “Transactions conducted or attempted by, at, or through the bank . . . aggregating 
$5,000 or more, if the bank . . . knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the 
transaction”: (a) “[m]ay involve potential money laundering or other illegal 
activity; (b) “[i]s designed to evade the BSA or its implementing regulations”; or 
(c) “[h]as no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the type of transaction 
that the particular customer would normally be expected to engage in, and the bank 
knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the 
available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction. 
59. 
The FFEIC Manual continues: “Appropriate policies, procedures, and processes 
should be in place to monitor and identify unusual activity.”14  When a bank detects suspicious 
activity, it must file a SAR within 30 days to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network.15  Moreover, where there is continuing suspicious activity, a bank 
should file a SAR at least every 90 days.16

Banks are required to notify their boards of directors when SARs have been filed,17 
and the FFEIC Manual advises that “management should provide sufficient information on its 
SAR filings to the board of directors or an appropriate committee in order to fulfill its fiduciary 
duties.”18  Under the laws of Delaware – JPM’s state of incorporation – the Board’s fiduciary 
duties require them to implement adequate oversight systems to ensure compliance with laws and 
regulations, including the BSA and the Patriot Act.             
II. 
EPSTEIN’S PRE-JPM PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND MADE HIM A “HIGH 
RISK-HIGH REWARD” CLIENT FROM THE OUTSET 
61. 
Historical context is necessary to appreciate why and how Epstein could thrive 
within JPM even though a person without links to the bank’s power centers would surely have 
been reported to authorities and terminated as a client when his status as a child sex trafficker 
became known within the Company.   
62. 
Epstein’s history and notoriety at the time of his earliest interactions with JPM 
supports the inference that, from the outset, he would have been recognized as a high-risk, but 
high-reward, client, and would likely have been reported to the highest levels within the Company.  
What already was known around the time Epstein was onboarded at JPM in 1998 – not to mention 
what came to light in 2002 to 2003 – begs the question of whether plentiful red flags were 
intentionally ignored by those in positions of power to retain Epstein as a client, overriding the 
many concerns that his history should have raised. 
63. 
Based solely on the sheer volume of money for an exceedingly high-profile 
clientele that Epstein purported to handle, it is probable that his seeking to open an account would 
have been brought to the attention of any bank CEO.  Even when the JPM onboarding process for

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 19 of 69

Epstein was taking place around 1998, there were already an array of reasons that his desire to 
bank with JPM would have garnered attention from the highest levels of the Company, and should 
have triggered KYC measures.   
64. 
Among these red flags were a trail of financial irregularities and crimes left in 
Epstein’s wake among those he was known to be close to, including an SEC investigation into 
insider trading during his time at Bear Stearns, his proximity to the Tower Financial Ponzi scheme, 
and his incredibly close ties to Robert Maxwell, whose theft of over $1.2 billion of his clients’ 
money had recently come to light.  Epstein’s history even at this time also included early red flags 
of his horrific sexual abuses, still being unearthed and litigated to this day. 
A. The Founding and Expansive Reach of J Epstein & Co 
65. 
In the summer of 1974, Epstein found himself within the halls of the prestigious 
Dalton School on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, teaching physics and calculus, despite the fact 
that he was 21 years old and had no college degree.  Epstein’s foray into education, however, 
proved short-lived.  In 1976, he traded his classroom for the financial sphere, securing a position 
at Bear Stearns – an institution that would later be subsumed by JPM. 
66. 
Working under the direct tutelage of Wall Street legends Alan “Ace” Greenberg 
and James “Jimmy” Cayne, Epstein rapidly ascended the Bear Sterns ranks, attaining the title of 
senior partner by 1980.  However, shortly thereafter, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(“SEC”) initiated a formal investigation into Bear Stearns about insider trading around a tender 
offer placed on March 11, 1981, by the Seagram Company Ltd. for St. Joe Minerals Corp.  Epstein 
left Bear Stearns the next day, March 12, 1982.  This investigation included at least one personal 
interview with Epstein by the SEC on April 1, 1981, regarding potential charges, and it has been 
reported that Epstein left behind a string of financial irregularities at Bearn Stearns, which perhaps 
explains his swift exit from the company.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 20 of 69

67. 
In fact, according to his SEC interview and a contemporaneous Bear Stearns 
memorandum from the Executive Committee, Epstein left the company because he had illicitly 
lent money to clients.  The transcript of this interview and its exhibits (including the memorandum 
from the Executive Committee) are publicly available.  After being fined and suspended by the 
Executive Committee, Epstein resigned. 
68. 
Epstein opened his own financial advisory firm, named J Epstein & Co., in 1982.  
The company did not employ any analysts or portfolio managers, operating instead with 
approximately twenty accountants.  Despite lacking any marketing efforts, grand opening 
announcements, or even simple promotional flyers, J Epstein & Co. mysteriously thrived a mere 
year after its establishment, boasting a client base consisting of a large number of ultra-high net 
worth individuals.  The firm purported to cater exclusively to clients with a net worth of $1 billion 
or more – a striking anomaly in the financial industry at the time when billionaires were 
considerably rarer.19  In fact, a 2002 article in New York Magazine reported that Epstein was known 
to scoff at offers to manage accounts of less than $1 billion, flatly – and often rudely – turning 
down requests to manage accounts of $500 million or $700 million as “too small.”20   
69. 
While some have questioned his veracity, Epstein consistently claimed that the 
world’s wealthiest and most influential people flocked to give Epstein control over their finances. 
70. 
Importantly, according to those acquainted with him or under his employment, 
Epstein’s business model hinged on maintaining absolute control over his clients’ assets.  He went 
so far as to assume power of attorney over his clients’ assets, providing him with total control over 
these immense pools of wealth, and unfettered authority over the finances of some of the world’s

wealthiest individuals. 21  At the time, Epstein’s most significant confirmed client was Wexner, the 
billionaire behind Limited Brands and Victoria’s Secret – and a director of Columbus-based Bank 
One.  As discussed below, Epstein’s close connection with Wexner paved the way for his 
entanglement with the Bank One and later JPM boards. 
B. Epstein’s Known Ties to the Maxwells Should Have Made Him a “High Risk” 
Client From the Time of His Onboarding at JPM  
71. 
In the early 1980s, Epstein spent his days traveling between England and the United 
States where he integrated into social circles comprised of socialites, arms-dealers, spies, 
billionaires, politicians, gangsters, and various other influential figures.  While in England, Epstein 
first encountered British media baron Robert Maxwell, the father of Ghislaine Maxwell (with 
whom Epstein would later partner in running his sex trafficking rings).   
72. 
Throughout his life, Robert Maxwell was renowned as a media proprietor, a 
member of the British Parliament, a suspected spy, and, later on, a notorious fraudster.  Most 
importantly, he was eye-poppingly rich and offered Epstein the connections and money that helped 
to turn J Epstein & Co into a massive financial advisory business.  As explained in more detail 
below, some of these connections included General Dynamics and the Crown family, a member 
of which sat on the Bank One board and currently sits on the JPM Board, i.e., Defendant Crown.   
73. 
Prior to his mysterious death on his yacht in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in 
1991, Robert Maxwell faced allegations of espionage for the Israeli Intelligence Directorate 
(“IID”).  Following his death, these accusations were corroborated by former IID employees and 
an unnamed U.S. intelligence official.22

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 22 of 69

74. 
Whether or not he had links to intelligence agencies, Robert Maxwell served as a 
mentor to Epstein, even hoping that Epstein would become his son-in-law.  As Ari Ben Menashe, 
the former IID employee who claimed to be Maxwell’s “handler,” put it, “Robert Maxwell saw in 
Jeffrey Epstein a potential husband for his daughter and a potential business partner for himself.”23  
It appears that Ghislaine Maxwell’s father introduced her to Epstein in the 1980s.24  
75. 
Epstein presented himself to Ghislaine Maxwell as a financial expert who could 
help her family finance its business.  During that time period, Robert Maxwell allegedly needed a 
$50 million bridge loan, which Epstein secured.25   
76. 
According to reporting by, among others, Seymour Hersh, under Robert Maxwell’s 
guidance, both Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein participated in a clandestine operation involving 
arms dealing, blackmail, and financial fraud, which ultimately played a role in the Iran-Contra 
scandal.  But that connection also provided the basis for a more strengthened Epstein-Ghislaine 
Maxwell link.  
77. 
Robert Maxwell’s involvement with Israeli intelligence became evident following 
his meeting with Epstein in London in the 1980s.  Maxwell was allegedly involved in the PROMIS 
scandal, also known as the “Inslaw Affair.”26  PROMIS, short for “Prosecutors Management 
Information System,” was a software developed by U.S.-based Inslaw Inc. and designed to help

federal and state prosecutors track and flag potential money laundering operations and suspicious 
wire transfers.27 
78. 
According to investigative journalist covering the Inslaw Affair, Earl Brian, an 
associate of President Ronald Reagan, and his Attorney General Edwin Meese (“Meese”), sought 
to acquire access to this software.  Meese and members of the Department of Justice covertly 
obtained the PROMIS software intending to use it to help U.S. intelligence organizations indirectly 
facilitate the very crimes that the program was supposed to prevent.   
79. 
The software also landed in the hands of Israeli agents, who installed a backdoor 
into the program and attempted to sell it to U.S. military-industrial companies, including General 
Dynamics (affiliated with the Crown family that later enjoyed seats on the Bank One and JPM 
boards of directors).  The alleged intermediary for this operation was Robert Maxwell.   
80. 
Given the high volume of publicity surrounding Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein’s 
relationship in the 1990s, Epstein’s ongoing dealings with the Maxwell family would inevitably 
have come up in any adequate bank onboarding or KYC due diligence process.     
C. Epstein’s Role in the Tower Financial Ponzi Scheme and Affiliation With 
Founder Steve Hoffenberg Should Have Raised Major Red Flags During his 
JPM Onboarding 
81. 
In 1993, Steven Hoffenberg (“Hoffenberg”), one of Epstein’s early mentors, was 
convicted for perpetrating one of the largest Ponzi schemes prior to Bernie Madoff.   
82. 
Tower Financial Corporation (“Towers”) came into existence in the early 1970s as 
a debt collection agency stationed in Manhattan, New York.  Hoffenberg was the driving force 
behind its creation, taking on the roles of Chairman, CEO, and President.  In 1987, shortly after

Epstein’s departure from Bear Stearns, Hoffenberg was introduced to Epstein by Sir Douglass 
Leese, who had ties to Robert Maxwell.   
83. 
Regarding Epstein, Leese told Hoffenberg: “He’s great at selling securities.  And 
he has no moral compass.”28  Hoffenberg thereafter welcomed Epstein into the fold as a consultant, 
providing him with a monthly salary of $25,000 (roughly $67,000 in today’s dollars).  When 
prompted about his association with Epstein years later, Hoffenberg stated, “He was my best friend 
for years.  My closest friend for years.”29 
84. 
In February 1993, the SEC lodged charges against Towers, Hoffenberg, and the 
remaining executive committee for perpetrating a $460 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded nearly 
200,000 Americans.  Hoffenberg pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice, and tax evasion in 
1995, and was sentenced to a 20-year prison term.  Hoffenberg’s co-conspirators received 
sentences ranging from seven to nine years. 
85. 
 While Epstein escaped charges, numerous press articles and court documents 
suggest Epstein was initially implicated in the scheme, with some witnesses even naming him as 
the true architect.  Yet, his name mysteriously disappeared from the court records.30  In any event,

Epstein’s role as a consultant to Towers should have been red flags to a bank with proper AML 
systems in place and conducting adequate KYC due diligence.   
86. 
Following Epstein’s arrest and subsequent incarceration in 2019, Hoffenberg, 
having served 18 years in prison, alleged that Epstein had in fact been the true mastermind behind 
the entire scheme.  When questioned about his silence on Epstein’s involvement, Hoffenberg 
claimed that Epstein had significant sway within the United States Department of Justice, further 
emphasizing, “You cannot grasp the magnitude of [Epstein’s] controlling effect."31  Given the 
sheer scale of the scheme and the extensive media coverage it attracted, it is hard to believe that 
major players in the financial world who worked with Epstein remained ignorant of Epstein’s 
identity by 1995.

A. Epstein Salvages and Successfully Turns Around the “New Albany” Project 
Created by Wexner and Kessler  
87. 
Sometime in the early 1980s, Epstein was introduced to Wexner, the billionaire 
behind Limited Brands and Victoria’s Secret.  Wexner was one of Epstein's earliest confidants and 
wealthiest clients, and close associates of Wexner found it perplexing that he would so quickly 
entrust his fortune to a relative newcomer like Epstein. However, Epstein soon demonstrated his 
worth, providing timely assistance to Wexner’s business venture in New Albany, Ohio. 
88. 
The New Albany project was the redevelopment of thousands of acres of farmland 
outside of Columbus, Ohio into a town modeled after an 18th-century Georgian village.  The

development includes multi-million dollar homes built around a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf 
course.  Wexner and his business partner Kessler invested significant capital into the project.   
89. 
By 1988, Wexner and Kessler’s ambitious real estate project had become a financial 
debacle.  To salvage the venture, Wexner enlisted Epstein’s help.  A Columbus-based investigative 
journalist has stated that “Before Epstein came along in 1988, the financial preparations and 
groundwork for the New Albany development were a total mess” and that “Epstein cleaned 
everything up.”32    
90. 
The New Albany venture marked the first interaction between Kessler and Epstein, 
establishing a link to Epstein’s future relationship with JPM.  Kessler was a future supporter of 
Dimon who helped him reach the highest echelons of Bank One and JPM, placing Epstein at just 
one degree of separation from Dimon (at most).   
91. 
Kessler was a co-founder of New Albany and was a director on the Bank One board 
during its merger with JPM and stayed on as a director of JPM.  He was also on the search 
committee that appointed Dimon as CEO of Bank One in 2000.  He has described Dimon as the 
“best banker in the country” and stated that Dimon loves Columbus and that “he’d move 
everybody” at JPM to Columbus if he could.33  Kessler, of course, knew Epstein and owed the 
success of the New Albany project to Epstein. 
92. 
Additionally, John G. McCoy, the father of John B. McCoy, was an early buyer of 
real estate in the New Albany development.  John G. McCoy had appointed Kessler to the Bank 
One board and they had a close relationship, with Kessler calling the senior John G. McCoy his

investor in New Albany, on information and belief interacted with Epstein. 
B. Epstein’s Success Ingratiated Him to Bank One, the Columbus Elite, and Future 
Decision Makers at JPM 
93. 
Epstein’s connections to Bank One, the Columbus elite, and JPM goes even further.  
As a gesture of gratitude for saving the New Albany project, Wexner and Kessler welcomed 
Epstein as a general partner in New Albany Co.’s holding company.  This move came at a nominal 
cost to Epstein, despite both Wexner and Kessler having already invested billions into the project. 
94. 
Wexner even let Epstein build a 10,000 square foot home on Wexner’s personal 
estate within the New Albany development.  Epstein, Kessler, Wexner, and John G. McCoy were 
all property owners (and neighbors) in this new and exclusive community.    
95. 
Epstein’s connections to Columbus continued to develop – in fact, one article notes: 
Mr. Epstein became ubiquitous in Ohio.  His black book of 
contacts filled up with phone numbers with Columbus’s 614 area 
code.  That included dozens of numbers for Mr. Wexner, his 
personal staff and L Brands executives — even a couple of local 
doctors.  Mr. Epstein, who would fly in and out of Columbus on his 
private plane, became a fixture at Mr. Wexner’s parties and an 
annual fund-raiser for the Wexner Center for the Arts, which 
included a luncheon at the billionaire’s home. 
Mr. Epstein became deeply involved in Mr. Wexner’s upscale real-
estate development in New Albany, about 15 miles outside 
Columbus.  He set up shop in the same downtown Columbus 
skyscraper as Jack Kessler. 
96. 
This same group of the Columbus elite helped Dimon become CEO of Bank One 
in 2000.  The Bank One board of directors that appointed Dimon included Kessler, who knew 
Epstein from the New Albany project.  Former Bank One board members and executives including 
Id.

Wexner and John G. McCoy had New Albany property neighboring Epstein.  And the Columbus 
elite that did business with Bank One ran in the same social circles as Epstein. 
C. Bank One Merges with First USA and First Chicago 
97. 
In 1997, John B. McCoy, a native of Columbus, Ohio and the son of John G. 
McCoy, the founder of Banc One Corporation (which later became Bank One), served as Bank 
One’s Chairman and CEO.  As the 1990s drew to a close, Bank One undertook a sequence of 
significant, high-profile mergers that redefined its corporate identity.  
98. 
In January 1997, Bank One agreed to merge with Texas-based First USA Bank.  
Following the closing of this transaction, in 1998, Bank One embarked on another significant 
merger, this time with First Chicago Bank.  While completing the First Chicago deal, John B. 
McCoy was secretly meeting with Dimon in an attempt to bring him to Bank One as his number 
two.   
99. 
At the time, John B. McCoy was fully aware of Epstein’s dealings in Ohio and with 
Wexner and Kessler, his Bank One colleagues who had worked with Epstein on creating the New 
Albany development.35  Additionally, his father owned property in the New Albany development 
along with Wexner, Kessler, and Epstein.    
100. 
Unfortunately for John B. McCoy, Bank One suffered a series of adverse financial 
results, leading to his resignation as CEO and Chairman in December 1999.  This void in leadership 
lead to speculation that Dimon would step in to lead Bank One, having recently been fired from 
Citigroup.

101. 
Indeed, the New York Post wrote: “John McCoy stepped down as CEO of Banc 
One, the Ohio based superregional bank.  Dimon’s name leapt to the top of the list of possible 
successors.  But as one bank analyst pointed out to Bull’s Eye, ‘Why would Jamie want to move 
to Ohio? He’s a New York boy.’” 
D. Dimon’s Move to New York and Into the Midwest Power Circle  
102. 
The New York Post’s skepticism proved misguided.  In early 2000, Dimon was 
vying for the CEO position at Bank One.  Dimon’s fate rested in the hands of a group of individuals 
like Kessler, who would not only shape his forthcoming leadership trajectory but also, as discussed 
above, were already quite familiar with the comings and goings of Epstein, who had become 
“ubiquitous in Ohio.”   
103. 
Following Dimon’s interview for the role of CEO at Bank One, Kessler was in 
favor of hiring Dimon, stating, “He’s just a fabulous leader.  He’s the best banker in the country, 
there’s no question.”36  Crown, one of the new Bank One directors with ties back to Robert 
Maxwell through his family link to General Dynamics, stated that the CEO Search Committee 
narrowed the search to two candidates, and that:  “Jamie met with the board and made a very 
convincing presentation about where he would focus his energy in the beginning.  It was clear he 
had seen this movie before.  He had the experience of cutting costs and bringing organizations 
together, something we clearly needed.”37

104. 
Crown would go on to serve as head of JPM’s risk committee during the Epstein 
saga.  Despite a massive failure in his role, Crown continued to serve on the Board, with his 
directorship spanning nearly two decades.  
105. 
Wexner was no longer on the board of Bank One when Dimon arrived, and it is 
unclear if Dimon ever personally knew of or interacted with Epstein during that time.  However, 
it is clear that Wexner, Kessler, Crown, and the McCoys were very much connected to Epstein’s 
dealings in Ohio (including, of course, the New Albany project).  Considering Epstein’s consistent 
involvement with the Columbus business elite, it is fair to infer that Dimon, as the CEO of Bank 
One, with a board populated with Columbus’s business elite, was aware of Epstein and likely 
crossed paths with him, at the least.  Indeed, in a 2014 interview, Kessler referred to Dimon’s 
affinity for Columbus, Ohio, stating, “Jamie loves it here because he said the work ethic is so good.  
He said he'd move everybody here if he could.”38   
106. 
In January 2004, Bank One announced its acquisition by JPM for $58 billion.  The 
initial announcement did not envisage Dimon assuming the top position.  According to the initial 
deal press release:  [T]he newly merged entity was to be led by William B. Harrison, 60, the 
existing chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase.  James Dimon, 47, then the chairman 
and chief executive of Bank One, was slated to become president and chief operating officer of the 
combined company.39 Fortunately for Dimon, his colleagues from Bank One had no plans to 
operate under Harrison's leadership for long.

107. 
Only six months after closing the merger, Dimon was invited by the Board to take 
over as CEO of the combined company, and a short time thereafter he took on the role of Chairman. 
The directors who moved from the Bank One board to the JPM Board – Kessler, Crown, Stephen 
Burke, Robert Lipp, Richard Manoogian, and David Novak – helped Dimon rise to the Company’s 
CEO role.  
108. 
Dimon’s tenure as CEO of JPM has been rife with management failures.  A 2020 
article raised a troubling question: “Why hasn’t JPMorgan Chase’s Board sacked Jamie Dimon as 
the bank accumulated five felony counts?”  The piece recognizes that Dimon has not forgotten 
who afforded him the opportunity to become CEO, and the connection with Bank One continues 
to exert a significant influence on JPM's current board.  The author responds to this question with:  
“Turns out Jamie Dimon has been taking very good care of the Directors on his Board and they 
have been taking very good care of Dimon – turning him into a billionaire, notwithstanding the 
worst criminal record of any major bank in the history of the United States.”40

JPM PURSUES EPSTEIN 
A. Onboarding Epstein As A Client  
109. 
Epstein’s association with JPM began in 1998.  In 2000, the Company entrusted 
the task of managing Epstein as a client to Staley, the then-new head of JPM's private banking 
division.  Staley has explained that, when he was told to work with Epstein, he was specifically 
advised to “get to know him.”  The head of a global bank’s private banking division presumably 
is not tasked with “getting to know” all of the bank’s private bank clients.

110. 
What began as Staley’s professional endeavor to build a relationship with Epstein 
transitioned into a personal one, as discussed below in more detail.  By 2003, it would become 
very quickly apparent to Staley that doing business with Epstein would include a level of 
reputational and legal risk unlike anything JPM had ever or should ever accept.  
111. 
As previously noted, JPM, like any major financial institution, has a duty to perform 
a high degree of due diligence on the individuals it does business with.  Indeed, that duty should 
hold even greater importance when a new client like Epstein, who claims to managing billions of 
dollars for world elite, has little to no digital or public footprint.  Moreover, Epstein’s onboarding 
should have revealed his involvement with a slew of shady characters and financial dealings.   
112. 
For instance, if JPM even conducted this most rudimentary due diligence prior to 
onboarding Epstein as a client they would have learned that he departed Bearns Sterns under a 
shadow of financial inpropriety and was connected to Hoffenberg and the Towers Ponzi scheme.  
Those two connections alone should have warranted escalating Epstein to senior management or 
the JPM risk committee.   
B. 2003 Vanity Fair Article Raises Major Concerns About Epstein 
113. 
In March 2003, Vicky Ward of Vanity Fair published an article entitled “The 
Talented Mr. Epstein.”41  The piece initially spotlights Epstein’s roster of high-profile admirers 
and clients, including Wexner, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and Alan Dershowitz.  However, the 
article simultaneously carries a more sinister undertone, which should have raised alarm bells for 
anyone conducting business with Epstein.  The following are several points from the article that 
should have set off significant concerns across JPM about its client:

 “He’s reckless,” says a former business associate, “and he’s gotten more so.  Money 
does that to you.  He’s breaking the oath he made to himself – that he would never 
do anything that would expose him in the media.” 
 According to S.E.C. and other legal documents unearthed by VANITY FAIR, 
Epstein may have good reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy: his real mentor, 
it might seem, was not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, 57, who, for a 
few months before the S.E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1993, was trying to buy 
the New York Post.  He is currently incarcerated in the Federal Medical Center in 
Devens, Massachusetts, serving a 20-year sentence for bilking investors out of more 
than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history. 
 In 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources, set Epstein up in the offices he still 
occupies in the Villard House, on Madison Avenue, across a courtyard from the 
restaurant Le Cirque.  Hoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at $25,000 
a month, and the relationship flourished.  “They traveled everywhere together – on 
Hoffenberg’s plane, all around the world, they were always together,” says a 
source.  Hoffenberg has claimed that Epstein confided in him, saying, for example, 
that he had left Bear Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered executing “illegal 
operations.” 
 Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein 
was the “technician” at Towers, executing illicit schemes, although, having no 
broker’s license, he had to rely on others to make the trades. 
 Epstein, according to Hoffenberg, also came up with a scheme to manipulate the 
price of Emery Freight stock in an attempt to minimize the losses that occurred 
when Hoffenberg’s bid went wrong, and the share price began to fall.  This was 
alleged to have involved multiple clients’ accounts controlled by Epstein. 
 Several of Epstein’s Bear Stearns contemporaries recall that Epstein left the 
company very suddenly.  Within the company, there were rumors that the executive 
committee asked that Epstein resign after his two supporters, Ace Greenberg and 
Jimmy Cayne, were outnumbered. 
 In 1998, the U.S. Attorney sued Epstein for illegally subletting the former home of 
the deputy consul general of Iran to attorney Ivan Fisher and others.  Epstein paid 
$15,000 a month in rent to the State Department, but he charged Fisher and his 
colleagues $20,000.  Though the exact terms of the agreement are sealed, the court 
ruled against Epstein. 
 Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from its private-banking 
arm for $20 million.  Epstein claims that Citibank “fraudulently induced” him into 
borrowing the money for investments.  Citibank disputes this charge.

C. Epstein Brokers JPM’s Purchase of Highbridge Capital And Helps Put JPM 
Executives on the Board of the Robin Hood Foundation 
114. 
Even if the 2003 Vanity Fair article never came to Defendants’ attention and, as a 
result, they were unaware of Epstein’s true character at the time, there is a deal from the early 
2000s leaving any such claim of unfamiliarity with Epstein implausible.   
115. 
The Epstein private jet flight logs, spanning from 1990 to 2005, have received 
considerable media coverage due to the inclusion of names of former presidents and other 
prominent figures.  However, less publicly recognized names, such as that of Eva Anderson 
(“Anderson”), have managed to elude intensive scrutiny.  Currently a practicing physician, 
Anderson is the former Miss Sweden, a Miss Universe Contestant, and, from at least the 1980s to 
the early 1990s, was Epstein’s girlfriend.   
116. 
In 1994, Anderson married Glenn Dubin (“Dubin”), the co-founder of both 
Highbridge Capital (“Highbridge”), an alternative asset management firm, and the non-profit The 
Robinhood Foundation.  Epstein reportedly invested millions of dollars into Highbridge in 1998, 
and it is possible that Epstein himself introduced Dubin and Anderson.   
117. 
One of Epstein’s most prominent accusers, Virginia Giuffre, alleged in her lawsuit 
against Ghislaine Maxwell that in 2001, Ghislaine Maxwell had directed her to have sex with 
Dubin, even though he had been married since 1994 and Giuffre was only 16.   
118. 
Just a few years following this incident, in 2004, Epstein allegedly facilitated a 
meeting between Staley and Dubin to broker the sale of Highbridge to JPM for a majority interest 
valued at over $1 billion.42  As reported by The Telegraph, “Epstein personally introduced the two 
men while Staley was head of the private bank at JP Morgan.  JP Morgan later purchased

Highbridge Capital in a $1bn deal that enhanced Staley’s status at the bank – and netted Epstein a 
fee of $10m.”43  
119. 
JPM now suggests that Staley somehow concealed Epstein’s name and relationship 
with the bank from his superiors, Dimon and the Board itself.  However, it is unlikely that a 
financial institution like JPM would approve a transaction exceeding a billion dollars without 
instituting some sort of top-level due diligence review.   
120. 
Highbridge was not the only conduit through which Epstein leveraged Dubin to 
extend his influence over key members at JPM.  Two prominent figures in the Epstein saga, Staley 
and Erdoes, both served on the board of Dubin’s New York City children’s charity, The Robinhood 
Foundation.  Founded by Dubin in the early 1980s, the charity also currently has Kristen Lemkau, 
the CEO of U.S. Wealth Management for JPM, serving as the co-chair of the organization’s 
leadership council.  Following Epstein’s arrest in 2019, The Robinhood Foundation faced intense 
public scrutiny for its connections to Epstein, and for allowing Staley to remain on its board.  
121. 
To truly comprehend the extent of involvement by Anderson and Dubin within 
Epstein’s network of enablers, it is instructive to examine their actions following Epstein’s 2008 
conviction as a pedophile.  As Business Insider revealed: 
The Dubins invited Epstein to their Palm Beach home for 
Thanksgiving dinner in 2009.  In an email to Epstein’s probation 
officer, Eva [Anderson] wrote, “I am 100% comfortable with Jeffrey 
Epstein around my children,” while acknowledging Epstein was 
convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution.  At the time, the 
couple’s three kids were underage.44

122. 
Merely months prior to the Thanksgiving dinner at the Dubin residence, Epstein 
had assisted Staley and JPM in finalizing the purchase of the remaining stake in Highbridge, which 
at the time had assets under management of approximately $21 billion.45   Considering the size of 
the initial investment and eventual purchase, the Highbridge deal would have a certainly been a 
material transaction that warranted due diligence from the highest levels of JPM.     
D. Epstein Brokered a Meeting Between JPM and the Prime Minister of Israel 
123. 
Between 2009 and 2011, Epstein helped Staley schedule meetings for Dimon to 
meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and Britain’s 
Prince Andrew.  Despite Epstein and Staley’s collaboration in setting up these meetings with such 
high-profile individuals, Dimon purportedly testified that he never heard of Epstein until 2018 or 
2019.46  Dimon’s unequivocal assertion rings untrue.   
124. 
It is almost unfathomable that the CEO and Chairman of JPM would not be aware 
of how an in-person meetings with some of the world’s most prominent leaders was arranged,

EPSTEIN REMAINS A JPM CLIENT WHILE THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM COMES 
INTO THE PUBLIC EYE  
A. The Highest Reaches of JPM Unambiguously Knew that Epstein Was a 
Convicted Sex Offender Accused of Continuing Sexual Abuse 
125. 
In March 2005, press reports emerged reporting that Epstein paid a 14-year-old girl 
in Palm Beach, Florida for a “massage” and then molested her.  Following the release of these 
allegations, a number of underage girls – many of them high school students – told police that 
Epstein also hired them to give sexual massages. 
126. 
In July 2006, Epstein was arrested in Palm Beach, Florida, after a grand jury 
indicted him for soliciting a minor for prostitution.  JPM – including Staley and Erdoes – were 
immediately aware of Epstein’s arrest and his pedophilia.  For instance, on August 27, 2006, Staley 
emailed Erdoes:  “Last night went to the Huggy Bear concert.  The age difference between 
husbands and wives would have fit in well with Jeffrey.  What a joke.”47   
127. 
Epstein’s arrest received national news coverage, leaving no doubt about the 
heinous nature of his crimes.  For instance, on September 3, 2006, The New York Times reported: 
In the summer and autumn of last year, when most of the mansions 
here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily 
watched one at the end of a waterside lane.  They monitored the 
comings and goings of its owner’s private jet, subpoenaed his phone 
records and riffled through his trash. 
The owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York 
money manager with several billionaire clients.  Months earlier, the 
stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the Palm Beach police that a 
wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr. Epstein, 
might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her. 
In sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage 
girls said a friend had arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home

Chase Bank, N.A., 1:22-cv-10904-JSR (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2023) (“Dimon Tr.”) at 133-34.

and give him massages, usually in their underwear, in exchange for 
cash. 
Most of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had 
masturbated during the massages, and a few said he had penetrated 
them with his fingers or penis.  They identified him in photos and 
accurately described the inside of his home.  Some recalled that his 
employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars. 
Mr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was 
ultimately charged with, soliciting prostitution.  But at a time when 
prosecutors around the nation have become increasingly severe in 
dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised 
questions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him 
preferential treatment. 
By the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge 
Mr. Epstein with much more serious offenses: one count of lewd 
and lascivious molestation and four counts of unlawful sexual 
activity with a minor. 48   
128. 
The fact of Epstein’s ongoing relationship with JPM was hardly a secret within the 
bank.  Indeed, JPM employees – including Erdoes – circulated this New York Times article 
internally.  The first line in the email read:  “Did you see this article in the NYT this weekend?  
Lovely guy to work with.”49   
129. 
On October 17, 2006, the Company’s Global Corporate Security Division 
designated Epstein a “high-risk client” because “[s]everal newspaper articles were found that detail 
the indictment of Jeffrey Epstein in Florida on felony charges of soliciting underage prostitutes.”50  
As a result, JPM determined not to “proactively solicit new investment business from Mr. 
Epstein.”51

130. 
Having so designated Epstein, internal review and approval processes were 
necessarily triggered.  Nevertheless, the Company continued to retain Epstein as a client.   
131. 
Knowledge of Epstein’s crimes (and his associated massive cash withdrawals to 
fund his sexual abuse) extended to the top of JPM’s organization.  At her recent deposition, Erdoes 
admitted that the Company was aware by 2006 not only that Epstein was abusing women and 
underage girls, but that Epstein paid these victims in cash. 52  This was the same year that a JPM 
Rapid Response Team noted that Epstein routinely withdrew $40,000 to $80,000 in cash from his 
accounts several times each month, and more than $750,000 per year.53   
132. 
Erdoes knew Epstein personally.  Indeed, Erdoes visited Epstein at his New York 
home in both 2011 and 2013.54  Erdoes is also reported to have exchanged “dozens of emails” with 
Epstein, including with regard to a charitable fund that JPM considered launching together with 
Epstein.55   
133. 
In June 2008, Epstein pled guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution.  As part of 
the plea agreement, Epstein was sentenced to an 18-month jail term, followed by one year of 
community confinement, and was required to register as a sex offender.  As with his 2006 arrest, 
Epstein’s plea deal received national media attention (and concomitant attention within JPM).56

See, e.g., Samuel Goldsmith, Jeffrey Epstein Pleads Guilty to Prostitution Charges, N.Y. POST

prostitution-charges/. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 40 of 69

134. 
According to JPM, “[p]er bank policy, felons are considered high risk and require 
additional approval.”57 
135. 
Epstein’s guilty plea led some JPM employees to assume that the Company would 
immediately terminate its relationship with the now-convicted sex offender.  As of July 15, 2008, 
a JPM Rapid Response Team document indicated that “Catherine [Keating, the CEO of the 
Company’s Private Bank] will go back to Jes [Staley, then the CEO of JPM’s Asset Management 
Division] to tell him we are uncomfortable with Epstein and do not want to go to [Stephen] Cutler 
[JPM’s General Counsel] for approval.”58  In other words, the most senior members of the Private 
Bank knew that trying to retain Epstein as a client was an absurd ask to the General Counsel, given 
all of the red flags surrounding Epstein.    
136. 
The next month, in August 2008, a JPM employee wrote that she “would count 
Epstein’s assets as a probable outflow for ’08 ($120mm or so?) as I can’t imagine it will stay 
(pending [Jamie] Dimon review).”59  The fact that Epstein’s account status was expected to be 
presented to Dimon suggests either that it was (as per known internal protocols) or that the matter 
was resolved in favor of keeping Epstein without forcing Dimon to leave a paper trail of his 
involvement in the matter.  
137. 
Thus, a plausible conclusion arising from that August 2008 email is that Dimon – 
the Company’s CEO and Chairman – was aware of Epstein’s crimes by that time and would decide 
whether the Company would retain Epstein as a client.  Yet, the bank chose to keep doing business 
with Epstein.

138. 
In 2009, a once-secret 2008 non-prosecution agreement between Epstein and the 
United States became public.  It revealed allegations that Epstein may have used interstate 
commerce to induce minors to engage in prostitution, engaged in illicit sexual conduct with 
minors, and trafficked minors.  
139. 
Epstein’s guilty plea in 2008, jail sentence, and additional allegations of sex crimes 
did not put an end to his relationship with Staley, who allegedly participated in Epstein’s crimes.60  
Between 2008 and 2013, Staley used his Company email account to exchange 1,200 emails with 
Epstein.61  And, both before and after Epstein’s arrest and prison sentence, Staley frequently called 
Epstein’s Palm Beach, Florida home, according to the below messages included in the complaint 
in the Jane Doe Action (including at least one call when Staley called with Wexner):62

140. 
In December 2008, Epstein and Staley discussed Staley visiting Epstein at his 
Florida home.  Although Epstein was not going to be in Palm Beach at the time, Epstein invited 
Staley to use his house.63  In early January 2009, around the time that Staley was staying at 
Epstein’s Palm Beach house, Epstein wired $2,000 from his JPM account to a woman with an 
Eastern European surname (many of the women that Epstein trafficked were from Eastern 
Europe).64   
141. 
Later in 2009, Epstein and Staley again discussed getting together, this time in 
London.  In late August 2009, Epstein asked Staley whether he would need anything while he was 
in London.  Staley said yes.65  Just two days later, Epstein again used his JPM account to wire 
$3,000 to the same woman with an Eastern European surname he had paid while Staley was in 
Palm Beach.66   
142. 
Just months later, in November 2009, while Epstein was already in jail, Staley again 
took advantage of Epstein’s hospitality – this time at Epstein’s now-infamous private island, Little

St. James, Virgin Islands.  While there, Staley emailed Epstein:  “So when all hell breaks lo[o]se, 
and the world is crumbling, I will come here, and be at peace.  Presently, I’m in the hot tub with a 
glass of white wine.  This is an amazing place.  Truly amazing.  Next time, we’re here together.  I 
owe you much.  And I deeply appreciate our friendship.  I have few so profound.”67 
143. 
The following month, Staley made clear that he was fully aware of the risk that his 
ongoing relationship with Epstein posed to him.  On December 4, 2009, Staley met with Epstein 
in New York, and then emailed him: “I realize the danger in sending this email.  But it was great 
to be able, today, to give you, in New York City, a long heartfelt, hug.”68   
144. 
Despite recognizing it, Staley continued to disregard the “danger” of Epstein.  The 
next day and later in December 2009, Epstein sent pictures of young women to Staley, to which 
Staley responded with cryptic commentary.69  Staley again visited Little St. James the following 
month, in January 2010.70  Later that year, in July 2010, Staley had the following exchange with 
Epstein via email, strongly suggesting that Epstein was procuring victims for Staley:71 
Staley:  Maybe they’re tracking u?  That was fun.  Say hi to Snow 
White. 
Epstein:  [W]hat character would you like next? 
Staley:  Beauty and the Beast. 
Epstein:  [W]ell one side is available. 
145. 
Also in July 2010, a news article from The Daily Beast reported that, since his 
release from jail, Epstein had settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls, and at

least seven victims received well over $1 million. 72  That same article noted allegations that 
Epstein was involved with Eastern European women in particular and that a modeling agency he 
helped fund brought “young girls . . . often from Eastern Europe” to the United States on Epstein’s 
private jets.73 
146. 
JPM was aware of these allegations.  Memos from JPM compliance meetings 
specifically referenced articles regarding a federal investigation into “whether a modeling agency 
run by a friend . . . fed his appetite for underage foreign girls” and noted that “Epstein was known 
to fly young women from Eastern Europe to Palm Beach where they’d massage him, among other 
services.”74 
147. 
In an internal email, an employee in the Company’s risk management division 
referred to “new allegations of an investigation related to child trafficking,” and asked whether 
JPM was “still comfortable with this client who is now a registered sex offender.”75  Other JPM 
compliance employees decided that Epstein “should go.”76  But reflecting the Company’s 
fundamental attitude towards Epstein’s crimes, a different JPM risk management employee 
dismissed these disturbing reports as routine:  “In my short tenure working on the account these 
stories pop up including these from the summer.”77

148. 
In December 2010, JPM granted Epstein a new $50 million line of credit.78 
149. 
The next year, in January 2011, JPM once again was made keenly aware of yet 
more allegations of human trafficking against Epstein.  And yet again, JPM brushed off the 
allegations.  That month, the Company conducted a review of Epstein’s accounts because a “few 
news stories during 2010 connect[ed] Jeffrey Epstein to human trafficking.”79  According to the 
complaint in the USVI Action, JPM’s coverage team “met to discuss the situation and agreed to 
enhance monitoring and document a discussion with the client.”80   
150. 
Staley – Epstein’s apparent co-conspirator and accomplice – was the JPM executive 
that the Company entrusted to hold this “discussion” with Epstein.81  According to the 
documentation of the discussion, Epstein claimed “there was no truth to the allegations” against 
him and “no evidence.”82  JPM internally concluded that it would “continue to monitor the 
accounts and cash usage closely going forward.”83  The Company did not file a SAR. 
151. 
In March 2011, JPM’s Global Corporate Security Division again internally reported 
that “[n]umerous articles detail various law enforcement agencies investigating Jeffrey Epstein for 
allegedly participating, directly or indirectly, in child trafficking and molesting underage girls.”84  
This report also noted that Epstein had “settled a dozen civil lawsuits out of court from his victims 
regarding solicitation.”85

152. 
This same March 2011 report also noted that the owner of a company named “MC2 
Model Management and Jeffrey Epstein engaged in racketeering that involved luring in minor 
children for sexual play for money[,]” and that MC2 Model Management’s owner was a “frequent 
passenger on Epstein’s private jet and often visited Epstein in jail.”86  The March 2011 report also 
noted that Epstein paid MC2 Model Management $1 million in 2005, and that it was “unknown if 
the money was given as a secret investment or payment for services as a procurer.”87   
153. 
MC2 Model Management’s owner was Jean-Luc Brunel (“Brunel”), a French 
model scout who faced allegations of sexual assault spanning three decades.  Brunel allegedly 
groomed young females and partook in Epstein’s sex trafficking ring.  On December 16, 2020, 
French prosecutors charged Brunel with rape of minors, but he died from an apparent suicide 
before his trial could proceed.88         
154. 
Also in 2011, a senior JPM compliance official who reviewed the Company’s 
relationship with Epstein warned that there was “[l]ots of smoke” and “[l]ots of questions” 
surrounding Epstein’s criminal behavior.89  According to the complaint filed in the USVI Action, 
these issues included that:90 
 Epstein “is alleged to be involved in the human trafficking of young girls and law 
enforcement is also allegedly investigating his involvement in this activity.” 
 “He is also an alleged personal associate of the CEO of the Investment Bank (Jes 
Staley).”

 “AML Operations went to a [Private Bank] risk meeting late last week requesting 
that we exit this relationship.” 
 “[W]hether Epstein is further exposed could have a potential serious impact.” 
 “The one new concerning thing is the one article about the DOJ investigation is 
saying they brought under age girls to the US via a modeling agency M2 that is 
owned by a guy named Brunel.  Turns out the banker said today we extended 
Epstein a loan in relation to this modeling agency.”  The writer claims that the 
agency is “legit” and that “it would be hard for us to tell” if “girls were exploited 
via their contract or arrangement.”  The loan was a letter of credit provided by JPM 
to MC2 Model Management. 
 In 2004, Epstein sponsored private bank accounts and credit cards for two 18 
year olds “that appear to be part of his inner entourage.  One is mentioned in many 
of the recaps of the escapades as a willing participant and assistant when hosting 
visitors.  She has received about 450,000 since opening from Epstein . . . .  Both 
can be put in Palm Beach during 2004, by way of debit charges, which was when 
most allegations were from . . . .  He did pay other girls, many models no huge 
amounts.  Sugar Daddy!” 
 “His foundation account did pay donations to the Palm Beach Police Dept as 
reported just before the case started.  The same foundation account did pay monies 
direct to models and payments direct to specialty schools (massage, culinary) and 
university’s [sic] on behalf of models/aspiring actresses.  Nothing was 
astronomical.” 
 “His business accounts Fiduciary we saw no client activity.  I know his biggest 
client, Wexner parted ways when he was convicted.  His [Due Diligence Reports] 
say he manages a few private clients [sic] money but never says who.  I would like 
to know if in fact he is managing anyone’s money at this point or is it all his 
money. We saw no evidence of disbursements even in the rocky years 08-09.  
When the well to do were running to their mattresses, he did not have any 
distributions from his accounts at Bear or JP.  He does have money at other 
institutions so maybe it happened there.”  
155. 
On July 20, 2011, Cutler emailed Staley and Erdoes, among others, concerning 
Epstein, and wrote:  “This is not an honorable person in any way.  He should not be a client.”91

The next day, July 21, 2011, Cutler emailed Erdoes again, writing about Epstein:  “I would like to 
put it and him behind us.  Not a person we should do business with, period.”92  
156. 
Yet, JPM continued doing business with Epstein, as well as his partners in crime.  
In August 2011, Ghislaine Maxwell applied to open a new account with JPM for a “personal 
recruitment consulting business.”93  Internally, the Company’s AML director asked:  “What does 
she mean by personal recruitment??  Are you sure this will have nothing to do with Jeffrey?  If 
you want to proceed, I suggest that we flag this as a High Risk Client.”94   
157. 
In fact, the Company retained Epstein as a client well into 2013.  John Duffy – who 
served as Vice Chairman of JPM and as the CEO of the Company’s private bank for ultrawealthy 
clients – visited Epstein at his New York home in April 2013.95  Just one month later, the private 
bank that Duffy ran re-authorized Epstein to borrow up to $50 million against his accounts.96 
158. 
At bottom, despite unequivocally knowing that Epstein was a serial sex offender, 
and despite the obviously suspicious nature of Epstein’s activity with the Company, JPM took no 
corrective action against Epstein for years.  Finally, later in 2013, the Company purportedly

terminated its relationship with Epstein.  That same year, Staley left the Company.97  The U.S. 
Virgin Islands has alleged that JPM continued business with Epstein affiliated entities. 
B. Adequate Compliance Systems Plainly Should Have At Least Resulted in the 
Filings of SARs and Reporting to the Board 
159. 
As alleged above, JPM employees – including those at the highest reaches of the 
Company, such as Staley and Erdoes – knew Epstein was a felon convicted for sexual abuse, a 
pedophile who allegedly trafficked young girls from all over the world (including on his private 
plane), and regularly wired and withdrew large sums of cash from his JPM accounts.  Those facts 
alone should have triggered the filing of SARs and reporting to the Board.  Again, federal banking 
laws require a SAR filing in connection with: 
Transactions conducted or attempted by, at, or through the bank . . . 
aggregating $5,000 or more, if the bank . . . knows, suspects, or has 
reason to suspect that the transaction”: (a) “[m]ay involve potential 
money laundering or other illegal activity”; (b) “[i]s designed to 
evade the BSA or its implementing regulations”; or (c) “[h]as no 
business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the type of transaction 
that the particular customer would normally be expected to engage 
in, and the bank knows of no reasonable explanation for the 
transaction after examining the available facts, including the 
background and possible purpose of the transaction.98 
160. 
Nevertheless, upon information and belief, JPM never filed a SAR related to 
Epstein.  And, according to the complaint filed in the USVI Action, it does not appear that JPM 
engaged in any investigation of the source of Epstein’s funds.99

161. 
Moreover, according to Dimon’s deposition testimony, between 2006 – when 
Epstein was arrested for soliciting a minor for prostitution – and 2013, the Board never discussed 
Epstein’s relationship with JPM.100  Indeed, in connection with the Jane Doe Action, Dimon 
submitted a sworn answer to an interrogatory that, between 2000 and 2018, he received no 
information from any officer, director, employee, or agent of JPM concerning Epstein.101 
162. 
Dimon not only continues to profess ignorance, but he also seeks to deflect blame 
entirely from JPM.  During his deposition, Dimon said, concerning a victim, “I hope she gets 
justice against the people who perpetrated the crime, which was not us,”102 and later quipped, “we 
cannot do law enforcement’s job.”103  Of course, JPM interfered with law enforcement doing its 
job (and the Company affirmatively violated the law) by not filing a single SAR related to Epstein. 
163. 
Also at his deposition, Dimon testified that Epstein’s cash activity would have been 
visible to JPM in real time.104  Had the Company focused on Epstein’s specific transactions – some 
of which are discussed below in more detail – JPM should have filed SARs and provided specific 
updates to the Board.   
164. 
In total, between 2003 and 2013, at least 20 women trafficked and abused by 
Epstein were paid through JPM accounts.105  These women received payments, typically multiple 
payments, in excess of $1 million collectively during this period.106  According to the complaint

in the USVI Action, “among the recipients of these payments were numerous women with Eastern 
European surnames who were publicly and internally identified as Epstein recruiters and/or 
victims.”107  For example, Epstein paid more than $600,000 (including more than $165,000 after 
Epstein’s 2008 plea) to a woman who – according to news reports contained in JPM’s due diligence 
reports – Epstein purchased at the age of 14.108  Like other women who received payments from 
Epstein, that victim listed Epstein’s apartment on 66th Street in New York City as her address, 
which should have been a glaring red flag to the Company.109   
165. 
Epstein also withdrew more than $775,000 in cash between 2003 and 2013 from 
JPM accounts, which is especially significant as Epstein was known to pay for “massages,” or 
sexual encounters, in cash.110  Financial information evaluated in connection with the USVI Action 
also reflects payments drawn from JPM accounts of nearly $1.5 million to known recruiters, 
including to the MC2 Model Management (a company which, as discussed above, JPM compliance 
had flagged in 2011), and another $150,000 to a private investigative firm.111 
166. 
Epstein and/or his associates also made 95 foreign remittances with no known 
payee during this same time period – all transactions which JPM should have flagged and 
investigated.112  For example, Hyperion Air, Inc. (“Hyperion”) – the Epstein-controlled company 
that owned Epstein’s private jet used to traffic his victims – issued over $547,000 in checks

payable to cash purportedly for “fuel expenses when traveling to foreign countries.”113  
Additionally, between January 2012 and June 2013, Hyperion converted more than $120,000 into 
foreign currency.114  Many of these cash withdrawals “either exceeded the $10,000 reporting 
threshold or were seemingly structured to avoid triggering the reporting requirement.”115  
167. 
Epstein also used other entities under his control and with accounts at JPM, 
including his purported charitable organizations C.O.U.Q. Foundation and Enhanced Education, 
to funnel payments to his victims and associates.116  JPM seemingly did no due diligence on the 
nature of these various business entities, which appear to have no legitimate business purpose and, 
upon information and belief, were part of Epstein’s criminal enterprise. 
168. 
For example, Epstein and/or his representatives “used the C.O.U.Q. Foundation 
account to pay $29,464.66 to three young women, including two known victims, and over $20,000 
to a company called Phoenix Realty Home Inc.”117   
169. 
It is clear that JPM’s compliance systems, at least between 2006 until Epstein’s 
2019 arrest, were grossly deficient and failed to comply with both banking laws and regulations 
and Delaware fiduciary duty law.  As detailed above, there were screaming red flags concerning 
Epstein – including his conviction, innumerable press reports, various government investigations, 
and highly suspicious activity in his Company accounts – yet JPM did nothing about it, besides 
sitting on their hands until belatedly firing Epstein as a client.  Simply put, that was plainly 
inadequate under the law.

VI. 
A BROKEN AML COMPLIANCE SYSTEM:  JPM “FAILED TO IDENTIFY 
SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY,” IS ORDERED TO PAY 
$350 MILLION IN FINES, AND PLEADS GUILTY TO TWO FELONY COUNTS  
170. 
In January 2014, JPM settled two felony violations of the BSA with the Department 
of Justice stemming from its failure to alert authorities to suspicious activity after red flags about 
Bernie Madoff’s illegal conduct were raised at the bank.118  As part of the settlement agreement, 
JPM agreed to pay $1.7 billion in penalties.119  Federal prosecutors noted that “the Madoff Ponzi 
scheme was conducted almost exclusively” through various accounts held at JPM.120  In fact, in 
the early 2010s, JPM’s board of directors risk committee lacked any directors who had worked at 
a bank or as financial risk managers.121    
171. 
Additionally, the OCC ordered JPM to pay a $350 million fine for deficiencies in 
JPM’s BSA and AML compliance programs.  The penalty was based in part on JPM’s failure to 
report suspicions about Bernie Madoff to U.S. law enforcement and regulators.    
172. 
Even after it faced these highly publicized penalties, JPM has continued its illicit 
conduct, servicing funds for notorious bad actors: 
 From 2003 through 2014, JPM handled hundreds of transactions totaling nearly $2 
billion for Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch who is wanted on criminal charges 
in the United States.122

 From 2010 through 2015, a shell company operated by Semion Mogilevich, a 
Russian mafia figure described as the “Boss of Bosses,” sent and received more 
than $1 billion in transactions through JPM.  Mogilevich has been at the top of the 
FBI’s most wanted listed since 2009.123   
 From 2012 through 2016, JPM moved more than $63 million for companies linked 
to Alejandro “Piojo” Isturiz, a former Venezuelan government official who has 
been charged by U.S. authorities as a player in an international money laundering 
scheme.124    
 From 2013 through 2016, Jho Low, a financier accused by authorities in multiple 
countries of being the mastermind behind the embezzlement of more than $4.5 
billion from a Malaysian economic development fund called 1Malaysia 
Development Berhad, or 1MDB, moved over $1.2 billion through JPM.125

Manafort in the 14 months after he resigned from Donald Trump’s 2016 
presidential campaign amid allegations of money laundering and corruption 
“spawning from his work with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.”126  
 Even after JPM allegedly closed Epstein’s accounts with the bank in 2013, a current

 In December 2019, JPM faced a regulatory penalty for its KYC deficiencies.

VII. 
THE JANE DOE AND USVI ACTIONS BRING TO LIGHT JPM’S PARTICIPATION 
IN EPSTEIN’S CRIMES 
174. 
 On November 24, 2022, the initial complaint in the Jane Doe Action was filed.  
That suit arose from “JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s . . . participation and intentional involvement 
in Jeffery Epstein’s widespread and well-publicized sex-trafficking operation, as well as the direct 
financial benefits it received therefrom.”130  The complaint in the Jane Doe Action publicized, for 
the first time, JPM’s alleged involvement in and facilitation of Epstein’s crimes. 
175. 
 On December 27, 2022, the initial complaint in the USVI Action was filed.  That 
suit arose from the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin Islands’ “ongoing effort to protect public 
safety and to hold accountable those who facilitated or participated in, directly or indirectly, the 
trafficking enterprise Epstein helmed.”131  According to the operative complaint in that action: 
The [U.S. Virgin Islands’] investigation revealed that JP Morgan 
knowingly, negligently, and unlawfully provided and pulled the levers 
through which recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to 
the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise. 
Financial institutions can connect – or choke – human trafficking networks, 
and enforcement actions filed and injunctive relief obtained by attorneys 
general are essential to ensure that enterprises like Epstein’s cannot flourish 
in the future.132

176. 
On March 20, 2023, this Court granted in part and denied in part the motions to 
dismiss filed in the Jane Doe and USVI Actions.   
177. 
On May 26, 2023, Dimon sat for a deposition in connection with the Jane Doe and 
USVI Actions.  During the weekend of June 10-11, 2023, Staley sat for a deposition in connection 
with the Jane Doe and USVI Actions.   
178. 
The following Monday, June 12, 2023, JPM announced that it had settled the Jane 
Doe Action for $290 million. 133  That settlement, if approved by this Court, would be one of the 
largest ever for a civil sex-trafficking case.134 
179. 
The USVI Action remains pending. 
VIII. 
DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY AND HAVE CAUSED 
HARM TO JPM 
180. 
As fiduciaries of JPM, a Delaware corporation, Defendants’ fiduciary duties 
required them to institute an adequate oversight system in order to ensure compliance with positive 
law, including federal laws (such as the BSA and Patriot Act) concerning AML.  Defendants 
plainly did not do so. 
181. 
As discussed above in detail, JPM’s compliance team repeatedly flagged that 
Epstein was a convicted felon, accused of running a sex trafficking ring financed primarily in cash, 
and withdrew and transferred huge sums of money.  Executives at the highest reaches of the 
Company were aware of these facts.  It is indisputable that Staley (who allegedly participated 
personally in Epstein’s sex ring) and Erdoes were aware of the allegations levied against Epstein, 
as was Cutler, the General Counsel who vociferously advocated for JPM to sever ties with Epstein.

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 58 of 69

Moreover, it is inferable from the Company’s own documents that Dimon personally reviewed 
Epstein’s account in 2008 and decided to retain him as a JPM client. 
182. 
Nevertheless, the Board and Company officers never acted on this information, 
terminated the Company’s relationship with Epstein, or filed the legally required SARs.  It was a 
clear breach of duty for JPM fiduciaries to be willfully blind and deaf to the highly publicized 
allegations against Epstein, who was a prominent figure in the financial world. 
183. 
These breaches of fiduciary duty occurred at least from Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea 
through his 2019 death, a period over which the JPM filed zero SARs related to Epstein.   
184. 
Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty have caused massive harm to the Company.  
The Company already has agreed to settle the Jane Doe Action for $290 million, and the USVI 
Action remains pending.  Moreover, JPM’s deep and lasting affiliation with Epstein has caused 
incalculable reputational harm (as the Company’s own filings warn is a severe risk of not 
complying with its regulatory obligations). 
DEMAND FUTILITY ALLEGATIONS 
185. 
Plaintiffs did not make a demand on the Board to institute this Action because pre-
suit demand is excused. 
186. 
Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each allegation above as if set forth in full in this 
Demand Futility Allegations section. 
187. 
Demand is excused because there exists a reasonable doubt that, at a minimum, at 
least half of the Board at the time that this Complaint is filed could properly exercise independent 
and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand. 
188. 
The demand Board has 12 members:  Bammann, Burke, Combs, Crown, Davis, 
Dimon, Flynn, Alex Gorsky (“Gorsky”), Hobson, Michael A. Neal (“Neal”), Novakovic, and 
Rometty.  Demand is therefore futile if at least six of the 12 directors either lack independence, 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 59 of 69

are not disinterested, or both.  Here, at least nine directors lack independence, are not disinterested, 
or both:  Bammann, Burke, Combs, Crown, Dimon, Flynn, Hobson, Neal, and Novakovic. 
189. 
Bammann, Burke, Combs, Crown, Dimon, Flynn, Hobson, and Neal are not 
disinterested because they face a substantial likelihood of liability, whether in this Action, the 
USVI Action or in the Jane Doe Action.  Each of these directors have served on the Board at times 
between Epstein’s 2008 plea and his 2019 death.  Yet, the Company plainly failed to comply with 
positive law, as evidenced by the fact that the Board never discussed JPM’s relationship with 
Epstein and the Company did not file a single SAR related to Epstein over this timeframe.   
190. 
Bammann, Crown, Dimon, Burke, and Flynn face an even more heightened 
likelihood of liability, given that they all served on the Board before the Company purportedly 
terminated its relationship with Epstein in 2013. 
191. 
Moreover, and separately, Dimon faces a substantial likelihood of liability because 
it appears that he knew about JPM’s relationship with Epstein as of at least 2008 (if not earlier, 
during his days in Columbus, Ohio and at Bank One) and knew about Epstein’s guilty plea, yet 
Dimon failed to cause the Company to terminate its relationship with Epstein, failed to address 
Epstein with the Board, and failed to cause the Company to file a single SAR concerning Epstein. 
192. 
Additionally, Bammann, Crown, and Novakovic are not independent from Dimon 
and/or Crown.   
193. 
  Bammann owes a significant portion of her professional success to Dimon.  While 
Dimon was the CEO of Bank One, Bammann reached the status of Bank One’s Executive Vice 
President and Chief Risk Management Officer from 2001 to 2004.  Then, after JPM acquired Bank 
One, when Dimon was JPM’s President and Chief Operating Officer, Bammann served as the 
Company’s Deputy Head of Risk Management.  Moreover, the Board invited Bammann to join 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 60 of 69

2013, while Dimon attained his current roles of CEO and Chairman.  Bammann’s only 
employment since 2013 has been her role as a JPM director. 
194. 
Crown served on the board of directors of Bank One from 1991 until its sale to JPM 
in 2004, and Crown was one of the people who selected Dimon to be Bank One’s CEO in 2000.  
Crown also advocated for Dimon to assume a leadership role at JPM.  Moreover, Crown was 
involved in the New Albany project, which relied on Epstein for its success.   
195. 
Novakovic, in turn, is not independent from Crown.  Novakovic is the Chairman 
and CEO of General Dynamics, Crown’s family business.  Thus, Crown likely had the influence 
to fire Novakovic, and it is not plausible that Novakovic would be willing to bring litigation against 
Crown concerning the allegations of this Complaint.         
PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE TIMELY 
196. 
Plaintiffs did not know, and could not have known, that Epstein used JPM to 
facilitate his trafficking enterprise or that the Company turned a blind eye to unusual cash 
transactions and wires and failed to carry out or follow up on basic due diligence and to timely 
comply with federal banking regulations until the filing of the complaint in the Jane Doe Action 
on November 24, 2022. 
197. 
To the extent the statute of limitations even began to run before November 24, 
2022, any perceived delay in Plaintiffs’ filing of this Action arises due to the Board’s and Company 
management’s concerted and long-running efforts to conceal critical facts necessary to put 
Plaintiffs on notice of the specific facts showing the Board’s and Company management’s 
sustained and systemic breaches of fiduciary duty.   
198. 
As discussed above, despite knowing Epstein was a felon convicted for sexual 
abuse, a pedophile who allegedly trafficked young girls from all over the world (including on his 
private plane), and wired and withdrew large sums of cash from his JPM accounts, the Company 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 61 of 69

failed to file a single SAR concerning Epstein and his accounts.  Additionally, JPM employees – 
including those at the highest reaches of the Company, such as Dimon, Staley, and/or Erdoes – 
actively concealed concerns about Epstein and failed to report them to the Board and/or timely fire 
Epstein as a client. 
199. 
Moreover, JPM continues to try to avoid accountability for its role in Epstein’s sex-
trafficking ring.  Dimon even repeatedly denied knowing who Epstein was until 2018 or 2019, 
which appears to be false given the allegations above.  Instead, JPM has tried to lay all blame 
exclusively on Staley, and the Company has asserted claims against him – but not against other 
executives still at the Company and who clearly had knowledge of Epstein’s crimes.

Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
(Against the Director Defendants) 
200. 
Plaintiffs reallege the preceding paragraphs as set forth above and incorporate them 
herein by reference. 
201. 
The Director Defendants, as directors of JPM, were and/or are fiduciaries of the 
Company and its stockholders.  As such, the Director Defendants owed and owe the Company and 
its stockholders the highest duties of good faith, due care, loyalty and candor.  
202. 
The Company was and is subject to numerous AML laws and KYC regulations.  
The Director Defendants’ fiduciary duties oblige them to put systems in place to manage risk and 
ensure compliance with these laws.  
203. 
The Director Defendants, consistent with their fiduciary duties, were required to 
implement and maintain effective controls to ensure the Company’s compliance with AML laws 
and KYC regulations. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 62 of 69

204. 
The Director Defendants consciously breached their fiduciary duties and violated 
their corporate responsibilities to ensure the Company’s compliance with the applicable laws even 
when Epstein’s criminal activity and criminal use of his JPM accounts and funds put them on 
notice, either by ignoring red flags related to Epstein’s actions and failing to adhere to their own 
internal controls or by knowingly disregarding their own internal controls and intentionally 
allowing the Company to continue facilitating Epstein’s criminal conduct. 
205. 
As a result of the Director Defendants’ conscious failure to perform their fiduciary 
duties and exercise their oversight responsibilities, the Company has sustained significant 
damages, both financial and reputational.  Such damages include, and will include, damage 
awards, settlements, expenses, penalties, fines, increased regulatory scrutiny, and other liabilities 
described herein. 
206. 
The Director Defendants’ continuing decision not to correct this failure exposes the 
Company to comparable and continuing risks of damages in the future. 
207. 
As a result of the bad faith misconduct alleged herein, the Director Defendants are 
liable to the Company. 
COUNT II 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
(Against the Officer Defendants)

Plaintiffs reallege the preceding paragraphs as set forth above and incorporate them 
herein by reference. 
209.

its stockholders the highest duties of good faith, due care, loyalty and candor.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 63 of 69

210. 
The Company was and is subject to numerous AML laws and KYC regulations.  
The Officer Defendants’ fiduciary duties oblige them to put systems in place to manage risk and 
ensure compliance with these laws.  
211. 
The Officer Defendants, consistent with their fiduciary duties, were required to 
implement and maintain effective controls to ensure the Company’s compliance with AML laws 
and KYC regulations. 
212. 
The Officer Defendants consciously breached their fiduciary duties and violated 
their corporate responsibilities to ensure the Company’s compliance with the applicable laws even 
when Epstein’s criminal activity and criminal use of his JPM accounts and funds put them on 
notice, either by ignoring red flags related to Epstein’s actions and failing to adhere to their own 
internal controls or by knowingly disregarding their own internal controls and intentionally 
allowing the Company to continue facilitating Epstein’s criminal conduct. 
213. 
As a result of the Officer Defendants’ conscious failure to perform their fiduciary 
duties and exercise their oversight responsibilities, the Company has sustained significant 
damages, both financial and reputational.  Such damages include, and will include, damage 
awards, settlements, expenses, penalties, fines, increased regulatory scrutiny, and other liabilities 
described herein. 
214.

liable to the Company. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 17     Filed 06/30/23     Page 64 of 69

(Against the Individual Defendants) 
216. 
Plaintiffs reallege the preceding paragraphs as set forth above and incorporate them 
herein by reference. 
217. 
As a result of the conduct described herein, the Individual Defendants breached 
their fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders.  The Individual Defendants were in a 
position to benefit from their misconduct in the form of profits, benefits, and other compensation. 
218. 
The Individual Defendants have been unjustly enriched at the expense and to the 
detriment of Plaintiffs and the Company. 
219. 
It would be unconscionable and against fundamental principles of justice, equity, 
and good conscience for the Individual Defendants to retain the benefits that they received only 
by virtue of breaching their fiduciary duties. 
220. 
All profits, benefits, and other compensation that accrued to the Individual 
Defendants, collectively or individually, as a result of their misconduct should be disgorged. 
RELIEF REQUESTED 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of the Company, request judgment as follows: 
A. 
Declaring that this Action is a proper derivative action maintainable under the law 
and that Plaintiffs are proper and adequate representatives of the Company;

fiduciary duties owed to the Company;

fiduciary duty set forth above, together with pre- and post-judgment interest, from each of the 
Individual Defendants, jointly and severally;

Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23.1 and 12(b)(6), Defendants1 submit this 
memorandum of law in support of their motion to dismiss with prejudice the Amended 
Stockholder Derivative Complaint, dated June 30, 2023 (the “Complaint”) [Dkt. 17]. 
I.
Preliminary Statement
Plaintiffs are stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan” or the “Company”)  
who assert derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty against eight former and current 
directors and a former officer of JPMorgan.  These claims concern the Company’s prior 
relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, whose accounts at a Company subsidiary (the “Bank”) were 
terminated in August 2013.  For all its length, the 65-page Complaint contains few factual 
allegations about Defendants themselves—no doubt, because many of the Director Defendants 
were not even on the Board when Epstein was a Bank client, and those actually on the Board at 
the time are not alleged to have known about Epstein’s accounts.  The Complaint should be 
dismissed with prejudice because it both (1) fails to plead demand futility as a matter of law, and 
(2) fails to state claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.     
Demand Futility Not Pleaded.  Shareholders may usurp the role of a company’s board of 
directors and pursue claims belonging to the company only in rare circumstances.  To displace 
that authority, Delaware law—which applies here because JPMorgan is incorporated in 
Delaware—requires that a shareholder first make a demand on the company’s board to 
investigate the alleged claims.  Compl. ¶ 60.2  Plaintiffs here concede that they did not make a 
This memorandum is submitted on behalf of all defendants apart from James Staley, including 
JPMorgan; Stephen Burke, Todd Combs, James Crown, Timothy Flynn, Mellody Hobson, John 
Kessler, and Phebe Novakovic (the “Director Defendants”); and James Dimon (together, with the 
Director Defendants, the “Defendants”).  JPMorgan joins only in Part III of this motion, 
addressing demand futility. 
References to “Ex. _ at _” refer to the exhibits to the attached Declaration of Audra J. Soloway 
and the corresponding page citation.  References to “¶” refer to paragraphs in the Complaint.
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 7 of 32

demand, instead contending that making a demand on the members of JPMorgan’s Board as of 
the date the Complaint was filed (the “Demand Board”) would be “futile.”  Compl. ¶¶ 185, 188.  
To surmount the stringent demand futility standard, however, Plaintiffs must plead that a 
majority of the Demand Board was conflicted because they (1) “received a material personal 
benefit from the alleged misconduct,” (2) “would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any 
of the claims,” or (3) “lack[] independence from someone” conflicted under (1) or (2).  United 
Food & Com. Workers Union & Participating Food Indus. Emps.’ Tri-State Pension Fund v. 
Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d 1034, 1058 (Del. 2021) (“Zuckerberg”).  Rule 23.1 additionally requires 
that these facts be pled with particularity.  The sparse, conclusory allegations of the Complaint, 
however, satisfy none of these prongs:

Under prong 1, there are no allegations whatsoever that any Demand Board Director 
received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct.

Under prong 2, the Complaint does not contain any well-pleaded facts, let alone 
particularized ones, establishing that any Demand Board Director faces a substantial 
likelihood of liability for the claims—let alone a majority of the Demand Board.  
Indeed, eight of the 11 Demand Board Directors joined the Board only after the Bank 
terminated Epstein’s accounts in 2013, and face no risk of liability.  

Under prong 3, the Complaint does not contain any well-pleaded facts that any 
Demand Board Director lacks independence from a purportedly conflicted Demand 
Board Director.  As an initial matter, there are no conflicted Demand Board Directors.  
Moreover, the Complaint asserts only that certain Demand Board Directors have had 
long-standing business relationships with others, and that one director invested in a 
real estate venture decades ago in which Epstein was allegedly involved, which is 
plainly insufficient. 

Accordingly, the Complaint lacks particularized factual allegations of demand futility 
to allow Plaintiffs to bring this action, and must be dismissed.  
Failure to State a Claim.  Even if Plaintiffs had adequately pleaded demand futility (they 
have not), the breach of fiduciary duty claims fail to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) against 
both the non-management Director Defendants, as well as CEO Dimon.    
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 8 of 32

With respect to the non-management Director Defendants, Plaintiffs face the difficult 
hurdle of alleging oversight failure under the demanding standard set forth in In re Caremark 
Int’l Inc. Derivative Litig., 698 A.2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996).  This hurdle is further heightened 
because JPMorgan’s charter exculpates its directors from liability for breaches of fiduciary duty 
except those that arise from acts taken in bad faith or from intentional misconduct.  The 
Complaint fails to identify any well-pleaded facts showing, as required by Caremark, that any 
Director Defendant consciously disregarded red flags concerning Epstein’s accounts and banking 
activity.  In fact, the Complaint does not plead that any Director Defendant even knew that 
Epstein was a client, much less that they disregarded the Bank’s anti-money laundering 
obligations.  Nor can the Complaint satisfy Caremark by alleging that the Director Defendants 
utterly failed to implement controls; to the contrary, it concedes that JPMorgan had robust 
internal controls for board oversight.  
With respect to Mr. Dimon, Plaintiffs likewise fail to plead allegations establishing (1) 
bad faith misconduct arising from a failure to act in the face of specific knowledge of any red 
flag (duty of oversight) or (2) that he acted with gross negligence with respect to compliance and 
risk management concerning Epstein’s accounts (duty of care).  Rather, the claims against Mr. 
Dimon are based on nothing more than pure speculation and innuendo.  These allegations, more 
suited to Page Six of the New York Post than a complaint in federal court, fail to demonstrate Mr. 
Dimon was even involved in the decision to continue the banking relationship with Mr. Epstein 
or with BSA/AML issues concerning Mr. Epstein’s accounts, much less state a failure of 
oversight claim.  
For all these reasons, the Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.

II.
Relevant Background Facts as Pleaded in Complaint
Plaintiffs’ claims are premised on the Bank’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein from 
2008, when Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution, until his 2019 death.  
Compl. ¶ 183.  The Complaint’s allegations are largely based on the claims advanced in two 
related cases pending before the Court, Jane Doe 1 v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10019 
(JSR) (S.D.N.Y. 2022) and Gov’t of the U.S. Virgin Islands v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 23-
cv-10904 (S.D.N.Y. 2023).  Defendants assume the Court’s familiarity with the underlying 
allegations in these cases. 
Plaintiffs concede that they “did not make a demand on the Board [of JPMorgan] to 
institute this Action because pre-suit demand is excused.”  Compl. ¶ 185.  For the reasons 
addressed below, a majority of the Demand Board is not conflicted for demand futility purposes, 
regardless of whether the Demand Board is deemed to have 11 members or 12 members 
(including Crown, who passed away on June 25, 2023, before this Complaint was filed).3
 Five Demand Board Directors—Linda Bammann, Alicia Davis, Alex Gorsky, Michael 
Neal, and Virginia Rometty—are current directors who are not named as defendants (the “Non-
Defendant Directors”).  The other current directors and Crown are named as Defendants, along 
with former director John Kessler, who served from 1996 to 2007.  For the convenience of the 
Court, the below table sets forth the Demand Board and Director Defendants and their respective 
Board tenures, as well as whether Epstein was a Bank client during their board service:

Notably, eight of the Demand Board Directors—a clear majority—joined the Board only 
after the Bank terminated its banking relationship with Epstein in August 2013 (this includes all 
of the five Non-Defendant Directors, and Combs, Hobson, and Novakovic).4  To address this 
inconvenient fact, the Complaint asserts that various Demand Board Directors face a “substantial 
likelihood of liability” because they “served on the Board at times between Epstein’s 2008 plea 
and his 2019 death,”  Compl. ¶ 189, and that directors who served before 2013 face “an even 
more heightened likelihood of liability for having served…before the Company purportedly 
terminated its relationship with Epstein in 2013.”  Compl. ¶ 190.  
The Complaint contains no particularized factual allegations even suggesting that any 
Director Defendant was aware of the Bank’s relationship with Epstein, much less consciously 
disregarded red flags or committed misconduct in connection with Epstein’s accounts.  Rather, to 
The Complaint incorrectly states that Bammann joined the Board before Epstein was 
terminated as a client.  Compl. ¶ 190.  This is incorrect because Bammann did not join the Board 
until September 2013.  Compare Doe 1 Compl. ¶ 473 (“By providing financing for Epstein’s sex 
trafficking organization from about 2000 through about August 2013”); ¶ 438 (“[B]etween about 
2000 and August 2013 and following, JP Morgan concealed its delivery of vast sums of cash to 
Epstein and his associates”) with JPMorgan Names Two to Board, Creates Lead Director Role, 
Bloomberg (Sept. 9, 2013) https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-09/jpmorgan-
names-two-to-board-creates-lead-director-role#xj4y7vzkg (dating Bammann joining the board to 
September 2013).

the extent the Complaint contains any allegations with respect to any Director Defendant, those 
allegations are speculative assignations of guilt-by-association:

As to Burke, Combs, Flynn, and Hobson, the Complaint contains no allegations 
whatsoever, apart from identifying them as Board members and detailing certain 
aspects of their professional backgrounds.  Compl. ¶¶ 35, 37–39.  

Plaintiffs’ only allegations against former director Crown are that, at some 
unspecified time decades ago, he “was involved in the New Albany project,” a project 
to re-develop farmland into a town modeled on an 18th Century Georgian village, 
“which relied on Epstein for its success.”  Compl. ¶ 88, 194.  Plaintiffs also allege 
that Crown recruited Dimon to Bank One Corporation, and that Crown served as the 
head of the JPMorgan Board of Directors’ Risk Committee while Epstein was a client 
of the Bank.  Compl. ¶¶ 14, 103, 104, 107.

With respect to Novakovic, Plaintiffs concede that she joined the Board after 
Epstein’s death, see Compl. ¶ 36, but assert her non-independence from Crown on 
grounds that Novakovic is the CEO of General Dynamics, which is alleged to be 
Crown’s “family business.”  Compl. ¶¶ 195, 12.  Plaintiffs fashioned this purported 
conflict for the first time after Crown passed away, by adding Novakovic to a later-
filed pleading.5   
The first-filed complaint did not sue Novakovic, and conceded her independence. [Dkt. 1]  It 
was not until the second-filed complaint that Novakovic was added as a defendant and identified 
as purportedly conflicted due to her connection to Crown—but that complaint was filed on June 
27, 2023 [City of Miami Gen. Emps. & Sanitation Emps. Retirement Trust v. JPMorgan Chase & 
Co., 23-cv-05459 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y. 2023), Dkt. 1] after Crown’s death on June 25, at which point 
any influence by Crown over Novakovic’s consideration of a demand had plainly ceased.  It is 
pure gamesmanship for Plaintiffs to sue Novakovic (who only joined the Board after Epstein’s 
death) and assert her purported lack of independence only after Crown’s death, when the 
purported conflict no longer exists.  Further, Defendants asked Plaintiffs to dismiss their claims 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 12 of 32


Plaintiffs allege that former director Kessler, a corporate lawyer, had a business 
relationship with Les Wexner—an Epstein associate—and invested in the New 
Albany project on which Epstein worked decades ago, and in which Wexner, Kessler, 
and Epstein all invested and owned property.  Compl. ¶¶ 11–13, 87–96, 105.  
Plaintiffs also allege the unremarkable fact that Kessler was involved in recruiting 
Dimon to join Bank One Corporation, which later merged with JPMorgan.  Compl. 
¶¶ 90–91, 96.  

Finally, as to non-Defendant Bammann, Plaintiffs allege that she worked for Dimon 
in the early 2000s at both Bank One and at JPMorgan—years before joining the 
JPMorgan Board in September 2013.  Compl. ¶ 193. 
The sole remaining allegation relevant to the non-management Director Defendants 
relates to government investigations and a jumble of inflammatory references to bad actors that 
Plaintiffs fail to show are in any way related to the Bank’s prior relationship with Mr. Epstein.  
Compl. ¶¶ 170–73.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that in January 2014, the Bank settled two BSA 
violations with the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York.  Compl. ¶ 170.  In the settlement agreement, the Bank acknowledged that it had failed to 
report suspicious activity concerning the activities of Bernie Madoff between 2006 and 2008.  
Compl. ¶ 171; (Ex. 1 at 1, 24).  At the same time, the Bank agreed to pay a civil money penalty 
consent order to the OCC for $350 million.  Compl. ¶ 170.6  Plaintiffs also list, without any 
against Crown in light of his death, and Plaintiffs’ response was to file this Amended Complaint 
on June 30, 2023 [Dkt. 17] that amended references to Crown’s Board service to past tense, but 
did not dismiss him from the lawsuit.  Defendants reserve all rights on this issue.
The government investigations related to the OCC consent order ultimately required JPMorgan 
and affiliates to improve compliance efforts, including with respect to suspicious activity reports 
(“SARs”).  The Complaint does not allege that such improvements were not actually made in 
2014, or that JPMorgan has violated the consent order.
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 13 of 32

details, transactions that JPMorgan has purportedly handled for “bad actors” unrelated to 
Epstein, such as Jho Low and Paul Manafort.  Compl. ¶ 172.7  None of this purported 
misconduct is alleged either to relate to Epstein, or to have been known by the Board.
As to Mr. Dimon, the Bank’s CEO, the Complaint’s allegations are limited to (a) 
speculation that Mr. Dimon must have known of Mr. Epstein’s criminality because, based on a 
lengthy, contorted story, Mr. Dimon and Mr. Epstein shared connections to the Columbus, Ohio 
business community (Compl. ¶¶ 14, 90-91, 96, 102–08, 191); (b) the assertion that a certain 
document concerning Epstein’s bank accounts was marked “pending Dimon review,” though the 
Complaint conspicuously stops short of alleging that this review ever occurred (Compl. ¶¶ 19, 
136–37, 191); and (c) the claim that Mr. Epstein and a different defendant, Mr. Staley, 
coordinated to schedule meetings for Mr. Dimon with the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu, Bill 
Gates, and Prince Andrew, even though the Complaint nowhere pleads facts demonstrating Mr. 
Dimon attended these meetings or, if he did, that he had any knowledge of Mr. Epstein’s 
purported involvement.  Compl. ¶ 123.
III.
No Demand Was Made, and Demand Futility Is Not Adequately Pleaded.
A.
Legal Standard for Demand Futility
“‘A cardinal precept’ of Delaware law ‘is that directors, rather than shareholders, manage 
the business and affairs of the corporation.’” 8  Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d at 1047 (citation omitted).  
This extends to a determination whether the corporation should file a lawsuit against its 
directors, its officers, its controller, or an outsider.  Id.  A stockholder may substitute his 
Plaintiffs also allege an equally irrelevant SEC fine concerning the deletion of electronic 
records which purportedly “includ[ed] emails and instant messages, dated from January to April 
2018” but do not explain how this is relevant to Epstein at all.  Compl. ¶ 173.  
Because JPMorgan is incorporated in Delaware, Delaware law governing demand futility 
applies.  Scalisi v. Fund Asset Mgmt., L.P., 380 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 2004).
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 14 of 32

judgment for that of the board and assert company claims only after either “(1) mak[ing] a 
demand on the company’s board of directors” that the board rejects “or (2) show[ing] that 
demand would be futile.”  Id.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1(b)(3) requires that a shareholder-derivative 
complaint “state with particularity” any “effort by the plaintiff to obtain the desired action from 
the directors” and “the reasons for not obtaining the action or not making the effort.”  It is the 
“rare case” where the requirement is excused based upon allegations that demand is futile.  In re 
Citigroup Inc. S’holder Derivative Litig., 964 A.2d 106, 121 (Del. Ch. 2009).  To plead demand 
futility, Plaintiffs must allege “particularized facts creating a reasonable doubt that a majority of 
the Board…would be disinterested or independent in making a decision on” whether to bring 
suit.  Rales v. Blasband, 634 A.2d 927, 930 (Del. 1993).
To plead that directors are conflicted, Plaintiffs must allege with particularity that they 
(1) “received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct,” (2) “would face a 
substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims,” or (3) “lack[] independence from 
someone” conflicted under (1) or (2).  Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d at 1058.  In this case, Plaintiffs 
make no allegation whatsoever that any director received a material personal benefit from any 
alleged misconduct (Compl. ¶¶ 135–51), making prong one of Zuckerberg inapplicable.9  And 
Plaintiffs’ efforts to satisfy prongs two and three plainly fail.      
To support its unjust enrichment claim, Plaintiffs allege in conclusory fashion that Defendants 
“benefit[ed] from their misconduct in the form of profits, benefits, and other compensation.”  
Compl. ¶ 217.  But under Zuckerberg’s first prong, ordinary board compensation does not 
constitute a material benefit.  See e.g., In re Am. Int’l Grp., Inc. Derivative Litig., 700 F. Supp. 
2d. 419, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), aff’d, 415 F. App’x 285 (2d Cir. 2011) (finding that “[p]laintiff’s 
allegations regarding director compensation [did] not raise any reasonable doubt as to directorial 
disinterestedness” because plaintiff did not “allege that the compensation that these directors 
received was anything other than customary director compensation”) (citing Orman v. Cullman, 
794 A.2d 5, 29 n. 62 (Del. Ch. 2002)).
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 15 of 32

B.
Plaintiffs Fail to Plead Particularized Facts Demonstrating that a Majority of 
the Demand Board Directors Face a “Substantial Likelihood of Liability.” 
Demand may be excused under the second prong of the Zuckerberg test only in “rare” 
circumstances where a complaint alleges with particularity that a majority of directors engaged 
in such “egregious” misconduct that they face not merely a “threat” but a “substantial likelihood 
of director liability.”  Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 815 (Del. 1984).  And here, Plaintiffs’ 
hurdle is higher still: Pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law Section 102(b)(7), 
JPMorgan’s charter exculpates its directors from liability for breaches of fiduciary duty except 
those that arise from acts taken in bad faith or from intentional misconduct.10  See Ex. 2 at 4 
(Restated Certificate of Incorporation of JPMorgan Chase & Co. at Art. 6(1)).  
In the face of this high pleading standard, Plaintiffs rely upon an oversight claim. 
Oversight claims are “possibly the most difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff 
might hope to win a judgment.”  In re Caremark, 698 A.2d at 967.  To state such a claim, 
Plaintiffs must plead particularized facts demonstrating either that “(a) the directors utterly failed 
As to the claim Plaintiffs seek to assert against Mr. Staley in particular, it is obvious that 
demand would not be futile.  As noted above, JPMorgan has already brought claims against Mr. 
Staley identical to those that Plaintiffs now seek to assert on behalf of JPMorgan.  See supra at 
Part III.  Demand cannot be futile where, as here, a board has already acted on the very matter on 
which the shareholder demands action.  See, e.g., In re Delta and Pine Land Co. S’holders Litig., 
No. Civ.A. 17707, 2000 WL 875421, at *6 (Del. Ch. June 21, 2000) (“As this Court has 
previously found, the existence of a board-initiated action conclusively defeats any claim that 
demand would have been futile.  Indeed, there is something to be said for the idea that this Court 
should inquire no further if it finds that the corporate directors are litigating the same claims 
advanced in the derivative action.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Kococinski v. 
Collins, 935 F. Supp. 2d 909, 919 n.17 (D. Minn. 2013) (noting that “if a board of directors had 
already commenced a lawsuit addressing the conduct that a potential derivative plaintiff wanted 
to challenge, there would be little reason for the derivative plaintiff to commence the same 
action”) (D. Minn. 2013); Meyers v. Keeler, 414 F. Supp. 935, 939 (W.D. Okla. 1976) (demand 
not futile where board has “already taken action on the very matter which [p]laintiff [] asserts 
they would not take action upon”).  Indeed, permitting Plaintiffs’ claim against Mr. Staley to 
proceed would simply result in unnecessary, duplicative litigation.

to implement any reporting or information system or controls; or (b) having implemented such a 
system or controls, consciously failed to monitor or oversee its operations thus disabling 
themselves from being informed of risks or problems requiring their attention.”  Stone v. Ritter, 
911 A.2d 362, 370 (Del. 2006).  In light of JPMorgan’s exculpatory charter provision, “the lack 
of oversight pled must be so extreme that it represents a breach of the duty of loyalty,” which 
“requires a pleading of scienter, demonstrating bad faith.”  Constr. Indus. Laborers Pension 
Fund v. Bingle, No. 2021-0940-SG, 2022 WL 4102492, at *1 (Del. Ch. Sept. 6, 2022), aff'd, No. 
411, 2022, 2023 WL 3513271 (Del. May 17, 2023).  In other words, Plaintiffs must allege facts 
demonstrating that the Board “knew that internal controls were inadequate” but “chose to do 
nothing.”  Desimone v. Barrows, 924 A.2d 908, 940 (Del. Ch. 2007).  The Complaint falls far 
short of meeting this rigorous pleading standard.  
1.
Eight Demand Board members assumed membership on the JPMorgan 
Board only after JPMorgan terminated Epstein as a client.
There is no colorable argument whatsoever that there is any risk of liability for at least 
eight of the Demand Board Directors—Defendants Combs, Hobson, Novakovic and non-
Defendants Bammann, Rometty, Gorsky, Neal, and Davis—for the obvious reason that these 
directors all assumed their positions on JPMorgan’s board only after Epstein’s relationship with 
JPMorgan was terminated in August 2013.  Compl. ¶¶ 36, 38, 39.  These directors cannot 
possibly bear liability in connection with any alleged Epstein-related compliance shortcomings 
by the Bank before their Board membership began.  See, e.g., In re Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 
Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 773 F. Supp. 2d 330, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (JSR) (majority of 
Bank of America board faced no substantial risk of liability for claims alleged against Merrill 
Lynch officers and directors based on pre-merger conduct); United Food & Com. Workers Union 
v. Zuckerberg, 250 A.3d 862, 894 (Del. Ch. 2020) (holding that a board member was not 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 17 of 32

interested in part because he had joined the board after the challenged action had taken place), 
aff’d sub nom. Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d 1034.  
In the face of this critical deficiency, Plaintiffs lodge several speculative and conclusory 
allegations:  First, Plaintiffs say that the Bank “potentially continued to engage with Epstein 
related entities until his death in jail in 2019” (Compl. ¶ 26), but the Complaint offers no well-
pleaded factual allegations showing any continuing engagement with Epstein following 
termination of his accounts, much less a lack of oversight by Defendants from 2013-2019 so 
extreme that it amounts to bad faith.  Second, Plaintiffs say that the Bank “actively concealed 
Epstein’s crimes by failing to file any legally required Suspicious Activity Reports (‘SARs’), 
which are mandated for large cash withdrawals and other suspicious transactions.”  Id.  
Plaintiffs, however, do not allege any particularized facts about the Company’s actual SAR filing 
practices concerning Epstein—indeed, Plaintiffs rely fully on the USVI and Doe complaints 
(which actually plead that SARs were filed), and offer no good faith factual basis to support the 
conclusory and contradictory assertion that zero SARs were filed.  Plaintiffs also fail to allege 
that any director would, in the ordinary course, have any knowledge of or involvement in the 
SAR filing process at a client-specific level, and therefore fail to allege that any director should 
have known about specific SAR filings related to Epstein.  In any event, Plaintiffs again fail to 
explain how Directors who joined the Board after the Epstein account terminations could 
possibly be culpable for SAR filings, or the alleged lack thereof, during his tenure as a client.
Accordingly, given that eight Demand Board Directors joined the Board after the Bank 
terminated Epstein’s accounts in 2013, there is no question that a majority of an 11- (or 12-) 
person board faces no substantial risk of personal liability under the Zuckerberg analysis.
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 18 of 32

2.
Plaintiffs fail to plead particularized facts demonstrating that the 
remaining Demand Board Directors knowingly failed to oversee internal 
controls.
While not necessary to address, Plaintiffs also cannot satisfy Caremark for the Demand 
Board Directors who served while Epstein’s accounts at the Bank were active—Burke, Dimon, 
and Flynn (and Crown, even if included).  To satisfy Caremark, both knowledge of the 
misconduct and a conscious failure to act upon that knowledge are required.  See Firemen’s Ret. 
Sys. of St. Louis v. Sorenson, No. CV 2019-0965-LWW, 2021 WL 4593777, at *13 (Del. Ch. 
Oct. 5, 2021) (plaintiff must allege directors “knew about ‘red flags’ alerting them to corporate 
misconduct and consciously failed to act after learning about evidence of illegality”) (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  Importantly, merely pleading facts that “imply that the [demand 
board] could have done a better job addressing the issues highlighted by, among other sources, . . 
. consent orders” is “not enough to state a Caremark claim.”  Okla. Firefighters Pension & Ret. 
Sys. v. Corbat, No. CV 12151-VCG, 2017 WL 6452240, at *17 (Del. Ch. Dec. 18, 2017).  
The Complaint is devoid of well-pleaded factual allegations that the Demand Board 
Directors who served while Epstein was a Bank client (or any other director) were even aware of 
that banking relationship, let alone were aware of any red flags concerning Epstein’s accounts 
and thereafter consciously disregarded a duty owed by the Board to act on such red flags, as is 
required to sustain a claim under the second Caremark prong.  See Pettry v. Smith, C.A. No. 
2019-0795-JRS, 2021 WL 2644475, at *7 (Del. Ch. Jun. 28, 2021).  Even the Complaint’s 
allegations that Staley was involved in Epstein’s crimes does not in any way suggest the Board 
was informed of issues concerning Epstein’s accounts.  Compl. ¶¶ 139-50.  Entirely absent, 
therefore, are any allegations that any Director Defendant was ever “presented with ‘red flags’ 
alerting it to potential misconduct” and consciously and deliberately ignored such warnings, as 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 19 of 32

required to state a prong-two Caremark claim.  David B. Shaev Profit Sharing Acct. v. 
Armstrong, No. Civ.A. 1449-N, 2006 WL 391931, at *5 (Del. Ch. Feb. 13, 2006), aff’d, 911 
A.2d 802 (Del. 2006); South v. Baker, 62 A.3d 1, 17 (Del. Ch. 2012) (no substantial likelihood 
of liability where “[a]lthough the complaint asserts that the directors knew of and ignored 
[certain safety incidents], the complaint nowhere alleges anything that the directors were told 
about the incidents, what the Board’s response was, or even that the incidents were connected in 
any way”).  
Nor does the mere existence of the alleged regulatory investigations or enforcement 
actions in 2013 and 2014 support a Caremark claim for the Director Defendants on the Board at 
that time.  See Compl. ¶¶ 170–71.  The DOJ settlement, OCC fine, and other allegations set forth 
in the Complaint did not concern the Bank’s relationship with Epstein, which had already been 
terminated.  Compl. ¶¶  172–73; see In re SAIC Derivative Litig., 948 F. Supp. 2d 366, 387 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (rejecting argument that “knowledge of wrongdoing in other transactions 
should have put the Board on a heightened state of alert”); Citigroup, 964 A.2d at 129 (rejecting 
contention that “alleged prior, unrelated wrongdoing would make directors sensitive to similar 
circumstances”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, if anything, the Director 
Defendants on the Board at the time of the government settlements would have been reassured 
by enhancement of the Company’s compliance procedures—and the Complaint does not allege 
that these enhancements were not actually made, or that the Board subsequently learned of any 
SAR-related compliance problems following those government investigations in 2014.  Plaintiffs 
thus fail to allege “information regarding the individual [d]irectors’ responses, if any” to the 
alleged regulatory enforcement, and thus fail to establish that any “[d]irector[] failed to act or 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 20 of 32

[that] the actions they took were inappropriate in light of the information they received.”  In re 
ITT Corp. Derivative Litig., 588 F. Supp. 2d 502, 513 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).  
In sum, where, as here, the Complaint fails to offer “well-pled, particularized allegations 
of fact detailing the precise roles” the Demand Board Directors played, the information that 
came to their attention, “and any indication as to why they would have perceived the 
[complained of] irregularities,” Plaintiffs cannot sustain a claim that such directors face a 
significant risk of liability.  Guttman v. Huang, 823 A.2d 492, 503 (Del. Ch. 2003).
3.
Plaintiffs fail to plead particularized facts demonstrating the Directors’ 
“utter failure” to implement any internal controls. 
Plaintiffs also fail to satisfy Caremark by pleading that the Demand Board Directors 
“utterly failed to implement any reporting or information system or controls.”  Stone, 911 A.2d at 
370.  “The issue [under prong one of Caremark] is not whether JPMorgan’s controls were 
adequate, but whether any existed.”  Steinberg v. Dimon, No. 14 Civ. 688 (PAC), 2014 WL 
3512848, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2014).  The standard “requires only that a reporting system 
exist, not even that it be ‘reasonable.’”  Corp. Risk Holdings LLC v. Rowlands, No. 17-CV-5225 
(RJS), 2018 WL 9517195, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018) (quoting Cent. Laborers’ Pension 
Fund v. Dimon, 638 F. App’x 34, 37–38 (2d Cir. 2016)). “[S]o long as directors ‘try’ to 
implement such system, they discharge their duty to monitor the corporation.”  Kravitz v. 
Tavlarios, No. 19 Civ. 8438 (NRB), 2020 WL 3871340, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2020), aff’d, No. 
20-2579-CV, 2021 WL 5365582 (2d Cir. Nov. 18, 2021).  Indeed, under the first prong of 
Caremark, “plaintiffs usually lose because they must concede the existence of board-level 
systems of monitoring and oversight such as a relevant committee, a regular protocol requiring 
board-level reports about the relevant risks, or the board’s use of third-party monitors, auditors, 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 21 of 32

or consultants.”  Rojas v. Ellison, C.A. No. 2018-0755-AGB, 2019 WL 3408812, at *9 (Del. Ch. 
Jul. 29, 2019) (quoting Marchand v. Barnhill, 212 A.3d 805, 823 (Del. 2019)).
That is the case here.  The Complaint concedes that robust systems do exist at JPMorgan 
to identify suspicious activity.  Compl. ¶ 2.  The Complaint also quotes from internal memoranda 
written by officials in JPMorgan’s risk management, Global Corporate Security, compliance, and 
other unspecified functions, acknowledging that internal reporting processes existed and were 
leveraged by employees.  See Compl. ¶¶ 24, 146, 151, 154.  In addition, the Complaint describes 
the numerous committees of the JPMorgan Board of Directors:  it acknowledges the Bank’s 
Audit and Risk Committees by mentioning directors’ memberships on them, and referencing 
their responsibilities.  See Compl. ¶¶ 33, 37–39, 104, 112, 170.  The existence of these 
committees alone “refutes the assertion that the directors utterly failed to attempt to fulfill their 
oversight obligations,”  Baker, 62 A.3d at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted), and preclude 
any claim by Plaintiffs based on Caremark’s first prong.  
C.
Plaintiffs Fail to Plead Particularized Facts Demonstrating That Any 
Demand Board Director “Lacks Independence.”
The Complaint also does not plead facts sufficient to satisfy the third prong of the 
Zuckerberg test—that “at least half of the members of the Demand Board” “lack[] independence 
from someone who received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct that is the 
subject of the litigation demand or who would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of 
the claims that are the subject of the litigation demand.”  Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d at 1058–59.  
Importantly, “[i]n the demand futility context, directors are presumed to be independent.”  
Teamsters Union 25 Health Servs. & Ins. Plan v. Baiera, 119 A.3d 44, 59 (Del. Ch. 2015) 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  To overcome this presumption, a plaintiff must allege that 
half of the directors “had ties to the person whose proposal or actions he or she is evaluating that 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 22 of 32

are sufficiently substantial that he or she could not objectively discharge his or her fiduciary 
duties.”  Kahn v. M & F Worldwide Corp., 88 A.3d 635, 649 (Del. 2014), overruled on other 
grounds by Flood v. Synutra Int’l, Inc., 195 A.3d 754 (Del. 2018).  
Plaintiffs allege that Bammann and Crown (even if relevant) were not independent from 
CEO Dimon (who purportedly faces a substantial risk of liability), and that Crown separately 
faces a substantial risk of liability because of his unspecified involvement decades ago in the 
New Albany development project, creating a purported conflict for Novakovic.  These arguments 
fail for numerous reasons: 
First, for the reasons stated infra, Dimon and Crown do not face a substantial risk of 
liability and therefore are not conflicted.    
Second, even if Dimon faced a substantial risk of liability, Bammann and Crown do not 
lack independence from Dimon.  Plaintiffs allege Bammann “owes a significant portion of her 
professional success to Dimon” simply because she worked with him at Bank One Corporation 
and then JPMorgan in the early 2000s.  Compl. ¶ 193.  Similarly, Plaintiffs point to Crown’s 
board service for Bank One when Dimon was CEO and his support for Dimon at both Bank One 
and JPMorgan.  Compl. ¶ 194.  Courts routinely hold that merely asserting close personal or 
business relationships is insufficient to plead lack of independence in the demand futility context.  
In re Morgan Stanley Derivative Litig., 542 F. Supp. 2d 317, 326 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); see also 
Beam ex rel. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. v. Stewart, 845 A.2d 1040, 1051–52 (Del. 
2004) (“Mere allegations that [the directors] move in the same business and social circles, or a 
characterization that they are close friends, is not enough to negate independence for demand 
excusal purposes.”); Rahbari v. Oros, 732 F. Supp. 2d 367, 388 n. 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“[M]ere 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 23 of 32

personal or business relationships will not raise a reasonable inference that a director cannot 
consider demand, absent specific factual allegations to support such a conclusion”).
Third, Plaintiffs cannot disqualify Crown as an independent director merely by citing the 
decades-ago New Albany real estate venture in which Crown purportedly was “involved” in 
some unspecified way, and for which Epstein was purportedly brought in to restructure and 
invest.  The Complaint offers no facts explaining Crown’s involvement, whether he even had any 
contact with Epstein, or whether he had any financial entanglements with Epstein—much less 
any connection that is relevant decades later.  Compl. ¶¶ 11, 105.  The mere coincidence that 
both Crown and Epstein (along with many others) were involved in a long-ago real estate project 
certainly cannot create a substantial likelihood of liability for Crown (much less, by extension, 
Novakovic, who allegedly was employed by Crown’s family business). 
IV.
Plaintiffs Have Failed to State a Claim Against Any Defendant.
A.
Legal Standard Under Rule 12(b)(6)
Even if demand futility were pleaded (it is not), to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 
12(b)(6), the Complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim 
to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bel 
Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  
B.
The Complaint Fails to State a Fiduciary Duty Claim Against Any Director 
Defendant 
For the same reasons that Plaintiffs have failed to plead that any Demand Board Director 
faces a substantial risk of liability, see supra Part(III)(B)(1), Plaintiffs have also failed to state a 
claim against any Director Defendant for breach of fiduciary duty.  As elaborated above, because 
JPMorgan’s charter exculpates its directors from liability for breaches of fiduciary duty, except 
those that arise from acts taken in bad faith or from intentional misconduct, JPMorgan’s Director 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 24 of 32

Defendants face no possibility of liability for claims based on negligence, gross negligence, or 
any other conduct short of bad faith.  Instead, Plaintiffs must plead scienter demonstrating bad 
faith.  Bingle, 2022 WL 4102492, at *1.  Further, as noted above, the Caremark claims asserted 
here are “possibly the most difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope 
to win a judgment” and are routinely dismissed.  Caremark, 698 A.2d at 967.   
The Complaint does not even attempt to plead the bad faith conduct of the Director 
Defendants Crown, Burke, Flynn, Hobson, Combs and Novakovic.  As addressed above, breach 
of a fiduciary duty under a Caremark oversight theory cannot be satisfied merely by offering 
conclusory allegations that directors were aware (or should have been aware) of wrongful 
conduct.  Here, there are simply no particularized allegations that any Director Defendant knew 
of Epstein’s conduct, knew of Epstein’s status as a client at the Bank, failed in any manner to 
respond to red flags regarding Epstein or JPMorgan’s SAR or other BSA/AML compliance 
policies or practices, or otherwise failed in any way in executing their oversight duties (indeed, 
Defendants Combs, Hobson, and Novakovic were not even on the Board when Epstein was a 
client at the Bank).  See supra pp. 11–12.11  
As to Kessler, a corporate lawyer who was a director of JPMorgan from 1995–2007, 
Plaintiffs allege that Kessler associated with Wexner, including in the New Albany real estate 
venture, on which Epstein supposedly also worked and invested.  Compl. ¶¶ 11–14, 34, 87–93, 
194.  Even crediting these conclusory allegations, they amount to nothing more than a thin thread 
Plaintiffs half-hearted attempts at alleging knowledge of Epstein’s crimes by the Director 
Defendants are not only generalized but also patently speculative.  See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 5 
(speculating that JPM executives who were aware of Epstein-related issues “presumably” 
attended Board meetings); id. (opining that Board members, by virtue of intelligence and 
business acumen, “very likely were aware” of Epstein’s misconduct).  This rank speculation is 
plainly inadequate.
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 25 of 32

tying Kessler to Epstein through a common business partner and venture—entirely disconnected 
from Epstein’s JPMorgan accounts or the activities at issue in Doe and USVI.  These allegations 
certainly do not plead that Kessler “knew of evidence of corporate misconduct… yet acted in bad 
faith by consciously disregarding [his] duty to address [it].” Pettry, 2021 WL 2644475, at *7.  
C.
The Complaint Fails to State a Fiduciary Duty Claim Against Mr. Dimon
The Court also should dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim that Mr. Dimon breached his fiduciary 
duties for failure to meet the “most difficult theory” imposed under Caremark.  
The Complaint principally alleges that Mr. Dimon breached his duty of loyalty, under 
Caremark, by allegedly failing to oversee risks arising from Epstein’s banking activities.  See 
Compl. ¶ 212.  Caremark claims have historically concerned directors; Delaware law only very 
recently extended them to officers.  In re McDonald’s Corp. S’holder Derivative Litig., 289 A.3d 
343, 358 (Del. Ch. 2023).  In McDonald’s, the Court declined to dismiss a Caremark claim 
against the Global Chief People Officer of McDonalds because he ignored 18 particularly 
pleaded red flags indicating the executive’s plain and obvious awareness that the company was 
violating law prohibiting sexual harassment.  Id. at 359.  The red flags included, for example: (i) 
complaints about the conduct of executives; (ii) two instances in which a dozen employees 
complained to the EEOC about sexual harassment and misconduct; (iii) a company walkout 
across thirty cities to protest sexual harassment; (iv) the defendant officer’s personal engagement 
in sexual harassment witnessed by 30 employees, leading to discipline by the audit committee; 
(v) letters from U.S. Senators probing sexual harassment; and (vi) receiving specific information 
that the CEO was engaged in a prohibited relationship with an employee.  Id. at 378.  Thus, the 
court drew a pleadings stage inference that the defendant consciously and in bad faith ignored 
red flags that the company engaged in sexual harassment and misconduct.  Id. at 379.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 26 of 32

Here, Plaintiffs seek to pursue a red flag theory of liability against Mr. Dimon.  See 
Compl. ¶ 212.12  But in stark contrast to McDonald’s, the allegations relating to Mr. Dimon are 
largely fantastical, unrelated to any knowledge of Epstein, much less Epstein’s criminal 
activities, and thus come nowhere close to stating a claim.  Unlike the allegations in 
McDonald’s, there are no allegations of the widespread, obvious awareness generated by things 
like public walkouts across the nation, letters from U.S. Senators, or dozens of complaints to 
U.S. agencies.  Fatally, the Complaint fails to allege that Mr. Dimon had any actual role in the 
decision to retain Mr. Epstein as a client or any role in SARs filings, BSA/AML compliance, or 
reporting of potential wrongdoing to law enforcement.  Likewise, the Complaint fails to allege 
with specificity that Mr. Dimon was aware of any red flags concerning Epstein’s criminal 
activities, much less that he personally engaged in the purported red flag behavior like the officer 
in McDonald’s.  This is fatal because, under McDonald’s, to establish breach of the duty of 
oversight, plaintiffs must establish that the officer was in fact responsible for receiving and 
addressing the supposed red flags.  See In re McDonald’s, 289 A.3d at 350.
Plaintiffs cannot salvage a claim by offering mere speculation based on a single 
document that neither is addressed to nor copied Mr. Dimon, referring to a potential “Dimon 
review.”  Compl. ¶¶ 19, 136.  The Complaint does not identify the employee who sent the email 
or explain the nature of the supposed “review.”  Further, the Complaint conspicuously fails to 
allege that the review occurred.13  This is no doubt because Plaintiffs have no ground to believe 
The Complaint does not assert officer liability under Caremark prong one (i.e., failure to set 
up monitoring).  Nor could it, since the Complaint instead takes the tack of asserting 
(unsuccessfully) that information about Epstein’s activities was available.
See Compl. ¶ 19 (“Whether Staley blocked the expected ‘Dimon review’ or someone with 
authority (such as Dimon or a Board member) provided informal and tacit support to Epstein and 
thus obviated the formal “Dimon review” process, Epstein remained with JPM.”), id. ¶ 136 
(“The fact that Epstein’s account status was expected to be presented to Dimon suggests either 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 27 of 32

that the review occurred.  And, even if such a review did occur (which the Complaint does not 
allege), the Complaint fails to plead what information was made available to Mr. Dimon or what 
decision he even purportedly made.  
None of the Complaint’s other allegations are sufficient either.  The long and winding 
story of Mr. Epstein’s supposed connections to members of the Columbus business community 
and the utterly unrelated support for Mr. Dimon from the Columbus business community is pure 
innuendo.  The Complaint nowhere alleges that any of Mr. Dimon’s Columbus business contacts 
introduced Mr. Epstein to Mr. Dimon, much less alerted Mr. Dimon about Mr. Epstein’s sexual 
crimes or raised any concern to Mr. Dimon about JPMorgan’s due diligence or compliance 
efforts with respect to Mr. Epstein’s accounts.  The Complaint similarly does not allege that Mr. 
Dimon was aware that Mr. Epstein was involved in the meetings Mr. Staley purportedly 
attempted to schedule on Mr. Dimon’s behalf, that those meetings occurred, or that, even if the 
meetings occurred, Mr. Dimon would have learned anything about Mr. Epstein’s criminality or 
JPMorgan’s compliance efforts through said meetings.  
Finally, separate from and in addition to all the failings already pointed out, none of these 
allegations come close to establishing any basis for inferring that Mr. Dimon acted in conscious 
bad faith—an absolute prerequisite to Plaintiffs’ claim under Delaware law.  See Horman v. 
Abney, No. CV 12290-VCS, 2017 WL 242571, at *9 (Del. Ch. Jan. 19, 2017) (even if reporting 
systems did not prevent corporate wrongdoing, no oversight claim without bad faith).  At 
bottom, the Complaint against Mr. Dimon seeks impermissibly to articulate a res ipsa loquitur 
theory—Mr. Epstein engaged in abhorrent conduct, the Bank allegedly failed to comply with 
that it was (as per known internal protocols) or that the matter was resolved in favor of keeping 
Epstein without forcing Dimon to leave a paper trail of his involvement in the matter.”).
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 28 of 32

BSA/AML requirements with respect to Epstein’s accounts or timely close those accounts, Mr. 
Dimon was the Chairman of the Board and CEO, so he must be responsible.  But such theories 
are insufficient:  “Delaware courts routinely reject the conclusory allegation that because illegal 
behavior occurred, internal controls must have been deficient, and [defendants] must have known 
so.”  Genworth Fin., Inc. Consol. Derivative Litig., No. CV 11901-VCS, 2021 WL 4452338, at 
*13 (Del. Ch. Sept. 29, 2021).  
To the extent the Complaint purports to assert that Mr. Dimon breached his duty of care, 
see, e.g., Compl. ¶ 209, the Court should also dismiss that claim.  “The fiduciary duty of care 
requires that officers and directors both: (1) use that amount of care which ordinarily careful and 
prudent men would use in similar circumstances; and (2) make business decisions by 
consider[ing] all material information reasonably available.”  In re: Old Bpsush, Inc., No. 16-
12373 (BLS), 2021 WL 4453595, at *8 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2021) (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  A breach of the duty of care requires a showing of “gross negligence.”  Id.  Plaintiffs 
must “plausibly show[]” that the Mr. Dimon was “recklessly uninformed or acted outside of the 
bounds of reason.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  
The Complaint does not plausibly show that Mr. Dimon acted with “gross negligence” 
for the same reasons that it fails to allege he acted in bad faith, that he had knowledge that the 
Company allegedly was not complying with BSA/AML requirements with respect to Epstein’s 
accounts, or that he even had any role in BSA/AML compliance relating to Epstein’s accounts.  
Instead, the allegations are purely conclusory.  See, e.g., Harcum v. Lovoi, C.A. No. 2020-0398-
PAF, 2022 WL 29695, at *26-27 (Del. Ch. Jan. 3, 2022) (dismissing duty of care claims where 
allegations as to officers’ conduct were conclusory); City of Warren Gen. Emps.’ Ret. Sys. v. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 29 of 32

Roche, 2020 WL 7023896, at *19 (Del. Ch. Nov. 30, 2020) (dismissing duty of care claim where 
complaint did not allege that officers were involved in allegedly misleading proxy).  
D.
The Complaint Fails to State a Claim for Unjust Enrichment
Finally, Plaintiffs have also failed to state a claim against any Defendant for unjust 
enrichment.  Under Delaware law, a claim of unjust enrichment requires showing “(1) an 
enrichment, (2) an impoverishment, (3) a relation between the enrichment and impoverishment, 
(4) the absence of justification and (5) the absence of a remedy provided by law.”  Cantor 
Fitzgerald, L.P. v. Cantor, 724 A.2d 571, 585 (Del. Ch. 1998).  
Plaintiffs’ claim fails at the outset, as the Complaint does not contain well-pleaded facts 
suggesting that a single Defendant was enriched beyond their ordinary compensation.  See 
Compl. ¶ 217; In re Pfizer Inc. S’holder Derivative Litig., 722 F. Supp. 2d 453, 465-66 
(S.D.N.Y. 2010) (applying Delaware law and denying claims for unjust enrichment absent 
support for the proposition “that the mere retention of directors’ and officers’ ordinary 
compensation can sustain an unjust enrichment claim predicated on allegations that these 
defendants breached their fiduciary duties”).  Plaintiffs also make no allegation that they were 
“impoverished” by the Defendants’ ordinary compensation, and therefore cannot satisfy any of 
the remaining elements of the five-part test under Cantor.
Plaintiffs’ claim for unjust enrichment also fails because it is premised solely on 
Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claim—which itself is deficient for the reasons stated above.  
See supra Section IV.B–C.  Under Delaware law, “[a]t the pleadings stage, an unjust enrichment 
claim that is entirely duplicative of a breach of fiduciary duty claim . . . is frequently treated in 
the same manner when resolving a motion to dismiss.”  Caspian Select Credit Master Fund Ltd. 
v. Gohl, No. CV 10244-VCN, 2015 WL 5718592, at *16 (Del. Ch. Sep. 28, 2015) (quoting 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 25     Filed 07/06/23     Page 30 of 32

Calma ex rel. Citrix Sys., Inc. v. Templeton, 114 A.3d 563, 591 (Del. Ch. 2015)).  Here, the 
unjust enrichment claim is explicitly predicated on Defendants’ alleged breaches of fiduciary 
duties.  Compl. ¶¶ 217, 219 (alleging Defendants should not retain the unspecified benefits they 
allegedly received “only by virtue of breaching their fiduciary duties”).  Defendants’ alleged 
unjust enrichment is therefore “not separate or distinct from the alleged breach of fiduciary duty, 
except as to the existence of such a duty.”  Manbro Energy Corp. v. Chatterjee Advisors, LLC, 
No. 20 CIV. 3773 (LGS), 2021 WL 2037552, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2021) (applying 
Delaware law).  
Accordingly, the unjust enrichment claim should be dismissed both because no actual 
enrichment is alleged, and because it is duplicative of the defective fiduciary duty claim. 
V.
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.14
Dated: July 6, 2023
Any dismissal should be with prejudice, as Plaintiffs have already filed two prior complaints 
prior to the operative complaint.  Certainly Plaintiffs should not be permitted to amend to add 
allegations that were already public when the Complaint was filed – particularly given that the 
claims are based on allegations brought in two related cases pending before the Court, Jane Doe 
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10019 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y. 2022), and U.S. Virgin Island v. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 23-cv-10904 (S.D.N.Y. 2023), and significant Epstein-related 
materials have been released into the public domain from these cases and other sources.

Re: 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. - Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
Dear Messrs. Savarese, DiPrima, Kleinhaus, and Peikin: 
Pursuant to our discussions and written exchanges, the Office of the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of New York (the "Office") and defendant JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan" or the "Bank"), under authority granted by its Board of Directors in the 
form of a Board Resolution (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A), hereby enter into 
this Deferred Prosecution.Agreement (the "Agreement"). 
The Criminal Information 
1. 
JPMorgan consents to the filing of a two~count Information (the 
"Information") in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the 
"Court"), charging JPMorgan with failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering 
program, in violation of Title 3 I, United States Code, Sections 5318(h) and 5322(a) and Title 12, 
Code of Federal Regulations, Section 21.21, and failure to file a suspicious activity report, in 
violation of Title 3 I, United States Code, Sections 53 I 8(g) and 5322(a) and Title I 2, Code of 
Federal Regulations, Section 21.11. A copy of the Information is attached hereto as Exhibit B. 
This Agreement shall take effect upon its execution by both parties. 
Acceptance of Responsibility 
2. 
JPMorgan admits and stipulates that the facts set forth in the Statement of 
Facts, attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated herein, are true and accurate.

Stephen R. DiPrima, Esq.

Steven R. Peikin, Esq. 
January 6, 2014 
Payments and Forfeiture Obligation 
3. 
As a result of the conduct described in the Information and the Statement 
of Facts, JPMorgan agrees to make a payment in the amount of $1,700,000,000 (the "Stipulated 
Forfeiture Amount") to the United States, pursuant to this Agreement. 
4. 
JPMorgan agrees that this Agreement, the Information, and the Statement 
of Facts may be attached and incorporated into a civil forfeiture complaint (the "Civil Forfeiture 
Complaint"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit D, that will be filed against the 
Stipulated Forfeiture Amount. By this Agreement, JPMorgan expressly waives service of that 
Civil Forfeiture Complaint and agrees that a Final Order of Forfeiture may be entered against the 
Stipulated Forfeiture Amount. 
5. 
JPMorgan shall transfer $1,700,000,000 to the United States within three 
business days after executing this Agreement ( or as otherwise directed by the Office following 
such period). Such payment shall be made by wire transfer to the United States Marshals 
Service, pursuant to wire instructions provided by the Office. If JPMorgan fails to timely make 
the payment required under this paragraph, interest (at the rate specified in 28 U.S.C. § 1961) 
shall accrue on the unpaid balance through the date of payment, unless the Office, in its sole 
discretion, chooses to reinstate prosecution pursuant to Paragraphs 14 and 15, below. 
6. 
Upon Court approval of this Agreement, JPMorgan shall release any and 
all claims it may have to the Stipulated Forfeiture Amount and execute such documents as 
necessary to accomplish the forfeiture of the funds. JPMorgan agrees that it will not file a claim 
with the Court or otherwise contest the civil forfeiture of the Stipulated Forfeiture Amount and 
will not assist a third party in asserting any claim to the Stipulated Forfeiture Amount. The 
Government intends to distribute the Stipulated Forfeiture Amount to victims of the fraud at 
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC and its predecessor, Bernard L. Madoff 
Investment Securities (collectively, "Madoff Securities"), consistent with the applicable 
Department of Justice regulations, through the ongoing remission process. See 21 U .S.C. § 
853(i)(l) and 28 C.F.R. Part 9. 
7. 
JPMorgan agrees that the Stipulated Forfeiture Amount shall be treated as 
a penalty paid to the United States government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. 
JPMorgan agrees that it will not claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction or tax credit with 
regard to any federal, state, local or foreign tax for any portion of the $1,700,000,000 that 
JPMorgan has agreed to pay to the United States pursuant to this Agreement. 
Obligation to Cooperate 
8. 
JPMorgan agrees to cooperate fully with the Office, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and any other governmental agency designated by the Office regarding 
any matter relating to the conduct described in the Information or Statement of Facts, or any 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 4 of 50

matter relating to the fraud committed at Madoff Securities (collectively, the "Office's 
Investigation"). 
9. 
It is understood that during the term of this Agreement, and consistent 
with its obligations under law, including relevant data protection, bank secrecy, or other 
confidentiality laws, JPMorgan shall, with respect to the Office's Investigation: (a) truthfully and 
completely disclose all information with respect to the activities of the Bank and its officers, 
agents, affiliates, and employees concerning all matters about which the Office inquires of it, 
which information can be used for any purpose; (b) cooperate fully with the Office, the FBI and 
any other governmental agency designated by the Office; ( c) attend all meetings at which the 
Office requests its presence and use its reasonable best efforts to secure the attendance and 
truthful statements or testimony of any past or current officers, agents, or employees at any 
meeting or interview or before the grand jury or at trial or at any other court proceeding; (d) 
provide to the Office upon request any document, record, or other tangible evidence relating to 
matters about which the Office or any designated law enforcement agency inquires of it; ( e) 
assemble, organize, and provide in a responsive and prompt fashion, and upon request, on an 
expedited schedule, all documents, records, information and other evidence in JPMorgan' s 
possession, custody or control as may be requested by the Office, the FBI, or designated 
governmental agency; (f) provide to the Office any information and documents that come to 
JPMorgan's attention that may be relevant to the Office's Investigation, as specified by the 
Office; (g) provide testimony or information necessary to identify or establish the original 
location, authenticity, or other basis for admission into evidence of documents or physical 
evidence in any criminal or other proceeding as requested by the Office, the FBI, or designated 
governmental agency, including but not limited to information and testimony concerning the 
conduct set forth in the Information and Statement of Facts. Nothing in this Agreement shall be 
construed to require JPMorgan to provide any information, documents, or testimony protected by 
the attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, or other applicable privileges. 
I 0. 
It is understood that, during the tenn of this Agreement, JPMorgan shall: 
(a) bring to the Office's attention all criminal conduct by JPMorgan or any of its employees 
acting within the scope of their employment related to violations of the federal laws of the 
United States, as to which JPMorgan's Board of Directors, senior management, or United States 
legal and compliance personnel are aware; (b) bring to the Office's attention any administrative, 
regulatory, civil, or criminal proceeding or investigation of JPMorgan relating to the Bank 
Secrecy Act ("BSA"); and (c) commit no crimes under the federal laws of the United States 
subsequent to the execution of this Agreement. 
11. 
JPMorgan agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, which 
shall commence upon the signing of this Agreement, will continue for two years from the date of 
the Court's acceptance of this Agreement, unless otherwise extended pursuant to Paragraph 16 
below. 
JPMorgan's obligation to cooperate is not intended to apply in the event that a 
prosecution against JPMorgan by this Office is pursued and not deferred.

Deferral of Prosecution 
12. 
In consideration of JPMorgan's entry into this Agreement and its 
commitment to: (a) accept and acknowledge responsibility for its conduct, as described in the 
Statement of Facts and the Information; (b) cooperate with the Office and the FBI; (c) make the 
payment specified in this Agreement; ( d) comply with the federal criminal laws of the United 
States (as provided herein in Paragraph 10); and (e) otherwise comply with all of the terms of 
this Agreement, the Office shall recommend to the Court that prosecution of JPMorgan on the 
Information be deferred for two years from the date of the signing of this Agreement. JPMorgan 
shall expressly waive indictment and all rights to a speedy trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment 
of the United States Constitution, Title 18, United States Code, Section 3161, Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 48(b ), and any applicable Local Rules of the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of New York for the period during which this Agreement is in effect. 
13. 
It is understood that this Office cannot, and does not, make any promises 
or commitments with respect to the prosecution of JPMorgan for criminal tax violations. 
However, if JPMorgan fully complies with the understandings specified in this Agreement, no 
testimony given or other information provided by JPMorgan ( or any other information directly or 
indirectly derived therefrom) will be used against JPMorgan in any criminal tax prosecution. In 
addition, the Office agrees that, if JPMorgan is in compliance with all of its obligations under 
this Agreement, the Office will, at the expiration of the period of deferral (including any 
extensions thereof), seek dismissal with prejudice of the Information filed against JPMorgan 
pursuant to this Agreement. Except in the event of a violation by JPMorgan of any term of this 
Agreement or as otherwise provided in Paragraph 14, the Office will bring no additional charges 
or other civil action against JPMorgan, except for criminal tax violations, relating to its conduct 
as described in the admitted Statement of Facts. This Agreement does not provide any protection 
against prosecution for any crimes except as set forth above and does not apply to any individual 
or entity other than JPMorgan and its affiliated entities. JPMorgan and the Office understand 
that the Agreement to defer prosecution of JPMorgan must be approved by the Court, in 
accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(2). Should the Court decline to approve the Agreement to 
defer prosecution for any reason: (a) both the Office and JPMorgan are released from any 
obligation imposed upon them by this Agreement; (b) this Agreement shall be null and void, 
except for the tolling provision set forth in Paragraph 14, below; and (c) if it has already been 
transferred to the United States pursuant to Paragraph 5, above, the Stipulated Forfeiture Amount 
shall be returned to JPMorgan. 
14. 
It is understood that should the Office in its sole discretion determine that 
JPMorgan: (a) has knowingly given false, incomplete or misleading information either during the 
term of this Agreement or in connection with the Office's investigation of the conduct described 
in the Information or Statement of Facts; (b) committed any crime under the federal laws of the 
United States subsequent to the execution of this Agreement; or (c) otherwise violated any 
provision of this Agreement, JPMorgan shall, in the Office's sole discretion, thereafter be subject 
to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, or suit for any civil cause of action, of which

January 6, 2014 
the Office has knowledge, including but not limited to a prosecution or civil action based on the 
Information, the Statement of Facts, the conduct described therein, or perjury and obstruction of 
justice. Any such prosecution or civil action may be premised on any information provided by or 
on behalf of JPMorgan to the Office, the FBI, or the United States Department of the Treasury, 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") at any time, with the exception of any 
information provided solely to the OCC and/or other regulators pursuant to Title 12, United 
States Code, Section 1828(x). In any prosecution or civil action based on the Information, the 
Statement of Facts, or the conduct described therein, it is understood that: (a) no charge would be 
time-barred provided that such prosecution is brought within the applicable statute of limitations 
period ( subject to any prior tolling agreements between the Office and JPMorgan), and excluding 
the period from the execution of this Agreement until its termination; and (b) JPMorgan agrees 
to toll, and exclude from any calculation of time, the running of the statute of limitations for the 
length of this Agreement starting from the date of the execution of this Agreement and including 
any extension of the period of deferral of prosecution pursuant to Paragraph 16 below. By this 
Agreement, JPMorgan expressly intends to and hereby does waive its rights in the foregoing 
respects, including any right to make a claim premised on the statute of limitations, as well as 
any constitutional, statutory, or other claim concerning pre-indictment delay. Such waivers are 
knowing, voluntary, and in express reliance on the advice of JPMorgan's counsel. 
15. 
It is further agreed that in the event that the Office, in its sole discretion, 
determines that JPMorgan has violated any provision of this Agreement, including JPMorgan's 
failure to meet its obligations under this Agreement: (a) all statements made or acknowledged by 
or on behalf of JPMorgan to the Office and the FBI or the OCC, including but not limited to the 
Statement of Facts, or any testimony given by JPMorgan or by any agent of JPMorgan before a 
grand jury, or other tribunal, whether before or after the date of this Agreement, or any leads 
from such statements or testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal 
proceedings hereinafter brought by the Office against JPMorgan; and (b) JPMorgan shall not 
assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11 (f) of the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule, that 
such statements made by or on behalf of JPMorgan before or after the date of this Agreement, or 
any leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or otherwise excluded from evidence. It is the 
intent of this Agreement to waive any and all rights in the foregoing respects, provided, however, 
that this Paragraph shall not apply to any information provided solely to the OCC and/or other 
regulators pursuant to Title 12, United States Code, Section 1828(x). 
16. 
JPMorgan agrees that, in the event that the Office determines during the 
period of deferral of prosecution described in Paragraph 12 above ( or any extensions thereof) 
that JPMorgan has violated any provision of this Agreement, an extension of the period of 
deferral of prosecution may be imposed in the sole discretion of the Office, up to an additional 
one year, but in no event shall the total term of the deferral-of-prosecution period of this 
Agreement exceed three (3) years.

17. 
JPMorgan, having truthfully admitted to the facts in the Statement of 
Facts, agrees that it shall not, through its attorneys, agents, or employees, make any statement, in 
litigation or otherwise, contradicting the Statement of Facts or its representations in this 
Agreement. 
Consistent with this provision, JPMorgan may raise defenses and/or assert 
affirmative claims in any civil proceedings brought by private parties as long as doing so does 
not contradict the Statement of Facts or such representations. Any such contradictory statement 
by JPMorgan, its present or future attorneys, agents, or employees shall constitute a violation of 
this Agreement and JPMorgan thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as specified in 
Paragraphs 14 through 15, above, or the deferral-of-prosecution period shall be extended 
pursuant to Paragraph 16, above. The decision as to whether any such contradictory statement 
will be imputed to JPMorgan for the purpose of determining whether JPMorgan has violated this 
Agreement shall be within the sole discretion of the Office. 
Upon the Office's notifying 
JPMorgan of any such contradictory statement, JPMorgan may avoid a finding of violation of 
this Agreement by repudiating such statement both to the recipient of such statement and to the 
Office within forty-eight ( 48) hours after receipt of notice by the Office. JPMorgan consents to 
the public release by the Office, in its sole discretion, of any such repudiation. Nothing in this 
Agreement is meant to affect the obligation of JPMorgan or its officers, directors or employees 
to testify truthfully in any judicial proceeding. 
18. 
JPMorgan agrees that it is within the Office's sole discretion to choose, in 
the event of a violation, the remedies contained in Paragraphs 14 and 15, above, or instead to 
choose to extend the period of deferral of prosecution pursuant to Paragraph 16, provided, 
however, that if JPMorgan's violation of this Agreement is limited to an untimely payment of the 
Stipulated Forfeiture Amount, the Office may elect instead to choose the additional financial 
penalties set forth in Paragraph 5, above. JPMorgan understands and agrees that the exercise of 
the Office's discretion under this Agreement is unreviewable by any court. Should the Office 
determine that JPMorgan has violated this Agreement, the Office shall provide notice to 
JPMorgan of that determination prior to exercising any of those remedies and provide JPMorgan 
with an opportunity to make a presentation to the Office to demonstrate that no violation 
occurred, or, to the extent applicable, that the violation should not result in the exercise of any of 
those remedies, including because the violation has been cured by JPMorgan. 
JPMorgan's BSA/AML Compliance Program 
19. 
JPMorgan shall continue its ongoing effort to implement and maintain an 
effective BSA/ AML compliance program in accordance with the requirements of the BSA and 
the directives and orders of any United States regulator of JPMorgan or its affiliates, including 
without limitation the OCC and Federal Reserve Board, as set forth in their respective Consent 
Cease and Desist Orders, dated January 14, 2013 ("Consent Orders"). The Office acknowledges 
that, pursuant to the Consent Orders, JPMorgan has implemented and is continuing to implement 
significant remedial changes to its BSA/ AML compliance program, prior to the entry of this 
Agreement. It is understood that a violation of the BSA or the Consent Orders arising from 
conduct occurring prior to the date of execution of this Agreement, including with respect to any 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 8 of 50
John F. Savarese, Esq. 
Stephen R. Di Prima, Esq. 
Emil A. Kleinhans, Esq. 
Steven R. Peikin, Esq. 
January 6, 2014 
SAR-filing obligation, will not constitute a breach of JPMorgan's obligations pursuant to this 
Agreement. However, there shall be no limitation on the ability of the Office to investigate or 
prosecute such violations and/or conduct in accordance with the applicable law and the other 
terms of this Agreement, including Paragraph 13 hereof. 
Review of JPMorgan's BSA/AML Compliance Program 
20. 
For the duration of the Agreement, JPMorgan shall provide the Office 
with quarterly reports ("Quarterly Reports") describing the status of JPMorgan's implementation 
of the remedial changes to its BSA/ AML compliance program required by the Consent Orders. 
The Quarterly Reports shall identify any violations of the BSA that have come to the attention of 
JPMorgan's United States legal and compliance personnel during this reporting period. 
21. 
For the duration of the Agreement, the Office, as it deems necessary and 
upon request to JPMorgan, shall: (a) be provided by JPMorgan with access to any and all non-
privileged books, records, accounts, correspondence, files, and any and all other documents or 
electronic records, including e-mails, of JPMorgan and its representatives, agents, affiliates, and 
employees, relating to any matters described or identified in the Quarterly Reports; and (b) have 
the right to interview any officer, employee, agent, consultant, or representative of JPMorgan 
concerning any non-privileged matter described or identified in the Quarterly Reports. 
22. 
It is understood that JPMorgan shall promptly notify the Office of (a) any 
deficiencies, failings, or matters requiring attention with respect to JPMorgan's BSA/AML 
compliance program identified by any United States regulatory authority within 10 business days

INFORMATION 
Cr. 
COUNT ONE 
(Violation of the Bank Secrecy Act: 
Failure to Maintain an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Program) 
The United States Attorney charges: 
Background 
I. 
At all times relevant to this Information, Bernard L. Mado:ff Investment Securities 
LLC, and its predecessor, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (collectively and separately, 
"Madoff Securities"), had its principal place of business in New York, New York. Madoff 
Securities operated three principal lines of business: market making, proprietary trading, and 
• investment advisory. Madoff Securities was registered with the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission ("SEC") as a broker-dealer since in or about 1960 and as an investment 
adviser since in or about August 2006. Bernard L. Madoff ("Madoff") was the founder of 
Madoff Securities and its sole owner. 
2. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMC" or the "Banlc") is a financial holding company 
incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, with its principal place of business in New York, New 
York. JPMC operates four lines of business, including the Corporate and Investment Bank, 
Asset Management, Commercial Banking, and Consumer and Community Banking. 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 15 of 50
3. 
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., the defendant, was at all relevant times the 
principal banking subsidiary of JPMC. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., provides banking 
services throughout the United States, and is subject to oversight and regulation by the United 
States Department of the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"). 
The Bank Secrecy Act 
4. 
The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly 
known as the Bank Secrecy Act, or "BSA"), 31 lJ.S.C. § 5311, et seq., and its implementing 
regulations require domestic banks and certain other financial institutions to establish and 
maintain programs designed to detect and report suspicious activity, and to maintain certain 
related records "where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory 
investigations or proceedings." 31 U.S.C. § 5311. 
5. 
Among other things, the BSA requires that financial institutions "maintain 
appropriate procedures to ensure compliance with [the BSA] and regulations prescribed under 
[the BSA] or to guard against money laundering." 31 U.S.C. § 5318(a)(2). Pursuant to 31 
lJ.S.C. § 53 !8(h)(l) and 12 C.F.R. § 21.21, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., the defendant, 
was required to establish and maintain an anti-money laundering ("AML") compliance program 
that, at a minimum: 
a. provided internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to guard against 
money laundering; 
b. provided for a compliance officer to coordinate and monitor day-to-day 
compliance with the BSA and AML requirements; 
c. provided for an ongoing employee training program; and 
d. provided for independent testing for compliance conducted by bank personnel 
or an outside party. 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 16 of 50
6. 
In addition, the BSA requires financial institutions to "report any suspicious 
transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation." 31 U.S.C. § 5318(g)(l ). 
Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 5318(g) and 12 C.F .R. § 21.11, a financial institution is required to file a 
Suspicious Activity Report ("SAR") when it "knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect" that a 
transaction, among other things, involves funds derived from illegal activities or has no apparent 
business or lawful purpose. 
The Madoff Securities Ponzi Scheme 
7. 
For more than three decades, the Madoff Securities investment advisory business was 
a massive, multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme. From at least as early as the 1970s through 
Madoff's arrest on December 11, 2008, Madoff and his co-conspirators fraudulently promised 
investors in Madoff Securities that their money would be invested in stocks, options, and other 
securities of well-known corporations. Contrary to these representations, investor money was in 
fact virtually never invested as promised. Instead, the Madoff Securities investment advisory 
business operated as a massive Ponzi scheme in which some investors were paid with money 
"invested" by different investors, and other proceeds were used to personally benefit Madoff and 
the people around him. At the time of its collapse in December 2008, Madoff Securities 
maintained more than 4,000 investment advisory client accounts, which purported to have a 
combined balance of approximately $65 billion. In fact, Madoff Securities had only 
approximately $300 million in assets at the time. 
8. 
From in or about October 1986 through Madoff's arrest on December 11, 2008, 
the Madoff Ponzi scheme was conducted almost exclusively through a demand deposit account 
and other linked cash and brokerage accounts held at JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., the 
defendant ( collectively, the "703 Account"). During that time period, virtually all client 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 17 of 50
investments were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at JPMORGAN CHASE 
BANK, N.A., and virtually all client "redemptions" were paid from a linked disbursement 
account, also held by Madoff Securities at JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N .A. 
October 2008: JPMC's Suspicions That Madoff"s Returns Were Too Good To Be True 
9. 
Since 2006, the Bank's London-based Equity Exotics Desk, which specialized in 
creating complex derivatives based on the perfonnance of certain investment funds, had issued 
structured products linked to the returns of "feeder" funds that were invested in Madoff 
Securities. As a hedge for its issuance of these derivative products, JPMC made certain 
proprietary investments tied to the returns ofMadoffSecurities. On October 16, 2008, an analyst 
on the Equity Exotics Desk, wrote a lengthy e-mail to the head of the desk and others about 
MadoffSecurities (the "October 16 Memo"). The October 16 Memo, among other things, 
described JPMC's inability to validate Madoffs trading activity or even custody of assets; 
questioned Madoff s "odd choice" of a small, unknown accounting firm; and reported that JPMC 
"seem[ed] to be relying on Madoffs integrity" with little to verify that such reliance was well-
placed. The October 16 Memo ended with the observation that: "[t]here are various elements in 
the story that could make us nervous," including the "feeder" funds managers' "apparent fear of 
Madoff, where no one dares to ask any serious questions as long as the performance is good." 
I 0. 
On or about October 29, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., the 
defendant, filed a report with the United Kingdom Serious Organised Crime Agency ("SOCA") 
pursuant to the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act. In that report, which identified Madoff Securities 
as its "Main Subject- Suspect," JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., reported that, among other 
things, "the investment performance achieved by [ the Mad off Securities] funds ... is so 
consistently and significantly ahead of its peers year-on-year, even in the prevailing market 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 18 of 50
conditions, as to appear too good to be true - meaning that it probably is." JPMORGAN 
CHASE BANK, N .A., reported that, "[ a ]s a result," it had submitted redemption requests for 
more than $300 million of its own funds, which were invested in Madoff Securities "feeder" 
funds. 
11. 
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., the defendant, failed to file a SAR in the 
United States concerning MadoffSecurities or Madoff. The concerns raised in the October 16 
Memo were never communicated to anti-money laundering compliance personnel in the United 
States, and there was no meaningful effort by the Bank to examine or investigate the Madoff 
Securities banking relationship with JPMC, including the transaction activity in the 703 Account. 
12. 
Prior to Madoffs arrest on December 11, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, 
N.A., the defendant, lacked effective policies, procedures, or controls designed to reasonably 
ensure that information - such as the information culminating in the October 2008 report to 
SOCA - obtained in the course of JPMC 's other lines of business, was communicated to anti-
money laundering compliance personnel based in the United States. In addition, JPMORGAN 
CHASE BANK, N.A., lacked effective policies, procedures, or controls designed to reasonably 
ensure that information about United States-based clients, obtained by JPMC in its business 
abroad, was communicated to anti-money laundering compliance personnel based in the United 
States. These systemic deficiencies reflected a failure to maintain adequate policies, procedures, 
and controls to ensure compliance with the BSA and regulations prescribed thereunder and to 
guard against money laundering.

Statutory Allegation 
13. 
In or about 2008, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, 
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., the defendant, did willfully fail to establish an adequate 
anti-money laundering program, including, at a minimum, (a) the development of internal 
policies, procedures, and controls designed to guard against money laundering; (b) the 
designation of a compliance officer to coordinate and monitor day-to-day compliance with the 
Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements; ( c) the establishment of an ongoing 
employee training program; and ( d) the implementation of independent testing for compliance 
conducted by bank persom1el or an outside party, to wit, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., 
failed to enact adequate policies, procedures, and controls to ensure that information about the 
Bank's clients obtained through activities in and concerning JPMC's other lines of business was 
shared with compliance and anti-money laundering personnel, and to ensure that information 
about the Bank's clients obtained outside the United States was shared with United States 
compliance and anti-money laundering personnel.

ST A TEMENT OF FACTS 
The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the Deferred 
Prosecution Agreement (the "Agreement") between the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York ("USAO") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a subsidiary of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, "JPMC" refers 
collectively to JPMorgan Chase & Co., its subsidiaries, and their predecessors in interest. The 
parties agree and stipulate that the following information is true and accurate: 
Bank Structure 
1. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co., a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law 
in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and the largest banking institution in 
the United States. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s principal bank subsidiary is JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A., which provides banking services throughout the United States and is 
regulated chiefly by the United States Department of Treasury, Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency (the "OCC"). 
2. 
JPMC operates four lines of business: the Corporate and Investment Bank, Asset 
Management, Commercial Banking, and Consumer & Community Banking. The 
Corporate and Investment Bank offers global investment banking services through 
various subsidiaries and affiliates of JPMC, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 
JPMorgan Securities LLC (the United States broker-dealer for JPMC, registered with the 
Securities & Exchange Commission), and JPMorgan Securities pie (in the United 
Kingdom). 
The Bank Secrecy Act's Requirements 
3. 
The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the 
Bank Secrecy Act, or "BSA"), Title 31, United States Code, Section 5311, et seq., 
requires financial institutions - including JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., and other JPMC affiliates - to take certain steps to protect against the 
financial institution being used by criminals to commit crimes and launder money. 
4. 
The BSA requires financial institutions to establish and maintain effective anti-money 
laundering ("AML") compliance programs that, at a minimum and among other things, 
provide for: (a) internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to guard against 
money laundering; (b) an individual or individuals to coordinate and monitor day-to-day 
compliance with BSA and AML requirements; ( c) an ongoing employee training 
program; and (d) an independent audit function to test compliance programs. 31 U.S.C. 
§ 53 l 8(h). 
5. 
The BSA and regulations thereunder also require financial institutions to report 
"suspicious transaction[ s] relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation." 31 
U.S.C. § 53 l 8(g)(l). BSA regulations provide that a transaction is reportable if it is 
"conducted or attempted by, at, or through the bank" and where "the bank knows, 
suspects, or has reason to suspect that ... [t]he transaction involves funds derived from 
illegal activities" or that the "transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose." 31 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 24 of 50
C.F.R. § 1020.320(a)(2). A separate BSA regulation provides that a bank must file a 
Suspicious Activity Report ("SAR") where the bank "detects any known or suspected 
Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations ... aggregating $5,000 or 
more in funds or other assets ... where the bank believes that ... it was used to facilitate 
a criminal transaction, and the bank has a substantial basis for identifying a possible 
suspect or group of suspects." 12 C.F.R. § 21.11 (c)(2). If the transactions total more 
than $25,000, then a bank must file a report even if it cannot identify a suspect. 12 
C.F.R. § 21.l l(c)(3). Financial institutions satisfy their obligation to report such a 
transaction by filing a SAR with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
("FinCEN"), a part of the United States Department of Treasury. 31 C.F.R. 
§ 1020.320(a)(l). 
6. 
At all relevant times, JPMC designated an executive located in New York, New York 
(the "JPMC BSA Officer") as the head of JPMC's AML program and the individual 
ultimately responsible for ensuring JPMC's ongoing compliance with its BSA 
obligations, including the filing of SARs when required . .JPMC's AML program 
included individuals based in the United States and other countries responsible for filing 
suspicious activity reports in the relevant jurisdictions. 
An Overview Of JPMC's Banking Relationship With Madoff 
7. 
Bernard L. Madoff ("Madoff') ran the largest known Ponzi scheme in history through 
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC and its predecessors and affiliates 
(collectively, "MadoffSecurities"). At the time of its collapse in December 2008, 
Madoff Securities maintained more than 4,000 investment advisory client accounts, 
which purported to have a combined balance of approximately $65 billion under 
management. In fact, Madoff Securities had only approximately $300 million in assets at 
the time, including approximately $234 million in cash and cash equivalents held by 
Madoff Securities in JPMC bank accounts. 
8. 
Madoff Securities maintained a continuous banking relationship with JPMC and its 
predecessor institutions, including Manufacturer's Hanover Trust, Chemical Bank and 
The Chase Manhattan Bank, between at least approximately 1986 and Madoffs arrest in 
December 2008. 
9. 
Madoff Securities held a series of linked direct deposit and custodial accounts at JPM C 
organized under the umbrella of a centralized "concentration account," number 140-
081703 ( collectively, the "703 Account"). The 703 Account was the bank account that 
received and remitted, through a Jinked disbursement account, the overwhelming 
majority of funds that Madoffs victims "invested" with MadoffSecurities. In addition, 
MadoffSecurities maintained linked accounts at JPMC through which Madoffheld the 
funds obtained through his Ponzi scheme in, among other things, government securities 
and commercial paper. 
10. 
Between approximately 1986 and Madoff s arrest in December 2008, the 703 Account 
received deposits and transfers of approximately $150 billion, almost exclusively from 
Madoff Securities investors. The 703 Account was not a securities settlement account 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 25 of 50
and the funds deposited by Madoff's victims into the 703 Account were not used for the 
purchase and sale of stocks, corporate bonds, or options, as Madoff had promised his 
customers he would invest their money. Nor were the funds deposited into the 703 
Account transferred to other broker-dealers for the purchase and sale of securities. 
11. 
The balance in the 703 Account generally increased over time, peaking at approximately 
$5.6 billion in August 2008. Between August 2008 and Madoff's arrest on December 11, 
2008, billions were transferred from the 703 Account to customers of Madoff Securities, 
leaving a balance of only approximately $234 million. 
12. 
As described herein, at various times between the late 1990s and 2008, employees of 
various divisions of JPMC and its predecessor entities raised questions about Madoff 
Securities, including questions about the validity ofMadoffSecurities's investment 
returns. 
At no time during this period did JPMC personnel communicate their concerns 
about Madoff Securities to AML personnel in the United States responsible for JPMC's 
banking relationship with Madoff Securities. Nor did JPMC file any SAR in the United 
States relating to Madoff Securities until after Madoff's arrest. 
JPMC's Tools For Identifying Money Laundering Among Broker/Dealer Clients 
13. 
The Madoff Securities banking relationship with JPMC was handled by the JPMC 
Investment Bank's Broker-Dealer Banking Group (the "BID Group"), which provided 
access to an array of banking services to approximately 200-250 broker-dealer clients. 
Each broker-dealer client had an assigned client executive (also known as a "relationship 
manager" or simply "banker") who was the primary point of contact for that client. 
14. 
Each relationship manager in the BID Group was required, pursuant to JPMC policy, to 
periodically certify that he had "(i) determin[ ed), ... on an ongoing basis, whether an 
existing ... relationship complies with relevant legal and regulatory-based policies and 
meets the firrn[')s corporate client standards, and (ii) [taken) appropriate action to 
identify, communicate and resolve any issue that may arise in the course of such 
detenninations." Client sponsorship also expressly "require[d) [the banker), as a Senior 
Officer of JPMorgan, to recertify on a periodic basis ... that the necessary due diligence 
has been performed [and] that the client and its subsidiaries continue to meet the JPMC 
corporate client standards in relation to any potential reputation risk." 
15. 
Following a restructuring of the BID Group in or about 2007, the JPMC employees 
providing various services to BID Group clients, such as credit or loan officers, were 
moved out of the BID Group and instead reassigned to other parts of the Bank. As a 
result, client financial statements, regulatory filings, credit reviews, and other documents 
that had in the past been reviewed by the relationship manager were no longer regularly 
reviewed within the BID Group, although employees in JPMC's Credit department still 
reviewed such documents. 
16. 
JPMC also relied on a computerized system to comply with its AML obligations. 
Specifically, with respect to demand deposit accounts (i.e., accounts holding client funds 
that can be withdrawn at any time, such as the 703 Account), JPMC employed different 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 26 of 50
software tools commonly used by large financial institutions to monitor account activity. 
Among other things, these software tools sought to determine how an account's activity 
compared to "peer" accounts and whether the account in question was behaving 
uncharacteristically for the peer group in terms of the value of the account and the 
volume of transactions. 
17. 
In the event that the computerized AML systems generated an "alert" for potentially 
irregular activity, JPMC policy provided that an AML investigations team within JPMC' s 
compliance department would investigate the alert and take appropriate action, which 
could include contacting business people at the bank, if any action was required. The 
AML alert process operated independently of the client sponsorship process, and AML 
officers monitoring the alerts did not have immediate access to computerized information 
providing the identity of the relationship manager in the event that the AML officer 
deemed it appropriate to contact the relationship manager to determine whether the 
alerted activity was consistent with the relationship manager's knowledge of the banking 
relationship. 
18. 
In addition, the AML investigations teams monitoring the alerts were expected to have 
access to the appropriate records about the client, including so-called "know-your-
customer" material ( often referred to as "KYC material") that JPMC maintained in 
connection with its BSA obligations and pursuant to bank policy. The computerized 
AML system provided a means for AML investigators to review centrally maintained 
electronic copies of KYC materials. However, JPMC's efforts to electronically store 
KYC materials were behind schedule and, accordingly, as set forth herein, on some 
occasions AML investigations teams responding to alerts were unable to access the 
computerized KYC material on the client as part of their investigation. 
The Use of JPMC's AML Tools in Connection With The Madoff Securities Accounts 
19. 
With respect to JPMC's requirement that a client relationship manager certify that the 
client relationship complied with all "legal and regulatory-based policies," a JPMC 
banker ("Madoff Banker l ") signed the periodic certifications beginning in or about the 
mid-l 990s through his retirement in early 2008, when the client relationship was 
assigned to a second individual ("Madoff Banker 2"). In March 2009 - three months 
after Madoffs arrest- MadoffBanker 2 received a form letter from JPMC's Compliance 
function asking him to certify the client relationship again. 
20. 
During his tenure at JPMC, MadoffBanker 1 periodically visited Madoffs offices and 
obtained financial documents from Madoff Securities in connection with periodic loans 
JPMC made to the firm. Despite those visits and financial documents, and despite the 
fact that Mad off Banker 1 was aware of Madoff s standing in the industry, Madoff 
Banker 1 had a limited and inaccurate understanding of both Madoffs business, as well 
as the purpose and balance of the demand deposit accounts maintained by Madoff 
Securities at JPMC. Madoff Banker 1 believed that the 703 Account was primarily a 
Madoff Securities broker-dealer operating account, used to pay for rent and other routine 
expenses. Madoff Banker 1 also believed that the average balance in Madoff Securities' 
demand deposit account was "probably [in the) tens of millions." He did not understand 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 27 of 50
that the 703 Account was, in fact, the account used by Madoff's investment advisory 
business, and achieved balances of well more than $1 billion beginning in approximately 
2005, and up to approximately $5.6 billion by 2008. Madoff Banker 1 stated that he re-
certified his sponsorship of the Madoff relationship each year because no adverse 
information about Madoff Securities was brought to his attention. 
21. 
With respect to the computerized AML system, on two occasions the system generated 
"alerts" with respect to potentially suspicious activity in Madoff Securities. In January 
2007, the 703 Account "alerted" because of unusual third party wire activity. On the day 
of the alert, January 3, 2007, the 703 Account received $757.2 million in customer wires 
and transfers, 27 times the average daily value of incoming wires and transfers over the 
prior 90 days of activity, virtually all of which came from Madoff"feeder funds" that 
offered to invest funds from their own customers in Madoff Securities. In July 2008, the 
system alerted due to activity associated with Treasury bond redemptions. In both cases, 
the AML investigators closed the alerts with a notation that the transactions did not 
appear to be unusual for the account in comparison to the account's prior activity. In 
both cases, prior to closing the alerts, the investigators attempted to review the KYC file 
for Madoff Securities but, upon receiving error messages to the effect that no file was 
available, did not conduct further investigation into the business of Madoff Securities 
beyond a review of the company's website. 
Transactions In the Madoff Securities Account Identified By JPMC Private Bank Predecessors 
22. 
Beginning in the mid-1990s, employees in the Private Bank for Chemical Bank, a 
predecessor of JPMC, identified a series of transactions between the account of a Private 
Bank client (the "Private Bank Client") and accounts held by Madoff Securities, 
including the 703 Account. 1 As one of the bank's largest individual clients, with a 
portfolio valued (as of the mid-1990s) at approximately $2.3 billion, the Private Bank 
Client was highly valued by JPMC and its predecessors and was provided with his own 
office within JPMC's offices. In addition, the Bank's Global Trust & Fiduciary Services 
business line served ( along with Bernard L. Madoff) as co~executor and co-trustee of the 
Private Bank Client's will, and stood to earn approximately $15 million in fee income 
upon his death. 
23. 
The transactions between Madoff and the Private Bank Client consisted of "row1d-trip" 
transactions which would typically begin with Madoff writing checks from an account at 
another bank ("Madoff Bank 2") to one of the Private Bank Client's accounts at JPMC 
and its predecessors. Later the same day, Madoff would transfer money from his 703 
Account to his account at Madoff Bank 2 to cover the earlier check from Madoff Bank 2 
In July 1996, Chemical Bank acquired The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. by merger and 
began offering banking services, including private banking, under the name The Chase 
Manhattan Bank. In November 2001, The Chase Manhattan Bank acquired Morgan Guaranty 
Trust Company of New York by merger and began offering banking services, including private 
banking, under the name JPMorgan Chase Bank. The Private Bank Client maintained an account 
at the JPMC Private Bank through his death in September 2005. 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 28 of 50
to the Private Bank Client at JPMC. And, in the final leg of the transaction, as known to 
JPMC, the Private Bank Client would transfer funds from his JPMC account to the 703 
Account in an amount sufficient to cover the original check he had received from Madoff 
at Madoff Bank 2. These round-trip transactions occurred on a virtually daily basis for a 
period of years, and were each in the amount of tens of millions of dollars. Because of 
the delay between when the transactions were credited and when they were cleared 
(referred to as the "float"), the effect of these transactions was to make Madoffs balances 
at JPMC appear larger than they otherwise were, resulting in inflated interest payments to 
Madoffby JPMC. 
24. 
In or around November 1994, an employee of the JPMC Private Bank drafted a memo 
stating that "the daily cost associated with" the overdrafts from the transactions is 
"outrageous," and documenting calls on November 29, 1994, in which the employee 
informed both Madoff and the Private Bank client that JPMC was aware of the activity 
and the fact that it allowed Madoff to earn interest on uncleared funds. According to the 
memo, the Private Bank Client responded that "if Bernie is using the float, it is fine with 
me, he makes a lot of money for my account." 
25. 
In or about 1996, personnel from Madoff Bank 2 investigated the round-trip transactions 
between Madoff and the Private Bank Client. As a result of that investigation, which 
included meeting with representatives of Madoff Securities, Madoff Bank 2 concluded 
that there was no legitimate business purpose for these transactions, which appeared to be 
a "check kiting" scheme, and terminated its banking relationship with Madoff Securities. 
According to personnel from MadoffBank 2, JPMC was notified ofMadoffBank 2's 
closure ofMadoffs bank account. In addition, although unknown to JPMC at the time, 
Madoff Bank 2 filed a SAR in or about I 996 identifying both Madoff Securities and the 
Private Bank Client as being involved in suspicious transactions at Madoff Bank 2 and 
JPMC "for which there was no apparent business purpose." 
26. 
JPMC Private Bank did not file a suspicious activity report relating to the transaction 
activity between the Private Bank Client and Madoff Securities, or terminate its banking 
relationship with Madoff, or direct the parties to cease such transactions. JPMC allowed 
the Private Bank Client transactions to continue, although JPMC did require the Private 
Bank Client to reimburse JPMC for the interest payments that these transactions had cost 
the bank. 
27. 
After MadoffBank 2 closed the MadoffSecurities account in or about 1996, the Private 
Bank Client and Madoff Securities continued to engage in round-trip transactions, the 
sizes of which increased, entirely through JPMC accounts. In December 2001, the 
Private Bank Client engaged in approximately $6.8 billion worth of transactions with 
Madoff Securities -
all between the Private Bank Client's accounts at JPMC and the 
Madoff Securities 703 Account -
in a series of usually $90 million transactions. These 
transactions continued through 2003. 
28. 
JPMC Private Bankers did not report the round-trip transactions between the Private 
Bank Client and Madoff Securities to JPMC AML personnel. After Madoff s arrest in 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 29 of 50
2008, JPMC AML personnel reviewed the activity and filed a SAR concerning the above 
transactions. 
Questions About Madoff Securities's Investment Returns From JPMC's Private Bank 
29. 
In or about 1993, the Private Bank Client requested that a senior investment officer (the 
"Senior Investment Officer") of the Private Bank of Chemical Bank, a predecessor of 
JPMC, meet with Madoff, so that he (the Private Bank Client) could better understand 
how Madoff regularly generated consistent returns. Along with a quantitative analyst 
(the "Analyst"), the Senior Investment Officer met with Madoff. A memorandum from 
around the time of the visit reports that the Senior Investment Officer was "very 
comfortable" with Madoff, "his operation" and "the conservative, risk-averse investment 
approach" for the Private Bank Client, and that the Analyst said "it is quite possible for 
top-notch investment advisors to make 20-30% annual returns through such short-term 
programs." However, the Senior Investment Officer later explained that he and the 
Analyst could not understand how Madoff was able to generate such consistent quarterly 
returns for the Private Bank Client despite historic volatility in the market, and therefore 
concluded that Madoff "might also have been smoothing out the returns" by sharing 
trading spreads and profits from the Madoff Securities market-making business with the 
Private Bank Client. 
30. 
In or about 1998, the Private Bank conducted a review ofMadoffSecurities because it 
had been extending credit to the Private Bank Client to invest in Madoff Securities. The 
review reflected that, according to Madoff Securities account statements, the Private 
Bank Client's reported investments, the substantial majority of which were invested 
through Madoff Securities, had increased from $ I 83 million at the end of 1986 to $1. 7 
billion in early 1998 - an increase of 830 percent in 12 years. The Private Bank also 
learned that Madoff reported consistently positive returns for the Private Bank Client at 
all times, including through the October 1987 stock market crash and subsequent market 
corrections. 
31. 
In late 2007, JPMC Private Bank personnel also conducted due diligence on Madoff 
Securities because there was sufficient interest in Madoff among the Private Bank's 
clients such that JPMC considered putting Madoff Securities on its own "trading 
platform" - that is, to put some of the money that the Private Bank invested on behalf of 
its clients into Madoff Securities. However, the JPMC Private Bank was told that Madoff 
would be unwilling to meet with JPMC in connection with its due diligence efforts. The 
JPMC Private Bank ended the due diligence process and did not place Madoff Securities 
on its trading platform. After Mad offs arrest, the Chief Investment Officer of the Private 
Bank wrote to Private Bank customers that "we did not do business with the Madoff 
funds, having never been able to reverse engineer how they made the money - the 
numbers didn't add up ... " JPMC Private Bank personnel did not provide this 
information to JPMC AML personnel. 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 30 of 50
Questions About Madoff Securities's Investment Returns By A JPMC 
Investment Fund 
32. 
Chase Alternative Asset Management ("CAAM")-the JPMC fund of funds open to 
institutional investors, and which was part of the Asset Management line of business -
also considered placing Madoff Securities on its platform in the late 1990s and again in 
or about 2007. In connection with reviewing Madoffs reported returns in the late 1990s, 
one CAAM fund manager commented on approximately December 10, 1998 that Madoff 
Securities returns were "possibly too good to be true," and that there were "too many red 
flags" to proceed with further due diligence." In 2007, JPMC's fund of funds again 
considered a Madoff investment, and also discontinued the due diligence early on 
because the first stages of the process provided "little additional insight as to the source 
of the [Madoff Securities) returns" and because JPMC learned that Madoff would not 
meet with JPMC personnel to answer their questions. In neither the late 1990s nor 2007 
did JPMC fund managers provide this information to JPMC AML personnel. 
JPMC's Issuance Of Madoff Derivative Products 
33. 
Beginning in approximately the Spring of 2006, JPMC invested approximately $343 
million of the Bank's own money in Madoff"feeder funds" - funds that sent investor 
money to Madoff Securities - as a hedge for structured products issued by JPMC's 
investment bank. Those derivative products were issued by JPMC in London in 2006 
and 2007 through JPMC's Equity Exotics Desk, a group that specialized in creating 
complex derivatives based on the performance of certain investment funds. The purpose 
of the products was to provide investors with "synthetic exposure" to hedge funds or 
other equities without the investor making a direct investment in the fund itself. 
34. 
The Madoff-derivative products offered by JPMC, which were issued in response to 
demand for Madoff Securities-related investments, generally worked as follows: JPMC 
issued notes (which it sold through various distributors) and promised to pay note-holders 
a return that corresponded to the return of a particular Madoff feeder fund. In order to 
hedge the risk created by those notes, JPMC then invested the Bank's own capital in the 
feeder fund directly. JPMC's investment of its own money in the Madofffeeder funds as 
a hedge position would therefore in large part offset the risks associated with JPMC's 
obligation under the notes. In this business model, JPMC's Investment Bank profited 
from transaction fees associated with issuing the notes, and endeavored to minimize risk 
resulting from these issuances. Due to the features of the JPMC-issued notes, however, it 
was impossible for JPMC to eliminate all risks from its exposure to Madoff feeder funds. 
For example, with respect to certain notes issued by JPMC that would pay the noteholder 
three times the Madoff feeder fund's investment returns, JPMC would suffer no losses if 
the Madofffeeder fund decreased in value by less than 33%, but could suffer substantial 
losses if the Madofffeeder fund's value fell to zero. 
35. 
JPMC required approval from the Investment Bank's Risk function in connection with its 
own investments in hedge funds, including the Madoff feeder funds. Under pre-existing 
guidelines in place in 2007, approval for investments in so-called single name hedge 
funds (like Madoff Securities) was set at $100 million in risk exposure to JPM C 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 31 of 50
(meaning, the total amount JPMC could be expected to lose if JPMC's investment lost 
virtually all its value). Risk exposure above $ I 00 million required approval from senior 
risk executives, with the level of approval depending on the size of the proposed 
investment. In assessing potential transactions that required individual approval from the 
JPMC risk function, risk officers assessed both "market risk" (i.e., the risk associated 
with the investment performance of the underlying fund, assuming the fund followed its 
advertised strategy) and "credit risk" (i.e., whether the fund could be trusted with the 
Bank's money). In the context of hedge fund investments, one credit risk factor in all 
proposed transactions was the risk that the fund manager was committing fraud. The 
scope of fraud risk ranged from a manager who deviated from a promised investment 
strategy to a manager who was reporting entirely fictitious returns. 
36. 
From the outset, JPMC's risk personnel recognized that there was little market risk 
provided that Madoff was investing client funds in the split-strike conversion strategy 
that Madoff claimed he was. Accordingly, JPMC risk personnel promptly identified 
credit risk, and in particular the risk of fraud, as the central potential risk to JPMC. For 
example, in a February I, 2006 e-mail, a risk executive evaluating the Madoff derivatives 
proposal commented, "[I]t seems to me the real systemic risk is that [MadoffJ ends up 
being the next Refco and all their assets are frozen .... " 
JPMC's Head Of Risk Denies A Request To Increase The Bank's Risk Exposure to Madoff 
Securities By More Than $1 Billion And Caps JPMC's Exposure At $250 Million 
37. 
There was significant investor demand for the JPMC notes tied to the performance of the 
Madoff feeder funds. By June 2007, JPMC's position in Madoff feeder funds had created 
approximately $105 million in risk exposure to Madoff Securities. 
38. 
In approximately June 2007, traders on the Equity Exotics Desk decided to ask for a 
combined risk limit exception for JPMC's exposure to Madoff Securities through the 
various feeder funds in order to meet increasing demand for the structured products. 
Ultimately, senior investment bankers - including the Head of Equities for the Europe, 
Middle East and Africa region ("EMEA") - decided to seek approval to underwrite 
approximately $ I billion in Madoff-linked derivatives. Given the particular nature of the 
derivatives (some of which included features such as capital protection and offered the 
purchasers a degree of leverage), the $ I billion issuance would have resulted in a total of 
more than$ 1.32 billion of the Bank's proprietary capital to be invested directly into 
Madoff feeder funds as a hedge, resulting in total exposure for JPMC of approximately 
$1.14 billion if the value of the feeder funds fell to zero. It was estimated at the time that 
the proposed $ I billion issuance, if approved, would bring the Equity Exotics Desk 
approximately $55-70 million in revenue. 
39. 
Because of the size of the proposed risk exception, the Investment Bank's Chief Risk 
Officer (the "CRO") required the proposal to be presented to the Investment Bank's 
Hedge Fund Underwriting Committee (the "Committee"). The Committee, chaired by 
the CRO, was comprised of executives from various of JPMC's lines of business who 
were affected by transactions involving hedge funds. The decision whether to permit the 
requested risk exception rested ultimately with the CRO. 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 32 of 50
40. 
The Committee met to consider the Investment Bank's $1.14 billion Madoff Securities 
proposal on June 15, 2007, at 11:00 AM, at JPMC's midtown-Manhattan offices. 
Investment Bank employees from the London Equity Exotics Desk participated by phone, 
and senior Equities executives - including the Investment Bank's Global Head of 
Equities -participated in person, as did other JPMC Executives from JPMC's Investment 
Bank. Executives from the B/D Group also participated by phone to address any 
questions relating to JPMC's banking or credit relationships with Madoff Securities. 
41. 
In advance of the meeting, credit executives circulated written materials analyzing the 
proposed Madoff transaction. Among other things, those written materials described 
Madoff Securities as being a fund "in the order of$ l 5-20bn" - making it one of the 
largest hedge funds then in existence. 
42. 
With respect to risk analysis, the written materials stated that there was little market risk 
associated with Madoff's investment strategy, and concluded that "the main risk this 
trade poses is systemic fraud risk at the BLM [i.e., Bernard L. MadoffJ level." 
Elsewhere, the materials reiterated that "[c)learly, our largest risk is that of wholesale 
fraud at BLM that would strip the firm of any real assets (balance sheet or customer)." 
The written materials reported that the prospect of a systemic fraud was "extremely 
unlikely." The written materials also reported that systemic fraud risk was further 
mitigated because even "under a fraud/insolvency event at BLM level JPM would be a 
senior creditor (together with other account holders of customer assets also protected by 
SIPC [the Securities Investor Protection Corporation] and should have priority in 
recovery above other creditors of BLM. It would therefore require a fraud/insolvency 
event of extreme proportions to erode the implied subordination in the JPM transactions 
( e.g. estimated $ I 5bln of assets run by BLM ... )." 
43. 
The presentation also made clear that although JPMC was able to conduct due diligence 
on some of the Madofffeeder funds, Madoffwas unwilling to allow JPMC to conduct 
direct due diligence on Madoff Securities. The presentation material did report that 
JPMC personnel had spoken to Madoffby telephone on March 30, 2007. During this 
call, Madoff provided what JPMC employees considered to be forthcoming answers to 
questions posed about Madoff's purported investment strategy, but indicated that he did 
not approve of the Madoff-linked derivative products and would not allow JPMC to 
conduct due diligence on his fund directly. 
44. 
The June 15, 2007 Committee meeting ended without the CRO's approval for any further 
exposure by JPMC to Madoff Securities. While the reported consensus of the Committee 
was that "the fraud risk at Madoff is remote," the CRO concluded that no approval would 
be granted unless JPMC could do "direct due diligence on Madoff Securities." The CRO 
stated in an e-mail that "we don't do $1 bio [billion] trust me deals." 
45. 
Shortly after the Committee meeting ended, the CRO had lunch with another JPMC 
Executive (the "JPMC Executive"). During the lunch, the CRO sent an e-mail to, among 
others, the Investment Bank's Global Head of Equities, the Head of Equities for EMEA, 
and the head of the Equity Exotics Desk stating: "I am sitting at lunch with [the JPMC 
Executive] who just told me that there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff 
IO 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 33 of 50
and that his returns are speculated to be part of a ponzi scheme - he said if we google the 
guy we can see the articles for ourselves - Pis do that and let us know what you find." In 
follow-up correspondence with the CRO, the JPMC Executive provided more specifics 
about the article and offered to find the article if the CRO had any difficulty locating it, 
explaining that he knew "nothing" on the subject other than what he read in what was 
"definitely an unflattering article." 
46. 
In response to the CRO's e-mail about the Madoff Ponzi scheme rumors, the Global 
Head of Equities wrote that JPMC should "seriously look into it" as JPMC lent Madoff 
Securities money through the BID Banking Group. The Global Head of Equities also 
commented that it was "hard to believe this would be going on over the years" because 
MadoffSecurities was "regulated by SEC, NYSE, NASD etc." To this the CRO 
responded that "Refco was regulated by the same crowd [that regulates Madoff 
Securities] and there was noise about them for years before it was discovered to be rotten 
to the core," adding that "we owe it to ourselves to investigate further." And in another e-
mail several days later, the CRO wrote to one of the co-Chief Executive Officers of the 
Investment Bank that the JPMC Executive "told me Madoff has a very shady reputation 
in the market." 
47. 
Neither the CRO nor anyone else at JPMC located the article to which the JPMC 
Executive had referred, although a junior JPMC employee conducted an unsuccessful 
search. The article referenced by the JPMC Executive was a 2001 Barron's feature 
entitled "Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Bernie Madoff is so secretive, he even asks his investors 
to keep mum." The Barron's article, among other things, raised some of the same issues 
identified by JPMC's risk analysts. For example, it noted Madoff Securities had 
"produced compound average annual returns of 15% for more than a decade," and that 
"some of the larger, billion-dollar Madoff-run funds have never had a down year." The 
article then reported that "some on the Street have begun speculating that Madoffs 
market-making operation subsidizes and smooths his hedge-fund returns" and described 
how such smoothing could be accomplished through an unlawful practice known as 
front-running. 
48. 
On or about June 27, 2007, the head of the Investment Bank's structured products group 
e-mailed the CRO a "quick reminder" that JPMC had "client trades requiring $150 mm of 
delta to buy in funds investing in Madoff on Friday of this week" and that there would be 
"further significant flows at next month end." The CRO then requested and received 
additional information from the BID Group about Madoff Securities, including 
information from its credit reviews. On the same day, the CRO also spoke by telephone 
to Madoff, who answered questions asked by the CRO. At the same time, the CRO 
understood that Madoff would not authorize any further direct due diligence on Madoff 
Securities. 
49. 
Later the same day, June 27, 2007, the CRO wrote "we will approve up to $250 mio for 
these trades," then clarified that he was approving $250 million of total risk exposure, to 
include both JPMC's existing approximately $105 million in exposure as well as 
exposure generated through new transactions by the Investment Bank. Based on the 
decision to set risk exposure at $250 million, the Equity Exotics Desk ended its 
I I 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 34 of 50
discussions related to other potential Madoff derivative transactions then under 
negotiation in order to stay within the risk limits. 
June 2007 - September 2008: The Equity Exotics Desk Monitors 
JPMC's Exposure to Madoff Securities 
50. 
In approximately August 2007, an Equity Exotics employee ("Equity Exotics Banker I") 
conducted an analysis in order to determine the relationship between returns reported by 
a Mad off feeder fund and the investments in S&P 5 00 stocks and Treasury bills that 
Madoff claimed comprised his investment strategy. Equity Exotics Banker I was unable 
to determine based on available information how the Madoff feeder fund could have 
• 
produced these returns had Madoff followed this strategy, writing that the market 
performance during the period analyzed was "far away" from the returns that Madoff 
"allegedly made." After obtaining further information and conducting further analysis, 
Equity Exotics Banker I e-mailed a colleague that he did "take comfort from the fact" 
that two separate Madoff feeder funds were reporting close to the same returns for the 
period. 
51. 
Also in the Fall of 2007, JPMC hired a "Head of Due Diligence" for the Equity Exotics 
Desk. On his first day on the job, the head of the Equity Exotics Desk directed the Head 
of Due Diligence to review the Madoff feeder fund positions and offer any insight into 
how Madoffwas able to generate his purported returns. The Head of Due Diligence was 
unable to explain the returns and learned that the Equity Exotics Desk was no longer 
interested in issuing products linked to the returns of Madoff Securities. 
52. 
On June 23, 2008, after reviewing e-mails about the failure of one of the feeder funds to 
provide information to JPMC, including about how the money sent to Madoff was 
invested, and the departure of various feeder fund employees, a senior Equity Exotics 
banker e-mailed the head of the Equity Exotics Desk: "How much do we have in Madoff 
at the moment? To be honest, the more I think about it, the more concerned I am." 
53. 
In or around September 2008, as described below, JPMC began to consider redeeming its 
positions in the Madoff feeder funds. 
October 2008: JPMC Concludes In A Report To U.K. Regulators That Madoffs Returns Are 
Probably Too Good To Be True 
54. 
In mid-September 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and growing 
concerns about counter-party risk, JPMC's Head of Global Equities directed investment 
bank personnel to substantially reduce JPMC's exposure to hedge funds, which had 
increased following JPMC's March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns. This directive was 
reiterated by the Investment Bank Risk Committee on October 3, 2008. Acting at the 
direction of the Head of Global Equities, the Equity Exotics Desk began analyzing which 
hedge funds to reduce exposure to, including by directing the Desk's due diligence 
analyst (the "Equity Exotics Analyst") to scrutinize investments in various hedge funds, 
including the Madoff feeder funds. The Equity Exotics Analyst conducted this due 
diligence by, among other things, analyzing the reported strategy and returns ofMadoff 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 35 of 50
Securities, speaking to personnel at Madoff feeder funds and financial institutions 
administering Madoff feeder funds, and unsuccessfully seeking from the feeder funds and 
administrators documentary proof of the assets of Madoff Securities. 
55. 
On October 16, 2008, the Equity Exotics Analyst wrote a lengthy e-mail to the head of 
the Equity Exotics Desk and others summarizing his conclusions (the "October 16 
Memo"). The October 16 Memo described the inability of JPMC or the feeder funds to 
validate Madoff's trading activity or custody of assets. The October 16 Memo noted that 
the feeder funds were audited by major accounting firms, which had issued unqualified 
opinions for 2007, but questioned Madoff's "odd choice" of a small, unknown accounting 
firm. The October 16, 2008 Memo reported that personnel from one of the feeder funds 
"said they were reassured by the claim that FINRA and the SEC performed occasional 
audits ofMadoff," but that they "appear not to have seen any evidence of the reviews or 
findings." The October 16 Memo also questioned the reliability of information provided 
by the feeder funds and the willingness of the feeder funds to obtain verifying 
information from Madoff. For example, the memo reported that personnel at one feeder 
fund "seem[ ed] very defensive and almost scared of Madoff. They seem unwilling to ask 
him any difficult questions and seem to be considering his 'interests' before those of the 
investors. It's almost a cult he seems to have fostered." The Equity Exotics Analyst 
further wrote that there was both a "lack of transparency" into Madoff Securities and "a 
resistance on the part ofMadoffto provide meaningful disclosure." 
56. 
The October 16 Memo ended with the observation that: "[t]here are various elements in 
the story that could make us nervous," including the fund managers' "apparent fear of 
Madoff, where no one dares to ask any serious questions as long as the performance is 
good." The October 16 Memo concluded: "I could go on but we seem to be relying on 
Madoff's integrity (or the [feeder funds'] belief in Madoff's integrity) and the quality of 
the due diligence work (initial and ongoing) done by the custodians ... to ensure that the 
assets actually exist and are properly custodied. If some[thing] were to happen with the 
funds, our recourse would be to the custodians and whether they had been negligent or 
grossly negligent." 
57. 
The Head of Due Diligence responded by complimenting the Equity Exotics Analyst on 
the October 16 Memo, making reference to other long-running fraud schemes, and 
suggesting in a joking manner that they should visit the Madoff Securities accountant's 
office in New City, New York to make sure it was not a "car wash." 
58. 
The October 16 Memo was forwarded to JPMC's in-house and external counsel, as well 
as to JPMC's London-based Head of AML for the EMEA region, who also served as 
JPMC's designated BSA Officer for the region (the "EMEA BSA Officer"). Following 
review of the October 16 Memo and consultation with legal counsel, on or about October 
29, 2008, the EMEA BSA Officer filed with the U.K. Serious Organised Crime Agency 
("SOCA") a report, also called a suspicious activity report or SAR, pursuant to the terms 
of the United Kingdom's Proceeds of Fraud Act (the "U.K. Report"). The U.K. Report 
was filed by the EMEA BSA Officer on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. - the 
OCC-regulated entity - and identified Madoff Securities as its "main subject - suspect." 
Under "reason for suspicion," the EMEA BSA Officer wrote, in pertinent part: 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 36 of 50
JPMCB's [i.e., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s] concerns around 
Madoff Securities are based (1) on the investment performance 
achieved by its funds which is so consistently and significantly 
ahead of its peers year-on-year, even in the prevailing market 
conditions, as to appear too good to be true - meaning that it 
probably is; and (2) the lack of transparency around Madoff 
Securities trading techniques, the implementation of its investment 
strategy, and the identity of its OTC [over the counter] options 
counterparties; and (3) its unwillingness to provide helpful 
information. As a result, JPMCB has sent out redemption notices 
in respect of one fund, and is preparing similar notices for two 
more funds. 
59. 
The U.K. Report continued that "JPMCB is also concerned about the conflict of interests 
which the three combined roles of BLM could represent" - i.e., acting "as sub-advisor, 
sub-custodian and broker/dealer to the funds in question" - a factor also cited in the 
October 16 Memo regarding JPMC's inability to verify that the assets ofMadoff 
Securities "actually exist." The U.K. Report further noted that other investment advisors 
had attempted to replicate Madoffs stated strategy "but nowhere near as successfully as 
BLM," and that the feeder fund managers "appear to know very little about how BLM 
strategy and systems work, and seem unconcerned in view of its consistent profitability." 
Under the heading "[o]ffurther concern," the U.K. Report also described the "small and 
unknown" auditors used by Madoff Securities. 
60. 
The U.K. Report then quantified JPMC's Madoff-related hedge fund redemptions as 
being undertaken "as a result" of these suspicions: €150 million (out ofa total of€200 
million) from one fund, and $150 million ( out of a total of $150 million) from another. 
61. 
In addition to reporting JPMC's suspicion that Madoff Securities was claiming returns 
"too good to be true," the U.K. Report also identified a distributor of the Madoff-linked 
derivatives as a "secondary subject" of the report. The basis for JPMC's suspicions about 
the distributor was a call between a JPMC Investment Bank salesperson and an employee 
of the distributor in which JPMC informed the distributor that JPMC intended to invoke a 
provision of the note agreement enabling JPMC to delink the notes from the performance 
of a Madoff feeder fund. During the call, the distributor's employee expressed 
displeasure about JPMC's proposed action and referenced having "Colombian friends 
who cause havoc ... when they get angry .... " 
62. 
On November 19, 2008, the EMEA BSA Officer filed a second report with SOCA in the 
United Kingdom, on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This report alerted British 
regulators to a proposal by JPMC to buy back certain of the Madoff-linked notes from 
investors linked to the distributor who had referenced "Colombian friends" and stated 
that"[ c ]!early we do not wish to make the legal offer if there is any risk that we could not 
meet our obligations if SOCA refused consent at a later date, on the basis that JPM could 
be considered party to laundering the proceeds of crime." 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 37 of 50
63. 
Prior to filing either of the U.K. reports, a U.K. markets compliance officer (the "U.K. 
Markets Compliance Officer") and a JPMC lawyer based in the United Kingdom spoke 
to the Global Head of Equities about the Madoff redemptions and need to potentially file 
a report. The Global Head of Equities stated that Madoff was not an important client 
relationship to him. The Global Head of Equities also indicated that he supported taking 
any necessary steps with regard to "disclosure to US/UK regulators," and that he assumed 
JPMC's general counsel would be involved in the "ultimate decision." No disclosure was 
made to United States regulators and no report was made to JPMC's general counsel. 
JPMC's Redemptions From Madoff Feeder Funds 
64. 
On October 16, 2008 - the day of the October 16 Memo - an Equity Exotics employee 
requested by e-mail a "list of all external trades and the exact counterparty trade" for each 
of the Madoff-related feeder funds, noting that "[t]he list needs to be exhaustive as we 
may be terminating all of these trades and we cannot afford missing any." The Equity 
Exotics Desk, which had already placed redemption orders for approximately $78 million 
from the Madoff feeder funds between October I and October 15, thereafter sought to 
redeem almost all of its remaining money in the Madoff feeder funds. 
65. 
In addition to redeeming its positions in the Madoff feeder funds, JPMC sought, with the 
assistance oflegal counsel, to cancel or otherwise unwind certain of the structured 
products issued related to the performance of the Madoff feeder funds. In an attempt to 
unwind these transactions, JPMC told the distributors of the Madoffnotes that it was 
invoking a provision of the derivatives contract that enabled it to de-link the notes from 
the performance of the Madoff feeder funds if JPMC could not obtain satisfactory 
information about its investment. For example, in a letter dated October 27, 2008, JPMC 
warned that it would declare a "Lock-In Event" under the terms of the contract unless the 
recipient - a distributor that the Equity Exotics Analyst had spoken to as part of his due 
diligence underlying the October 16 Memo - could provide the identity of all of Madoff 
Securities' options counterparties by 5:00 PM the following day. 
66. 
In the Fall of 2008, the amount of JPMC's position in Madoff feeder funds fell from 
approximately $369 million at the beginning of October 2008 (which was down slightly 
from its high-water mark of$379 million, in July 2008) to approximately $81 million at 
the time ofMadoff's arrest, on December 11, 2008-a reduction of approximately $288 
million, or approximately 80% of JPMC's proprietary capital invested as a hedge in 
Madoff feeder funds. During the same period, JPMC spent approximately $19 million 
buying back Madoff-linked notes and approximately $55 million to unwind a swap 
transaction with a Madofffeeder fund that eliminated JPMC's contractual obligation with 
respect to those structured products. When Mad off was arrested, JPM C booked a loss of 
approximately $40 million, substantially less than the approximately $250 million it 
would have lost but for these transactions. 
67. 
At the same time, the Equity Exotics Desk also held through the time ofMadoff's arrest a 
gap note providing JPMC with $5 million in protection if the value of a Madoff feeder 
fund collapsed completely. In a November 28, 2008 e-mail, an Equity Exotics banker 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 38 of 50
declined a third party's request to buy this protective gap note from JPMC, and described 
the gap note as being "as of today ... very valuable" to JPMC. 
68. 
Although JPMC sharply reduced its hedge position in Madofffeeder funds, it was 
exposed to substantial risk in the event that Madoff Securities continued to perform 
successfully because it had not been able to unwind or otherwise cancel an equivalent 
value of JPMC-issued notes linked to the performance of the Madoff feeder funds. 
69. 
No one at the Investment Bank involved in JPMC's redemptions from the Madoff feeder 
funds informed anyone in the BID Group of their concerns about the validity ofMadoffs 
returns or even the fact of the redemptions. The key Investment Bank personnel involved 
in the Madoff feeder fund redemptions knew that the BID Group had a banking 
relationship with Madoff Securities. 
JPMC's Failure to File a SAR in the United States 
70. 
Although JPMC stated in the U.K. Report that a New York-based, SEC-regulated broker-
dealer's reported returns were "probably too good to be true," JPMC failed to file a SAR 
in the United States. 
71. 
The U.K.-based EMEA BSA Officer who filed the U.K. Report did not ask anyone in the 
United States AML compliance function to investigate the suspicions about Madoff 
Securities described in the U .K. Report. The EMEA BSA Officer placed a phone call to 
the JPMC BSA Officer (as defined in paragraph 6, above) but, upon failing to reach him, 
did not follow up with any other individual in the United States AML compliance 
function. The EMEA BSA Officer also contacted the Head of Global Compliance for 
JPMC about the threat to the JPMC employee referenced in paragraph 62 stemming from 
planned Madoff feeder fund redemptions and steps taken to address it, but did not raise 
any issue about the potential need to file a SAR in the United States. JPMC did not at the 
time have any formal protocol for the sharing of information about suspicious activity 
between geographic regions. 
72. 
So that he would be prepared to answer questions in the event that the Global Head of 
Equities were to learn about the U.K. Report, the U.K. Markets Compliance Officer 
alerted a high-ranking compliance officer for JPMC's Investment Bank in the United 
States (the "Senior 1B Compliance Officer") about the trading desk's suspicions 
concerning Madoff Securities, and, ultimately, the Senior 1B Compliance Officer learned 
that a report in the U.K. had been filed (although he did not receive a copy). The U.K. 
Markets Compliance Officer did not ask the Senior 1B Compliance Officer to undertake 
any AML review, and no such review was undertaken by United States AML personnel. 
73. 
The U.K. Markets Compliance Officer also provided the Senior 1B Compliance Officer 
with a copy of the October 16 Memo, as well as copies of the written materials that 
accompanied the original Madoff derivative proposal from June 2007. Both the October 
I 6 Memo and the June 2007 written material identified, in numerous places, the decades-
long banking relationship between Mad off Securities and JPMC, and the relationship in 
particular between Madoff Securities and JPMC's BID Group. For example, the June 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 39 of 50
2007 written materials specifically noted that "BLM is a relationship of JPMorgan's 
broker-dealer team in New York," i.e., the BID Group. 
74. 
The Senior IB Compliance Officer did not alert U.S. AML Compliance personnel about 
the concerns expressed in the October 16 Memo. Nor did the Senior IB Compliance 
Officer take any steps to examine JPMC's banking relationship with Madoff or the 
activity within the Madoff Securities accounts at JPMC. The Senior IB Compliance 
Officer did informally discuss the information he had received about Madoff Securities 
with several colleagues during an impromptu conversation in a hallway. After that 
conversation, one of the participants in that conversation - on his own initiative -
conducted internet-based research and located two articles that contained negative 
information about Madoff Securities: the 2001 Barron's article, discussed above, that the 
JPMC Executive had referred to in June 2007, and an article in a hedge fund industry 
publication called MAR/Hedge from 2001 entitled "MadoffTops Charts; Skeptics Ask 
How." 
75. 
The MAR/Hedge article identified Madoff Securities as having "$6-$7 billion in assets 
under management," which "would put it in the number one or two spot" in the list of the 
world's biggest hedge funds. The article noted Madoffs "positive returns for the last 11-
plus years," with "little volatility," and reported that other fund managers had attempted 
to replicate Madoffs strategy with less success, and far more volatility. The 
MAR/Hedge article echoed the report in the Barron's article that Mad off could be 
"subsidizing" client returns from his market-making business, by front-running order 
flow. 
76. 
The Senior IB Compliance Officer forwarded one of the two articles to markets 
compliance personnel in the U.K., and that article was ultimately forwarded to senior 
lawyers at JPMC in London. The Senior IB Compliance Officer has stated in connection 
with this investigation that, when he reviewed these articles in October 2008, he had 
viewed as significant that the concerns about the consistency of Madoff s returns and 
lack of transparency had been discussed in articles since 2001, because it suggested to 
him that regulators likely would have already examined the concerns about Madoff 
Securities. 
77. 
On or about November I 0, 2008, an AML compliance officer based in London who had 
assisted in drafting the U.K. Report wrote an e-mail that contained information about 
JPMC's redemptions from the Madofffeeder funds, and asked, "What other 
relationships, if any, does JPM have with either [a particular distributor] or Madoff 
Investment Securities?" A markets compliance officer responded, copying the U.S.-based 
Senior IB Compliance Officer and noting that JPMC had "lodged a report with the 
relevant U.K. authority" and that the Global Head of Compliance was "aware" of the 
report. The email also stated that, while U.K. personnel would examine JPMC's 
relationship with Madoffin that jurisdiction, "given Madoffis a U.S. broker dealer we 
may undertake significant business in the U.S. I've copied [the Senior IB Compliance 
Officer] to keep him apprised." No JPMC personnel took any action following this e-
mail to investigate JPMC's banking relationship with Madoff Securities. 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 40 of 50
78. 
At no time between October 16, 2008 and Madoffs arrest did JPMC file a SAR in the 
United States based on the suspicions articulated in the U.K. Report. Nor did anyone at 
JPMC during this time (a) examine the 703 Account; (b) inform the Madoff Securities 
relationship manager; (c) update the Madoff Securities KYC file; or (d) refer suspicions 
to any U.S.-based AML personnel. 
Billions Of Dollars Were Transferred From The 703 Account After JPMC Redeemed Its Madoff 
Feeder Fund Investments And Filed The U.K. Report 
79. 
JPMC continued providing banking services to Madoff Securities through the B/D Group 
until Madoffs arrest. In particular, after filing the U.K. Report, JPMC continued to 
process banking transactions for Madoff Securities in the account used for the Ponzi 
scheme, i.e., the 703 Account, which was then being rapidly depleted through 
withdrawals as the scheme neared collapse. 
80. 
Whereas the balance in the 703 Account reached approximately $5.6 billion in August 
2008, by October 16, 2008 - the date of the October 16 Memo - the account balance had 
fallen to $3.7 billion. Thirteen days later, when the U.K. Report was filed, the balance 
had fallen another $700 million, to approximately $3 billion. And in the five business 
days after the U.K. Report was filed, approximately $2.450 billion more was withdrawn 
from the 703 Account, leaving a balance of approximately $550 million, some ninety 
percent less than it had been in August of the same year. 
81. 
Most of the funds withdrawn during this period went to the same two feeder fund groups 
in which JPMC had invested- and then redeemed- JPMC's own funds. Between 
October 1 and October 28, 2008, JPMC placed redemption orders for approximately $276 
million from two particular feeder funds. On November 4, 2008, approximately $1.3 
billion was paid from the 703 Account to those two feeder fund groups in four 
transactions. Later in November 2008, JPMC placed redemptions orders for an 
additional approximately $23 .1 million from one of the funds; Madoff was arrested 
before those funds were ever received, however. 
82. 
On December 11, 2008, agents of the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation arrested Madoff. 
At the time of his arrest, there was approximately $234 million remaining in the 703 
Account. Between October 16, 2008 and Madoffs arrest, approximately $3.5 billion of 
the $3.7 billion in the MadoffSecurities accounts at JPMC had been withdrawn to pay 
customer redemptions. 
83. 
On the day of Madoff s arrest, the Head of Due Diligence e-mailed the Equity Exotics 
Analyst who had drafted the October 16 Memo: "Can't say I'm surprised, can you?" The 
Equity Exotics Analyst replied: "No." On the same day, the EMEA BSA Officer who 
caused the U.K. Report to be filed stating that Madoffs returns appeared "too good to be 
true" e-mailed JPMC's BSA Officer and head of JPMC's AML department that Madoff 
Securities, "was the hedge fund that we reported 6 weeks ago and which I never had a 
one to one with you on. It came to pass." Additionally, on the same day, the JPMC head 
of structured products e-mailed the Global Head of Equities about the amount JPMC had 
been able to redeem from Madoff feeder funds before Madoffs arrest, commenting "we 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 41 of 50
got this one right at least - I said it looked too good to be true on that call with you in 
Sep[tember]." Finally, on the same day, the CRO e-mailed senior JPMC executives and 
wrote that with respect to Madoff, "we actually look like we have some clue of what 
we're doing," reporting that the investment bank had "got out of all but $36 mio 
[million]" of"$200 mio (down from the $1 bio that [an investment bank executive] 
pushed hard for last year)." The CRO wrote further that the Chief Investment Officer of 
JPMC's private bank had "told us a lot of our Private Bank customers have invested with 
Madoff but luckily we didn't place any there." 
84. 
On March 12, 2009, Madoffpleaded guilty to securities fraud, wire fraud, money 
laundering, and related offenses, and was subsequently sentenced to 150 years' 
imprisonment. These offenses, and others, were committed through transactions using 
Madoffs 703 Account at JPMC. 
85. 
After Madoffs arrest, JPMC AML personnel examined the 703 Account transactions and 
filed a series of SARs relating to suspicious transactions in that account. JPMC did not 
file any SAR in the United States relating to Madoff prior to his arrest.

_________________ ) 
Plaintiff the United States of America (the "Government"), by its attorney Preet Bharara, 
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, for its verified complaint (the 
"Complaint") alleges, upon information and belief, as follows: 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
This action is brought by the Government pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 981 
seeking forfeiture of certain property traceable to the Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernard L. 
Madoff ("Madoff'), which was conducted through a demand deposit account, and other linked 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 44 of 50
accounts, maintained at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., its affiliates, and their predecessors 
(collectively and separately, "JPMC"). 
2. 
By this Complaint, the Government seeks forfeiture of all right, title 
and interest in $1,700,000,000 in United States currency (the "Defendant Funds"), which JPMC 
has agreed to forfeit to the United States pursuant to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement. 
3. 
Upon entry of a final order forfeiting the Defendant Funds to the United 
States, the Government intends to distribute the funds to victims of the fraud, consistent with the 
applicable Department of Justice regulations, through the ongoing remission process. See 21 
U.S.C. § 853(i)(l) and 28 C.F.R. Part 9. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
4. 
This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U .S.C. 
§§ 1345 and 1355. 
5. 
Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § ]355(b)(l)(A) because acts 
and omissions giving rise to the forfeiture took place in the Southern District of New York. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
6. 
The Government's claims for forfeiture arise out of the investigation of 
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, and its predecessor, Bernard L. Madoff 
Investment Securities ( collectively and separately, "Madoff Securities"). 
7. 
At all relevant times to this Complaint, Madoff Securities had its 
principal place of business in New York, New York. Madoff Securities operated three principal 
lines of business: 
market making, proprietary trading, and investment advisory. 
Madoff 
Securities was registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") 
as a broker-dealer since in or about 1960 and as an investment adviser since in or about August 
2006. Madoff was the founder of Madoff Securities and its sole owner. 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 45 of 50
8. 
For more than three decades, the Madoff Securities investment advisory 
business was a massive, multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme. From at least as early as the 1970s 
through Madoff' s arrest on December 11, 2008, Madoff and his co-conspirators fraudulently 
promised investors in Madoff Securities that their money would be invested in stocks, options, 
and other securities of well-known corporations. Contrary to these representations, investor 
money was in fact virtually never invested as promised. Instead, the Madoff Securities 
investment advisory business operated as a massive Ponzi scheme in which some investors were 
paid with money "invested" by different investors, and other proceeds were used to personally 
benefit Madoff and the people around him. At the time of its collapse in December 2008, 
Madoff Securities maintained more than 4,000 investment advisory client accounts, which 
purported to have a combined balance of approximately $65 billion. In fact, Madoff Securities 
had only approximately $300 million in assets at the time. 
9. 
From in or about October 1986 through Madoff' s arrest on December 
11, 2008, the Madoff Ponzi scheme was conducted almost exclusively through a demand deposit 
account and other linked cash and brokerage accow1ts held at JPMC. During that time period, 
virtually all client investments were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at 
JPMC, and virtually all client "redemptions" were paid from a linked disbursement account, also 
held by Madoff Securities at JPMC. 
I 0. 
On March 12, 2009, in connection with the Ponzi scheme operated 
through Madoff Securities, Madoff pleaded guilty to Information 09 Cr. 213 (DC), which 
charged him with securities fraud, investment advisor fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, two counts 
of international money laundering, money laundering, false statements, perjury, false filings with 
the SEC, and theft from an employee benefit plan. Among other things, Madoff admitted that 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 46 of 50
despite his promise to clients and prospective clients that he would invest their money in shares 
of common stock, options, and other securities of well-known corporations, he in fact almost 
never invested those clients' funds in the securities as he had promised. Madoff further admitted 
that he attempted to conceal his fraud by, among other things, issuing false account statements 
and otherwise deceiving his investment advisory clients, lying to regulators, and wiring money 
between Madoff Securities and its London-based affiliate to create the impression that Madoff 
Securities was actually trading securities. 
11. 
On June 29, 2009, the Honorable Denny Chin sentenced Madoff to 150 
years' imprisonment and criminal forfeiture. 
THE DEFENDANT IN REM 
12. 
On or about January 6, 2014, JPMC entered into a Deferred Prosecution 
Agreement with the United States. Pursuant to that agreement, JPMC agreed to forfeit to the 
United States $1,700,000,000, i.e., the Defendant Funds. 
The Defendant Funds represent 
proceeds of Madoffs fraud, and constitute some of the billions of dollars that flowed through the 
Madoff Securities accounts at JPMC during the course of the Ponzi scheme, including from the 
point in October 2008 that JPMC reported to regulators in the United Kingdom that JPMC had 
suspicions about the legitimacy of Madoff Securities. 
13. 
Specifically, on or about October 29, 2008, JPMC filed a repmt with 
the United Kingdom Serious Organised Crime Agency ("SOCA") pursuant to the U.K. Proceeds 
of Crime Act. In that report, which identified Madoff Securities as its "Main Subject - Suspect," 
JPMC reported that, among other things, "the investment performance achieved by [the Madoff 
Securities) funds ... is so consistently and significantly ahead of its peers year-on-year, even in 
the prevailing market conditions, as to appear too good to be true - meaning that it probably is." 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 47 of 50
JPMC reported that, "[a]s a result," it had submitted redemption requests for more than $300 
million of its own funds, which were invested in Mad off Securities "feeder" funds. 
14. 
Between the date of JPMC's report to SOCA and the date of Madoff's 
arrest, the balance of the Madoff Securities accounts at JPMC fell from approximately $3 billion, 
to approximately $234 million as a result of withdrawals paid to Madoff's investors as fictitious 
redemptions. The $1.7 billion that JPMC has agreed to forfeit to the United States pursuant to 
the Deferred Prosecution Agreement represents a portion of the funds leaving the Madoff 
Securities accounts at JPMC from October 29, 2008 (i.e., the date of JPMC's report to SOCA) 
until Madoff' s arrest on December 11, 2008, and is in an amount substantially greater than the 
value of all the funds redeemed by JPMC from the Madoff-linked feeder funds. 
15. 
The Deferred Prosecution Agreement and accompanying Statement of 
Facts are attached as Exhibit I, and are incorporated fully into this Complaint as if they had been 
set forth herein. 
CLAIM FOR FORFEITURE 
(18 U.S.C. § 98l(a)(l)(C)) 
I 6. 
The Government incorporates by reference paragraphs I through 15 
above as if fully set forth herein. 
17. 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 98l(a)(l)(C), "[a]ny property, real or personal, 
which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to ... any offense constituting 'specified 
unlawful activity' ... , or a conspiracy to commit such offense," is subject to forfeiture to the 
Government. 
18. 
"Specified unlawful activity" is defined in I 8 U .S.C. § 1956( c )(7) to 
include, among other things, any offense listed under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Section I 961(1) lists, 

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 26-1     Filed 07/06/23     Page 48 of 50
among other things, violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), and "fraud 
in the sale of securities." 
19. 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(2)(A), for purposes of the civil 
forfeiture statutes, "proceeds" refers to "property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly, as a 
result of the commission of the offense giving rise to forfeiture, and any property traceable 
thereto, and is not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense." 
20. 
As a result, the Defendant Funds are subject to forfeiture to the United 
States of America, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 98l(a)(l)(C), because the Defendant Funds constitute 
property derived from Madoff's mail fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE plaintiff, the United States of America, requests that judgment be 
entered in its favor and against the Defendant Funds, and that process issue to enforce the 
forfeiture of the Defendant Funds, and that all persons having an interest in the Defendant Funds 
be cited to appear and show cause why the forfeiture should not be decreed, and that this Court 
decree forfeiture of the Defendant Funds to the United States of America for disposition 
according to law, and that this Court grant the Government such further relief as this Court may 
deem just and proper, together with the costs and disbursements in this action.

creating any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of any such series shall have no voting power
whatsoever.
FIFTH      The by-laws may be made, altered, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors. The books of the
Corporation (subject to the provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware) may be kept outside of the State of
Delaware at such places as from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors.
SIXTH      (1)  To the fullest extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it exists on the
date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors,
no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.
(2)    The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or any other person who is serving at the request of the Corporation in any such
capacity with another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including,
without limitation, any employee benefit plan) to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be
amended, and any such indemnification may continue as to any person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and may inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.
(3)    By action of its Board of Directors, notwithstanding any interest of the directors in the action,
the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, in such amounts as the Board of Directors
deems appropriate, to protect any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or any
other person who is serving at the request of the Corporation in any such capacity with another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any
employee benefit plan) against any liability asserted against him or incurred by him in any such
capacity or arising out of his status as such (including, without limitation, expenses, judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement) to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended, and
whether or not the Corporation would have the power or would be required to indemnify any such
person under the terms of any agreement or by-law or the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware. For purposes of this paragraph (3), "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to any employee benefit plan.
SEVENTH       (1)    Any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Common Stock of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
and may not be effected by any consent in writing.
(2)    Whenever the vote of holders of shares of any class or series other than Common Stock at a
meeting thereof is required or permitted to be taken for or in connection with any corporate action
by any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the meeting and vote of
such stockholders may be dispensed with if such action is taken with the written consent of such
holders representing not less than a majority of the voting power of all the capital stock of such
class or series entitled to be voted upon such action if a meeting were held; provided that in no case
shall the written consent be by such holders having less than the minimum percentage of the vote
required by statute for such action, and provided that prompt notice is given in writing to all such
stockholders entitled to vote thereon of the taking of corporate action without a meeting and by less
than unanimous written consent.
(3)    Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.
EIGHTH      The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

§ 261.2(c), non-public information of the Office of the Comptroller of the

of this Order and remain subject to the standard confidentiality requirements of the BSA and its 
implementing regulations.

Currency or the former Office of Thrift Supervision as set forth in 12 C.F.R. 
§ 4.32(b), exempt information of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
as set forth in 12 C.F.R. §§ 309.2, 309.5, and 309.6, and confidential 
information of the Consumer Financial Protection Board as set forth in 12 
C.F.R. § 1070.2, and any other records concerning supervision, regulation,

regulator or government agency unless authorized by the appropriate 
regulatory authority (“CSI-Protected Information”); or 
h.
any other category of information hereinafter given confidential status by 
the Court. 
3.
With respect to the Confidential portion of any Discovery Material other than 
deposition transcripts and exhibits, the producing person or that person’s counsel may designate 
such portion as “Confidential” by stamping or otherwise clearly marking as “Confidential” the 
protected portion in a manner that will not interfere with legibility or audibility, and by also 
producing for future public use another copy of said Discovery Material with the confidential 
information redacted.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein is intended to prevent a party 
from designating the entirety of a given document as “Confidential” if the party reasonably 
believes the entire document falls within one or more of the categories in paragraph 2, above.  With 
respect to deposition transcripts and exhibits, a producing person or that person’s counsel may 
indicate on the record that a question calls for Confidential information, in which case the transcript 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 27     Filed 07/06/23     Page 3 of 12

of the designated testimony shall be bound in a separate volume and marked “Confidential 
Information Governed by Protective Order” by the reporter. 
4.
If at any time prior to the trial of this action, a producing person realizes that some 
portion[s] of Discovery Material that that person previously produced without limitation should 
be designated as Confidential, he may so designate by so apprising all parties in writing, and such 
designated portion[s] of the Discovery Material will thereafter be treated as Confidential under the 
terms of this Order.  If a party has disclosed such designated portion[s] of Discovery Material to 
anyone other than the individuals set forth in paragraph 5 below, that party shall make reasonable 
efforts to promptly retrieve such Discovery Material, and inform any recipient of the terms of the 
Order.
5.
With the exception of the qualifications pertaining to BSA-Protected Information, 
SAR-Protected Information and/or CSI-Protected Information in paragraph 6, no person subject 
to this Order other than the producing person shall disclose any of the Discovery Material, 
designated by the producing person as Confidential excluding any material containing BSA-
Protected Information, SAR-Protected Information and/or CSI-Protected Information to any other 
person whomsoever, except to: 
a.
the parties to this action; 
b.
counsel retained specifically for this action, including any paralegal, clerical 
and other assistant employed by such counsel and assigned to this matter; 
c.

d.

testify at trial or deposition in this action, provided such person has first

executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as an Exhibit 
hereto;

action (including but not limited to professional jury or trial consultants, 
mock jurors, and persons or entities providing litigation support services – 
such as photocopying, videotaping, translating, preparing exhibits or 
demonstrations, and processing, hosting, organizing, storing, or retrieving 
data in any form or medium – and their employees and subcontractors), 
provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the 
form annexed as an Exhibit hereto;
f.
any mediator or other dispute-resolution personnel, or any employee 
thereof, provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure 
Agreement in the form annexed as Exhibit hereto;

insurance policies that do or may provide insurance coverage applicable to 
this action;
h.

and videographers engaged to record depositions conducted in this action; 
and
i.
the Court and its support personnel. 
6.
No person subject to this Order shall disclose any BSA-Protected Information, 
SAR-Protected Information, and/or CSI-Protected Information to any other person whomsoever, 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 27     Filed 07/06/23     Page 5 of 12

except to the following persons, consistent with any authorization received from the appropriate 
regulatory authority: 
a.
the parties and their counsel, including any paralegal, clerical and other 
assistant employed by such counsel and assigned to this matter; 
b.
any witness employed or formerly employed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or any witness who serves or formerly served 
on the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. or JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., who counsel for the parties in good faith believes may be called 
to testify at trial or deposition in this action, provided such person has first 
executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form annexed as an Exhibit 
hereto; 
c.
any person retained by the parties to serve as an expert witness or otherwise 
provide specialized advice to counsel in connection with this action, 
provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the 
form annexed as an Exhibit hereto; 
d.
stenographers engaged to transcribe depositions conducted in this action 
and videographers engaged to record depositions conducted in this action 
provided such person has first executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the 
form annexed as Exhibit hereto; and
e.
the Court and its support personnel. 
7.
Prior to any disclosure of any Confidential Discovery Material to any person 
referred to in subparagraphs 5(d), 5(e), or 5(f) above, such person shall be provided by counsel 
with a copy of this Protective Order and shall sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 27     Filed 07/06/23     Page 6 of 12

annexed as an Exhibit hereto stating that that person has read this Order and agrees to be bound by 
its terms. Said counsel shall retain each signed Non-Disclosure Agreement, hold it in escrow, and 
produce it to opposing counsel either prior to such person being permitted to testify (at deposition 
or trial) or at the conclusion of the case, whichever comes first. 
8.
All Confidential Discovery Material filed with the Court, and all portions of 
pleadings, motions or other papers filed with the Court that disclose such Confidential Discovery 
Material, shall be filed under seal with the Clerk of the Court and kept under seal until further 
order of the Court. The parties will use their best efforts to minimize such sealing. In any event, 
any party filing a motion or any other papers with the Court under seal shall also publicly file a 
redacted copy of the same, via the Court’s Electronic Case Filing system, that redacts only the 
Confidential Discovery Material itself, and not text that in no material way reveals the Confidential 
Discovery Material. 
9.
Any party who either objects to any designation of confidentiality, or who, by 
contrast, requests still further limits on disclosure (such as “attorneys’ eyes only” in extraordinary 
circumstances), may at any time prior to the trial of this action serve upon counsel for the 
designating person a written notice stating with particularity the grounds of the objection or 
request. If agreement cannot be reached promptly, counsel for all affected persons will convene a 
joint telephone call with the Court to obtain a ruling. 
10.
All persons are hereby placed on notice that the Court is unlikely to seal or 
otherwise afford confidential treatment to any Discovery Material introduced in evidence at trial, 
even if such material has previously been sealed or designated as Confidential. The Court also 
retains unfettered discretion whether or not to afford confidential treatment to any Confidential 
Document or information contained in any Confidential Document submitted to the Court in 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 27     Filed 07/06/23     Page 7 of 12

connection with any motion, application, or proceeding that may result in an order and/or decision 
by the Court. 
11.
Each person who has access to Discovery Material that has been designated as 
Confidential shall take all due precautions to prevent the unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of 
such material. 
12.
If, in connection with this litigation, a party inadvertently discloses information 
subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protection, including any 
privilege or immunity from production associated with BSA, SAR-Related Information, and/or 
CSI (“Inadvertently Disclosed Information”), such disclosure shall not constitute or be deemed a 
waiver or forfeiture of any claim of privilege or work product or such other applicable protection 
with respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information and its subject matter.  For avoidance of 
doubt, outside of authorization from an appropriate regulatory authority, the disclosure of BSA, 
SAR-Related Information and/or CSI shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of 
any claim of privilege or work product or such other applicable protection with respect to such 
information.
13.
If a disclosing party makes a claim of inadvertent disclosure, the receiving party 
shall not thereafter review the Inadvertently Disclosed Information for any purpose, except by 
order of the Court. The receiving party shall, within five business days, return or destroy all copies 
of the Inadvertently Disclosed Information, and provide a certification of counsel that all such 
information has been returned or destroyed. 
14.
Within five business days of the notification that such Inadvertently Disclosed 
Information has been returned or destroyed, the disclosing party shall produce a privilege log with 
respect to the Inadvertently Disclosed Information. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 27     Filed 07/06/23     Page 8 of 12

15.
As with any information redacted or withheld, the receiving party may move the 
Court for an Order compelling production of the Inadvertently Disclosed Information. The motion 
shall be filed under seal, and shall not assert as a ground for entering such an Order the fact or 
circumstances of the inadvertent production. 
16.
The disclosing party retains the burden of establishing the privileged or protected 
nature of any Inadvertently Disclosed Information. Nothing in this Order shall limit the right of 
any party to request an in camera review of the Inadvertently Disclosed Information. 
17.
This Protective Order shall survive the termination of the litigation. Within 30 days 
of the final disposition of this action, all Discovery Material designated as “Confidential,” and all 
copies thereof, shall be promptly returned to the producing person, or, upon permission of the 
producing person, destroyed.  For the avoidance of doubt, counsel of record in this action shall be 
permitted to keep copies of filings and work product that incorporates any Confidential Discovery 
Material, so long as counsel continues to treat such Confidential Discovery Material in accordance 
with this Order.
18.
This Court shall retain jurisdiction over all persons subject to this Order to the 
extent necessary to enforce any obligations arising hereunder or to impose sanctions for any 
contempt thereof.

Defendant James E. “Jes” Staley respectfully submits this Memorandum of Law in Support 
of his Motion To Dismiss the Verified Amended Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint 
(“Complaint” or “Compl.”) pursuant to Rules 9(b), 12(b)(6), and 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  Mr. Staley expressly adopts and incorporates by reference the arguments advanced in 
the Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss the Complaint filed by 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan”) and related Defendants on July 6, 2023.  See ECF No. 25. 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Plaintiffs allege that the directors and officers of JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, failed 
to implement any compliance systems to review the bank’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein—the 
bank’s most controversial client—and ignored countless red flags concerning his financial 
activities, ultimately harming the company after Epstein’s criminal proclivities were exposed.  One 
of the officers whom Plaintiffs have sued on this theory is Jes Staley, the former head of the bank’s 
investment banking division, who left JPMorgan more than a decade ago.  Plaintiffs’ claims 
against Mr. Staley fail at the threshold for multiple reasons. 
Having declined to make a demand on the board before filing this derivative suit, Plaintiffs 
must show that JPMorgan’s current board of directors could not be trusted to bring claims against 
its officers and directors.  Plaintiffs cannot make this showing as to Mr. Staley, given that the 
bank—under the leadership of the very same board—already sued Mr. Staley earlier this year, in 
this very Court, on the same factual allegations.  Moreover, the two claims against Mr. Staley (in 
Counts II and III) fail to state a claim because Plaintiffs fail to plead (i) any allegations that Mr. 
Staley actually owed the supervisory duties that they accuse him of breaching, or (ii) any basis to 
toll the statute of limitations for claims that accrued more a decade ago.  Finally, the doctrine of 
claim splitting bars any repetitive claims against Mr. Staley by JPMorgan, which this derivative 
suit clearly is.  The Court should dismiss the claims against Mr. Staley.

BACKGROUND 
Parties  
Nominal Defendant JPMorgan Chase & Co. (as previously defined, “JPMorgan”) is a 
Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, New York, that provides financial and 
investment services as the nation’s largest banking institution.  Compl. ¶ 32. Plaintiffs are two 
pension funds that currently hold JPMorgan common stock, and which purport to bring derivative 
claims on JPMorgan’s behalf.  Id. ¶¶ 29-31.   
There are two sets of individual defendants in this case, the “Director Defendants” and the 
“Officer Defendants.”  JPMorgan’s current CEO and Board Chairman James “Jamie” Dimon is 
sued in both capacities. 
Director Defendants.  Stephen B. Burke, Todd A. Combs, James S. Crown1, Timothy P. 
Flynn, Mellody Hobson, John W. Kessler, Phebe N. Novakovic, and Dimon are current or former 
directors of JPMorgan’s board.  Id. ¶¶ 33-39.  All except Kessler were members of the so-called 
“Demand Board,” i.e., the twelve-member Board of Directors tasked with managing the bank’s 
affairs at the time this lawsuit was filed in May 2023.  Id. ¶ 188.   
Officer Defendants.  Besides Dimon, the only other Officer Defendant is Jes Staley, a 
former executive who left the bank in 2013 after serving as head of the firm’s Investment Bank 
since 2009.  Id. ¶ 42.  Mr. Staley previously occupied several roles within the bank’s Asset 
Management division, where he interacted with financier Jeffrey Epstein, a client of the bank.  Id. 
¶ 109.  Mr. Staley never served on the company’s Board of Directors.  Id. ¶¶ 40, 42. 
Upon information and belief, Mr. Crown died on June 25, 2023, seven weeks after this suit was 
filed.  See Suggestion of Death, ECF No. 23.

A. 

The Alleged Wrongdoing2 
The allegations underlying this lawsuit are familiar to the Court.  See Op. and Order, Jane 
Doe v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 1:22-cv-10019-JSR, ECF No. 102; Op. and Order, Gov’t of 
the U.S. Virgin Islands v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 1:22-cv-10904-JSR, ECF, No. 130.  As 
relevant here, the Plaintiff pension funds allege that Defendants facilitated a colossal breakdown 
in compliance and oversight requirements in JPMorgan’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, 
resulting in harm to the bank. 
According to the Complaint, even before the bank first onboarded Epstein as a client in 
1998, he was a well-known and controversial figure, and thus a “high-risk, but high-reward, 
client.”  Compl. ¶ 62.  Such a client should have undergone robust due-diligence review, id. ¶¶ 63-
64, in part due to his notoriety and in part because—as a global financial institution—JPMorgan 
was subject to numerous laws and regulations requiring certain internal controls to monitor client 
activity, id. ¶¶ 49-60.  
The Complaint further alleges that, once onboarded as a client, Epstein should have 
received additional scrutiny from the bank, principally because of the well-publicized charges of 
sexual abuse that eventually led to his arrest, incarceration, and registration as a sex offender in 
2008.  Id. ¶¶ 113-33.  Although the bank terminated Epstein as a client in 2013, id. ¶ 158, Plaintiffs 
allege that, for several years before then, JPMorgan ignored certain “red-flag” evidence of 
Epstein’s possible sex trafficking, including (i) his prodigious cash withdrawals, (ii) his frequent 
transporting of women on international flights via private jet, and (iii) his suspicious foreign 
Although he vigorously denies many of the allegations in this case, Mr. Staley treats as true the 
Complaint’s factual allegations for purposes of this motion.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 8 of 27
B. 

remittances.  Id. ¶¶ 145, 154, 159-69.  According to the Complaint, JPMorgan failed to follow 
through on investigating such activity and reporting it to the authorities.  Id. ¶¶ 154-62, 169.  
As to Mr. Staley specifically, the Complaint alleges that, at the very outset of the 
relationship, the bank tasked Mr. Staley with “managing Epstein as a client,” and that over time, 
the two developed a personal friendship.  Id. ¶¶ 109-10.  Other executives and departments of 
JPMorgan, however, were aware of and responsible for keeping tabs on Epstein’s activities and 
the risks he posed to the bank.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 146-47, 149-55.   
Procedural History 
On November 24, 2022, “Jane Doe”—a purported victim of Epstein’s trafficking—sued 
JPMorgan on putative class claims for negligence and violation of the Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act.  See Compl., Jane Doe v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 1:22-cv-10019-JSR, ECF 
No. 1.  The U.S. Virgin Islands similarly sued the bank a few weeks later.  Compl., Gov’t of the 
U.S. Virgin Islands v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 1:22-cv-10904-JSR, ECF No. 1.  JPMorgan 
subsequently impleaded Mr. Staley into both cases, suing him for, inter alia, (i) breach of his 
fiduciary duties, and (ii) violation of the “faithless servant” doctrine, based on alleged misconduct 
in Mr. Staley’s interaction with Epstein as a client.  See Third-Party Compls., ECF Nos. 59, 130.  
The litigation between JPMorgan and Mr. Staley remains ongoing. 
In May 2023—roughly six months after the above-mentioned Jane Doe lawsuit—the first 
pension fund Plaintiff filed this derivative action.  (Initial) Compl., ECF No. 1.  The second 
Plaintiff filed suit roughly six weeks later, and—following consolidation—the two funds jointly 
filed the operative Amended Complaint on June 30, 2023.  ECF No. 17.  The Amended Complaint 
asserts three causes of action: (i) breach of fiduciary duty against the Director Defendants (Count 
I), (ii) breach of fiduciary duty against the Officer Defendants (Count II), and unjust enrichment 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 9 of 27
C. 

against both Defendant groups (Count III).  Compl. ¶¶ 200-20.  As to all three Counts, the crux of 
the allegations is that Defendants—including Mr. Staley—breached their fiduciary duties to 
JPMorgan by “ignoring red flags related to Epstein’s actions and failing to adhere to their own 
internal controls,” or “knowingly disregarding their own internal controls,” such that Epstein’s 
activities continued uninterrupted, and the bank later suffered financial and reputational damages 
as a result of its commercial relationship with him.  Id. ¶¶ 211-13.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that 
these alleged failings occurred more than a decade ago, but suggest that the untimeliness of their 
lawsuits can be excused by “concerted and long-running efforts to conceal critical facts” by 
unnamed individuals at JPMorgan.  Id. ¶ 197. 
Although Plaintiffs filed derivatively on behalf of Nominal Defendant JPMorgan, neither 
pension fund made a pre-suit demand on the Board, and instead they contend that demand should 
be excused as futile.  Id. ¶ 185.  In this regard, the Demand Board—i.e., the persons who would 
have received and considered a demand, had Plaintiffs made one—consisted of twelve members, 
seven of whom are Defendants: Burke, Combs, Crown, Dimon, Flynn, Hobson, and Novakovic; 
and five of whom are not: Linda B. Bammann, Alicia Boler Davis, Alex Gorsky, Michael A. Neal, 
and Virginia Rometty.  Id. ¶ 188.   
Plaintiffs concede that three of the twelve Demand Board members—Davis, Gorsky, and 
Rometty—face no conflicts and are thus independent for purposes of assessing litigation demands.  
Id. ¶¶ 189-92.  For the remaining members, Plaintiffs predictably allege that all seven Defendant 
members of the Demand Board are biased due to their own potential liability on the claims at issue.  
Id. ¶ 189.  Plaintiffs state that Michael Neal faces “a substantial likelihood of liability” in this 
action or related actions, but he is not a defendant and there is no further explanation.  Id.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 10 of 27

The Complaint also alleges a lack of independence, contending that non-defendant director 
Bammann is not independent from Dimon because she “owes a significant portion of her 
professional success” to him based on (i) her previous work roles under him at Bank One from 
2001 to 2004 and at JPMorgan in 2005, and (ii) the fact that she joined JPMorgan’s board when 
he was chairman.  Id. ¶ 193.  The Complaint similarly contends that Defendant Crown, too, lacks 
independence from Dimon because he (i) served on the board of directors at Bank One while 
Dimon was its CEO, and (ii) later “advocated” for Dimon to assume a leadership role at JPMorgan.  
Id. ¶ 194.  Defendant Novakovic, in turn, is allegedly not independent from Crown because she is 
currently CEO and Chair of General Dynamics, which is “Crown’s family business.”  Id. ¶ 195. 
ARGUMENT 
Mr. Staley is a Defendant as to Counts II and III of the Complaint.  Both claims are fatally 
deficient for multiple reasons.  First, Plaintiffs do not (and cannot) show that making a demand of 
JPMorgan’s board would have been futile given that the company is already suing Mr. Staley in 
this very Court.  Nor do Plaintiffs meet their high burden to show that the board lacks impartiality 
to weigh litigation against all Defendants generally.  Second, the claims against Mr. Staley are 
substantively deficient because they fail to allege (i) any basis to conclude that Mr. Staley had the 
supervisory duties that they accuse him of breaching, or (ii) any basis to toll the expired limitations 
periods on claims that accrued long ago under New York law.  Lastly, the doctrine of claim 
splitting bars the repetitive claims against Mr. Staley by JPMorgan that this suit seeks to advance. 
I. 
Plaintiffs Have Failed To Show That Demand on the Board Is Excused. 
It is a “‘cardinal precept’” of Delaware law3 that “directors, rather than shareholders, 
manage the business and affairs of the corporation,” including by deciding whether and whom to 
“In determining whether demand is required or excused, the Court applies the substantive law of 
Delaware, JPMorgan’s state of incorporation.”  Cent. Laborers’ Pension Fund v. Dimon, 2014 WL 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 11 of 27

sue for alleged harm to the business.  United Food & Com. Workers Union v. Zuckerberg, 262 
A.3d 1034, 1047 (Del. 2021) (en banc) (quoting Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 811 (Del. 1984)).  
Because a derivative suit “encroaches on the managerial freedom of directors,” id., Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 23.1 requires that a stockholder bringing such a suit either (1) make a demand 
on the board, or (2) show why a demand would be futile.  Id.  This demand requirement “is not 
excused lightly,” id. at 1049, and a complaint must “state with particularity” the reasons for not 
obtaining the board’s approval “or not making the effort.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1(b)(3).  As courts 
have observed, this is an “atypically rigorous” pleading requirement, In re SAIC Inc. Derivative 
Litig., 948 F. Supp. 2d 366, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff’d, 553 F. App’x 54 (2d Cir. 2014), so 
“surviving a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Rule 23.1 is a difficult feat.”  Brewer v. 
Breen, 2018 WL 565267, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2018) (internal quotation and citation omitted). 
Where, as here, a plaintiff admits that it made no demand of the board but alleges that its 
failure to do so may be excused as futile, its pleadings must show that the current board of directors 
was “incapable of making an impartial decision regarding the pursuit of the litigation.”  Wood v. 
Baum, 953 A.2d 136, 140 (Del. 2008).  This showing requires a well-supported rationale as to why 
the board could not be relied on to press claims aggressively against the would-be defendants, such 
as that certain members of the board would face a personal risk of liability in the litigation, or 
would be “beholden” to those who would.  As explained below, Plaintiffs cannot make the required 
showing here. 
3639185, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014), aff’d, 638 F. App’x 34 (2d Cir. 2016); see Kamen v. 
Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 108-09 (1991). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 12 of 27

Plaintiffs Cannot Show Demand Futility as to Mr. Staley Because the Bank 
Has Already Sued Him on the Same Allegations. 
The Court need not undertake a standard demand-futility analysis here because there can 
be no doubt of the Demand Board’s ability—and willingness—to sue Mr. Staley for the events at 
issue.  As this Court is well aware, JPMorgan has already sued Mr. Staley for breach of fiduciary 
duty based on the identical alleged acts underlying this derivative action.  See Third-Party Compls., 
Doe v. JPMorgan, 1:22-cv-10019-JSR, ECF No. 59; USVI v. JPMorgan, 1:22-cv-10904-JSR, 
ECF, No. 130.  Indeed, the bank did so less than four months ago, and no director left or joined 
the company’s board since Plaintiffs initiated this suit.  See generally Compl. ¶¶ 33-39, 188.   
In short, the very same Demand Board that Plaintiffs declined to petition has already done 
what Plaintiffs claim it would never do if asked.  For that reason alone, Plaintiffs’ failure to make 
that demand cannot be excused.  See, e.g., In re Delta & Pine Land Co. S'holders Litig., 2000 WL 
875421, at *6 (Del. Ch. June 21, 2000) (“[T]he existence of a board-initiated action conclusively 
defeats any claim that demand would have been futile.”); Richardson, as Tr. of Richardson Living 
Tr. v. Clark, 2020 WL 7861335, at *12 (Del. Ch. Dec. 31, 2020) (dismissing claim where the 
“Demand Board would . . . have been able to apply its business judgement to a demand”). 
Plaintiffs’ Allegations That the Board Could Not Impartially Consider a 
Litigation Demand Fall Short. 
Under a standard demand-futility analysis, a court presumes that directors are independent 
and faithful to their fiduciary duties, In re Am. Int’l Grp., Inc. Derivative Litig., 415 F. App’x 285, 
286 (2d Cir. 2011), and thus to show futility, a plaintiff must establish one of the following three 
things for at least half the members of the demand board: (1) that the member “received a material 
personal benefit” from the misconduct alleged in the lawsuit; (2) that he “faces a substantial 
likelihood of liability” on a particular claim; or (3) that he “lacks independence” from someone 
who meets one of the first two criteria.  Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d at 1058 (adopting three-prong test); 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 13 of 27
A. 
B. 

see also Patel v. Duncan, 2021 WL 4482157, at *18 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2021) (confirming 
Zuckerberg test), aff’d, 227 A.3d 1257 (Del. 2022).  And because futility is assessed “on a claim-
by-claim basis,” Lambrecht v. O’Neal, 504 F. App’x 23, 26 (2d Cir. 2012); accord Beam v. 
Stewart, 833 A.2d 961, 977 n.48 (Del. Ch. 2003), aff’d, 845 A.2d 1040 (Del. 2004), a plaintiff 
must make this showing independently for each claim at issue. 
Here, Plaintiffs make no allegation of a “material personal benefit” to any director,4 so to 
establish futility as to both Counts II and III against Mr. Staley, they appear to rely exclusively on 
prongs two and three of the test from Zuckerberg identified above.  They do not succeed.  
1. 
Demand Is Not Excused for Claim II. 
Count II is a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Mr. Staley and Dimon, alleging 
that, in their capacity as “Officers” of JPMorgan, they ignored red flags related to Epstein’s 
banking activity and permitted the bank to neglect its reporting and compliance requirements.  
Compl. ¶¶ 208-15.  As to this claim, Plaintiffs make no showing of demand futility on any of the 
available Zuckerberg grounds.   
Zuckerberg Prong Two: The second Zuckerberg prong hinges on a director facing a 
“substantial likelihood” of personal liability were his company to bring the claim at issue.  Here, 
for Count II, the only persons whose conduct are at issue are Dimon and Mr. Staley, the “Officer 
Defendants.”  Compl. ¶¶ 208-15.  Of those two, only Dimon sits on the Demand Board.  None of 
remaining eleven members of the Board faces any liability on Count II, much less “a substantial 
likelihood of liability” as the law requires to show demand futility.  262 A.3d at 1058.  So a clear 
Indeed, several of the Demand Board members joined the board only after the bank terminated 
Epstein as a client, and thus they could not have benefited from any alleged actions by Dimon or 
Mr. Staley to conceal Epstein’s dealings over the course of bank’s relationship with him.  See, e.g., 
Compl. ¶¶ 37 (Combs joining 2016), 38 (Hobson joining 2018), 190 (Neal joining after 2013), 35 
(Novakovic joining 2020).   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 14 of 27

majority of the board directors could fairly assess a litigation demand against the Officer 
Defendants, as articulated in Count II of the Complaint.  See Melbourne Mun. Firefighters’ 
Pension Tr. Fund ex rel. Qualcomm, Inc. v. Jacobs, 2016 WL 4076369, at *13 (Del. Ch. Aug. 1, 
2016) (“It is unclear . . . how a majority of the Board could face a substantial likelihood of liability 
as to Count II when only two of the fifteen members of the Board . . . are included as Officer 
Defendants.”), aff’d, 158 A.3d 449 (Del. 2017) (unpublished table decision). 
Although the Court should not consider the board members’ potential liability on Count I 
when assessing demand futility as to Count II,5 Plaintiffs’ allegations of futility would still fall 
short even if the Court were to do so.  Because JPMorgan has adopted the exculpatory protections 
of Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law,6 the company’s directors face 
liability only for bad faith or disloyal conduct—e.g., knowingly engaging in illegal activity—not 
mere misjudgment or poor performance.  Stone ex rel. AmSouth Bancorporation v. Ritter, 911 
A.2d 362, 367 (Del. 2006) (en banc); Wood, 953 A.2d at 141.  To establish director liability under 
this standard, Plaintiffs attempt to plead a Caremark theory based on the directors’ knowing 
abdication of oversight duties,7 which requires particularized facts showing that the directors either 
(1) “utterly failed to implement any reporting or information system or controls,” or (2) after 
implementing such controls, “consciously failed to monitor or oversee [their] operations.”  Stone, 
As noted above, futility is a claim-by-claim determination.  Lambrecht, 504 F. App’x at 26. 
See 8 Del. C. § 102(b)(7).  “A serious threat of liability may only be found to exist if the plaintiff 
pleads a non-exculpated claim against the directors.”  Wood, 953 A.2d at 141; see Decl. of Audra 
J. Soloway, Ex. 2 at 4, ECF No. 26-1 (exculpating directors to “the fullest extent” permitted by 
Delaware law for breaches of fiduciary duty).   
The Director Defendants breached their fiduciary duties “either by ignoring red flags related to 
Epstein’s actions and failing to adhere to their own internal controls or by knowingly disregarding 
their own internal controls and intentionally allowing the Company to continue facilitating 
Epstein’s criminal conduct.”  Compl. ¶ 204.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 15 of 27

911 A.2d at 370 (emphases added); see also In re McDonald’s Corp. S’holder Derivative Litig., 
289 A.3d 343, 359-60 (Del. Ch. 2023) (distinguishing an “Information-Systems” Caremark claim 
from a “Red-Flags” claim).  Such a claim has been described as “possibly the most difficult theory 
in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment,” and Plaintiffs’ pleadings 
do not come close to satisfying the requirements.  In re Caremark Int’l Inc. Derivative Litig., 698 
A.2d 959, 967 (Del. Ch. 1996).8 
First, while the Complaint faults the Director Defendants for failing to install “an adequate 
oversight system” to ensure compliance, Compl. ¶ 180, this is not equivalent to alleging that the 
directors undertook no efforts at all, as the law requires.  Rojas ex rel. J.C. Penney Co., v. Ellison, 
2019 WL 3408812, at *9 (Del. Ch. July 29, 2019) (noting that “utterly” is a “linguistically extreme 
formulation”).  Indeed, the Complaint admits that JPMorgan had a “compliance team” that 
“repeatedly flagged” Epstein’s suspicious activity, bringing them to the attention of “[e]xecutives 
at the highest reaches” of the bank.  Compl. ¶ 181.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ grievances boil down to chides 
about the sufficiency of JPMorgan’s internal controls, e.g., ¶¶ 149, 154, 158, 169, not their 
existence.  This is a fatal failing, as courts routinely reject failure-of-oversight claims where, as 
here, a plaintiff acknowledges that the company had a regular compliance structure.  See, e.g., In 
re Gen. Motors Co. Derivative Litig., 2015 WL 3958724, at *14 (Del. Ch. June 26, 2015) (rejecting 
Caremark claim because company “had a system for reporting risk to the Board, but in [plaintiff’s] 
view it should have been a better system”), aff’d, 133 A.3d 971 (Del. 2016); In re LendingClub 
Such a showing is all the more difficult for director Michael Neal: Plaintiffs suggest that he could 
face substantial liability in this action or the Doe and USVI actions, Compl. ¶ 189, but he has not 
been sued in any case, and he did not even join the JPMorgan board until after the bank terminated 
Epstein as a client, id. ¶ 190. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 16 of 27

Corp. Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 5678578, at *9 n.59 & *18 (Del. Ch. Oct. 31, 2019) (dismissing 
Caremark claim because company had, inter alia, risk and audit committees).  
Plaintiffs fare no better on Caremark’s alternative theory of knowingly disregarding clear 
red flags.  Under this “Red-Flags” theory, liability exists only when “the directors were conscious 
of the fact that they were not doing their jobs.”  Horman v. Abney, 2017 WL 242571, at *10 (Del. 
Ch. Jan. 19, 2017).  Here, although the Complaint pleads a litany of alleged red flags (and ensuing 
management failures) in JPMorgan’s compliance and anti-money laundering systems, e.g., Compl. 
¶¶ 170-73, it is devoid of allegations of particularized knowledge or bad faith—i.e., “actual 
scienter”—by the individual directors who oversaw the bank.  Okla. Firefighters Pension & Ret. 
Sys. v. Corbat, 2017 WL 6452240, at *1 (Del. Ch. Dec. 18, 2017).9  Such conclusory allegations 
are insufficient, as Delaware courts reject the idea that “because illegal behavior occurred, internal 
controls must have been deficient, and the board must have known so.”  Horman, 2017 WL 
242571, at *7 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).  As these cases recognize, even well-
intentioned oversight cannot guarantee a company’s law-abiding behavior—especially when the 
company is the largest bank in the United States—and thus showing merely “that corporate 
wrongdoing has occurred” does not equate to showing that “directors failed to act in good 
faith.”  Id.  But that is precisely the logic of Plaintiffs’ allegations here.  Compl. ¶ 189.10 
Perhaps that silence is strategic.  After all, if Plaintiffs added factual allegations pertaining to 
each director—as it should to maintain a viable Caremark claim—then Plaintiff would find itself 
with a numbers problem.  Of the twelve members of the Demand Board, at most five served on the 
Board while Epstein was a client of the bank.  Compl. ¶ 190.  They are thus the only Demand 
Board members who could conceivably face liability under a Caremark theory for “consciously 
disregarding” red flags about Epstein banking activities at JPMorgan.   
Plaintiffs’ slapdash pleading is most evident in their decision to include Phebe Novakovic as a 
Director Defendant.  Ms. Novakovic plainly could not have “ignor[ed] red flags related to 
Epstein’s actions” or “knowingly . . . allow[ed] the Company to continue facilitating Epstein’s 
criminal conduct,”  Compl. ¶ 204, given that she did not join JPMorgan’s board until 2020, after 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 17 of 27

Zuckerberg Prong Three: The Complaint devotes a few lines to the idea that three 
Demand Board members—Bammann, Crown, Novakovic—lack independence because they are 
or were beholden to Jamie Dimon.  The arguments cannot withstand scrutiny.  Although it is true 
that Bammann worked under Dimon for five years, she did so nearly 20 years ago.  Compl. ¶ 193.  
And while Crown worked with Dimon at Bank One—and helped select him for a leadership role 
at JPMorgan—he did so as a director serving over Dimon, not in a manner that would make Crown 
beholden.  Id. ¶ 194.  Such prior business relationships “fall well short of what is required under 
Delaware law to establish that a director lacks independence.”  DiRienzo v. Lichtenstein, 2013 WL 
5503034, at *23 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2013) (rejecting allegations that director served on board of 
defendant’s outside portfolio companies); Franchi v. Firestone, 2021 WL 5991886, at *5 (Del. 
Ch. May 10, 2021) (director’s nomination to other boards by defendant did not destroy 
independence).  As one court has observed, the fact that directors of one company are also 
“colleagues at another institution does not mean that they will not or cannot exercise their own 
business judgment” when one or the other of them stands to lose or gain.  In re Dow Chem. Co. 
Derivative Litig., 2010 WL 66769, at *9 (Del. Ch. Jan. 11, 2010).  A fortiori, when two colleagues’ 
working relationship occurred a decade or more ago—as with Bammann and Dimon—inferring 
partiality is even less appropriate.  See Yucaipa Am. All. Fund II, L.P. v. Riggio, 1 A.3d 310, 315 
(Del. Ch. 2010) (rejecting lack-of-independence allegation based on director’s work as defendant’s 
subordinate ten years prior), aff’d, 15 A.3d 218 (Del. 2011) (unpublished table decision). 
The Complaint fares no better impugning the independence of Novakovic. Plaintiffs’ 
allegations of her partiality are entirely derivative of their arguments as to Crown.  Compl. ¶ 195.  
Epstein was already dead.  Id. ¶ 36.  While Plaintiffs have leveled serious allegations, they have 
not filed a serious complaint. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 18 of 27

That is, there is no allegation that Novakovic was herself beholden to Dimon—much less to Mr. 
Staley—but rather that she presently serves as CEO and Chair of “Crown’s family business,” and 
thus Crown’s purported beholdenness should be attributed to her as well.  Id. at 195 (“Crown likely 
has the influence to fire Novakovic.”).11  But even if Crown faced liability or his independence 
were somehow compromised—and, as noted above, neither is true—Plaintiffs’ claims as to 
Novakovic would still amount to nothing more than speculation, falling well short of overcoming 
the strong presumption that directors operate independently and faithfully in their fiduciary duties.  
See In re Am. Int’l Grp., Inc. Derivative Litig., 415 F. App’x at 286.  Indeed, the Complaint fails 
to plead whether Crown’s role at General Dynamics gave him “‘unilateral power,’ much less 
substantial sway, over [Novakovic’s] compensation or future job prospects,” which is what the 
law requires to establish a lack of independence.  Flannery v. Genomic Health, Inc., 2021 WL 
3615540, at *15 (Del. Ch. Aug. 16, 2021).   
2. 
Demand Is Not Excused for Count III. 
Aside from their claim in Count II for breach of fiduciary duty, Plaintiffs have also pleaded 
a claim against Mr. Staley in Count III for unjust enrichment.  Compl. ¶¶ 216-20.  Like all 
derivative claims, Count III must meet the same demand requirements as Count II.  So, for demand 
to be excused as futile, Plaintiffs must show, as to Count III specifically, that the board could not 
consider the claim impartially.  See MCG Cap. Corp. v. Maginn, 2010 WL 1782271, at *23-24 
(Del. Ch. May 5, 2010) (dismissing derivative claim for unjust enrichment because demand was 
not excused as futile). 
What Plaintiffs casually call “Crown’s family business” is in fact General Dynamics—a publicly 
traded Fortune 100 company with no controlling shareholder. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 19 of 27

For the same reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs cannot make this showing.  Count III 
differs from Count II only in that it is nominally a claim for unjust enrichment.  Compl. ¶ 218.  But 
Plaintiffs’ actual underlying theory of unjust enrichment—i.e., their basis to claim that Mr. Staley 
now possesses wealth that he should not have—depends entirely, and expressly, on their allegation 
that he breached his fiduciary duties to JPMorgan.  In Plaintiffs’ own words: 
It would be unconscionable and against fundamental principles of justice, 
equity, and good conscience for the Individual Defendants to retain the 
benefits that they received only by virtue of breaching their fiduciary duties. 
Id. ¶ 219.  Thus, the demand-futility showing fails for the same reasons.  See Reiter v. Fairbank, 
2016 WL 6081823, at *14 (Del. Ch. Oct. 18, 2016) (dismissing derivative breach of fiduciary duty 
and unjust enrichment claims under Rule 23.1); see also In re MetLife Inc. Derivative Litig., 2020 
WL 4746635, at *18 (Del. Ch. Aug. 17, 2020) (“A Rule 23.1 analysis for the unjust enrichment 
claim thus necessarily treads the same path as the demand futility analysis, implicates the same 
conduct, and, therefore, obtains the same result.” (cleaned up)). 
II. 
The Claims Against Mr. Staley Specifically Are Defective. 
Besides their failure to establish demand futility, Plaintiffs’ claims against Mr. Staley in 
Counts II and III are also fatally deficient for (i) failure to state a claim, and (ii) untimeliness under 
New York’s statute of limitations. 
Plaintiffs Fail To State a Claim Against Mr. Staley. 
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain sufficient 
factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. 
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “A claim has facial 
plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable 
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  While the Court must draw 
all reasonable inferences in the complaint’s favor, it need not accept as true “mere conclusions of 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 20 of 27
A. 

law or unwarranted deductions of fact.”  Petrosurance, Inc. v. Nat’l Ass’n of Ins. Comm’rs, 888 F. 
Supp. 2d 491, 502 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
As noted above, Count II alleges that Officer Defendants Dimon and Staley breached their 
fiduciary duties to JPMorgan by “ignoring red flags related to Epstein’s actions and failing to 
adhere to their own internal controls or by knowingly disregarding their own internal 
controls.”  Compl. ¶¶ 211-12.  As applied to Mr. Staley specifically—who was never a director, 
but only an officer—this claim falters on the well-settled principle that, unlike directors, who bear 
“ultimate responsibility” for the entire business,12 a corporate officer is merely an agent possessing 
only those powers and responsibilities delegated by the board.  In re McDonald’s, 289 A.3d at 
369.  While a company’s CEO and Chief Compliance Officer may have “company-wide oversight 
portfolios,” other officers “generally have a more constrained area of authority,” which necessarily 
entails limitations on the duties that they owe.  Id.  Accordingly, where, as here, a plaintiff brings 
a Caremark breach-of-fiduciary duty claim against an officer, he must allege specific facts 
establishing that the officer-defendant owed oversight duties as to the particular corporate 
function where supervision allegedly broke down.  See id. at 369-70 (ruling duty limited to 
“addressing or reporting red flags within [the officer’s] areas of responsibility”); cf. Ontario 
Provincial Council of Carpenters’ Pension Tr. Fund v. Walton, 2023 WL 3093500, at *51 (Del. 
Ch. Apr. 26, 2023) (permitting Caremark claim because defendants “were Walmart’s principal 
compliance officers . . . during the actionable period”) (emphasis added)).  
This principle defeats Plaintiffs’ attempt to plead claims against Mr. Staley.  Although 
Plaintiffs indiscriminately allege that the “Officer Defendants” were required to implement and 
Chapin v. Benwood Found., Inc., 402 A.2d 1205, 1211 (Del. Ch. 1979), aff’d sub nom. Harrison 
v. Chapin, 415 A.2d 1068 (Del. 1980); see 8 Del. C. § 141. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 21 of 27

maintain controls with respect to suspicious financial transactions and Know-Your-Customer 
regulations, e.g., Compl. ¶ 211, they fail to allege any area-specific oversight obligations of Mr. 
Staley, and make no showing whatsoever that the compliance function was ever within Mr. 
Staley’s purview.  In this regard, the Amended Complaint is replete with references to the bank’s 
“risk management division,” “compliance department,” “compliance team,” and even its “Global 
Corporate Security Division,” id. ¶¶ 5, 147, 151, 181, all without a single allegation that Mr. Staley 
either worked in or oversaw any of them.  Unlike his co-Defendant Jamie Dimon—whose writ, as 
CEO, presumably ran the gamut—Mr. Staley served in discrete roles lower in the corporate 
hierarchy.  And starting in 2009, Mr. Staley moved to JPMorgan’s investment banking division, 
with no job duties connected to the bank’s private wealth arm that handled Epstein’s finances.  
Moreover, while Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Staley was tasked early on with securing Epstein as a 
client, they concede that the “top-level due diligence review” for onboarding him—i.e., the part of 
the process where, according to Plaintiffs, the breakdown in controls occurred—was undertaken 
by other employees.  Id. ¶¶ 119, 122.   
Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim against Mr. Staley in Count III fares no better.  As noted 
above, that claim expressly depends on the allegation that Defendants “breached their fiduciary 
duties,” id. ¶ 217, and thus it necessarily fails for the same reasons.  See, e.g., Monroe Cnty. Emps.’ 
Ret. Sys. v. Carlson, 2010 WL 2376890, at *2 (Del. Ch. June 7, 2010) (dismissing unjust 
enrichment claim based on deficient fiduciary duty claim); Hughes v. Xiaoming Hu, 2020 WL 
1987029, at *17 (Del. Ch. Apr. 27, 2020) (explaining that “unjust enrichment” is “properly 
conceived as a form of additional damages dependent on the plaintiff proving the oversight 
claim”).  Even on its terms, moreover, the claim is fatally deficient.  Under Delaware law, unjust 
enrichment requires a plaintiff to plead, among other things, “the absence of a remedy provided 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 22 of 27

by law.”  Nemec v. Shrader, 991 A.2d 1120, 1130 (Del. 2010) (en banc).  Even with the most 
generous reading, Plaintiffs nowhere pled that prerequisite.  See id. at 1130-31 (affirming dismissal 
on that basis).  In addition, the only damages that Plaintiffs claim are the Defendants’ “profits, 
benefits, and other compensation,” e.g., their salaries and bonuses.  Compl. ¶ 217.  As a matter of 
law, this is insufficient for an unjust enrichment claim: 
[A] claim for unjust enrichment cannot be maintained where, as here, the 
“only enrichment alleged by plaintiffs consists of defendants’ salaries, 
benefits, and unspecified bonuses.”   
Steinberg v. Dimon, 2014 WL 3512848, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2014) (quoting In re Pfizer Inc. 
S’holder Derivative Litig., 722 F. Supp. 2d 453, 465 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)). 
 The Claims Against Mr. Staley Are Time-Barred. 
Even if Plaintiffs’ claims against Mr. Staley were not substantively deficient, they would 
still fail as untimely.13  In New York, a six-year limitations period governs suits by corporations 
against their officers for mismanagement, which includes derivative suits for breaches of fiduciary 
duty.  Hilton Head Holdings b.v. v. Peck, 2012 WL 613729, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2012); see 
N.Y. CPLR § 213(7).  And a three-year limitations period covers unjust enrichment claims where, 
as here, the plaintiff seeks monetary damages.  Kermanshah v. Kermanshah, 580 F. Supp. 2d 247, 
263 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); N.Y. CPLR § 214(3).  Under either limit, Plaintiffs’ claims against Mr. 
Staley are time-barred.  Mr. Staley left his employment at the bank in January 2013, and Epstein 
was terminated as a client later the same year.  Compl. ¶¶ 42, 158.  By that point—i.e., a full 
decade ago—any oversight duties that Mr. Staley owed came to an end, and any alleged breaches 
of those duties had already occurred.  No related failures could conceivably have occurred 
A “statute of limitations defense may be decided on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion if the defense 
appears on the face of the complaint.”  Ellul v. Congregation of Christian Bros., 774 F.3d 791, 
798 n.12 (2d Cir. 2014). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 23 of 27
B. 

thereafter.  Because a claim “accrues upon the occurrence of the alleged wrongful act giving rise 
to restitution,” Busher v. Barry, 2021 WL 5071871, at *3 (2d Cir. Nov. 2, 2021) (citation omitted), 
both the three- and six-year limitations periods had long since expired when Plaintiffs filed this 
suit in May 2023.14  
Apparently anticipating this problem, Plaintiffs attempt to plead a tolling theory premised 
on fraudulent concealment, specifically that JPMorgan employees failed to disclose the “critical 
facts necessary to put Plaintiffs on notice.”  Compl. ¶ 197.  But under New York law, this theory 
applies only where a plaintiff shows that he (i) “was induced by fraud, misrepresentations or 
deception to refrain from filing a timely action,” and (ii) that he undertook “reasonable reliance on 
the defendant’s misrepresentations.”  Busher, 2021 WL 5071871, at *4.15  In this regard, the best 
that Plaintiffs can do is to point to the failure of “the Company”—not Mr. Staley or any other 
Defendant—to file Suspicious Activity Reports “concerning Epstein and his accounts.”16  Compl. 
¶ 197.  Even if this were true—and it is not17—it is emphatically not a failing that may be attributed 
To be sure, for causes of action “based upon fraud,” the limitations in Section 213(8) apply, 
including the extension until two years after “the plaintiff or the person under whom the plaintiff 
claims discovered the fraud, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.”  N.Y. CPLR. 
§ 213(8).  But Plaintiffs’ claims here—alleging oversight and compliance failures—are not 
grounded in fraud.  See Hilton Head Holdings, 2012 WL 613729, at *3. 
The federal doctrine of equitable tolling is unavailable for state causes of action in New York, 
so New York’s tolling laws apply.  Busher, 2021 WL 5071871, at *4. 
Although Plaintiffs make the entirely conclusory claim that Mr. Staley and others “actively 
concealed concerns,” Compl. ¶ 198, this Court need not credit wholly unsupported allegations that 
merely mimic the legal standard but provide none of the detail required to satisfy Rule 9(b). 
As mentioned, on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court can judicially notice 
information outside the pleadings, including in related court filings, when such information bears 
on notice for purposes of a tolling argument countering a statute of limitations defense.  So the 
Court can note that the bank in fact filed numerous SARs related to Epstein, including “multiple 
suspicious activity reports related to Epstein’s accounts in 2002.”  Op. and Order Granting Mot. 
for Class Certification at 5, Doe v. JPMorgan, 22-cv-10019-JSR, ECF No. 171.  That fact destroys 
Plaintiffs’ main theory here. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 24 of 27

to Mr. Staley, who had no responsibility for such filings nor any corporate authority to influence 
whether or not they were filed.  Even more fundamentally, inaction—which is all that a failure-to-
file amounts to—is not an affirmative act of concealment for purposes of a tolling argument, and 
New York law requires “an act of deception, separate from the ones for which” a plaintiff sues, as 
a basis for tolling.  Corsello v. Verizon New York, Inc., 18 N.Y.3d 777, 789 (2012).  The Complaint, 
moreover, contains no explanation as to why or how any actions affected Plaintiffs’ ability or 
decision to sue, such as how they relied on particular filings (or the absence thereof) or how they 
were prevented from learning or doing anything.  There is thus no basis for tolling the statute of 
limitations here.  
III. 
Under the Doctrine of Claim Splitting, This Suit Cannot Proceed Against Mr. Staley. 
The Court should also dismiss the claims against Mr. Staley under the doctrine of claim 
splitting.  This doctrine enforces the common-law rule that “a party must bring in one action all 
legal theories arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions.”  Am. Stock Exch., LLC 
v. Mopex, Inc., 215 F.R.D. 87, 91 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (emphasis added); see also 18A Charles Alan 
Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4406 (3d ed.) 
(“In dealing with simultaneous actions on related theories, courts at times express principles of 
‘claim splitting’ that are similar to claim preclusion, but that do not require a prior judgment.”).  
Like the doctrine of claim preclusion, the rule against claim splitting fosters judicial economy, 
safeguards finality, and protects parties from vexatious or repetitive litigation.  Id.  When faced 
with claims split across duplicative lawsuits, a court can stay the later-filed action, dismiss it, or 
consolidate it with the earlier one.  But whatever the remedy, the rationale remains the same: 
Plaintiffs “have no right to maintain two actions on the same subject in the same court, against the 
same defendant at the same time.”  Curtis v. Citibank, N.A., 226 F.3d 133, 138-39 (2d Cir. 2000). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 29     Filed 07/06/23     Page 25 of 27

Here, Plaintiffs seek to advance claims on behalf of JPMorgan as an entity, based on alleged 
wrongs done to the entity and ensuing harm accruing to the entity.  Any recovery in this action will 
be in the name of the entity, not individual shareholders like Plaintiffs.  Such is the nature of a 
derivative claim.  But as this Court is well aware, the very entity whose claims and damages are at 
stake in this case—JPMorgan—has already sued Mr. Staley for claims premised on the same legal 
theories and arising out of the same events.  See Doe v. JPMorgan, 1:22-cv-10019-JSR; USVI v. 
JPMorgan, 1:22-cv-10904-JSR.18  By any definition, therefore, the present derivative case is 
entirely duplicative of the already-existing lawsuit that JPMorgan has brought in its own name and 
right.  That the derivative case is being directed by someone other than the bank itself does not 
change this analysis or the applicability of legal doctrines governing duplicative litigation.  See 
Huck ex rel. Sea Air Shuttle Corp. v. Dawson, 106 F.3d 45, 47 (3d Cir. 1997) (explaining that 
claim preclusion applies to dismiss subsequent derivative action based on similar claims); see also 
Barclay v. Lowe, 131 F. App’x 778, 779 (2d Cir. 2005) (unpublished) (affirming dismissal, on 
claim-splitting grounds, a second lawsuit with different defendants because such defendants were 
“in privity” with those in first suit).  JPMorgan has already decided when and how it wants to sue 
Mr. Staley, and any additional claims it possesses could have been brought in that action.  Those 
already-existing claims will be resolved in this Court in due course, and in the meantime, this 
Court should dismiss the duplicative claims against Mr. Staley in this action. 
Although courts are typically limited to the four corners of a complaint when assessing a motion 
to dismiss, when analyzing claim preclusion or claims splitting, courts can consider documents 
incorporated by reference in the complaint or “not incorporated by reference” but “relie[d] heavily 
upon” in their “terms and effect.”  Coleman v. B.G. Sulzle, Inc., 402 F. Supp. 2d 403, 417 
(N.D.N.Y. 2005) (citation omitted) (citing judicial actions not expressly incorporated in complaint 
when dismissing claims under claims splitting doctrine).  And courts can judicially notice items 
appearing in the court records of prior litigation that are related to the case before it.  Id.

CONCLUSION 
For the forgoing reasons, the Court should dismiss the claims against Mr. Staley.

Plaintiffs, derivatively on behalf of Nominal Defendant JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPM” or 
the “Company”), submit this memorandum of law in opposition to the motions to dismiss filed by 
Defendants and Nominal Defendant JPM (the “Motions”).1 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
For fifteen years, JPM allowed a known felon convicted of soliciting a minor for 
prostitution and widely identified as having engaged in rampant sexual abuse to use the Company’s 
facilities to further his criminal scheme. Epstein’s abhorrent crimes received global attention and 
were well known throughout the organization, prompting many—including the Company’s 
General Counsel and the CEO of the Company’s Private Bank—to sound the alarm about the need 
to sever the relationship. But Epstein was also a very valued client with close ties to JPM second-
in-command James E. Staley, and so the Company instead condoned Epstein’s use of the Company 
to perpetuate his criminal activities, violating BSA and AML laws and regulations in the process.  
The threshold question presented by the Motions is whether demand on the Board to sue 
Defendants, including CEO Jamie Dimon, would have been futile. The answer to that question is 
“yes” where, as here, at least half of the board at the time the original complaint was filed (the 
“Demand Board”) either face a substantial likelihood of liability or lack independence from 
someone who faces a substantial likelihood of liability. Here, seven members of the twelve-person 
Demand Board face a substantial likelihood of liability and an additional member lacks 
independence, excusing demand as to all counts. 
Dimon faces a substantial likelihood of liability because the Complaint’s particularized 
allegations support a pleading-stage inference that Dimon knew JPM was violating the law by 
Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to them in 
the Verified Amended Stockholder Derivative Complaint. Unless otherwise noted, all citations are 
omitted and all emphasis is added. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 9 of 34

facilitating Epstein’s crimes, but took no action. Several members of JPM management who report 
directly to Dimon knew by no later than 2006 that Epstein was abusing underage girls and paying 
victims in cash. A 2008 document contemplated terminating JPM’s relationship with Epstein 
“pending Dimon review.” Staley testified that he spoke with Dimon about whether to maintain 
Epstein as a client in 2006 when he was arrested, in 2008 when he pleaded guilty, and several other 
times before 2012. These and other particularized allegations support a pleading-stage inference 
that Dimon was aware of “corporate misconduct”—the “proverbial ‘red flag’”—yet breached his 
duty of loyalty by “consciously disregard[ing his] duty to address that misconduct.” Teamsters 
Local 443 Health Servs. & Ins. Plan v. Chou, 2020 WL 5028065, at *17 (Del Ch.). 
The Board members at the time Epstein was a client (e.g., Burke, Crown, and Flynn), for 
their part, face a substantial likelihood of liability for failing to “establish[] [the Board’s] own 
reasonable system of [BSA/AML compliance] monitoring and reporting, choosing instead to rely 
entirely on management.” Hughes v. Xiaoming Hu, 2020 WL 1987029, at *16 (Del. Ch.). 
“Caremark envisions some degree of board-level monitoring system, not blind deference to and 
complete dependence on management.” Id. at *4. Blind deference to and complete dependence on 
management is the only explanation for the Board’s apparent failure to learn of Epstein’s activities 
(and JPM’s concomitant violations of law) while he was a client. Indeed, the Board’s failure to 
establish its own system of BSA/AML compliance monitoring is confirmed by the 2013/2014 
findings of the DOJ and OCC, who uncovered the same BSA/AML noncompliance that facilitated 
Epstein’s crimes, levied criminal fines of $2.1 billion, and entered into a deferred prosecution 
agreement (“DPA”) with JPM in connection with the Madoff Ponzi scheme. 
Even after the Epstein relationship was terminated, and contrary to Defendants’ claim that 
post-Epstein Board members did nothing wrong, the Board (e.g., Dimon, Bammann, Burke, 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 10 of 34

Combs, Crown, Flynn, and Neal) continued breaching their duties. The Madoff DPA and Consent 
Orders entered into as a result of the Board’s oversight failures expressly obligated management 
to report past misconduct (e.g., Epstein) to the Board. And—as Defendants appear to concede 
(DOB 7)—there is every reason to believe that management did so, including because JPM’s 
General Counsel had previously sounded the alarm about Epstein and signed the DPA. Yet the 
Board—ignoring its obligation under the DPA and Consent Orders to ensure that information was 
provided to the DOJ—failed to require any retroactive SAR filings, failed to inform the DOJ or 
OCC of JPM’s relationship with Epstein, and failed to hold any JPM executives accountable for 
facilitating Epstein’s crimes. The Board’s failure to comply with its heightened obligations makes 
the “inference of deliberate disregard by each and every member of the board…entirely 
reasonable.” In re Pfizer Inc. S’holder Deriv. Litig., 722 F. Supp. 2d 453, 462 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).  
Finally, the Complaint’s particularized allegations raise a reasonable doubt as to 
Novakovic and Bammann’s ability to impartially consider authorizing a lawsuit against Crown 
and Dimon, respectively. Novakovic is the CEO of a company in which the Crown family has 
substantial influence and “Delaware decisions have recognized that when a director is employed 
by” a company “where the interested party who would be adversely affected by pursuing litigation 
controls or has substantial influence over those entities, a reasonable doubt exists about that 
director’s ability to impartially consider a litigation demand.” In re Ezcorp Inc Consulting 
Agreement Derivative Litig., 2016 WL 301245, at *36 (Del. Ch.). Bammann faces similar 
independence concerns. She owes a significant portion of her professional success to Dimon, 
having worked under Dimon at both Bank One and JPM and having been appointed to the JPM 
Board in 2013—her sole employment since—when Dimon was Chairman and CEO. The requisite 
“nuanced and realistic approach” to assessing her independence leads to the inescapable 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 11 of 34

conclusion that she could not impartially consider a demand to sue Dimon for misconduct that 
could end his career.  
Defendants’ breaches of duty significantly harmed JPM. This action seeks to shift 
responsibility for that harm from JPM’s stockholders to those responsible. None of Defendants’ 
arguments support dismissal. The Motions should be denied. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
Plaintiffs assume the Court’s familiarity with the Complaint and the USVI and Doe Actions 
and therefore only briefly summarize the Complaint’s allegations below. 
I. 
COMPLIANCE WITH BSA/AML REGULATIONS IS MISSION-CRITICAL  
JPM has acknowledged in SEC filings that it “is subject to extensive and comprehensive 
regulation under U.S. federal and state laws.” ¶¶49-50. JPM has also disclosed that failure to 
comply with banking laws and regulations can subject JPM to “significant penalties and collateral 
consequences,” including “greater exposure to litigation” and reputational damage. ¶¶50-51.  
Because JPM is susceptible to serving as a conduit for financial crimes, it is subject to a 
series of strict AML laws and regulations. ¶52. The BSA and Patriot Act require JPM to, inter alia, 
implement adequate risk-based AML policies and systems to detect and prevent money laundering 
and other uses of a bank’s services and resources to facilitate criminal activity. ¶53. Such 
requirements include maintaining a due diligence program, filing SARs after detecting suspicious 
behavior, and filing currency transaction reports for transactions exceeding $10,000/day. Id. 
Importantly, federal regulations require AML risk oversight at the board level. The FFIEC 
Manual provides, among other things, that “[t]he board of directors…is ultimately responsible for 
ensuring that the bank maintains an effective BSA/AML internal control structure, including 
suspicious activity monitoring and reporting.” ¶¶54-55. According to the FFIEC Manual, customer 
due diligence policies and procedures are “critical” for “[a]voiding criminal exposure from persons 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 12 of 34

who use…the bank’s products and services for illicit purposes.” ¶56. 
With respect to “high-risk customers,” such as Epstein, the FFIEC Manual instructs that 
“[e]nhanced due diligence…is especially critical in understanding their anticipated transactions 
and implementing a suspicious activity monitoring system that reduces the bank’s reputation, 
complaint, and transaction risks.” ¶57. That suspicious activity monitoring system includes the 
filing of SARs, “the cornerstone of the BSA reporting system,” if the bank knows, suspects, or has 
reason to suspect that a customer may be engaging in money laundering or other illegal activity. 
¶58. Indeed, when a bank suspects suspicious activity, it must file a SAR within 30 days to the 
U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. ¶59. Upon the filing of a 
SAR, management should provide sufficient information in its SAR filings to the board—or an 
appropriate committee thereof—to fulfill its fiduciary duties. ¶60. 
II. 
JPM FAILED TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH ITS BSA/AML 
OBLIGATIONS WHILE EPSTEIN WAS A CLIENT 
JPM onboarded Epstein in 1998. Id. By that time, he was well known for managing the 
fortunes of some of the world’s richest and most powerful people. ¶¶8-9. And JPM was eager to 
curry favor with Epstein, as evidenced by its directive to Staley to “get to know him.” ¶109. 
Company executives—who knew for at least seven years that Epstein was engaged in 
criminal activity—repeatedly expressed the need to sever the relationship, but JPM nevertheless 
permitted Epstein to use his corporate accounts to further his criminal activities with impunity. 
See, e.g., ¶¶113-22, 125-58. The Board, for its part, failed even to attempt to implement adequate 
AML risk oversight and, as a result, apparently remained ignorant to Epstein’s crimes (or even the 
fact that Epstein was a client) until the relationship was terminated in 2013. Id. 
III. 
THE BOARD FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE CONSENT ORDER AND 
DPA AFTER THE EPSTEIN RELATIONSHIP WAS TERMINATED 
In January 2013, the OCC found (and JPM consented to entry of an order finding) in 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 13 of 34

connection with the Madoff Ponzi scheme that JPM (i) “failed to adopt and implement a 
compliance program that adequately covers the required BSA/AML program elements”, (ii) “did 
not develop adequate due diligence on customers…a repeat problem, and failed to file all necessary 
SARs related to suspicious customer activity”, and (iii) had numerous “critical deficiencies” in its 
BSA/AML compliance program, including “systemic deficiencies in its transaction monitoring 
systems, due diligence processes, risk management, and quality assurance programs.” Ex. 1, Art. 
I.2 In January 2014, the Company agreed to pay $2.1 billion in criminal fines and restitution (the 
largest BSA sanctions ever imposed) and entered into a DPA in which it admitted that it never 
filed a Madoff-related SAR over the course of several years despite suspicions about Madoff’s 
Ponzi scheme. ¶¶170-71; DPA Ex. C ¶26.  
As part of prosecutors’ willingness to forego criminally prosecuting JPM for its Madoff 
misconduct, JPM agreed to implement numerous Board-level undertakings to affirmatively 
identify and report all suspicious activities and transactions. Among other things, the Consent 
Orders required the Board to (i) implement an exhaustive review of all past SAR filings and ensure 
that any other potentially suspicious activity was identified and reported, (ii) review all 
transactions by non-bank financial institutions, which would have included JPM’s use of 
Highbridge Capital’s private jets to transport girls for Epstein’s sex trafficking operation (¶¶114-
20), and (iii) oversee these reviews, with written findings “reported to the Board.” See Ex. 1, Arts. 
VIII, IX. The Consent Orders were unequivocal that JPM’s obligations to remedy its BSA 
compliance failures fell to the Board—not management—and that the “Board shall ensure that the 
The DPA is DOB Ex. 1 and the Consent Orders—attached hereto as Exs. 1-2—are referenced in 
the DPA and incorporated by reference into the Complaint. ¶¶170-71; Helprin v. Harcourt, Inc., 
277 F. Supp. 2d 327, 331 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (documents incorporated by reference where, as here, 
the Complaint makes “a clear, definite and substantial reference to the documents”). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 14 of 34

Bank achieves and thereafter maintains compliance” with its obligations under the BSA and the 
Consent Orders. Ex. 1, Art. III(a)-(d).   
Moreover, the DPA imposed an affirmative obligation on JPM to inform the DOJ of “all 
criminal conduct by JPMorgan or any of its employees…as to which JPMorgan’s Board, senior 
management, or U.S. legal compliance personnel are aware” and any “violations of the BSA that 
have come to the attention of JPMorgan’s U.S. legal and compliance personnel.” DPA ¶¶10, 20. 
That unquestionably should have included Staley’s, Cutler’s, Erdoes’, Dimon’s and other 
executives’ knowledge of JPM’s role in Epstein’s sex trafficking, but no SAR was filed and 
nothing about JPM’s relationship with Epstein was reported to the DOJ. ¶¶189-90. Reporting 
JPM’s involvement may have been a breach of the DPA and subjected JPM to criminal 
prosecution—an extraordinarily severe consequence that perhaps explains, but does not excuse, 
the Board’s failure to report anything Epstein-related. Indeed, rather than take these steps, JPM 
Managing Directors Nelson and Barrett continued to meet frequently with Epstein in New York 
and at his Santa Fe ranch until at least 2017. ¶157 n.95.     
IV. 
DEFENDANTS’ BREACHES OF DUTY SIGNIFICANTLY HARMED JPM 
As a result of Defendants’ breaches, JPM has incurred significant costs, including the $290 
million settlement of the Doe Action, litigation costs incurred in the Doe and USVI Actions, and 
reputational harm. The USVI Action remains pending and likely will result in further harm.  
ARGUMENT 
I. 
DEMAND IS EXCUSED BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD COULD 
NOT IMPARTIALLY CONSIDER A DEMAND  
The demand futility test focuses on “whether the derivative plaintiff has shown some 
reason to doubt that the board will exercise its discretion impartially and in good faith.” In re BGC 
P’rs, Inc. Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 4745121, at *6 (Del.Ch.). A plaintiff can show reason to 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 15 of 34

doubt a board’s ability to exercise its discretion impartially and in good faith by adequately 
pleading that at least half of the directors (i) “face[] a substantial likelihood of liability on any of 
the claims that would be the subject of the litigation demand” or (ii) “lack[] independence from 
someone who…would face a substantial likelihood of liability of any of the claims that are the 
subject of the litigation demand.” United Food & Commercial Workers Union & Participating 
Food Indus. Emps. Tri-State Pension Fund v. Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d 1034, 1059 (Del. 2021). 
Defendants suggest that demand is excused only if at least half of the board face a substantial 
likelihood of liability, DOB 11-12, but the Delaware courts aggregate directors who face a 
substantial likelihood of liability and those who lack independence. Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d at 1059.  
In evaluating a motion to dismiss for failure to make a demand, the Court “is required to 
accept the truth of all facts pleaded in the Complaint, and plaintiffs are entitled to all reasonable 
factual inferences that logically flow from the particularized facts alleged.” Pfizer, 722 F. Supp. 
2d at 458. The particularity requirement does not obligate a plaintiff “to demonstrate a reasonable 
probability of success on the claim,” only to “make a threshold showing…that [its] claims have 
some merit.” La. Mun. Emps.’ Ret. Sys. v. Pyott, 46 A.3d 315, 351 (Del. Ch.). 
Demand is excused as to all counts because the Complaint adequately pleads that seven of 
twelve Demand Board directors face a substantial likelihood of liability and an additional director 
lacks independence:

DIMON FACES A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD OF LIABILITY FOR TURNING A 
BLIND EYE TO THE COMPANY’S LEGAL VIOLATIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
EPSTEIN 
Dimon had oversight duties in his capacity as an officer and director. In re McDonald’s 
Corp. S’holder Derivative Litig., 289 A.3d 343, 369 (Del. Ch.). “An officer who receive[d] 
credible information indicating that the corporation is violating the law cannot turn a blind eye,” 
id. at 370, because “Delaware law does not charter law breakers.” Massey, 2011 WL 2176479, at 
*20. Rather, a fiduciary acts in bad faith where it “consciously disregard[s] its duty to address 
[corporate] misconduct.” Chou, 2020 WL 5028065, at *17. 
The following particularized allegations support a pleading-stage inference that Dimon 
knew that the Company was not complying with BSA/AML obligations with respect to Epstein 
but failed to cause the Company to sever its relationship with Epstein: 
 The CEO of JPM’s Asset and Wealth Management business—who reported directly to 
Dimon—knew in 2006 that Epstein was abusing women and underage girls and paying 
victims in cash. ¶131.  
 A July 2008 document contemplates a conversation in which the CEO of JPM’s Private 
Bank would tell Staley that “we are uncomfortable with Epstein and do not want to go to 
Cutler [JPM’s General Counsel] for approval.” ¶135.  
 A month later, a JPM employee wrote that she “would count Epstein’s assets as a probable 
outflow for ’08 ($120mm or so?) as I can’t imagine it will stay (pending [Jamie] Dimon 
review).” ¶136.  
 Between 2009 and 2011, Epstein helped schedule meetings for Dimon with Benjamin 
Complaint did not alter the relevant board for assessing demand futility. See Braddock v. 
Zimmerman, 906 A.2d 776, 786 (Del. 2006) (“[W]hen an amended derivative complaint is filed, 
the existence of a new independent board of directors is relevant to a Rule 23.1 demand inquiry 
only as to derivative claims in the amended complaint that are not already validly in litigation.”). 
All of the claims in the amended complaint were already validly in litigation. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 17 of 34

Netanyahu, Bill Gates, and Prince Andrew. ¶123.  
 From 2006-2011, employees routinely raised concerns about Epstein. See, e.g., ¶¶146-54.  
 In July 2011, the Company’s General Counsel emailed Staley and Erdoes that Epstein 
should not be a client. ¶155. 
Despite these and other glaring red flags, Epstein remained a client until 2013.  
Defendants effectively argue that the Complaint suffers from a lack of proof. To wit, 
Defendants assert, inter alia, that (i) “the Complaint fails to allege with specificity that Mr. Dimon 
was aware of any red flags concerning Epstein’s criminal activities,” (ii) fails to allege that Dimon 
conducted the contemplated review of Epstein, (iii) “fails to plead what information was made 
available to Mr. Dimon [for the review] or what decision he even purportedly made,” and  
(iv) “does not allege that Mr. Dimon was aware that Mr. Epstein was involved in the meetings Mr. 
Staley purportedly attempted to schedule on Mr. Dimon’s behalf[.]” DOB 21-22. 
But proof is not required at the pleading stage, and Defendants cannot deny Plaintiffs the 
reasonable inferences to which they are entitled. It is possible that (i) the CEO did not know that 
one of his largest clients was using the Company to facilitate sex trafficking for over a decade;  
(ii) several members of senior management knew of Epstein’s crimes but unilaterally chose to 
conceal this knowledge from the CEO; (iii) the contemplated “Dimon review” of Epstein never 
happened or Dimon was provided insufficient information; (iv) Dimon never asked Staley how he 
secured the meetings with Netanyahu, Gates, and/or Prince Andrew (or the meetings did not 
occur), and (v) Staley perjured himself when he testified that he discussed Epstein with Dimon in 
2006 when Epstein was arrested, in 2008 when Epstein pleaded guilty, and at various other times 
about whether to maintain Epstein as a client.4

But it is far more likely—and, at a minimum, reasonably inferable—that Dimon knew who 
Epstein was and what he was doing, but prioritized profits over legal compliance (or otherwise 
chose to put his head in the sand). Metro Commc’n Corp. BVI v. Advanced Mobilecom Techs. Inc., 
854 A.2d 121, 131 (Del. Ch.) (“[A] fiduciary may not choose to manage an entity in an illegal 
fashion.”). At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court “must credit [the plaintiff-friendly] inference, 
even if [it] believe[s] it more likely that [Dimon] acted in good faith.” Pyott, 46 A.3d at 356; Pfizer, 
722 F. Supp. 2d at 458 (plaintiffs are entitled to “all reasonable inferences”). 
B. 
BURKE, CROWN, AND FLYNN FACE A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD OF LIABILITY 
FOR FAILING TO IMPLEMENT BSA/AML BOARD LEVEL REPORTING SYSTEMS 
Directors are obligated to ensure management has implemented mechanisms and 
procedures sufficient to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks, and that there is a reporting system 
in place that enables the board to be kept informed as to how effectively management deals with 
those risks. See Hughes, 2020 WL 1987029, at *13-14; Rich v. Chong, 66 A.3d 963, 983-84 (Del. 
Ch.). “Caremark envisions some degree of board-level monitoring system, not blind deference to 
and complete dependence on management.” Hughes, 2020 WL 1987029, at *16. “The board is 
obligated to establish information and reporting systems that ‘allow management and the board, 
each within its own scope, to reach informed judgments concerning both the corporation’s 
compliance with law and its business performance.’” Id. (quoting Caremark, 608 A.2d at 959).  
Moreover, JPM is subject to extensive AML laws and regulations and JPM acknowledges 
in SEC filings that noncompliance can expose the Company “to significant penalties and collateral 
consequences.” ¶¶49-60. “As Marchand makes clear, when a company operates in an environment 
jpmorgan-jes-staley-says-dimon-did-b11f0da5. See Staehr v. Hartford FiFin. Servs.Grp., Inc., 547 
F.3d 406, 425 (2d Cir. 2008) (affirming the judicial notice of media reports and regulatory filings 
on a motion to dismiss). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 19 of 34

where externally imposed regulations govern its ‘mission critical’ operations, the board’s oversight 
function must be more rigorously exercised.” In re Clovis Oncology, Inc. Derivative Litig., 2019 
WL 4850188, at *12 (Del. Ch.). “Delaware courts are more inclined to find Caremark oversight 
liability at the board level when the company operates in the midst of obligations imposed upon it 
by positive law yet fails to implement compliance systems, or fails to monitor existing compliance 
systems, such that a violation of law, and resulting liability, occurs.” Id.  
The Complaint’s particularized allegations support a “pleading-stage inference that the 
board never established its own reasonable system of monitoring and reporting, choosing instead 
to rely entirely on management.” Hughes, 2020 WL 1987029, at *16. Such an inference is 
supported by the fact that, as Defendants claim, Epstein’s use of JPM to further his criminal scheme 
was never discussed at the Board level despite the national attention Epstein received and 
management’s knowledge that the Company should not be doing business with Epstein, including: 
 When Epstein was onboarded in 1998, Know Your Customer due diligence would have 
unearthed the investigation into Epstein’s alleged insider trading while at Bear Stearns and 
his proximity to the Tower Financial Ponzi scheme. ¶¶63, 112.  
 Epstein’s 2006 arrest for soliciting a minor for prostitution received national attention and 
was discussed at the upper levels of JPM management. ¶¶126-31.  
 The Company was aware by 2006 that Epstein was abusing women and underage girls and 
was paying the victims in cash. ¶131. 
 Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea for soliciting a minor for prostitution received national attention 
and caused some JPM employees, including the CEO of the Company’s Private Bank, to 
advocate dropping him as a client. ¶¶133-35.  
 In 2010, memos from JPM compliance reference a federal investigation into Epstein. An 
employee in JPM’s risk management division referred to “new allegations of an 
investigation related to child trafficking,” and asked whether JPM was “still comfortable 
with this client who is now a registered sex offender.” ¶¶146-47. 
 In January 2011, JPM conducted a review of Epstein’s accounts because a “few news 
stories during 2010 connect[ed] Jeffrey Epstein to human trafficking.” ¶149. 
 In March 2011, JPM’s Global Corporate Security Division internally reported that 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 20 of 34

“[n]umerous articles detail various law enforcement agencies investigating Jeffrey Epstein 
for allegedly participating, directly or indirectly, in child trafficking and molesting 
underage girls.” ¶151. 
 In 2011, a senior JPM compliance official reviewed the Company’s relationship with 
Epstein and warned that there was “[l]ots of smoke” and [l]ots of questions” surrounding 
Epstein’s criminal behavior, including, inter alia, that (i) Epstein “is alleged to be involved 
in the human trafficking of young girls,” (ii) AML Operations was “requesting that we exit 
this relationship,” and (iii) JPM had “extended Epstein a loan in relation to [a] modeling 
agency” that was under DOJ investigation. ¶154. 
 In July 2011, Cutler emailed Staley and Mary Erdoes (CEO of JPM’s Asset and Wealth 
Management business), among others, that Epstein “is not an honorable person in any 
way. He should not be a client” and later emailed Erdoes, “I would like to put it and him 
behind us. Not a person we should do business with, period.” ¶155. 
 In August 2011, Ghislaine Maxwell applied to open a new account for a “personal 
recruitment consulting business,” prompting the Company’s AML director to ask: “What 
does she mean by personal recruitment?? Are you sure this will have nothing to do with 
Jeffrey? If you want to proceed, I suggest that we flag this as a High Risk Client.” ¶156. 
One would have imagined that at least some of that information about one of the Company’s largest 
clients would have made its way to the Board; Defendants insist that it did not. 
Although the Board apparently did not know, Epstein’s use of the Company to further his 
well-publicized sex-trafficking operation—and the Company’s concomitant breaches of its 
BSA/AML obligations—were happening in plain sight. In 2006, the JPM Rapid Response Team 
noted that Epstein routinely withdrew $40,000 to $80,000 in cash from his accounts several times 
each month—which, according to Dimon, would have been visible to JPM in real time (¶163)—
yet the Company failed to file SARs as required by federal law. ¶¶131, 159. At least 20 women 
trafficked and abused by Epstein were paid through JPM accounts between 2003 and 2013, many 
of whom had Eastern European surnames that were publicly and internally identified as Epstein 
recruiters and/or victims. ¶164. And Epstein paid an additional $1.5 million to well-known 
recruiters. ¶165. Simply put, management “did not just see red flags; they were wrapped in them.” 
Lebanon Cty. Emps.’ Ret. Fund v. Collis, 2022 WL 17841215, at *16 (Del. Ch.). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 21 of 34

But it was the Board that was “ultimately responsible for ensuring that the bank maintains 
an effective BSA/AML internal control structure, including suspicious activity monitoring and 
reporting.” ¶55. The Board’s utter failure to install oversight systems apparently blinded the Board 
to Epstein’s use of JPM to further his criminal activity for years. C.f. Mason-Mahon v. Flint, 166 
A.D.3d 754, 759 (N.Y. App. 3d 2018) (“In view of the illegal purpose, magnitude, and duration 
of the alleged wrongdoing…the allegations were such that the [wrongdoing] should have come to 
the attention of…the board of directors.”). “When a plaintiff can plead an inference that a board 
has undertaken no efforts to make sure it is informed of a compliance issue intrinsically critical to 
the company’s business operation, then that supports an inference that the board has not made the 
good faith effort that Caremark requires.” Marchand v. Barnhill, 212 A.3d 805, 822 (Del. 2019); 
In re Oxford Health Plans, Inc., 192 F.R.D. 111, 117 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (applying Delaware law) 
(“[W]here liability is based upon a failure to supervise and monitor, and to keep adequate 
supervisory controls in place, demand futility is ordinarily found, especially where the failure 
involves a scheme of significant magnitude and duration which went undiscovered by the 
directors.”).5 
JPM’s admissions (and the government’s findings) in connection with JPM’s complicity 
in the Bernie Madoff scandal confirm that the Board failed to undertake required efforts to inform 
itself of BSA/AML compliance. See In re Massey Energy Co. Derivative and Class Action Litig., 
2011 WL 2176479, at *21 (Del. Ch.) (looking to company’s record as a “recidivist” in assessing 
See also Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters’ Pension Trust Fund v. Walton, 2023 WL 
3093500, at *33 (Del. Ch.) (“If the corporate trauma resulted from a central compliance area that 
fiduciaries acting in good faith would monitor, and if the corporate fiduciaries did not have a 
monitoring system that reflects a good faith effort to bring timely and actionable information to 
their attention, then the absence of such a system may support an inference that the corporate 
fiduciaries willfully blinded themselves to a known risk.”). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 22 of 34

Caremark claim). The Madoff Ponzi scheme was conducted almost exclusively through JPM 
accounts and JPM settled two felony violations—and paid a $1.7 billion criminal fine (the largest 
such sanction ever)—stemming from its failure to alert authorities to suspicious activity. ¶170. 
Defendants claim that Madoff is unrelated to Epstein, DOB 7, but the oversight deficiencies that 
enabled the Madoff Ponzi scheme were the same as those that enabled Epstein’s crimes.  
Indeed, the OCC found that JPM “failed to adopt and implement a compliance program 
that adequately covers the required BSA/AML program elements due to an inadequate system 
of internal controls, and ineffective independence testing.” Ex. 1, Art. I. The OCC highlighted 
JPM’s “previously identified systemic weaknesses in the adequacy of customer due diligence and 
the effectiveness of monitoring…constituting a deficiency in its BSA/AML compliance 
programs.” Id. JPM—including the Board—was ordered to take a series of actions to comply with 
their BSA/AML reporting obligations, id., Arts. II-IV, IX-X, XII, confirming the Board’s prior 
failure to make “the good faith effort that Caremark requires.” Marchand, 212 A.3d at 822.    
Defendants’ arguments leave them in a Caremark catch-22. They assert that JPM 
implemented robust systems to identify suspicious activity, but also that these “robust” systems 
left them unaware of Epstein’s crimes (or even that he was a client). DOB 13-16. Defendants 
cannot have it both ways. Epstein was not just any client; he was an extremely valuable client that 
repeatedly met with JPM’s most senior executives. And his transgressions were not isolated, 
secret, or insignificant; they were repeated, well known, and abhorrent. If JPM had implemented 
robust systems to identify suspicious activity, the Board necessarily would have known that one 
of JPM’s largest clients was using the corporate machinery to further his sex-trafficking operation. 
If it knew, the Board breached its duties by failing to promptly sever the relationship and report 
Epstein’s misconduct. Melbourne Mun. Firefighters’ Pension Tr. Fund on Behalf of Qualcomm, 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 23 of 34

Inc. v. Jacobs, 2016 WL 4076369, at *12 (Del. Ch.) (when board learns of illegality, it has an 
“immediate duty” to alter the company’s “business practices”). If it did not know—as Defendants 
say—the Board breached its duties because Caremark does not permit “blind deference to and 
complete dependence on management.” Hughes, 2020 WL 1987029, at *16.  
Defendants otherwise engage in misdirection. They claim that the Complaint concedes that 
JPM had robust systems in place, DOB 16; SOB 11, but ignore that the Complaint speaks to 
management reporting systems, not the board level reporting systems required by Delaware law.6 
Indeed, despite relying on the DPA, Defendants ignore that the DOJ’s and OCC’s findings confirm 
the lack of a board level reporting system. Defendants separately assert that the existence of Audit 
and Risk Committees forecloses a Caremark prong one claim, DOB 16, but in fact “[t]he mere 
existence of an audit committee and the hiring of an auditor does not provide universal protection 
against a Caremark claim.” Hughes, 2020 WL 1987029, at *14.

JPM violated the law by allowing Epstein to use the Company to further his repugnant 
crimes for more than a decade. The particularized allegations support a pleading-stage inference 
that the Board willfully blinded itself to BSA/AML compliance, in breach of its duty of loyalty. 
The Board members who served while Epstein was a client—including Burke, Crown, and Flynn 
(and Dimon and Kessler)—thus face a substantial likelihood of liability. 
C. 
BAMMANN, BURKE, COMBS, CROWN, FLYNN, AND NEAL FACE A SUBSTANTIAL 
LIKELIHOOD OF LIABILITY FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE DPA AND 
CONSENT ORDERS 
In connection with entering into the DPA and Consent Orders, JPM agreed to (i) implement 
Defendants’ authority undercuts their claim. See SOB 11 (citing In re Gen. Motors Co. Derivative 
Litig., 2015 WL 3958724, at *14 (Del. Ch.) (dismissing claim because company “had a system for 
reporting risk to the Board, but in [plaintiff]s view it should have been a better system”). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 24 of 34

an exhaustive review of all past SARs filings and ensure that any other potentially suspicious 
activity was identified and reported, (ii) review all transactions by non-bank financial institutions, 
and (iii) oversee these reviews, with written findings “reported to the Board.” See Ex. 1, Arts. VIII, 
IX. The Board was required to “ensure that the Bank achieves and thereafter maintains 
compliance” with its obligations under the Consent Orders. Ex. 1, Art. III(a)-(d); supra, Factual 
Background §III. And JPM was required to inform the DOJ of “all criminal conduct by JPMorgan 
or any of its employees…as to which JPMorgan’s Board, senior management, or U.S. legal 
compliance personnel are aware” and “any violations of the BSA that have come to the attention 
of JPMorgan’s…legal and compliance personnel.” DPA ¶¶10, 20.   
It is reasonably inferable that JPM management—including Cutler, who repeatedly raised 
concerns about Epstein and who signed the DPA—complied with its obligations by identifying for 
the Board past suspicious activity concerning Epstein, particularly given that allegations 
concerning Epstein were increasingly “squarely in the public eye.” ¶173; Pfizer, 722 F. Supp. 2d 
at 461 (“[T]hese agreements obligated Pfizer’s chief Compliance Officer to report directly to the 
board…There is no reason to believe this reporting requirement was not fully complied with…”). 
It logically follows that it is reasonably inferable that the post-DPA Board members (e.g., 
Bammann, Burke, Combs, Crown, Flynn, and Neal) learned of JPM’s failure to timely file Epstein-
related SARs and of Epstein’s criminal conduct more generally.7 Yet, the Board failed to comply 
As set forth herein, Bammann, Burke, Combs, Crown, Flynn, and Neal served on the Board 
during the term of the DPA (from 2014 to 2016) and the Consent Orders (OCC required committee 
disbanded in 2019). Hobson and Novakovic did not join the Board until 2018 and 2020, 
respectively. Although the Complaint credibly alleges that JPM continued to engage with Epstein 
until his death—including the frequent visits from JPM Managing Directors through 2017—and 
did not begin belatedly complying with its BSA obligations with respect to Epstein accounts until 
August 2019 (see, e.g., USVI (ECF No. 16) at ¶91), Plaintiffs are no longer pursuing the claims 
against them. Novakovic, however, lacks independence for reasons discussed below. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 25 of 34

with the DPA and Consent Orders by informing the DOJ of Epstein’s crimes or JPM’s BSA 
violations in connection therewith (or to take any other action against JPM executives until 
belatedly suing Staley after it became public that he sexually assaulted an Epstein victim). ¶¶189-
90. That was a breach of duty. See Westmoreland Cty. Emp. Ret. Sys. v. Parkinson, 727 F.3d 719, 
726, 728 (7th Cir. 2013) (breach of duty to ignore “clear and specific guidance from [regulators]”). 
Defendants contend that directors who joined the Board after the Epstein relationship was 
terminated cannot be held liable, DOB 5, but ignore the post-Epstein Board’s failure to comply 
with the heightened duties imposed by the DPA and Consent Orders. The post-Epstein Board’s 
failure to comply with those heightened duties makes the “inference of deliberate disregard by 
each and every member of the board…entirely reasonable.” Pfizer, 722 F. Supp. 2d at 462.8   
D. 
NOVAKOVIC AND BAMMANN LACK INDEPENDENCE  
A plaintiff can plead that a director is not independent by alleging facts from which the 
director’s ability to act impartially against an interested party “can be doubted because that director 
may feel either subject to the interested party’s dominion or beholden to that interested party.” 
Delaware Cty. Emps. Ret. Fund v. Sanchez, 124 A.3d 1017, 1024 n.25 (Del. 2015). At the pleading 
stage, a plaintiff satisfies this test by alleging that the director has relationships with an interested 
party that “might have a material effect on the parties’ ability to act adversely toward each other.” 
Sandys v. Pincus, 152 A.3d 124, 134 (Del. 2016). As Pincus observed, “[c]ausing a lawsuit to be 
brought against another person is no small matter, and is the sort of thing that might plausibly 
endanger a relationship.” Id.  
Although Defendants contend that JPM appropriately filed Epstein-related SARs (see DOB at 
12, SOB at 19 n.17), that improper and counterfactual claim is contrary to the Complaint, the 
OCC’s findings, the evidence in the Doe and USVI Actions, and the Court’s class certification 
order—which notes SARs were filed in 2002, years before the Board’s misconduct alleged here.     
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 26 of 34

Novakovic lacks independence from Crown. The Crown family inherited General 
Dynamics Corporation in 1959 and Crown served as a General Dynamics director from 1987 until 
his 2023 death. ¶¶12, 33. Novakovic joined General Dynamics in 2002 and became the Chairman 
and CEO of General Dynamics in 2013, a position she continues to enjoy at the pleasure of the 
Crown family. ¶¶36, 195. “Delaware decisions have recognized that when a director is employed 
by or receives compensation from other entities, and where the interested party who would be 
adversely affected by pursuing litigation controls or has substantial influence over those entities, 
a reasonable doubt exists about th[e] director’s ability to impartially consider a litigation demand.” 
Ezcorp, 2016 WL 301245, at *36. 
Staley argues that the Complaint fails to allege that Crown or his family had substantial 
influence over General Dynamics, SOB 13-14, but the Complaint’s particularized allegations 
support that inference. See e.g., ¶¶12, 33, 195. The rest of the Defendants, for their part, bizarrely 
claim (in a footnote) that Crown’s death somehow impacts the analysis. DOB 6 n.5. But even if it 
does, given that the Crown family continues to run General Dynamics, Novakovic would logically 
be as hesitant to authorize a lawsuit against Crown’s estate—which could also unearth troubling 
ties between Crown and Epstein—as she would have been against Crown himself. 
In addition to facing a substantial likelihood of liability,9 Bammann lacks independence 
of Dimon because she owes a significant portion of her professional success to Dimon. While 
Dimon was the CEO of Bank One, Bammann reached the status of Bank One’s Executive Vice 
President and Chief Risk Management Officer from 2001 to 2004. ¶193. After JPM acquired Bank 
One—and when Dimon was JPM’s President and Chief Operating Officer—Bammann served as 
If the Court agrees that Bammann faces a substantial likelihood of liability, it need not reach 
independence. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 27 of 34

the Company’s Deputy Head of Risk Management. Id. Bammann was then added to the Board in 
2013—which has been her only employment since10—when Dimon was Chairman and CEO. 
¶193. Considered holistically (as they must be), these allegations support a pleading-stage 
inference that Bammann may have felt a sense of owingness to Dimon that might have 
compromised her ability to impartially consider a demand. In re Ply Gem Indus., Inc. S’holders 
Litig., 2001 WL 1192206, at *1 (Del. Ch.).   
Defendants’ assertion that Bammann’s independence cannot be compromised because her 
working relationship with Dimon ended some time ago, SOB 13, ignores that “past benefits 
conferred…may establish an obligation or debt (a sense of ‘owingness’) upon which a reasonable 
doubt as to a director’s loyalty to a corporation may be premised.” Ply Gem, 2001 WL 1192206, 
at *1; see also Off v. Ross, 2008 WL 5053448, at *11 (Del. Ch.) (“[A] director ‘may feel beholden 
to someone for past acts.’”). Defendants also contend that “merely asserting close personal or 
business relationships is insufficient,” DOB 17, but the Complaint in fact pleads particularized 
allegations supporting an inference that Bammann owes a significant portion of her professional 
success to Dimon. See, e.g., ¶193. That is sufficient to compromise her independence.  
Defendants’ arguments also ignore that Delaware takes a “nuanced and realistic approach 
to independence.” In re Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. Derivative Litig., 2019 WL 1224556, *9 (Del. Ch.). 
Jamie Dimon is a giant in the industry who worked with Bammann. It blinks reality to suggest that 
Bammann—or, frankly, any other member of the Board—could impartially consider whether to 
authorize a lawsuit against Dimon for something that may destroy his reputation and end his career. 
Cf. In re Tesla Motors, Inc. S’holder Litig., 2018 WL 1560293, at *19 (Del. Ch.) (recognizing 
Cf. Khan v. Portnoy, 2008 WL 5197164, at *12 (Del. Ch.) (director compensation material 
where it exceeded compensation from other employment).

relevance of Musk’s “extraordinary influence within the Company generally” as relevant to 
independence analysis). The fact that the Board—including Bammann—is attempting to pin it all 
on Staley supports the inference that the Board is disposed toward protecting Dimon. 
E. 
DEMAND IS EXCUSED AS TO THE CLAIM AGAINST STALEY AND THE UNJUST 
ENRICHMENT CLAIM 
For the same reasons, a majority of the Board was incapable of considering a demand as to 
Count II against Staley and Count III for unjust enrichment. Staley claims that the analysis against 
him is different because demand futility is a “claim by claim determination,” SOB 9-10, but 
Delaware courts have consistently held that a board’s ability to consider litigation against officers 
is disabled where, as here, such litigation could implicate the board’s own wrongdoing. See, e.g., 
Chou, 2020 WL 5028065, at *26 (excusing demand where “the Director Defendants could not 
bring their business judgment to bear on a demand to prosecute [claims raised only against 
officers], because such litigation would implicate their own wrongdoing adequately pled in [claims 
raised against current directors]”). 
Staley (and the rest of the Defendants) separately argue that demand cannot be futile 
because JPM has already sued Staley. SOB 8; DOB 10 n.10. JPM’s belated and reactive decision 
to sue Staley is not the gleaming seal of impartiality that Defendants make it out to be, but rather 
a transparent attempt to deflect blame from Defendants’ own longstanding facilitation of Epstein’s 
horrific crimes onto a high-ranking executive no longer affiliated with JPM. Instead of proactively 
holding Staley accountable for his misconduct, JPM sued him because, to use Staley’s words, it 
was finally “[c]onfronted with documented failures in its anti-money-laundering compliance” and 
“sought to change the narrative and deflect blame.”11  
Doe/USVI, Doc. 91 at 1. Timing and Board conflicts distinguishes this case from those on which 
Defendants rely on. See, e.g., In re Delta & Pine Land Co. S’holders Litig., 2000 WL 875421, at 
*6 (Del. Ch.) (Delta board sued ten days after planned merger collapsed, no similar board conflict); 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 29 of 34

And that encapsulates the problem. In litigating the claim against Staley, the Company 
(controlled by the Board, including Defendants) is, incentivized to deflect blame. If evidence 
implicates Staley and additional Defendants, the Company could choose not to introduce it. If 
settling the claim against Staley at a non-maximizing price means that damaging information about 
other Defendants (or non-Defendant JPM employees, e.g., Erdoes) never comes to light, the 
Company may choose that route. Thus, even if the Court will not usurp the claim against Staley 
from the Company at this stage of its litigation, Plaintiffs should be permitted unfettered access to 
the evidence against Staley and a seat at the table of any settlement discussions (should they occur) 
to ensure that the Company’s interests—not Defendants’—are being represented.   
II. 
THE RULE 12(B)(6) MOTIONS MUST BE DENIED BECAUSE THE 
COMPLAINT STATES CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY 
AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT 
A. 
THE COMPLAINT STATES BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY CLAIMS AGAINST 
DIMON, BURKE, COMBS, CROWN, FLYNN, AND KESSLER 
For the reasons discussed above, Defendants Dimon, Burke, Combs, Crown, and Flynn 
face a substantial likelihood of liability for breaching their fiduciary duties. “Because the pleading 
standard under Chancery Rule 23.1 is more demanding than the standard imposed by Chancery 
Rule 12(b)(6), it follows that the motion to dismiss the claims against these same [] Board members 
for failure to state viable claims must also be denied.” In re CBS Corp. S’holder Class Action & 
Derivative Litig., 2021 WL 268779, at *4 (Del. Ch.). The Complaint also states a claim against 
Kessler, who was on the Board from 2004 – 2007, owed the same duties as the other directors, and 
Silverzweig v. Unocal Corp., 1989 WL 3231, at *1, *4 (Del. Ch.), aff'd sub nom., Silversweig v. 
Unocal Corp., 561 A.2d 993 (Del. 1989) (Unocal board made proactive and unprompted decision 
to sue Goldman Sachs and others in connection with a tender offer; defendant directors faced no 
risk of liability); Meyers v. Keeler, 414 F. Supp. 935, 939 (W.D. Okla. 1976) (independent, 
proactive board action).  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 30 of 34

engaged in the same misconduct. ¶¶11-15, 87-92, 102-08,   
B. 
THE COMPLAINT STATES AN UNJUST ENRICHMENT CLAIM AGAINST ALL 
DEFENDANTS 
“At the pleading stage, an unjust enrichment claim that is entirely duplicative of a breach 
of fiduciary duty claim…is frequently treated ‘in the same manner when resolving a motion to 
dismiss.” Calma v. Templeton, 114 A.3d 563, 591 (Del. Ch. 2015) (citation omitted); DOB 24. 
Because the Complaint states claims for fiduciary breaches, the unjust enrichment claim survives.  
C. 
STALEY’S RULE 12(B)(6) ARGUMENTS ARE MERITLESS  
Staley argues that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim and that Plaintiffs’ claims are time-barred. 
SOB 15-20. This Court already rejected those arguments when Staley made them in response to 
JPM’s third-party complaint against him. See Doe/USVI Doc. 126, at 18-23; Doc. 163. The Court 
should reject them again for the same reasons. 
1. 
The Complaint States a Fiduciary Breach Claim Against Staley 
One of Epstein’s victims has now revealed that Staley assaulted at least one of Epstein’s 
victims and “used aggressive force” in doing so while claiming Epstein had given Staley 
“permission to do what he wanted to her.”12 Staley nevertheless argues that he cannot be held liable 
because he had no obligations with respect to the Company’s internal controls. Put differently, 
Staley argues that even if he knew that JPM was breaking the law (and even if he participated in 
Epstein’s crimes), he had no obligation to tell the Board and no obligation to stop it from 
happening. The Court of Chancery has expressly rejected that argument: “An officer who receives 
credible information indicating that the corporation is violating the law cannot turn a blind eye 
and dismiss the issue as ‘not in my area.’” McDonald’s, 289 A.3d at 370. 
Jane Doe 1 v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 2023 WL 3167633, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 1, 2023).   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 31 of 34

Moreover, even assuming counterfactually that the Plaintiffs were required to plead that 
Staley had some specific oversight duty with respect to Epstein, Plaintiffs easily meet that 
standard. When Epstein was retained as a high-value client, Staley (as head of JPM’s private 
banking division) was specifically tasked with “get[ing] to know” Epstein. ¶15. And when Staley 
became the CEO of JPM’s Asset Management Division, an internal risk function memorandum 
noted that employees would report to Staley about the risk Epstein presented as a client. ¶18. 
Indeed, JPM has alleged that “Staley’s act of disloyalty…occurred in his primary area of 
responsibility.”13 Staley cannot escape liability for his significant involvement in furthering 
Epstein’s crimes, e.g. ¶¶135-44, by falsely claiming that Epstein was outside of his purview.   
2. 
The Claims Against Staley Are Timely 
The Court correctly rejected Staley’s statute of limitations arguments in the related 
Doe/USVI Actions and should do so again here. Staley incorrectly relies on New York law. SOB 
18. Delaware law,14 which recognizes the concept of equitable tolling,15 applies. Such tolling is 
available where “a plaintiff has reasonably relied upon the competence and good faith of a 
fiduciary.” In re Tyson Foods, Inc., 919 A.2d 563, 585 (Del. Ch.). Claims are tolled until “the 
plaintiff is aware of the injury, or should have discovered it in the exercise of reasonable diligence.” 
Lebanon Cnty. Emps.’ Ret. Fund v. Collis, 287 A.3d 1160, 1212 (Del. Ch.).16  
Doe/USVI, Doc. 59 at ¶76 (cited at SOB 21 n.18). 
In diversity cases brought in New York federal court, New York’s conflict of law rules govern, 
Marino v. Grupo Mundial Tenedora S.A, 810 F. Supp. 2d 601, 606 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), New York 
law applies the internal affairs doctrine, id., which in turn applies the laws of the state of 
incorporation. Howe v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 783 F. Supp. 2d 466, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).  
Equitable claims under Delaware law are governed by the doctrine of laches, the equitable (and 
more flexible) analog of a statute of limitations defense. See Whittington v. Dragon Grp., LLC, 
991 A.2d 1, 8 (Del. 2009). The relevant laches period here is three years. See Largo Legacy Grp., 
LLC v. Charles, 2021 WL 2692426, at *9 (Del. Ch.). 
Similarly, under New York law, “[w]here [the record] does not conclusively demonstrate that a 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 30     Filed 07/20/23     Page 32 of 34

The claims against Staley were equitably tolled until the Doe and USVI Actions were filed 
in late 2022 because Plaintiffs previously had no way of knowing of Staley’s knowledge of (much 
less participation in) Epstein’s crimes. Indeed, if the Company could not be expected to discover 
the claims against Staley before the Doe and USVI Actions were filed, Plaintiffs—stockholders 
with no access to, e.g., communications involving Staley and Epstein—certainly could not have 
been. And, by any measure, Plaintiffs acted with sufficient alacrity in filing suit against Staley, 
thereby defeating any claim of unreasonable delay.  
3. 
Staley’s Claims-Splitting Argument Fails 
Application of the claim-splitting doctrine is discretionary. Curtis v. Citibank, N.A., 226 
F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 2000). The Court should exercise its discretion to reject Staley’s claim-
splitting argument for the same reason that Staley’s demand futility argument should be rejected. 
Staley contends that because the Company is already pursuing claims against him, Plaintiffs should 
not be permitted to do so. SOB 20-21. But Plaintiffs already explained why the Company cannot 
be trusted to maximize the value of the claims against Staley. See supra, Argument § I.E. Any 
benefits of claim-splitting therefore are outweighed by the potential harm to the Company.   
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the Motions should be denied. If the Court is inclined to grant 
the Motions, Plaintiffs should be permitted to amend the Complaint, including to incorporate the 
discovery produced after it was filed. 
plaintiff had knowledge of facts from which the alleged fraud might be reasonably inferred, the 
cause of action should not be disposed of summarily on statute of limitations grounds.” Epiphany

CONSENT ORDER 
WHEREAS, the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America 
(“Comptroller”), through his national bank examiners and other staff of the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), has conducted examinations of JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., Columbus, Ohio; JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., San Francisco, 
California; and Chase Bank USA, N.A., Newark, Delaware (collectively referred to as 
“Bank”). The OCC has identified deficiencies in the Bank’s overall program for Bank 
Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (“BSA/AML”) compliance and has informed the 
Bank of the findings resulting from the examinations. 
WHEREAS, the Bank, by and through its duly elected and acting Boards of 
Directors (collectively referred to as “Board”), has executed a “Stipulation and Consent 
to the Issuance of a Consent Order,” dated January__14___, 2013, that is accepted by the 
Page 1 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 2 of 37

Comptroller (“Stipulation”).  By this Stipulation and Consent, which is incorporated by 
reference, the Bank has consented to the issuance of this Consent Cease and Desist Order 
(“Order”) by the Comptroller, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(b).  The Bank has begun 
corrective action, and has committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to 
remedy the deficiencies identified by the OCC, and to enhance the Bank’s BSA/AML 
compliance program. 
ARTICLE I 
COMPTROLLER’S FINDINGS 
The Comptroller finds, and the Bank neither admits nor denies, the following: 
(1) 
The OCC’s examination findings establish that the Bank has deficiencies 
in its BSA/AML compliance program.  These deficiencies have resulted in the failure to 
correct a previously reported problem and a BSA/AML compliance program violation 
under 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s) and its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. § 21.21 (BSA 
Compliance Program).  In addition, the Bank has violated 12 C.F.R. § 21.11 (Suspicious 
Activity Report Filings). 
(2) 
The Bank has failed to adopt and implement a compliance program that 
adequately covers the required BSA/AML program elements due to an inadequate system 
of internal controls, and ineffective independent testing.  The Bank did not develop 
adequate due diligence on customers, particularly in the Commercial and Business 
Banking Unit, a repeat problem, and failed to file all necessary Suspicious Activity 
Reports (“SARs”) related to suspicious customer activity. 
(3) 
The Bank failed to correct previously identified systemic weaknesses in 
the adequacy of customer due diligence and the effectiveness of monitoring in light of the 
Page 2 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 3 of 37

customers’ cash activity and business type, constituting a deficiency in its BSA/AML 
compliance program and resulting in a violation of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s)(3)(B). 
(4) 
Some of the critical deficiencies in the elements of the Bank’s BSA/AML 
compliance program, resulting in a violation of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s)(3)(A) and 12 C.F.R. 
§ 21.21, include the following: 
(a)  
The Bank has an inadequate system of internal controls and 
independent testing. 
(b)  
The Bank has less than satisfactory risk assessment processes that 
do not provide an adequate foundation for management’s efforts to 
identify, manage, and control risk.  
(c)  
The Bank has systemic deficiencies in its transaction monitoring 
systems, due diligence processes, risk management, and quality 
assurance programs. 
(d)  
The Bank does not have enterprise-wide policies and procedures to 
ensure that foreign branch suspicious activity involving customers 
of other bank branches is effectively communicated to other 
affected branch locations and applicable AML operations staff.   
The Bank also does not have enterprise-wide policies and 
procedures to ensure that on a risk basis, customer transactions at 
foreign branch locations can be assessed, aggregated, and 
monitored. 
Page 3 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 4 of 37

(e)  
The Bank has significant shortcomings in SAR decision-making 
protocols and an ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and 
alerts are properly documented, tracked, and resolved. 
(5) 
The Bank failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity and 
file the required SARs concerning suspicious customer activities, in violation of 
C.F.R. § 21.11. In some of these cases, the Bank self-identified the issues and is 
engaged in remediation. 
(6) 
The Bank’s internal controls, including filtering processes and 
independent testing, with respect to Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) 
compliance are inadequate. 
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that: 
ARTICLE II  
COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE  
(1) 
The Board shall appoint and maintain a Compliance Committee of at least 
three (3) directors, of which a majority may not be employees or officers of the Bank or 
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  The names of the initial members of the Compliance 
Committee shall be submitted in writing to the Examiner-in-Charge for a written 
determination of no supervisory objection.  In the event of a change of the membership, 
the name of any new member shall be submitted in writing to the Examiner-in-Charge at 
the Bank (“Examiner-in-Charge”) for a written determination of no supervisory 
objection. The Compliance Committee shall be responsible for coordinating and 
Page 4 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 5 of 37

monitoring the Bank’s adherence to the provisions of this Order.  The Compliance 
Committee shall meet at least monthly and maintain minutes of its meetings. 
(2) 
Within ninety (90) days of this Order, and quarterly thereafter, the 
Compliance Committee shall submit a written progress report to the Board setting forth 
in detail the actions taken to comply with each Article of this Order, and the results and 
status of those actions, including improvements to the BSA/AML Program. 
(3) 
The Board shall forward a copy of the Compliance Committee’s report, 
with any additional comments by the Board, to the Deputy Comptroller for Large Bank 
Supervision (“Deputy Comptroller”) and the Examiner-in-Charge within ten (10) days of 
receiving such report. 
ARTICLE III  
COMPREHENSIVE BSA/AML ACTION PLAN  
(1) 
Within sixty (60) days of this Order, the Bank shall submit to the Deputy 
Comptroller and the Examiner-in-Charge a plan containing a complete description of the 
actions that are necessary and appropriate to achieve full compliance with Articles IV 
through XI of this Order (“BSA/AML Action Plan”).  The Bank shall implement the 
BSA/AML Action Plan upon the Deputy Comptroller’s issuance of a written 
determination of no supervisory objection.  In the event the Deputy Comptroller requires 
the Bank to revise the plan, the Bank shall promptly make and the Board shall approve 
necessary and appropriate revisions and resubmit the BSA/AML Action Plan to the 
Deputy Comptroller and Examiner-in-Charge for review and determination of no 
supervisory objection. Following implementation, the Bank shall not take any action that 
Page 5 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 6 of 37

will cause a significant deviation from, or material change to, the BSA/AML Action Plan 
unless and until the Bank has received a prior written determination of no supervisory 
objection from the Deputy Comptroller. 
(a)  
The Board shall ensure that the Bank achieves and thereafter 
maintains compliance with this Order, including, without 
limitation, successful implementation of the BSA/AML Action 
Plan. The Board shall further ensure that, upon implementation of 
the BSA/AML Action Plan, the Bank achieves and maintains an 
effective BSA/AML compliance program, in accordance with the 
BSA and its implementing regulations. In each instance in this 
Order in which the Board is required to ensure adherence to or 
undertake to perform certain obligations of the Bank, it is intended 
to mean that the Board shall: Authorize and adopt such actions on 
behalf of the Bank as may be necessary for the Bank to perform its 
obligations and undertakings. 
(b)  
Require the timely reporting by Bank management of such actions 
directed by the Board to be taken under this Order;  
(c)  
Require corrective action be taken in a timely manner for any non­
compliance with such actions; and  
(d)  
Follow-up on any non-compliance with such actions in a timely 
and appropriate manner. 
(2) 
The BSA/AML Action Plan must specify timelines for completion of each 
of the requirements of Articles IV through XI of this Order.  The timelines in the 
Page 6 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 7 of 37

BSA/AML Action Plan shall be consistent with any deadlines set forth in these Articles, 
unless modified by written agreement with the Deputy Comptroller or the Examiner-in-
Charge. 
(3) 
Upon request by the Deputy Comptroller or the Examiner-in-Charge, the 
Bank shall modify the BSA/AML Action Plan to address any Matters Requiring 
Attention concerning BSA/AML matters, or citations of violations of law concerning 
BSA/AML matters, which the OCC may issue to the Bank following the effective date of 
this Order. 
(4) 
The Bank shall ensure that it has sufficient processes, personnel, and 
control systems to implement and adhere to this Order.  The BSA/AML Action Plan must 
specify in detail budget outlays and staffing, including aggregated staff compensation 
information in a format acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge, that are necessary to 
achieve and maintain full compliance with Articles IV through XI of this Order. 
(5) 
Any independent consultant or auditor engaged by the Bank or the Board 
to assist in the assessment of the BSA/AML Action Plan or other compliance with this 
Order must have demonstrated and specialized experience with the BSA/AML matters 
that are the subject of the engagement, and must not be subject to any conflict of interest 
affecting the consultant’s or auditor’s independence.  
(6) 
Within ten (10) days of this Order, the Bank shall designate an officer to 
be responsible for coordinating and submitting to the OCC the written plans, reports, and 
other documents required to be submitted under the terms and conditions of this Order.

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 8 of 37

ARTICLE IV  
MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
(1) 
The Bank shall ensure there are clear lines of authority and responsibility 
for BSA/AML and OFAC compliance with respect to lines of business and corporate 
functions, and that competent and independent compliance management is in place on a 
full-time basis.  
(2) 
The Bank shall ensure that compliance staff has the appropriate level of 
authority to implement the BSA/AML Compliance Program and, as needed, question 
account relationships and business plans. Compliance staff shall maintain independence 
from the business line.  The Bank shall follow any applicable guidance addressing 
independence issued by the OCC or the FFIEC. 
(3) 
The Bank shall ensure that senior management and line of business 
management are accountable for effectively implementing bank policies and procedures, 
and fulfilling BSA/AML/OFAC obligations.  The Bank shall incorporate BSA/AML and 
OFAC compliance into the performance evaluation process for senior and line of 
business management.  Additionally, written Bank policies and procedures shall clearly 
outline the BSA/AML/OFAC responsibilities of senior management and relevant 
business line employees, including, but not limited to, relationship managers, business 
banking, commercial banking, correspondent banking and private banking personnel, and 
legal and business development staff.   
(4) 
The Bank shall develop appropriate objectives and means to measure the 
effectiveness of compliance management officers and compliance management personnel 
within each line of business and for those with responsibilities across lines of business.

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 9 of 37

(5) 
The Board shall not permit any other party, including but not limited to the 
Bank’s holding company, to perform any act on behalf of the Bank which is the subject 
of this Order, unless the Bank requires that party to perform such act in the manner and 
under safeguards and controls as least as stringent as required by the Bank under the 
terms of this Order as implemented by the Bank. 
ARTICLE V 
BSA/AML AND OFAC COMPLIANCE PROGRAM EVALUATION 
AND RISK ASSESSMENT 
(1) 
Within 60 days of this Order, the Bank shall provide an action plan for the 
completion of an evaluation of the Bank’s BSA/AML and OFAC Compliance Programs 
to the Examiner-in-Charge for no supervisory objection.  If the Examiner-in-Charge 
recommends changes to the evaluation, the Bank shall incorporate those changes or 
suggest alternatives that are acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge. 
(2) 
The evaluation required pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this Article shall be 
completed and submitted to the Examiner-in-Charge within 90 days following the non-
objection of the Examiner-in-Charge to the action plan referred to in Article V(1). This 
evaluation shall include assessments of the BSA/AML and OFAC Compliance Programs’ 
organizational structure, enterprise-wide effectiveness, competency of management, 
accountability, staffing requirements, internal controls, customer due diligence processes, 
risk assessment processes, suspicious activity monitoring systems, audit/independent 
testing, and training. The evaluation shall include recommendations for enhancements 
needed to achieve remediation of any deficiencies identified in the evaluation. 
Page 9 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 10 of 37

(3) 
This evaluation shall also include a comprehensive assessment of the 
Bank’s BSA/AML risk, including detailed quantification of risk to accurately assess the 
level of risk and the adequacy of controls.  The comprehensive assessment shall include: 
(a)  
An assessment of the AML risk associated with each line of 
business, and an enterprise-wide assessment of AML risk.  This 
evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the 
risk associated with correspondent banking, pre-paid cards and 
mobile banking, cash-intensive businesses, remote deposit capture, 
business, commercial, and private banking, and other higher risk 
products, services, customers, or geographies.  The purpose of the 
enterprise-wide assessment is to identify systemic AML risk that 
may not be apparent in a risk assessment focused on line of 
business or assessment units;      
(b)  
Evaluation of the Bank’s current methodology for identifying and 
quantifying the level of BSA/AML risk associated with categories 
of customers and for specific customers.  The methodology should 
ensure that the relationships are reviewed holistically, across lines 
of business, taking into consideration the risk within the Bank.  
This evaluation shall result in the development of a comprehensive 
approach to quantifying BSA/AML risk for new and existing 
customers.  The quantification of risk shall encompass a 
customer’s entire relationship with the Bank, include the purpose 
of the account, actual or anticipated activity in the account (e.g., 
Page 10 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 11 of 37

type, volume, and value (number and dollar) of transaction activity 
engaged in), nature of the customer’s business or occupation, 
customer location (e.g., customers’ geographic location, where 
they transact business, and have significant operations), types of 
products and services used by the customer, material changes in 
the customer’s relationship with the Bank, as well as other factors 
discussed within the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual; 
(c)  
The identification of specific lines of business, geographies, 
products or processes where controls are not commensurate with 
the level of AML risk exposure; 
(d)  
The risk assessment shall be refreshed periodically, the timeframe 
for which shall not exceed twelve months, or whenever there is a 
significant change in AML risk within the Bank or line of business.  
The AML risk assessments shall also be independently reviewed 
by the Bank’s internal audit function for the adequacy of 
identification of risk; control plan to manage identified risks; gap 
analyses where controls are not sufficient; and action plans to 
address gaps; and 
(e)  
The aggregation of the Bank’s enterprise-wide AML risk shall be 
logical and clearly supported in the work papers.  The work papers 
and supporting documentation shall be readily accessible for   
OCC review.

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 12 of 37

(4) 
OFAC risk shall be included within the BSA/AML risk assessment, using 
the same criteria as described above in paragraphs 2(a) through (e) of this Article.  
ARTICLE VI  
CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE  
(1) 
Within 90 days of this Order, the Bank shall ensure that appropriate 
customer due diligence policies, procedures, and processes are developed.  These controls 
shall be implemented and applied on a Bank-wide basis.  Minimum corporate standards 
shall provide general guidance, and individual lines of business and AML compliance 
management shall develop standards based on their client base, products, services, 
geographic risk, and other AML risk factors.  Customer due diligence shall be 
commensurate with the customer’s risk profile, and sufficient for the bank to develop an 
understanding of normal and expected activity for the customer’s occupation or business 
operations. The customer due diligence process shall include the following items: 
(a)  
Information regarding the client’s/customer’s relationships with 
the Bank, all lines of business within the Bank, and all Bank 
subsidiaries or affiliates (that are subject to management control by 
the Banks’ holding company).  This includes accounts within other 
lines of business, regions, and countries (as permitted by 
jurisdiction).  The relationship includes its owners, principals, 
signers, subsidiaries, affiliates, and parties with the ability to 
manage or control the account or client; 
Page 12 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 13 of 37

(b)  
An electronic due diligence database, which includes information 
specified in subparagraph (a) above, that is readily accessible to 
the relationship manager or other parties responsible for the 
customer relationship, AML compliance personnel, suspicious 
activity monitoring alert analysts and investigators, and quality 
control and assurance personnel; 
(c)  
Customer due diligence shall be periodically updated to reflect 
changes in the customer’s behavior, activity profile, derogatory 
information, periodic reviews of the customer relationship, or other 
factors that impact the AML risk for the client and shall include 
any remediation required by the standards required by the Article. 
The frequency of the periodic update of due diligence shall be 
based on risk with the update performed at least annually for high-
risk relationships, triennially for low-risk business relationships, 
and as appropriate for low-risk individuals.  The periodic updates 
shall be documented, and subject to quality assurance processes; 
(d)  
The client relationship AML risk shall be detailed in the customer 
due diligence record, along with the supporting factors, including 
transaction activity, geographies involved, and suspicious activity 
monitoring alert and filing history, among others; 
(e)  
Specialized or enhanced due diligence for higher risk clients and/or 
products and services shall be implemented enterprise-wide.  
These due diligence standards shall comply with the FFIEC 
Page 13 of 26

BSA/AML Examination Manual, the Interagency Guidance on 
Beneficial Ownership Information (OCC 2010-11), as well as 
industry standards; and 
(f)  
Management processes to periodically review, based on the 
relationship risk, the type, volume, and value of customer activities 
in relation to normal and expected levels.  The purpose of these 
reviews shall be to determine if the customer’s activity is 
reasonable, that customer due diligence is current and complete, 
and the customer risk rating is accurate.  These reviews shall be 
documented and quality assurance processes must ensure the 
reviews are comprehensive and accurate.  Standards and processes 
shall be established for elevating reviews for additional 
management consideration regarding increased monitoring, 
additional due diligence, or account closure/   
(2) 
The Bank shall submit its policies and procedures for customer due 
diligence to the Examiner-in-Charge for prior no supervisory objection.  If the Examiner­
in-Charge recommends changes to the policies or procedures, the Bank shall incorporate 
those changes or suggest alternatives that are acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge.

transaction monitoring system, alert management process, and 
SAR decisioning and filing are working effectively and according 
to internal standards. 
ARTICLE VIII 
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT REVIEW (“SAR LOOK-BACK”) 
(1) 
Within 30 days of this Order, the Banks shall provide to the Examiner-in-
Charge for prior no supervisory objection an action plan to review the quality of SAR 
filings (“SAR look-back”).  The purpose of the SAR look-back is to review the quality of 
SARs filed and determine whether corrections or amendments are necessary to ensure 
Page 17 of 26 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-1     Filed 07/20/23     Page 18 of 37

that the suspicious activity identified was accurately reported in accordance with 12 
C.F.R. § 21.11, and whether additional SARs should be filed on additional subjects or for 
continuing suspicious activity. 
(2) 
The SAR look-back must be supervised and certified by independent 
consultant(s) acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge with expertise in conducting look-
back reviews for large institutions. 
(3) 
Upon completion of the SAR look-back: (i) the Bank shall ensure that 
SARs have been filed, in accordance with 12 C.F.R. § 21.11, for any previously reported 
suspicious activity identified during this review; (ii) the written findings shall be reported 
to the Board; and (iii) the Bank will provide the Examiner-in-Charge with a report, 
containing relevant information, including the number of modified or amended SARs and 
any additional or continuing activity SARs filed as a result of the review.   
(4) 
Based upon the results of the SAR look-back, the OCC may expand the 
scope of the independent review or require a longer SAR look-back period.  If an 
additional SAR look-back is deemed appropriate by the OCC, the Bank shall complete 
the SAR look-back in accordance with this Article.  
ARTICLE IX

back”) covering non-bank financial institutions, as defined in the FFIEC BSA/AML 
Examination Manual.  
(2) 
The purpose of the account and transaction look-back is to determine 
whether suspicious activity was timely identified by the Bank, and, if appropriate to do 
so, was then timely reported by the Bank in accordance with 12 C.F.R. § 21.11. 
(3) 
The account and transaction look-back must be supervised and certified by 
independent consultant(s) with expertise in conducting look-back reviews for large 
institutions. The account and transaction look-back shall be risk-based, including the 
risks identified in the Bank’s risk assessment as revised under Article V, and shall 
identify the sampling, software screening, or analytical techniques used to identify 
transactions that are subject to review for suspicious activity. 
(4) 
Upon completion of the account and transaction look-back: (i) the Bank 
shall ensure that SARs have been filed, in accordance with 12 C.F.R. § 21.11, for any 
previously unreported suspicious activity identified during this review; (ii) the written 
findings shall be reported to the Board; and (iii) the Bank will provide the Examiner-in-
Charge with a report, containing relevant information, identifying any SARs filed as a 
result of previously unreported suspicious activity.   
(5) 
Based upon the results of the account and transaction look-back, the OCC 
may expand the scope of the independent review or require a longer account and 
transaction look-back period. If an additional account and transaction look-back is 
deemed appropriate by the OCC, the Bank shall complete the account and transaction 
look-back in accordance with this Article.

experience level, specialty expertise regarding BSA/AML and OFAC, and number of the 
individuals employed. 
(4) 
The Bank’s Audit Program shall report all internal audit- and OCC-
identified deficiencies to the Compliance Committee, the Bank’s Audit Committee, and 
to senior compliance management.  The reports shall indicate the severity of the 
deficiencies, the risks, the corrective actions, and timeframes.  Corrective actions must be 
followed-up by internal audit within a reasonable period of time until closed.  Monthly 
status reports on corrective action status shall be provided to the Compliance Committee 
and the Bank’s Audit Committee. 
(5) 
The Board and senior compliance management shall receive adequately 
detailed information about the Bank’s compliance management program in light of their

ARTICLE XI  
NEW ACCOUNTS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR MARKET  
SEGMENTS/INDUSTRIES  
(1) 
The Bank shall ensure that new products and services are subject to senior 
level compliance review and approval.  These reviews must consider the quantity of 
BSA/AML and OFAC risk of the new product or service as well as the quality of risk 
management.  At a minimum, these reviews must assess the ability of the Bank’s 
compliance program to manage the risk, the anticipated growth in both the business and 
the compliance function, and the ability of alert investigators’ to manage any anticipated 
increase in alert volume as a result of the new business. 
(2) 
The Bank shall not enter into a new high-risk (inherent quantity) market 
segment/industry, enter into new or expand existing high-risk (inherent quantity) lines of 
business, without conducting a risk assessment, a determination of compliance staffing 
impact, and without providing prior notification of at least 30 days to the Examiner-in-
Charge of such proposed actions.

become effective upon its execution by the Comptroller through his authorized representative, 
and will be fully enforceable by the Comptroller pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(b).   
(4) 
Notwithstanding the absence of mutuality of obligation, or of consideration, or of 
a contract, the Comptroller may enforce any of the commitments or obligations herein 
undertaken by the Bank under his supervisory powers, including 12 U.S.C. § 1818(b), and not as 
a matter of contract law.  The Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Bank nor the 
Comptroller has any intention to enter into a contract.   
(5) 
The Bank declares that no separate promise or inducement of any kind has been 
made by the Comptroller, or by his agents or employees, to cause or induce the Bank to consent 
to the issuance of the Consent Order and/or execute this Stipulation. 
(6) 
The Bank expressly acknowledges that no officer or employee of the Comptroller 
has statutory or other authority to bind the United States, the United States Treasury Department, 
the Comptroller, or any other federal bank regulatory agency or entity, or any officer or 
employee of any of those entities to a contract affecting the Comptroller’s exercise of his 
supervisory responsibilities.

against the Bank contemplated by the Comptroller, based on the unsafe or unsound practices and 
violations of law or regulation described in the Comptroller’s Findings set forth in Article I of 
the Consent Order. The OCC releases and discharges the Bank from all potential liability for a 
cease and desist order that has been or might have been asserted by the OCC based on the 
practices and violations described in the Comptroller’s Findings set forth in Article I of the 
Consent Order, to the extent known to the OCC as of the effective date of the Order.  Provided, 
however, that nothing in this Stipulation or the Consent Order shall prevent the Comptroller from

instituting other enforcement actions against the Bank or any of its institution-affiliated parties, 
including, without limitation, assessment of civil money penalties, based on the findings set forth 
in the Consent Order, or any other findings, and nothing in the Consent Order shall preclude or 
affect any right of the OCC to determine and ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of this 
Stipulation or the Consent Order. 
(8) 
The terms and provisions of the Stipulation and the Consent Order shall be 
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their successors in interest.  
Nothing in this Stipulation or the Consent Order, express or implied, shall give to any person or 
entity, other than the parties hereto, and their successors hereunder, any benefit or any legal or

CONSENT ORDER FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY 
The Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America (“Comptroller”), 
through his national bank examiners and other staff of the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (“OCC”), has conducted examinations of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Columbus, 
Ohio; JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., San Francisco, California; and Chase Bank 
USA, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware (collectively referred to as “Bank”).  The OCC has identified 
deficiencies in the Bank’s Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (“BSA/AML”) compliance 
program, resulting in violations of 31 U.S.C. § 5318(i) and its implementing regulation,  
C.F.R. § 1010.610(a), (b) and (c); 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s) and its implementing regulation,  
C.F.R. § 21.21(c); and 12 C.F.R. § 21.11(c) and (d).  The Bank is also the subject of a prior 
OCC Consent Cease and Desist Order issued on January 14, 2013 (“January 2013 Order”).   
Examinations conducted subsequent to the issuance of the January 2013 Order have 
revealed additional deficiencies in the Bank’s BSA/AML compliance program, which resulted in 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 2 of 20

the citation of additional violations of law and regulation.  The Bank has been notified of the 
findings of these examinations.  
The Bank, by and through its duly elected and acting Boards of Directors, has executed a 
“Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order for the Assessment of a Civil 
Money Penalty,” dated January 7, 2014, that is accepted by the Comptroller (“Stipulation”).  By 
this Stipulation, which is incorporated herein by reference, the Bank has consented to the 
issuance of this Consent Order for the Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty (“Consent Order”) 
by the Comptroller. 
On January 6, 2014, the Bank entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) 
with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  In the DPA, the 
Bank admitted to certain facts concerning the failure to file a Suspicious Activity Report 
(“SAR”) in the United States on Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, LLC (“Madoff”). 
ARTICLE I 
COMPTROLLER’S FINDINGS 
The Comptroller finds the following: 
The Comptroller incorporates the following findings from Article I of the January 2013 
Order: 
(1) 
The OCC’s examination findings establish that the Bank has deficiencies in its 
BSA/AML compliance program.  These deficiencies have resulted in the failure to correct a 
previously reported problem and a BSA/AML compliance program violation under 
U.S.C. § 1818(s) and its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. § 21.21 (BSA Compliance 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 3 of 20

Program).  In addition, the Bank has violated 12 C.F.R. § 21.11 (Suspicious Activity Report 
Filings). 
(2) 
The Bank has failed to adopt and implement a compliance program that 
adequately covers the required BSA/AML program elements due to an inadequate system of 
internal controls and ineffective independent testing.  The Bank did not develop adequate due 
diligence on customers, particularly in the Commercial and Business Banking Unit, a repeat 
problem, and failed to file all necessary SARs related to suspicious customer activity. 
(3) 
The Bank failed to correct previously identified systemic weaknesses in the 
adequacy of customer due diligence and the effectiveness of monitoring in light of the 
customers’ cash activity and business type, constituting a deficiency in its BSA/AML 
compliance program and resulting in a violation of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s)(3)(B). 
(4) 
Some of the critical deficiencies in the elements of the Bank’s BSA/AML 
compliance program, resulting in a violation of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s)(3)(A) and 12 C.F.R. § 21.21, 
include the following: 
(a) 
The Bank has an inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing. 
(b) 
The Bank has less than satisfactory risk assessment processes that do not provide 
an adequate foundation for management’s efforts to identify, manage, and control risk. 
(c) 
The Bank has systemic deficiencies in its transaction monitoring systems, due 
diligence processes, risk management, and quality assurance programs. 
(d) 
The Bank does not have enterprise-wide policies and procedures to ensure that 
foreign branch suspicious activity involving customers of other bank branches is effectively 
communicated to other affected branch locations and applicable AML operations staff.  The 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 4 of 20

Bank also does not have enterprise-wide policies and procedures to ensure that on a risk basis, 
customer transactions at foreign branch locations can be assessed, aggregated, and monitored. 
(e) 
The Bank has significant shortcomings in SAR decision-making protocols and an 
ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and alerts are properly documented, tracked, and 
resolved. 
(5) 
The Bank failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity and file the 
required SARs concerning suspicious customer activities, in violation of 12 C.F.R. § 21.11.  In 
some of these cases, the Bank self-identified the issues and is engaged in remediation. 
(6) 
The Bank’s internal controls, including filtering processes and independent 
testing, with respect to Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) compliance are inadequate. 
The Comptroller further finds, for purposes of this Consent Order: 
(7) 
The Bank has not established adequate BSA/AML and due diligence programs for 
its foreign branches, offices, or affiliates in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5318(i) (implementing 
Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 312(a), 115 Stat. 272, 312 
(2001)), and 12 C.F.R. § 21.21(c). This violation includes the Bank's failure to conduct 
suspicious activity monitoring of transactions between the Bank and certain of the Bank's 
affiliates. 
(8) 
The Bank did not establish and implement an adequate BSA/AML program for 
correspondent banking and remote deposit capture (“RDC”) and international cash letter (“ICL”) 
products or adequate internal controls, including the Bank’s due diligence programs, in the 
correspondent banking and RDC/ICL areas. Inadequate controls resulted in certain special 
accommodation clients in the Bank that operated outside of the normal AML monitoring and 
OFAC screening controls. For these reasons, the Bank is in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5318(i),  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 5 of 20

U.S.C. § 1818(s), 12 C.F.R. § 21.21(c), and 31 C.F.R. § 1010.610(a), (b), and (c).  These 
failures also caused the Bank to fail to file SARs and to do so timely in violation of 12 C.F.R.  
§ 21.11(c) and (d). 
(9) 
The Bank has failed to correct previously reported problems in several areas, 
including Asia Private Banking, and with respect to one of its correspondent bank relationships, 
resulting in additional violations of 12 U.S.C. § 1818(s).  
(10)
 The Bank’s SAR filing processes and procedures for SAR filing in the areas of 
Chase Auto Finance and Student Lending were inadequate, and the Bank further failed in certain 
instances to file SARs related to suspected fraud by employees, resulting in violations of  
C.F.R. § 21.11(c). 
(11) 
Between 2006 and 2008, the Bank created, sold and made a secondary market for 
structured products that provided customers access to Madoff’s investment strategy through 
several “feeder funds.” Prior to Bernard L. Madoff’s arrest, the Bank developed concerns about 
Madoff and a distributor of Madoff-linked investments created by the Bank.  These concerns 
caused the Bank’s London branch to file a suspicious activity report with the United Kingdom’s 
Serious Organised Crime Agency on October 29, 2008.  Aware that Madoff was a client of the 
Bank in the U.S., U.K.-based Bank employees conveyed these concerns to U.S.-based Bank 
employees.  Despite the fact that these concerns caused the Bank to file a suspicious activity 
report in the U.K., the Bank did not file a SAR in the U.S. based on these concerns.  The failure 
to file a SAR on this activity and to do so timely is significant and a violation of 12 C.F.R.  
§ 21.11(c) and (d). 
(12)
ﾭ
­
chartered affiliate of a Venezuelan bank. Although the Bank filed SARs relating to this 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 6 of 20

correspondent account, the Bank did not investigate additional suspicious activity, totaling over 
$2 billion, pertaining to counterparties that flowed through the account at the Bank.  The failure 
to file SARs on this activity and to do so timely is significant and in violation of 12 C.F.R.  
§ 21.11(c) and (d). 
(13) 
From 2004 to 2010, the Bank failed to adequately monitor, investigate and file 
SARs on approximately $450 million of suspicious bulk cash transactions in an account at the 
Bank for another of its correspondents. The failure to file SARs on this activity and to do so 
timely is significant and in violation of 12 C.F.R. § 21.11(c) and (d). 
(14) 
From February 2013 to March 2013, the Bank failed to adequately monitor and 
file a supplemental SAR on ongoing activity relating to $471,680 in suspicious transactions in an 
account at the Bank for a third correspondent.  The failure to file SARs on this activity and to do 
so timely is significant and in violation of 12 C.F.R. § 21.11(c) and (d). 
ARTICLE II 
ORDER FOR A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY 
Pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C.  
§ 1818(i), the Comptroller orders, and the Bank consents to, the following: 
(1)

three hundred and fifty million dollars ($350,000,000), which shall be paid upon the execution of

manner as an effective and outstanding order that has been issued and has become final pursuant 
to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(h) and (i). 
ARTICLE III  
OTHER PROVISIONS  
(1) 
This Consent Order is intended to be, and shall be construed to be, a final order 
issued pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)(2), and expressly does not form, and may not be

(2) 
This Consent Order constitutes a settlement of the civil money penalty proceeding 
against the Bank contemplated by the Comptroller, based on the violations of law and regulation 
described in the Comptroller’s Findings set forth in Article I of this Consent Order.  The OCC 
releases and discharges the Bank from all potential liability for a civil money penalty that has 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 8 of 20

been or might have been asserted by the Comptroller based solely on the violations of law and 
regulation as described in the referenced findings, to the extent known to the Comptroller as of 
the effective date of the Consent Order. Provided, however, that nothing in the Stipulation or 
this Consent Order shall prevent the Comptroller from instituting enforcement actions against the 
Bank or any of its institution-affiliated parties, including, without limitation, assessment of civil 
money penalties, based on any other findings, including, but not limited to, findings related to 
required look backs or reviews conducted by or on behalf of the Bank.  The violations of law and 
regulation described in Article I of this Consent Order may be utilized by the Comptroller in 
other future enforcement actions against the Bank or its institution-affiliated parties, including, 
without limitation, to establish a pattern or practice of violations or unsafe and unsound 
practices, or the continuation of a pattern or practice of violations or unsafe or unsound practices.  
Nothing in this Consent Order shall preclude or affect any right of the Comptroller to determine 
and ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of the Stipulation or this Consent Order. 
(3) 
The terms of this Consent Order, including this paragraph, are not subject to 
amendment or modification by any extraneous expression, prior agreements, or prior 
arrangements between the parties, whether oral or written.

STIPULATION AND CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A CONSENT ORDER FOR 
THE ASSESSMENT OF A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY 
The Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America (“Comptroller”), based 
upon information derived from the exercise of his regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, 
intends to initiate a civil money penalty (“CMP”) proceeding against JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., Columbus, Ohio; JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., San Francisco, California; 
and Chase Bank USA, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware (collectively referred to as “Bank”), 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i), based on serious deficiencies in the Bank’s Bank Secrecy 
Act/anti-money laundering (“BSA/AML”) compliance program and violations of Suspicious 
Activity Reporting laws and regulations. 
In the interest of cooperation and to avoid additional costs associated with administrative 
and judicial proceedings with respect to the above matter, and without an adjudication on the 
merits, the Bank, through its duly elected and acting Boards of Directors (“Boards”), has agreed 
to execute this Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order for the Assessment of 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 11 of 20

a Civil Money Penalty (“Stipulation”), that is accepted by the Comptroller, through his duly 
authorized representative. 
In consideration of the above premises, it is stipulated by the Bank that: 
ARTICLE I  
JURISDICTION  
(1) 
The Bank is a national banking association chartered and examined by the 
Comptroller pursuant to the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended, 12 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. 
(2) 
The Comptroller is “the appropriate Federal banking agency” regarding the Bank 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. §§ 1813(q) and 1818(i). 
(3) 
The Bank is an “insured depository institution” within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 
§ 1818(i). 
ARTICLE II  
CONSENT  
(1) 
The Bank consents and agrees to issuance of the accompanying Consent Order for 
the Assessment of a Civil Money Penalty (“Consent Order”) by the Comptroller.   
(2) 
The terms and provisions of the Consent Order apply to JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., Columbus, Ohio; JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A., San Francisco, California; 
and Chase Bank USA, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware; and all their subsidiaries, even though those 
subsidiaries are not named as parties to the Consent Order. 
(3) 
The Bank consents and agrees that the Consent Order shall be deemed an “order 
issued with the consent of the depository institution” pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(h)(2), and 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 12 of 20

consents and agrees that the Consent Order shall become effective upon its execution by the 
Comptroller through his authorized representative, and shall be fully enforceable by the 
Comptroller pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i).   
(4) 
Notwithstanding the absence of mutuality of obligation, or of consideration, or of 
a contract, the Comptroller may enforce any of the commitments or obligations herein 
undertaken by the Bank under his supervisory powers, including 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i), and not as 
a matter of contract law.  The Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Bank nor the 
Comptroller has any intention to enter into a contract. 
(5) 
The Bank expressly acknowledges that no separate promise or inducement of any 
kind has been made by the Comptroller, or by his agents or employees, to cause or induce the 
Bank to consent to the issuance of the Consent Order and/or execute this Stipulation. 
(6) 
The Bank expressly acknowledges that no officer or employee of the Comptroller 
has statutory or other authority to bind the United States, the United States Treasury Department, 
the Comptroller, or any other federal bank regulatory agency or entity, or any officer or 
employee of any of those entities to a contract affecting the Comptroller’s exercise of his 
supervisory responsibilities. 
(7) 
The Consent Order constitutes a settlement of the CMP proceeding against the 
Bank contemplated by the Comptroller, based on the violations of law and regulation described 
in the Comptroller’s Findings set forth in Article I of the Consent Order.  The OCC releases and 
discharges the Bank from all potential liability for a CMP that has been or might have been 
asserted by the Comptroller based solely on the violations of law and regulation as described in 
the referenced findings, to the extent known to the Comptroller as of the effective date of the 
Consent Order. Provided, however, that nothing in this Stipulation or the Consent Order shall 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 13 of 20

prevent the Comptroller from instituting enforcement actions against the Bank or any of its 
institution-affiliated parties, including, without limitation, assessment of CMPs, based on any 
other findings, including, but not limited to, findings related to required look backs or reviews 
conducted by or on behalf of the bank. The violations of law and regulation described in Article 
I of the Consent Order may be utilized by the Comptroller in other future enforcement actions 
against the Bank or its institution-affiliated parties, including, without limitation, to establish a 
pattern or practice of violations or unsafe and unsound practices, or the continuation of a pattern 
or practice of violations or unsafe or unsound practices.  Nothing in the Consent Order shall 
preclude or affect any right of the Comptroller to determine and ensure compliance with the 
terms and provisions of this Stipulation, the Consent Order, or the prior OCC Consent Cease and 
Desist Order issued on January 14, 2013 (“January 2013 Order”). 
ARTICLE III  
WAIVERS  
(1) 
The Bank, by executing this Stipulation and consenting to the Consent Order, 
waives: 
(a)  
Any and all rights to the issuance of a Notice of Charges pursuant to 
U.S.C. § 1818(i); 
(b)  
Any and all procedural rights available in connection with the issuance of 
the Consent Order; 
(c)  
Any and all rights to a hearing and a final agency decision pursuant to  
U.S.C. § 1818(i) and 12 C.F.R. Part 19; 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 14 of 20

(d)  
Any and all rights to seek any type of administrative or judicial review of 
the Consent Order; 
(e)  
Any and all claims for fees, costs or expenses against the Comptroller, or 
any of his agents or employees, related in any way to this enforcement 
matter or the Consent Order, whether arising under common law or under 
the terms of any statute, including, but not limited to, the Equal Access to 
Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. § 504 and 28 U.S.C. § 2412; 
(f)  
Any and all rights to assert this proceeding, this Stipulation, consent to the 
issuance of the Consent Order, and/or the issuance of the Consent Order, 
as the basis for a claim of double jeopardy in any pending or future 
proceeding brought by the United States Department of Justice or any 
other governmental entity; and 
(g)  
Any and all rights to challenge or contest the validity of the Consent 
Order. 
ARTICLE IV  
CLOSING  
(1) 
The provisions of this Stipulation and the Consent Order shall not inhibit, estop, 
bar, or otherwise prevent the Comptroller from taking any other action affecting the Bank if, at 
any time, he deems it appropriate to do so to fulfill the responsibilities placed upon him by the 
several laws of the United States of America. 
(2) 
Nothing in this Stipulation or the Consent Order shall preclude any proceedings 
brought by the Comptroller to enforce the terms of the Consent Order or the January 2013 Order, 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 31-2     Filed 07/20/23     Page 15 of 20

and nothing in this Stipulation or the Consent Order constitutes, nor shall the Bank contend that 
it constitutes, a release, discharge, compromise, settlement, dismissal, or resolution of any 
actions, or in any way affects any actions that may be or have been brought by any other 
representative of the United States or an agency thereof, including, without limitation, the United 
States Department of Justice. 
(3) 
The terms of this Stipulation and the Consent Order are not subject to amendment 
or modification by any extraneous expression, prior agreements or prior arrangements between 
the parties, whether oral or written.

The Opposition alternates between criticizing the Board for being “ignorant to Epstein’s 
crimes (or even the fact that Epstein was a client),” and speculating “one could have 
imagined…information…would have made its way to the Board” and “it is reasonably inferable” 
that Directors learned of purported failures to meet BSA obligations.  Whatever theory Plaintiffs 
are advancing, however, the Opposition makes clear that Plaintiffs cannot identify any well-
pleaded facts showing that the Director Defendants were actually aware of Epstein’s illegal 
activity, purported failures to meet BSA obligations, or even that Epstein was a Bank client.  
Plaintiffs’ rank speculation comes nowhere close to pleading that the Demand Board Directors 
face a substantial likelihood of liability or lack independence from another director who does—
requiring dismissal for failure to plead demand futility.  Plaintiffs also fail to plead that any 
Defendant engaged in bad faith misconduct sufficient to state a breach of fiduciary duty claim.  
The Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.

I.
The Complaint Fails Adequately to Plead Demand Futility.2
In Opposition, Plaintiffs concede that demand would not be futile on four of the twelve 
members of the Demand Board (Davis, Gorsky, Hobson, and Rometty).  The Opposition also does 
nothing to remedy Plaintiffs’ failure to sufficiently plead in their Complaint that six of the 
remaining eight members of the Demand Board were conflicted under the stringent demand futility 
standard.  Specifically, Plaintiffs cannot show that six of the remaining Demand Board Directors 
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to them in Defendants’ 
Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 25] (“Mot.”).  
Plaintiffs’ description of the Rule 23.1 pleading requirements understates the stringent standard.  
The Court is only required to accept as true the Complaint’s “particularized and well-pleaded 
allegations.”  United Food & Com. Workers Union & Participating Food Indus. Emps.’ Tri-State 
Pension Fund v. Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d 1034, 1048 (Del. 2021) (“Zuckerberg”)

either (1) “face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims” or (2) “lack[] 
independence from someone” conflicted under (1).  Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d at 1058.3
A.
Directors Who Joined the Board After Epstein Was Terminated as a Client 
Do Not Face a Substantial Likelihood of Liability.
Plaintiffs do not dispute that eight Demand Board Directors joined the Board following the 
termination of Epstein as a client (Mot. 11–12) and, as to five of these directors (Davis, Gorsky, 
Hobson, Novakovic, and Rometty), Plaintiffs do not even attempt to assert a substantial likelihood 
of liability. Focusing on only three directors (Bammann, Combs, and Neal),4 Plaintiffs argue that 
they face a substantial likelihood of liability because of the 2014 Consent Order with the OCC and 
a deferred prosecution agreement (“DPA”), relating to Bernie Madoff.5  In particular, Plaintiffs 
argue that it is “reasonably inferable” that, as a result of the government settlements, the then-
current Board was told about “past suspicious activity concerning Epstein,” and that “[i]t logically 
As to Staley, unable to dispute that the claims have already been asserted, Plaintiffs complain 
that the Bank waited too long.  Unsurprisingly, Plaintiffs cite no legal precedent in support of their 
argument, much less any legal basis for Plaintiffs’ request for “a seat at the table” of any settlement 
discussions between JPMorgan and Staley (an impractical proposal that prioritizes the interests of 
two plaintiff shareholders).  Opp. 22.  
It is telling that Plaintiffs have not asserted claims against Bammann and Neal, which 
dramatically undermines any argument that these individuals face a substantial risk of personal 
liability.  Laties v. Wise, No. Civ.A. 1280-N, 2005 WL 3501709, at *2 (Del. Ch. Dec. 14, 2005) 
(granting motion to dismiss and finding no substantial likelihood of liability where complaint did 
not assert “conduct for which the directors may be liable”).  As to Combs, he joined the Board in 
2016, making the 2014 Consent Order and DPA of no relevance to him.  
Because the government settlements arose from Madoff-related issues, they are insufficiently 
related to the underlying Epstein-related allegations to be relevant here.  See, e.g., In re MetLife 
Inc. Deriv. Litig., No. CV 2019-0452-SG, 2020 WL 4746635, at *15 (Del. Ch. Aug. 17, 2020) 
(failure to incorporate improved processes from government investigations and a regulatory 
settlement agreement across even “‘analogous’ lines of business” did not support inference of 
directors’ bad faith); Oklahoma Firefighters Pension & Ret. Sys. v. Corbat, No. CV 12151-VCG, 
2017 WL 6452240, at *15 (Del. Ch. Dec. 18, 2017) (the corporate trauma in question “must be 
sufficiently similar to the misconduct implied by the ‘red flags’ such that the board’s bad faith, 
‘conscious inaction’ proximately caused that trauma”) (quoting Melbourne Mun. Firefighters’ 
Pension Tr. Fund on Behalf of Qualcomm, Inc. v. Jacobs, 2016 WL 4076369, at *8 (Del. Ch. Aug. 
1, 2016)); In re Citigroup, Inc. S'holder Deriv. Litig., 964 A.2d 106, 129 (Del. Ch. 2009) (rejecting 
argument that “alleged prior, unrelated wrongdoing would make directors ‘sensitive to similar 
circumstances’”).
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 34     Filed 07/27/23     Page 6 of 15

follows that it is reasonably inferable” that the Board also learned of the purported “failure to 
timely file Epstein-related SARs.”  Opp. 17.  These allegations are not pleaded in the Complaint.  
See Kosovich v. Metro Homes, LLC, No. 09 Civ. 6992 (JSR), 2009 WL 5171737, at *5 n.6 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 2009) (“[I]t is axiomatic that the Complaint cannot be amended by the briefs 
in opposition to a motion to dismiss.”) (quoting O’Brien v. Nat’l Prop. Analysts Partners, 719 F. 
Supp. 222, 229 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)).
Even assuming these new allegations were properly before the Court, they are wildly 
speculative.  The provision of the Consent Order cited by Plaintiffs required an independent 
consultant to conduct a look-back review of “the quality of SARs filed [to] determine whether 
corrections or amendments are necessary to ensure that the suspicious activity identified was 
accurately reported.”  (Ex. 1 [Doc. 31-1], Art. VIII).  Accepting as true Plaintiffs’ assertion that 
JPMorgan “filed zero SARs related to Epstein” (Compl. ¶¶ 183, 26), a review of previous filings 
made to comply with BSA/AML obligations would identify nothing.  And Plaintiffs do not plead 
that the consultants identified any failures related to AML compliance related to Epstein—much 
less that any were elevated to the Board.  Likewise, Plaintiffs cite a Consent Order provision 
requiring review of transaction activity “covering non-bank financial institutions” (id., Art. IX), 
but do not explain how this review would even hypothetically implicate Epstein’s accounts—much 
less that any such review was elevated to the Board.
But even accepting the string of unpleaded hypotheticals positing that the Consent Order 
would have caused information to be elevated to the Board, Plaintiffs’ argument makes no sense.  
The 2014 DPA and Consent Order occurred after the Bank had terminated Epstein as a client in 
2013.  Since Epstein had already been terminated as a client, such hypothetical after-the-fact 
knowledge by the then-current 2014 Board still would not establish a breach of fiduciary duty by 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 34     Filed 07/27/23     Page 7 of 15

Directors for activities relating to Epstein’s accounts that had already been closed.6  And, as 
Plaintiffs do not dispute, JPMorgan enhanced its BSA/AML policies and procedures as part of the 
government settlements, so the then-current Board would have had every reason to believe that 
any compliance weaknesses had been addressed—and Plaintiffs do not allege that the Board 
subsequently learned of any inadequacies in those systems.  
Certainly, Plaintiffs cannot plead that compliance systems were not in place,7 and the 
Bank’s commitment to enhance its BSA/AML procedures would have provided further comfort to 
the Board that appropriate measures were in place as of 2014.8  
Plaintiffs cite Westmoreland Cnty. Emp. Ret. Sys. v. Parkinson, which is inapposite.  727 F.3d 
719 (7th Cir. 2013).  In that case, Plaintiffs alleged that “[d]espite repeated warnings from the FDA 
that [the Company’s] remedial efforts were insufficient—warnings that were directly 
communicated to [the] CEO [] and passed along to the board of directors—the board took no action 
to ensure the company’s timely compliance with the law.”  Id. at 726.  Unlike here, “the complaint 
allege[d] particularized facts (e.g., meeting dates and minutes) indicating that the directors were 
intimately involved in overseeing the remedial effort.”  Id. at 728  The Complaint here contains no 
such allegations—much less any allegations before Epstein’s accounts were terminated.  Plaintiffs 
also quote Jacobs, 2016 WL 4076369 at *12, for the proposition that “when board learns of 
illegality, it has an ‘immediate duty’ to alter the company’s ‘business practices.’”  Opp. 16.  The 
“illegality” referenced actually consisted of pleading guilty to criminal charges including a “felony 
count for willful violation of mandatory safety standards.”  Jacobs, 2016 WL 4076369 at *12.  In 
either case, the Complaint here does not plead that the Board actually learned of any Epstein-
related illegality, much less before the Epstein accounts were terminated, and still took no action 
to alter JPMorgan’s business practices.
The Comptroller’s Findings in the 2013 Consent Order, Ex. 1 [Doc. 31-1], Art. I, and 2014 
Consent Order, Ex. 2 [Doc. 31-2], Art. I, acknowledge the existence of various compliance 
programs, and the mere finding of deficiencies in those programs does not satisfy Zuckerberg.  See 
Firemen's Ret. Sys. of St. Louis ex rel. Marriott Int'l, Inc. v. Sorenson, 2021 WL 4593777, at *16 
(Del. Ch. Oct. 5, 2021) (“Even if the gaps in [the Company’s] data security evidenced the sort of 
compliance failure that could support a viable claim under the second prong of Caremark, the 
Complaint lacks particularized allegations that the Board consciously overlooked or failed to 
address them.”).
Plaintiffs cite the FFIEC Manual to argue that “federal regulations require AML risk oversight 
at the board level” (Opp. 4–5), but the FFIEC Manual, which provides guidance to bank 
examiners, does not suggest customer-specific updates to the Board are required—to the contrary, 
it says that “banks may opt to provide [the board] summaries, tables of SARs filed for specific 
violation types, or other forms of notification.”  Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering 
Examination Manual, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, at 67–68 (2006), 
https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/bsa_aml_examination_manual2006.pdf.

B.
Plaintiffs Fail to Plead That the Remaining Demand Board Directors (Burke, 
Crown, Dimon, and Flynn) Face a Substantial Likelihood of Liability.
While not necessary to reach, Plaintiffs also cannot establish a substantial likelihood of 
personal liability for the Demand Board Directors who served while Epstein was a client (Burke, 
Crown, Dimon, and Flynn).  Plaintiffs concede that Burke, Crown, and Flynn were “ignorant to 
Epstein’s crimes (or even the fact that Epstein was a client).”  Opp. 5.  Plaintiffs instead allege 
lower-level employee knowledge (Opp. 12–13), and muse that “[o]ne would have imagined that 
at least some of that information . . . would have made its way to the Board.”  Id. at 13.  
Such imaginings, however, do not plead a Caremark claim, which requires both director 
knowledge of the misconduct and a conscious failure to act upon that knowledge.  Firemen’s Ret. 
Sys. of St. Louis v. Sorenson, No. CV 2019-0965-LWW, 2021 WL 4593777, at *13 (Del. Ch. Oct. 
5, 2021) (plaintiff must allege directors “knew about ‘red flags’ alerting them to corporate 
misconduct and consciously failed to act after learning about evidence of illegality”) (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  The cases cited by Plaintiff acknowledge that the law requires directors 
to ensure management has implemented procedures to monitor risks, and keep the Board informed 
about risk management.  See Opp. 12, 14.  These cases do not in any way support Plaintiffs’ 
contention that Board knowledge can be inferred from lower-level employees. 
Plaintiffs make the leap that simply because Epstein was a client, the Board must not have 
installed adequate BSA/AML controls.  This is not the law.  Even if a violation of law had occurred 
(which Plaintiffs have not established),9 that would not establish either deficient controls or a 
failure of oversight.  Desimone v. Barrows, 924 A.2d 908, 940 (Del. Ch. 2007) (“Delaware courts 
Plaintiffs do not cite any legal requirement that a bank must exit a client relationship where the 
bank files a SAR relating to that client.  See Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Answers to 
Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Suspicious Activity Reporting and Other Anti-Money 
Laundering Considerations (Jan. 19, 2021) (“There is no BSA regulatory requirement to terminate 
a customer relationship after the filing of a SAR or any number of SARs”), https://www.-
fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/Joint%20SAR%20FAQs%20Final%20508.pdf. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 34     Filed 07/27/23     Page 9 of 15

routinely reject the conclusory allegation that because illegal behavior occurred, internal controls 
must have been deficient, and the board must have known so.”).
The cases cited by Plaintiffs are not contrary.  In Mason-Mahon v. Flint, a case applying 
New York rather than Delaware law, Plaintiffs alleged that the “board had specific information or 
reason to inform itself regarding HSBC Bank’s payments of alleged penalties.”  166 A.D.3d 754, 
758 (2d Dept  2018).  Plaintiffs admit that there is no such allegation here.  Plaintiffs also cite 
Marchand v. Barnhill, but the “tough” Caremark standard was met in Marchand only because “no 
system of board-level compliance monitoring” existed and because the board had received many 
“red flag” reports regarding food safety issues.  212 A.3d 805, 822 (Del. 2019).  As Plaintiffs 
concede, they must “plead an inference that a board has undertaken no efforts to make sure it is 
informed of a compliance issue” in order to meet the “good faith effort that Caremark 
requires.”  Id.10  The Complaint, however, is replete with allegations of a robust and functioning 
BSA/AML compliance program.  See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 18–21, 51, 129–30, 134.  As such, Plaintiffs 
have failed to credibly allege a Caremark claim and therefore have failed to demonstrate a 
substantial likelihood of liability even for those members of the Demand Board who were on the 
Board while Epstein was a client of the Bank.
C.
Plaintiffs Fail to Plead Facts Sufficient to Show That Any Demand Board 
Director “Lacks Independence.”
Plaintiffs’ arguments that Novakovic and Bammann lack independence also fail.
Novakovic.  Although Plaintiffs now concede that the claims against Novakovic should be 
dismissed (Opp. 17 n.7), Plaintiffs argue that Novakovic lacks independence from deceased 
In re Oxford Health Plans, Inc. is similarly unavailing and irrelevant to the conduct alleged in 
the Complaint.  192 F.R.D. 111, 144 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).  There, demand was excused because 
plaintiffs alleged that demand board directors had traded on inside information, purposely misled 
shareholders, and allowed the company to engage in wholesale improper billing practices and 
violate numerous insurance regulations.  Id.
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 34     Filed 07/27/23     Page 10 of 15

director Crown, who purportedly faced a substantial likelihood of liability.11  For the reasons stated 
infra, former director Crown did not face a substantial risk of liability.  Further, Plaintiffs allege 
only that Crown, who was already deceased at the time this allegation was first made, “likely had 
the influence to fire Novakovic.”  Compl. ¶ 195.12  This speculation falls far short of overcoming 
the strong presumption that directors operate independently and faithfully in their fiduciary duties. 
See In re Am. Int’l Grp., Inc. Deriv. Litig., 700 F. Supp. 2d. 419, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), aff’d, 415 
F. App’x 285 (2d Cir. 2011).  Plaintiffs’ reliance on In re Ezcorp Inc. Consulting Agreement Deriv. 
Litig. is unavailing.  2016 WL 301245 (Del. Ch. Jan. 25, 2016).   There, the director whose 
independence was challenged was employed by an entity with common ownership as the company 
whose board was considering the litigation demand.  Id.  at *36.   In addition to common 
ownership, the two entities were partners in a joint venture, and the company had disclosed that 
the director was not independent for the purposes of the NASDAQ listing standards.  Id.  
 Bammann.  As to Non-Defendant Bammann, Plaintiffs claim she suffers a “sense of 
owingness to Dimon.”  Opp. 20.  As an initial matter, for the reasons stated infra and supra, Dimon 
does not face a substantial risk of liability.  Regardless, Plaintiffs’ broad and non-particularized 
allegations of Bammann’s non-independence are belied by the cases cited in Plaintiffs’ own 
brief—neither of which arises in the context of assessing independence for the purposes of demand 
futility.  See, e.g., Off v. Ross, No. 3468–VCP, 2008 WL 5053448, at *11 (Del. Ch. Nov. 26, 2008) 
(non-independent director was the dean of business school to which interested party had donated 
Plaintiffs have not contested Defendants’ argument that former Director Crown is independent 
(Mot. 17–18) and therefore Plaintiffs have conceded his independence.  See Owens on Behalf of 
Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. v. Mayleben, No. CV 12985-VCS, 2020 WL 748023, at *10 n.126 
(Del. Ch. Feb. 13, 2020) (holding that three directors’ independence was established because 
Plaintiff did not challenge these directors’ independence in its answering brief), aff'd sub nom. 
Owens v. Mayleben, 241 A.3d 218 (Del. 2020), as corrected (Nov. 18, 2020). 
Plaintiffs now allege that Novakovic lacks independence from Crown’s estate—but Plaintiffs 
have not sought to substitute the estate as a defendant in this action.
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 34     Filed 07/27/23     Page 11 of 15

$100 million resulting in naming of school after interested party); In re Ply Gem Indus., Inc. 
S’holders Litig., No. CIV. A. 15779-NC, 2001 WL 755133, at *9 (Del. Ch. Oct. 3, 2001) (non-
independent director’s law firm had received $1 million in legal fees), reh’g denied, 2001 WL 
1192206 (Del. Ch. Oct. 3, 2001).  Plaintiffs’ argument that Bammann owes some of her 
professional success to Dimon simply because she worked with him at Bank One Corporation and 
then JPMorgan in the early 2000s (Compl. ¶ 193) dates back 20 years ago and is plainly insufficient 
for a finding that Bammann is presently conflicted.  See Rahbari v. Oros, 732 F. Supp. 2d 367, 
388 n.24 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“[M]ere personal or business relationships will not raise a reasonable 
inference that a director cannot consider demand, absent specific factual allegations to support 
such a conclusion.”); In re NutriSystem, Inc. Deriv. Litig., 666 F. Supp. 2d 501, 515 (E.D. Pa. 
2009) (“[M]erely being employed by a corporation is not, by itself, sufficient to create a reasonable 
doubt as to the independence of a director.”).  Plaintiffs’ assertion that Dimon is a “giant in the 
industry” (Opp. 20) such that that no board member is truly independent is unsupported by law.13
II.
The Complaint Fails to State a Claim Against Any Defendant.
Demand Board Directors.  Plaintiffs admit that their claims against Novakovic and 
Hobson must be dismissed.14  As to the other Demand Board Directors, for the same reasons 
Plaintiffs fail to plead a substantial risk of liability, see supra Section I.B., Plaintiffs also fail to 
state a claim.
Kessler.  Plaintiffs’ one-sentence response (Opp. 22–23) fails to engage with Defendants’ 
Plaintiffs’ citation to In re Tesla Motors, Inc. S’holder Litig., Consol. C.A. No. 12711–VCS, 
2018 WL 1560293 (Del. Ch. Mar. 28, 2018), does not support this proposition.  The court 
acknowledged Musk’s “extraordinary influence within the Company generally,” id. at *16, but 
relied upon specific allegations that Musk had a history of ousting senior management when 
displeased, id. at *15; there was no special committee process for the particular transaction at issue, 
id. at *17; Musk did not recuse himself from and instead led the board’s discussions of the 
transaction, id. at *16; and the fairness opinion process was possibly flawed, id. at *9–10.
Plaintiffs expressly abandoned their claims against Defendants Hobson and Novakovic (Opp. 
n.7), requiring their dismissal.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 34     Filed 07/27/23     Page 12 of 15

showing that Plaintiffs failed to plead a Caremark claim against Kessler (Mot. 19–20), and 
effectively concedes dismissal is required.
Dimon.  Plaintiffs’ discussion concerning Dimon (Opp. at 9–11) is remarkable only for 
what it omits.  Plaintiffs plead Dimon’s purported knowledge of alleged BSA/AML 
noncompliance as the basis for their claim against him (Opp. 9), but the Opposition does not cite 
a single allegation from the Complaint that Dimon was aware of any BSA/AML noncompliance 
with respect to Epstein accounts, because there are none.  The Opposition also fails to address the 
point (Mot. 21) that the Complaint nowhere alleges that Dimon had any role in particular SARs 
filings.  Finally, the Opposition does not address bad faith as to Dimon, much less explain why he 
plausibly would receive and ignore red flags concerning violations of BSA/AML law.  See Horman 
v. Abney, No. CV 12290-VCS, 2017 WL 242571, at *9 (Del. Ch. Jan. 19, 2017) (no oversight 
claim without bad faith). These shortcomings are fatal to the claim against Dimon because 
Caremark requires Plaintiffs to plead that the defendant was responsible for addressing the 
supposed red flags, yet in bad faith did nothing.  See In re McDonald’s Corp. S’holder Deriv. 
Litig., 289 A.3d 343, 350 (Del. Ch. 2023).  The Complaint does not do so.15     
Unable to muster the allegations required to state a Caremark claim against Dimon, the 
Opposition seeks to distract with tenuous, irrelevant assertions that Dimon supposedly interacted 
with or learned something about Epstein.  Id. at 9–11.  These allegations are irrelevant because 
they do not assert instances of BSA/AML noncompliance, much less assert knowledge by Dimon 
of such noncompliance.  The same is true of the Opposition’s reference (at 2, 10) of Staley’s 
Plaintiffs also try to avoid dismissal by imagining that Defendants in their Motion to Dismiss 
prematurely demand “proof” of claims against Dimon.  Opp. 10.  Not so.  Defendants’ Brief is 
carefully cabined to the allegations of the Complaint and does not discuss “proof”; rather, the 
problem is that the Complaint lacks “facts supporting an inference that the fiduciary knew of 
evidence of corporate misconduct,” “consciously failed to take action in response,” and acted in 
bad faith in doing so.  In re McDonald’s Corp. S’holder Deriv. Litig., 289 A.3d at 376.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 34     Filed 07/27/23     Page 13 of 15

alleged conversations with Dimon, which Plaintiffs conspicuously did not plead anywhere in the 
Complaint and, in any event, even the Opposition makes no claim that any such conversation 
concerned any alleged BSA/AML noncompliance, the theory undergirding Plaintiffs’ claim.  
Finally, although it would be insufficient to state a claim, the allegations also do not show that 
Dimon was aware that Epstein was a bad actor or even a client of JPMorgan.16    
Unjust Enrichment Claim.  Plaintiffs do not address or dispute Defendants’ showing that 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege an “enrichment” or “impoverishment,” as required under Delaware 
law to state a claim for unjust enrichment.  See Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. v. Cantor, 724 A.2d 571, 
585 (Del. Ch. 1998); Mot. 24.  This concession requires dismissal.  Plaintiffs also acknowledge 
that their unjust enrichment claim is duplicative of breach of fiduciary duty (Opp. 23), and thus is 
subject to dismissal for the reasons set forth infra at Section II.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons, and those set forth in Defendants’ opening brief, the Court should 
dismiss the Complaint with prejudice.  
Half of the allegations in Plaintiffs’ list merely assert that employees other than Dimon had 
concerns about Epstein and discussed those concerns amongst themselves.  They do not mention 
Dimon at all and cannot possibly support a claim against him.  Opp. 9–11.  One listed allegation 
asserts that the CEO of JPM’s Asset and Wealth Management business knew about Epstein’s 
crimes in 2006 and that this individual reported to Dimon.  Id. at 9.  But this is also inadequate 
because there is no allegation the individual discussed with Dimon what the individual allegedly 
knew, and it is preposterous to posit that Dimon automatically knew everything that any of the 
people reporting to him knew.  Another allegation (addressed Mot. at 21–22) asserts that an 
unidentified employee once wrote an email vaguely referencing a “Dimon review” with respect to 
Mr. Epstein.  But Plaintiffs do not allege that this review even occurred, much less allege what it 
concerned or what Dimon supposedly learned.  Finally, Plaintiffs assert the facially irrelevant 
allegation that Epstein helped Staley schedule meetings intended for Dimon to attend.  Opp. 9–10.  
But the Complaint doesn’t allege that Dimon was aware of Epstein’s involvement, that the 
meetings even happened, or that Epstein was discussed at all at the meetings, much less his 
criminal conduct.

Plaintiffs’ Opposition asserts that it simply does not matter that JPMorgan has already sued 
Defendant Jes Staley on the very same claims, and for the very same acts, that are at issue in this 
derivative action.  Of course it does:  That the bank is already suing Mr. Staley shows that there is 
no need for Plaintiffs to do so on its behalf, nor any reason to excuse Plaintiffs’ failure to petition 
the board before filing suit.  Indeed, as to both demand futility and the rule against claim splitting, 
Plaintiffs’ only response is that they can pursue the bank’s interests better than JPMorgan’s board.  
This is a baseless argument, as there is no legal doctrine that permits shareholders to usurp the 
board’s prerogative, and disregard the rules against duplicative litigation, simply on the basis of 
second-guessing litigation management. 
As to the merits of their individual claims, moreover, Plaintiffs fare no better.  They suggest 
that they can state a Caremark claim against Mr. Staley based on his alleged knowledge of Jeffrey 
Epstein’s sexual misconduct, as though that somehow equates to knowledge of failed oversight 
procedures within JPMorgan.  It does not.  And on the statute of limitations, Plaintiffs rest the 
survival of their claims entirely on the exceedingly narrow doctrine of equitable tolling (which 
they did not plead) under Delaware law (which does not apply here).  Coupled with Plaintiffs’ 
inability to meet their burden to show demand futility, Plaintiffs’ Opposition does nothing to 
forestall dismissal of the two claims against Mr. Staley (Counts II and III).  The Court should 
therefore grant Mr. Staley’s Motion to Dismiss. 
I. 
The Bank’s Existing Lawsuit Against Mr. Staley Quashes this Derivative Suit. 
The shareholder Plaintiffs do not dispute that nominal defendant JPMorgan—on whose 
behalf they purport to act—is already suing Jes Staley on the very same claims and theories that 
they seek to vindicate in this derivative action.  See Third-Party Compls., Doe v. JPMorgan, 1:22-
cv-10019-JSR, ECF No. 59; USVI v. JPMorgan, 1:22-cv-10904-JSR, ECF No. 130. This 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 35     Filed 07/27/23     Page 4 of 12

undisputed fact presents two fatal obstacles to Plaintiffs’ ability to proceed.  Plaintiffs’ Opposition 
does not seriously grapple with, much less rebut, either one. 
The first obstacle is, of course, Plaintiffs’ need to show demand futility.  Having declined 
to petition JPMorgan’s board of directors to bring their contemplated claims against Mr. Staley, 
Plaintiffs must show that doing so would have been a fool’s errand because the board would not 
sue Mr. Staley on its own because of the legal risk to the board members.  But the fact that the 
very same board has already taken exactly that action—seeking to hold Mr. Staley liable for, 
among other things, the full $290 million settlement with the Jane Doe class—is ipso facto fatal to 
Plaintiffs’ theory of futility.  See, e.g., In re Delta & Pine Land Co. S’holders Litig., 2000 WL 
875421, at *6 (Del. Ch. June 21, 2000) (“[T]he existence of a board-initiated action conclusively 
defeats any claim that demand would have been futile.” (internal citation omitted)).1 
Plaintiffs offer no substantive response to this point, and instead merely disparage 
JPMorgan’s third-party actions as “belated and reactive,” suggesting that they were intended solely 
to “deflect blame” from the bank, and thus that the bank might settle them “at a non-maximizing 
price.”  Opp’n at 21-22.  But Plaintiffs cite no authority suggesting that a court should second-
guess board members’ motives even after they decide to pursue the claims that shareholders said 
they would not.  Quite to the contrary, Delaware law suggests the opposite: 
[T]he existence of [a board-initiated suit] conclusively defeats any claim 
that demand would have been futile.  Indeed, there is something to be said 
for the idea that this Court should inquire no further if it finds that the 
corporate directors are litigating the same claims advanced in the derivative 
action. 
The Delta & Pine decision was no outlier.  See, e.g., Silverzweig v. Unocal Corp., 1989 WL 
3231, at *4 (Del. Ch. Jan. 19, 1989), aff’d, 561 A.2d 993 (1989); Meyers v. Keeler, 414 F. Supp. 
935, 939 (W.D. Okla. 1976). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 35     Filed 07/27/23     Page 5 of 12

Silverzweig, 1989 WL 3231, at *4.  Simply put, the demand-futility doctrine is intended to address 
circumstances in which a supposedly conflicted board would refuse to pursue valid claims.  It is 
not intended to allow shareholders to commandeer and micromanage litigation already underway.  
In all events, JPMorgan impleaded Mr. Staley less than four months after it was sued, and there 
can be no doubt that it has vigorously pursued claims against him ever since.2  
The second obstacle arises under the rule against claim splitting, i.e., the principle that a 
plaintiff “must bring in one action all legal theories arising out of the same transaction.”  Am. Stock 
Exch., LLC v. Mopex, Inc., 215 F.R.D. 87, 91 (S.D.N.Y. 2002); accord Curtis v. Citibank, N.A., 
226 F.3d 133, 138-39 (2d Cir. 2000).  This rule applies here because the very nature of a derivative 
action is that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate the claims of someone else—in this case, JPMorgan, 
which is already pursuing the same claims against Mr. Staley in this Court.  See Huck ex rel. Sea 
Air Shuttle Corp. v. Dawson, 106 F.3d 45, 50-51 (3d Cir. 1997) (derivative action precluded by 
prior lawsuit based on similar claims).  
Plaintiffs’ response on this point mirrors their response on demand futility, as they argue 
that the rule against claim-splitting is “discretionary,” and that the Court should decline to apply it 
here because “the Company cannot be trusted to maximize the value of the claims against Staley.”  
Opp’n at 25.  This is a preposterous assertion:  as noted above, no serious observer of the bank’s 
lawsuit against Mr. Staley would describe it as anything less than hard fought on both sides.  
Moreover, the rule against claim-splitting is a well-developed concept, with multiple precedential 
factors to guide judges when applying it.  See Curtis, 226 F.3d at 138-41.  Nowhere among those 
Regarding demand futility more generally, Plaintiffs’ attempts to rewrite their complaint through 
briefing is as ineffective as it is improper.  Mr. Staley refrains from belaboring the dispositive 
arguments of his codefendants and instead adopts and incorporates by reference their Reply Brief.  
See ECF No. 34.   
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 35     Filed 07/27/23     Page 6 of 12

factors is the notion that duplicative litigation should be tolerated simply because the driver of a 
later-filed action questions the bona fides of an earlier one.  This Court should not be the first to 
recognize such a subjective and groundless principle. 
II. 
The Claims Against Mr. Staley Specifically Are Defective. 
Plaintiffs’ claims against Mr. Staley are substantively deficient even if one overlooks the 
claim-killing fact of the preexisting JPMorgan lawsuit.  Plaintiffs’ Opposition attempts to defend 
these claims on the merits, but fails completely. 
Plaintiffs Fail To State a Breach-of-Fiduciary Duty Claim Against Mr. Staley. 
Count II purports to state a Caremark claim, alleging breach of fiduciary duty based on a 
breakdown of operating controls and corporate compliance functions at JPMorgan.  This claim 
cannot proceed against Mr. Staley because the Complaint is devoid of any allegation that Mr. 
Staley—who was never a director, merely an officer—ever had responsibility for the compliance 
and oversight functions where, according to Plaintiffs, JPMorgan fell short.3  This is a fatal 
deficiency because Caremark liability attaches to a corporate officer only when the officer was 
responsible for receiving and addressing the supposed red flags of misconduct.  In re McDonald’s, 
289 A.3d 343, 366 (Del. Ch. 2023) (officer’s duty “to identify red flags, report upward, and address 
them if they fall within the officer’s area of responsibility”). 
Plaintiffs do not dispute Mr. Staley’s point that he had no responsibility for the compliance 
functions.  They instead assert that an exception to the “area of responsibility” principle exists—
and that a Caremark claim can still arise—where the defendant officer has actual knowledge of 
potential corporate wrongdoing, yet fails to act.  Or, as the Plaintiffs put it—quoting from the 
As the Complaint notes, AML and KYC compliance were managed by separate divisions at the 
bank, as was the filing of SARs.  See Compl. ¶¶ 5, 147, 151, 181 (referencing, e.g., “compliance 
department,” “risk management division,” and “Global Corporate Security Division”).  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 35     Filed 07/27/23     Page 7 of 12
A. 

McDonald’s decision—“An officer who receives credible information that the corporation is 
violating the law cannot turn a blind eye and dismiss the issue as ‘not in my area.’”  Opp’n at 23 
(quoting id. at 370). 
The problem with Plaintiffs’ reliance on this principle is that their Complaint is, again, 
devoid of any allegation that Mr. Staley was ever made aware that “the corporation” was “violating 
the law,” as the rule from McDonald’s would require.  289 A.3d 369-70.  Although the Complaint 
is replete with (baseless) allegations that Mr. Staley knew of Jeffrey Epstein’s misdeeds,4 the 
actions of a bank’s client do not equate to actions of the bank, and only the latter will suffice to 
state a “Red-Flags” variant of a Caremark claim.  And there is no allegation that Mr. Staley ever 
knew, for example, of JPMorgan’s alleged failures to submit SARs about Epstein or of any of the 
other purported “red flags” indicating a breakdown in the bank’s back-end compliance functions.  
Indeed, to judge from the Complaint, one could conclude only that Mr. Staley believed that the 
bank was actively addressing Epstein’s suspicious transactions, as the Complaint references 
multiple discussions he supposedly had with the higher-ups at the bank who bore actual 
responsibility for compliance.  E.g., Compl. ¶¶ 25, 135-37, 181.  In other words, regardless of 
whatever Mr. Staley might have known about Epstein’s personal life, Plaintiffs’ Complaint 
presents no basis to infer that he knew that the bank was falling short in its compliance and external 
reporting obligations over Epstein’s accounts. 
Finally, Plaintiffs get no support from their afterthought citation to JPMorgan’s allegation 
that “Staley’s act of disloyalty . . . occurred in his primary area of responsibility.”  Opp’n at 24.  
Plaintiffs’ own Complaint makes no such allegation, and, indeed, their Opposition otherwise 
E.g., Opp’n at 24 (noting allegations (i) that Mr. Staley was “tasked with ‘getting to know’ 
Epstein,” Compl. ¶ 15, and (ii) that another officer was supposed to tell Mr. Staley that the bank 
was “uncomfortable with Epstein,” id. ¶ 18). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 35     Filed 07/27/23     Page 8 of 12

denigrates JPMorgan’s third-party claims as mere overhead cover to deflect blame away from the 
bank.  See Opp’n at 21-22.  But more importantly, an entirely conclusory and generalized 
allegation about Mr. Staley’s purported “area of responsibility,” devoid of specifics and factual 
support, is not a premise for Caremark liability based on compliance failures. 
Plaintiffs Fail To State an Unjust Enrichment Claim Against Mr. Staley.  
Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim against Mr. Staley in Count III fails too.  As noted in 
Mr. Staley’s opening brief, the essence of the claim is breach of fiduciary duty, so it suffers from 
the same faults as Plaintiffs’ Caremark claim against Mr. Staley in Count II.  See Monroe Cnty. 
Emps.’ Ret. Sys. v. Carlson, 2010 WL 2376890, at *2 (Del. Ch. June 7, 2010) (dismissing unjust 
enrichment claim based on deficient fiduciary duty claim).   
The unjust enrichment claim is also independently deficient. Such a claim requires, inter 
alia, (i) an express pleading of “the absence of a remedy provided by law,” Nemec v. Shrader, 991 
A.2d 1120, 1130 (Del. 2010) (en banc), and (ii) some form of alleged “enrichment” beyond the 
defendant’s ordinary employment compensation, see Steinberg v. Dimon, 2014 WL 3512848, at 
*4 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2014).  Here, Plaintiffs’ Complaint pleads neither prerequisite.  Mr. Staley 
pointed out these failings in his opening brief (at 17-18), but Plaintiffs’ Opposition fails to address 
them at all.  The deficiency of Count III is thus conceded.  See AT & T Corp. v. Syniverse Techs., 
Inc., 2014 WL 4412392, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2014) (unaddressed arguments are conceded). 
III. 
The Claims Against Mr. Staley Are Time-Barred. 
Plaintiffs’ argument for the timeliness of their lawsuit rests on narrow grounds.  See Opp’n 
24-25.  Plaintiffs do not dispute, for example, that Mr. Staley left JPMorgan in 2013—more than 
a decade ago—or that the applicable New York limitations periods had long since expired by the 
time they filed suit in May 2023.  Nor do Plaintiffs so much as mention the tolling doctrines of 
fraudulent concealment or inherently unknowable injury.  Id.  Instead, Plaintiffs attempt to salvage 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 35     Filed 07/27/23     Page 9 of 12
B. 

their claim solely through “equitable tolling” under Delaware law—a doctrine that excuses 
untimeliness by a plaintiff who “reasonably relied” on a fiduciary and was otherwise ignorant of 
his claim.  Id. (citing In re Tyson Foods, Inc., 919 A.2d 563, 585 (Del. Ch. 2007)).  According to 
Plaintiffs, this doctrine should apply here, and for support they cite this Court’s denial of the 
motions to dismiss in the Doe and USVI actions.  This argument fails in every respect. 
First, Plaintiffs are simply wrong that Delaware law applies.  In New York, forum law 
governs limitations.  As the Second Circuit has observed: 
Under New York law[,] the statute of limitations is considered procedural 
since it goes to the remedy, and New York will apply its own statute of 
limitations even though the injury which gave rise to the action occurs in 
another state.   
Stafford v. Int’l Harvester Co., 668 F.2d 142, 147 (2d Cir. 1981).  This is true even where Delaware 
law governs the merits under the internal affairs doctrine.  Willensky v. Lederman, 2015 WL 
327843, at *5 n.8 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2015) (“[N]o New York court has held that the internal affairs 
doctrine requires that it apply the statutes of limitations of a defendant corporation’s home state.”) 
(applying New York statute of limitations to shareholder derivative claims).  And because New 
York’s statutes of limitation apply, its law on tolling also applies,5 and New York law notably does 
not recognize the fiduciary-duty-based equitable tolling theory advanced by Plaintiffs.6  
U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n as Tr. to Bank of Am., N.A. v. KeyBank, Nat’l Ass’n, 2023 WL 2745210, 
at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2023) (explaining that New York law governs limitations and also 
“determines the related questions of what events serve to commence an action and to toll the statute 
of limitations”) (quoting Diffley v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 921 F.2d 421, 423 (2d Cir. 1990)). 
New York law’s version of equitable tolling applies only where a plaintiff “establish[es] that 
subsequent and specific actions were taken by defendants, separate from those that provide the 
factual basis for the underlying cause of action, and that these subsequent actions by defendants 
somehow kept plaintiff from timely bringing suit.”  De Sole v. Knoedler Gallery, LLC, 137 F. 
Supp. 3d 387, 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (cleaned up). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 35     Filed 07/27/23     Page 10 of 12

Even if the Court were to apply Delaware tolling law as Plaintiffs urge, their argument 
would still fail.  The background rule in Delaware is that “a claim accrues as soon as the wrongful 
act occurs,” Tilden v. Cunningham, 2018 WL 5307706, at *14 (Del. Ch. Oct. 26, 2018) (citation 
omitted), not “when the harmful effects of the act are felt—even if the plaintiff is unaware of the 
wrong,” In re Coca-Cola Enters., Inc., 2007 WL 3122370, at *5 (Del. Ch. Oct. 17, 2007).  
Although Delaware law recognizes equitable tolling in certain circumstances, a plaintiff seeking 
refuge under that doctrine bears the burden to plead specific facts showing (i) that he delayed filing 
due to the fact that he “reasonably relied upon the competence and good faith of a fiduciary,” and 
(ii) that he was “not on inquiry notice of [his] claims” during the claimed tolling period.  In re 
Tyson Foods, 919 A.2d at 585; In re Dean Witter P’ship Litig., 1998 WL 442456, at *6 (Del. Ch. 
July 17, 1998), aff’d, 725 A.2d 441 (Del. 1999). 
Plaintiffs, however, plead no such facts.  Indeed, the section of their Opposition addressing 
this argument is devoid of even a single citation to the Complaint.  Opp’n at 24-25.  And even if 
Plaintiffs had actually tried to plead an equitable tolling theory under Delaware law in their 
Complaint—which they did not—they certainly could not premise it on a fiduciary relationship 
with Mr. Staley, as any such relationship ended when Mr. Staley left the bank in 2013, well outside 
any potentially applicable limitations period.  Indeed, given that the Miami municipal employees’ 
pension fund did not purchase JPMorgan common stock until December 2016 (Compl. ¶ 30), more 
than three years after Mr. Staley departed, it never had a fiduciary relationship with him, much 
less relied on that relationship.  
Finally, it matters not that the Court declined to dismiss JPMorgan’s claims against Mr. 
Staley in the Doe and USVI actions.  The Court’s bottom-line rulings—based on different 
pleadings and arguments by the parties—do not control here.  While it is true that Mr. Staley’s 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 35     Filed 07/27/23     Page 11 of 12

motions contained statute-of-limitations arguments, Plaintiffs have offered no comparison of their 
complaint to the pleadings and allegations that the Court apparently found adequate in the USVI 
and Doe suits.  Nor did the bank defend untimeliness on equitable-tolling grounds, as Plaintiffs 
rely on here.  And the Court has not yet issued any opinion(s) on the motions to dismiss in those 
cases, so Plaintiffs have no basis to contend that any rationale for the Court’s rulings should also 
apply here. 
CONCLUSION 
For the forgoing reasons, and the reasons set forth in Mr. Staley’s opening brief (ECF No. 
29), the Court should dismiss Counts II and III against Mr. Staley.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.: 
This is a derivative action brought by shareholders of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan”) against various officers and directors of 
JPMorgan. The amended complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary 
duty and unjust enrichment, based upon allegations that the defendants 
caused JPMorgan to retain Jeffrey Epstein as a client of the bank long 
after defendants knew -- or should have known -- that Epstein was 
using the bank’s financial services to facilitate Epstein’s criminal 
sex trafficking and exploitation of women and underaged girls. JPMorgan 
recently entered into two court-approved settlements concerning this

activity --one with a class of Epstein victims and another with the 
Government of the United States Virgin Islands –- in which JPMorgan 
has agreed to pay a total of $365 million. Plaintiffs seek to hold the 
defendants liable for causing this and other harms to the company.  
On July 6, 2023, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint 
in its entirety, arguing both that plaintiffs’ amended complaint fails 
to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) 
and that plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege that they are 
excused from making a pre-suit demand on JPMorgan’s board of directors. 
See Dkt. 24; Dkt. 28. On August 9, 2023, this Court granted defendants’ 
motions by “bottom-line” Order. See Dkt. 39. That Order noted that the 
Court did not reach defendants’ motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) 
because the Court found that the amended complaint failed to adequately 
allege that it would have been futile to make a pre-suit demand on 
JPMorgan’s board. This Opinion sets forth more fully the reasons for 
that ruling.1 
I. 
Legal Standard  
Under Delaware law, applicable here because JPMorgan is a Delaware 
corporation, “the board’s authority to govern corporate affairs 
extends to decisions about what remedial actions a corporation should 
take after being harmed, including whether the corporation should file 
a lawsuit against its directors, its officers, its controller, or an 
outsider.” United Food & Com. Workers Union & Participating Food Indus. 
The Court’s August 9, 2023, Order noted that judgment would not be entered 
until the issuance of this Opinion.  
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 2 of 16

Emps. Tri-State Pension Fund v. Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d 1034, 1047 (Del. 
2021); see also Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 811 (Del. 1984) (“A 
cardinal precept of [Delaware corporations law] is that directors, 
rather than shareholders, manage the business and affairs of the 
corporation.”). “In order for a stockholder to divest the directors 
of their authority to control the litigation asset and bring a 
derivative action on behalf of the corporation, the stockholder must 
(1) make a demand on the company’s board of directors or (2) show that 
demand would be futile.” Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d at 1047 (internal 
quotation omitted). 
The plaintiffs here did not make a demand on the JPMorgan board 
before bringing suit, and so plaintiffs must allege that making a 
litigation demand on JPMorgan’s board would have been futile. To do 
this, a plaintiff must allege that a majority of the members of 
JPMorgan’s board, at the time the complaint was filed, would have been 
unable to disinterestedly consider a litigation demand. A plaintiff 
may show a given director is unable to disinterestedly consider a 
litigation demand in one of three ways: (1) the director “received a 
material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct,” (2) the 
director “would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of 
the claims,” or (3) the director “lacks independence from someone” 
conflicted under (1) or (2). Id. at 1058. Pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 23.1, allegations of demand futility must be pled 
“with particularity.” F5 Cap. v. Pappas, 856 F.3d 61, 82-83 (2d Cir. 
2017) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1(b)(3)). 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 3 of 16

In evaluating whether the director defendants face a substantial 
likelihood of liability on plaintiffs’ claims, it is significant that 
JPMorgan’s corporate charter –- in line with the virtually uniform 
practice of public corporate charters today –- contains a provision 
exculpating directors from liability for breaches of fiduciary duty 
except where they arise from acts taken in bad faith or as a result 
of intentional misconduct. See Soloway Decl. Ex. 2 (Dkt. 26-2), at 4; 
see also Del. Gen. Corp. L. § 102(b)(7) (authorizing such provisions). 
Therefore, to establish a substantial likelihood of liability, it is 
not enough to establish a breach of the duty of care, but rather 
plaintiff must allege “conduct that is not in good faith or a breach 
of the duty of loyalty.” Stone ex rel. AmSouth Bancorporation v. 
Ritter, 911 A.2d 362, 367 (Del. 2006). 
The amended complaint alleges that the director-defendants 
breached the duty of loyalty by failing to adequately oversee the 
affairs of the corporation. Such a theory is often referred to as a 
“Caremark claim” after the seminal Delaware case elaborating the 
theory, and has been described as “possibly the most difficult theory 
in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a 
judgment.” In re Caremark Int'l Inc. Derivative Litig., 698 A.2d 959, 
967 (Del. Ch. 1996). To make out a Caremark claim, a plaintiff must 
establish that either “(a) the directors utterly failed to implement 
any reporting or information system or controls; or (b) having 
implemented such a system or controls, consciously failed to monitor 
or oversee its operations thus disabling themselves from being informed 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 4 of 16

of risks or problems requiring their attention.” Stone, 911 A.2d at 
370. Whether proceeding under either or both of these theories, it is 
necessary that a plaintiff show the directors were acting in bad faith, 
in the sense that the directors actually “knew that they were not 
discharging their fiduciary obligations.” City of Detroit Police & 
Fire Ret. Sys. ex rel. NiSource, Inc. v. Hamrock, 2022 WL 2387653, at 
*11 (Del. Ch. June 30, 2022) (quoting id.).  
II. 
Discussion 
At the time the plaintiffs filed suit, JPMorgan’s board was 
comprised of twelve directors, and so to plead demand futility 
plaintiff must adequately allege that at least six directors were 
conflicted.2 Of the twelve demand directors, only four were even on 
JPMorgan’s board while Epstein was a client of the bank -- JPMorgan 
terminated Epstein as a client in 2013. Am. Compl. ¶ 3. Plaintiffs 
allege that one of these four directors, CEO and board chairman Jamie 
Dimon, was aware of Epstein’s misconduct, and yet failed to take action 
to eliminate Epstein as a client sooner. See Pls. Opp. at 9-11. With 
One of JPMorgan’s directors, James Crown, passed away between when the original 
complaint in this case was filed and when the amended complaint was filed. See 
Suggestion of Death (Dkt. 23) (noting Crown died five days before amended complaint 
was filed). While, as a general matter, demand futility is assessed based on the 
board’s composition at the time the operative complaint is filed, a plaintiff who 
amends its complaint may rely on the board’s composition at the time of a prior 
complaint if the derivative claims asserted in the amended complaint were already 
“validly in litigation.” Braddock v. Zimmerman, 906 A.2d 776, 785-86 (Del. 2006). 
Determining whether a claim is “validly in litigation” requires application of a 
three-part test that generally evaluates the sufficiency of the prior complaint’s 
derivative allegations. See Barenbaum ex rel. FTE Networks, Inc. v. Palleschi, 2020 
WL 5819810, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2020). Both parties fail to cite the relevant 
legal standard or provide any analysis about how this test applies here. Accordingly, 
the Court will assume without deciding that Crown should be included within the 
composition of the relevant demand board because the Court finds plaintiffs’ claims 
fail even if he is. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 5 of 16

respect to the other three directors in this category –- Stephen Burke, 
James Crown, and Timothy Flynn -- plaintiffs allege that they utterly 
failed to implement an effective board-level system of reporting to 
oversee compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering 
laws, and as a result failed to detect the bank’s facilitation of 
Epstein’s misconduct. See Pls. Opp. at 11-16. While defendants 
vigorously dispute whether even these directors face a substantial 
likelihood of liability, the Court need not resolve this question 
because the Court finds that plaintiffs have failed to allege with 
particularity that any of the remaining eight directors are conflicted.  
Of the remaining eight directors, plaintiffs concede that four 
are disinterested and capable of considering a litigation demand. With 
respect to the other four such directors -- Linda Bammann, Todd Combs, 
Michael Neal, and Phebe Novakovic -- plaintiffs make two arguments. 
First, plaintiffs argue that Bammann, Combs and Neal are conflicted 
because they face a substantial likelihood of liability. Second, 
plaintiffs argue that Bammann and Novakovic are conflicted because 
they each lack independence from one or another director who was on 
JPMorgan’s board while Epstein was a client -- Jamie Dimon and James 
Crown, respectively. As explained below, the Court finds neither 
argument plausible. 
A. Substantial Likelihood of Liability of Bammann, Combs and Neal. 
Plaintiffs claim that Bammann, Combs and Neal face a substantial 
likelihood of liability. However, none of these three directors were 
on JPMorgan’s board of directors while Epstein was a client, and so 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 6 of 16

they cannot be accused of failing to eliminate Epstein as a client. 
Rather, as articulated in plaintiffs’ opposition brief, plaintiffs’ 
theory of liability with respect to these directors centers around a 
deferred prosecution agreement (“DPA”) the company entered into with 
the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) in 2014 in connection with 
JPMorgan’s completely unrelated facilitation of Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi 
scheme and a similar, related consent order (“Consent Order”) JPMorgan 
entered into with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(“OCC”). See Pls. Opp. at 16-18. 
Plaintiffs observe that, in the DPA and Consent Order, JPMorgan 
“agreed to (i) implement an exhaustive review of all past [suspicious 
activity report, or “SAR”] filings and ensure that any other 
potentially suspicious activity was identified and reported, (ii) 
review all transactions by non-bank financial institutions, and (iii) 
oversee these reviews, with written findings ‘reported to the Board.’” 
Pls. Opp. at 16-17 (quoting Soloway Decl. Ex. 1 (Dkt. 26-1) Art. VIII, 
IX).  The DPA also required JPMorgan to report any criminal conduct 
or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act to the DOJ. Soloway Decl. Ex. 1 
(Dkt. 26-2) ¶¶ 10, 20.   
Plaintiffs argue that it is “reasonable to infer” that JPMorgan 
management complied with the DPA’s obligations to review past 
transactions and thereby learned of the alleged failures to file SARs 
regarding Epstein. Pls. Opp. at 17. From this, plaintiffs claim that 
“[i]t logically follows that it is reasonably inferable that the post-
DPA Board members . . . learned of JPM’s failure to timely file 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 7 of 16

Epstein-related 
SARs 
and 
of 
Epstein’s 
criminal 
conduct 
more 
generally.” Id. Having supposedly learned this information, plaintiffs 
further argue the aforementioned directors breached their fiduciary 
duties by failing to report Epstein’s misconduct to the DOJ or file a 
belated SAR, thereby breaching the DPA and Consent Order. Id.  
Plaintiffs’ argument is riddled with holes. First, the amended 
complaint’s allegations do not line up with the argument outlined 
above. The amended complaint contains only a single, off-hand reference 
to the DPA and Consent Order and does so to suggest that, more 
generally, the company’s compliance infrastructure was inadequate. See 
Am. Compl. ¶¶ 170-71. The amended complaint contains no discussion of 
the DPA’s or Consent Order’s contents, does not allege that the review 
conducted under the DPA uncovered Epstein-related issues and does not 
allege that any uncovered information about Epstein was passed on to 
the board. Plaintiffs cannot amend their complaint through their 
opposition papers, especially where, as here, plaintiffs were required 
by Rule 23.1 to plead particularized facts to support demand futility.  
Second, even assuming these allegations had been included in the 
complaint, the inferences plaintiffs ask this court to draw from them 
are simply not plausible. It is not at all clear that the review of 
past money laundering filings mandated by the DPA and Consent Order 
uncovered Epstein-related conduct. The Consent Order required that the 
review “be supervised and certified by independent consultant(s) 
acceptable to the Examiner-in-Charge” -- a third-party reviewer 
appointed under the Consent Order -- and the results of the review 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 8 of 16

were to be reported to the Examiner-in-Charge. Mackintosh Decl. Ex. 1 
(Dkt. 31-1) Art. VII, Sec. (2)-(3). Plaintiff asks the Court to 
implausibly infer that both the independent consultant and the 
independent examiner appointed under the Consent Order became aware 
of the Epstein-related conduct and yet were complicit in the company’s 
alleged continued failure to file SARs relating to it.  
Even assuming hypothetically that the review did identify the 
Epstein-related conduct, there is no reason to think that information 
was transmitted to the board. As the amended complaint acknowledges, 
JPMorgan is “one of the world’s largest financial institutions.” Am. 
Compl. ¶ 2. While the DPA did require the written findings of the 
review be reported to the board, it does not follow the board would 
have received information about every single client who was the subject 
of concerns. Indeed, if anything, the amended complaint seems to 
contradict any inference that the board was made aware, alleging “there 
is no evidence that JPM’s board of directors . . . ever discussed 
Epstein prior to his death by apparent suicide in 2019.” Am. Compl. 
¶ 3. Thus, the Court cannot reasonably infer that these three board 
members were made aware of the company’s alleged failure to file 
Epstein-related SARs.3 
The absence of any allegation of actual evidence of the board’s knowledge 
defeats any claim under the second prong of Caremark, which requires proof “the 
board knew of evidence of corporate misconduct -- the proverbial ‘red flag’ -- yet 
acted in bad faith by consciously disregarding its duty to address that misconduct.” 
Teamsters Loc. 443 Health Servs. & Ins. Plan v. Chou, 2020 WL 5028065, at *17 (Del. 
Ch. Aug. 24, 2020) (quotation omitted). To the extent plaintiffs’ claim these 
directors are liable pursuant to the first prong of Caremark, requiring allegations 
of “an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting 
system exists,” the very existence of the Consent Order and DPA would defeat such a 
claim, because both agreements expressly required a reporting system be established. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 9 of 16

Third, even setting aside these factual deficiencies, plaintiffs 
have failed to explain how the purported breach of fiduciary duty –- 
permitting a violation of the DPA/Consent Order and failure to correct 
previously-deficient SAR filings regarding Epstein -- actually caused 
the company any harm. To reiterate, these directors cannot be accused 
of failing to terminate Epstein as a client, because the company had 
already done so by the time they joined the board. And plaintiffs do 
not allege that JPMorgan was ever penalized by the DOJ or OCC for 
violating the DPA or Consent Order (or even that either government 
agency found a violation), so even assuming a violation of those 
agreements occurred in the abstract, it is not clear how that would 
support liability for the Epstein-related conduct. Nor do plaintiffs 
explain why failure to correct previously deficient SAR filings between 
2014 and 2016 -- after Epstein was no longer a client -- caused the 
company any harm. In short, plaintiffs have failed to allege -- let 
alone allege with particularity –- facts giving rise to a reasonable 
inference that Bammann, Combs and Neal face a substantial likelihood 
of liability.4 
Hamrock, 2022 WL 2387653, at *12 (quotation omitted) (noting that a plaintiff that 
attempts to allege a Caremark claim under both prongs typically loses under prong 
one “because the plaintiff must concede the existence of a board-level monitoring 
system to plead under prong two”). 
The absence of any allegation that that JPMorgan was penalized for violating 
the DPA or Consent Order distinguishes this case from the two authorities cited by 
plaintiffs, both of which involved situations where a company entered into a consent 
decree requiring board-level reporting, violated that consent decree, and then were 
later penalized for those violations. See Westmoreland Cnty. Emp. Ret. Sys. v. 
Parkinson, 727 F.3d 719, 727 (7th Cir. 2013); In re Pfizer Inc. S'holder Derivative 
Litig., 722 F. Supp. 2d 453, 461-62 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). The absence of particularized 
factual allegations here is, of course, another distinguishing factor. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 10 of 16

B. Independence of Novakovic & Bammann 
The amended complaint offers one final route to establish demand 
futility. It claims that Novakovic and Bammann lack independence from 
directors facing a substantial likelihood of liability because they 
were on the board while Epstein was a client of the bank. If plaintiffs 
are correct that both of these directors lack independence, then demand 
would be excused (again assuming arguendo that the four directors on 
the board while Epstein was a client face a substantial likelihood of 
liability). But as explained below, the Court finds plaintiffs have 
failed to allege either Novakovic or Bammann lack independence such 
that they are incapable of disinterestedly considering a litigation 
demand.  
In evaluating demand futility, “directors are presumed to be 
independent.” Teamsters Union 25 Health Servs. & Ins. Plan v. Baiera, 
119 A.3d 44, 59 (Del. Ch. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
To 
overcome 
this 
presumption, 
plaintiffs 
must 
allege 
with 
particularity “facts from which the director’s ability to act 
impartially on a matter important to the interested party can be 
doubted because that director may feel either subject to the interested 
party’s dominion or beholden to that interested party.” F5 Cap. v. 
Pappas, 856 F.3d 61, 84 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Sandys v. Pincus, 152 
A.3d 124, 128 (Del. 2016)). In making this determination, the Court 
may not view each of the amended complaint’s allegations in isolation 
but must instead consider them wholistically. See id. at 83. 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 11 of 16

Bammann. Plaintiffs argue Bammann is not disinterested because 
she has extensive professional ties to Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan 
and Chairman of its board. From 2001 to 2004 Bammann was an executive 
at another company called Bank One while Dimon was the CEO of Bank 
One. Am. Compl. ¶ 193. And then, after Bank One was acquired by 
JPMorgan, Bammann served as JPMorgan’s deputy head of risk management 
while Dimon was President and COO of JPMorgan. Id. Finally, plaintiffs 
allege Bammann joined the JPMorgan board while Dimon was CEO and 
chairman of JPMorgan in 2013, and that since then Bammann’s only source 
of income has been her role on the board. Id.  
The mere fact that Bammann and Dimon worked together at One Bank 
and JPMorgan does not give rise to an inference that Bammann is 
disabled from considering a litigation demand against Dimon. See, 
e.g., F5 Cap., 856 F.3d at 85 (noting that a “mere personal friendship 
or outside business relationship does not raise a reasonable doubt 
about a director's independence” and concluding allegations that 
directors served on several other boards together and had “substantial 
business entanglements” did not call into question director’s 
independence (internal quotation marks omitted)); Orman v. Cullman, 
794 A.2d 5, 27 (Del. Ch. 2002) (“[A]llegations concerning longstanding 
business relations fail as a matter of law to place in issue the 
independence of directors . . . .”).  
Nor is the bare allegation that Bammann joined the board while 
Dimon was CEO and Chairman sufficient to rebut the presumption of 
independence. Delaware courts have repeatedly found that even where a 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 12 of 16

director is appointed at the behest of a company’s controlling 
shareholder –- a far more extreme scenario than that presented here -
- the fact of a director’s appointment alone does not rebut the 
presumption of independence, since that is simply how the normal 
process of nominating directors operates in such instances. See 
McElrath v. Kalanick, 224 A.3d 982, 995 (Del. 2020) (“Importantly, 
being nominated or elected by a director who controls the outcome is 
insufficient by itself to reasonably doubt a director's independence 
because that is the usual way a person becomes a corporate director.” 
(internal quotation marks omitted); Baiera, 119 A.3d at 60-61 (same). 
The fact that Bammann’s sole employment since 2013 as been her service 
on JPMorgan’s board does not alter this conclusion, given that 
plaintiffs have not explained why this compensation would be imperiled 
were she to consider a litigation demand or alleged that the amount 
she is paid is particularly significant to her overall financial 
prosperity. See Simons v. Brookfield Asset Mgmt. Inc., 2022 WL 223464, 
at *15 (Del. Ch. Jan. 21, 2022) (“[M]ere allegations of payment of 
director fees are insufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to the 
director's independence.”); Halpert Enter., Inc. v. Harrison, 362 F. 
Supp. 2d 426, 433 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (“The allegations that the Board 
members receive various fees from [the company] are similarly 
unavailing, because there are no particularized allegations indicating 
that that compensation is excessive.”).  
Plaintiffs argue that the relationship between Bammann and Dimon 
goes beyond a normal professional relationship because Bammann “owes 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 13 of 16

a significant portion of her professional success to Dimon.” Pls. Opp. 
at 19. But the amended complaint’s allegations do not support this 
claim. Nowhere does the amended complaint actually allege, let alone 
offer particularized factual allegations, how Bammann’s professional 
advancement was the result of Dimon’s influence. Rather, plaintiffs’ 
argument is based solely on the circumstantial inference that, because 
Bammann and Dimon had overlapping upward trajectories at One Bank and 
JPMorgan, Dimon must have been the cause. But these allegations at 
most establish that it is conceivable Dimon played a role in Bammann’s 
advancement, and pleading conceivability alone is insufficient even 
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)’s more permissive pleading 
standard. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) 
(complaint 
must 
allege 
sufficient 
factual 
matter 
to 
“nudged 
[plaintiffs’] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible”).  
The inference that Bammann owes some professional debt to Dimon 
is further undermined by the fact that their time serving together as 
managers occurred over a decade ago. While plaintiff responds that 
“past benefits conferred . . . may establish an obligation or debt,” 
Pls. Opp. at 20, the age of any such obligation remains relevant. 
Absent more particularized allegations about the nature of the debt 
of gratitude Bammann supposedly owes to Dimon, the Court is unable to 
reasonably infer that such a debt was so substantial as to imperil 
Bammann’s independence so many years later. In short, even when taken 
as a whole, plaintiffs’ threadbare allegations are insufficient to 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 14 of 16

give rise to a reasonable inference that Bammann lacks independence 
from Dimon. 
Novakovic. Plaintiffs argue Novakovic lacks independence from 
Crown, who was among the directors on the board at the time Epstein 
was a client. Novakovic is the CEO and Chairman of another company, 
General Dynamics, which the amended complaint describes as “affiliated 
with the Crown family,” and as a “Crown[] family business.” Am. Compl. 
¶¶ 36, 195. The amended complaint also alleges Novakovic served on the 
General Dynamics board with Crown. Id. ¶ 33. Plaintiffs claim that, 
as a result of the Crown-family’s control of General Dynamics, 
Novakovic is beholden to Crown and therefore could not disinterestedly 
consider a litigation demand against him. See Pls. Opp. at 19. 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Crown’s and Novakovic’s 
ties to General Dynamics rise beyond the general business relationships 
that are otherwise insufficient to establish a lack of independence. 
See supra. While plaintiffs claim that, because General Dynamics is 
“Crown’s family business,” Crown “likely had the influence to fire 
Novakovic” from her position as General Dynamics CEO, Am. Compl. ¶ 194, 
plaintiffs offer no particularized allegations to support this 
contention that Crown had the unilateral power to fire Novakovic or 
that Crown exercised significant influence over the direction of the 
company. See Flannery v. Genomic Health, Inc., 2021 WL 3615540, at *15 
(Del. Ch. Aug. 16, 2021) (concluding allegation director had 
“significant investments” in employer of director was insufficient 
where complaint failed to allege whether those investments gave the 
Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 15 of 16

Case 1:23-cv-03903-JSR     Document 42     Filed 01/12/24     Page 16 of 16
"u;nilateral power" to control the directors compensation) . General 
Dynamics is not a privately held family business but a publicly traded 
Fortune 100 company, and it is simply not plausible, based on the 
conclusory allegations in the amended complaint, to conclude Crown had 
sufficient power over Novakovic's employment at General Dynamics so 
as to render Novakovic not disinterested. 5

For the reasons set forth above, the Court grants the motions to 
dismiss. Because the plaintiffs have already amended their complaint 
and because, even based on the additional allegations referenced in 
their reply papers, the complaint would still have to be dismissed, 
the dismissal is with prejudice. 
Accordingly, 
the Court 
hereby 
dismisses the case with prejudice. The Clerk of the Court is directed 
to enter final judgment forthwith and close the case. 
SO ORDERED.

January __Q,_, 2024 
~~-S.D.J. 
Indeed, the absence of any particularized allegations of control of General 
Dynamics by the Crown is likely because they would be counterfactual. According to 
General Dynamic's 2023 proxy statement, as of March 2023 Crown directly owned 
under .5% of the Company's shares and was potentially the indirect beneficial 
owner of slightly over 5% of shares. See General Dynamics Proxy Statement, at 88-
(Mar. 24, 2023), available at https://dl8rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-
0000040533/8a5193el-4ca4-4d33-b67d-dabbl58e8ed9.pdf. No other Crown family member 
is listed as controlling over 5% of the company's stock.

Rev. 5/23/14 
Ruby J. Krajick 
Clerk of Court 
Dear Litigant: 
Enclosed is a copy of the judgment entered in your case. If you disagree with a judgment or 
final order of the district court, you may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit. To start this process, file a “Notice of Appeal” with this Court’s Pro Se 
Intake Unit.  
You must file your notice of appeal in this Court within 30 days after the judgment or order 
that you wish to appeal is entered on the Court’s docket, or, if the United States or its officer 
or agency is a party, within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order. If you are unable 
to file your notice of appeal within the required time, you may make a motion for extension 
of time, but you must do so within 60 days from the date of entry of the judgment, or 
within 90 days if the United States or its officer or agency is a party, and you must show 
excusable neglect or good cause for your inability to file the notice of appeal by the 
deadline. 
Please note that the notice of appeal is a one-page document containing your name, a 
description of the final order or judgment (or part thereof) being appealed, and the name of 
the court to which the appeal is taken (the Second Circuit) – it does not include your reasons 
or grounds for the appeal. Once your appeal is processed by the district court, your notice 
of appeal will be sent to the Court of Appeals and a Court of Appeals docket number will 
be assigned to your case. At that point, all further questions regarding your appeal must be 
directed to that court. 
The filing fee for a notice of appeal is $605 payable in cash, by bank check, certified check, 
or money order, to “Clerk of Court, S.D.N.Y.” No personal checks are accepted.  Please see 
District Court fee schedule at https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/programs/fees. If you are 
unable to pay the $605 filing fee, complete the “Motion to Proceed in Forma Pauperis on 
Appeal” form and submit it with your notice of appeal to the Pro Se Intake Unit. If the 
district court denies your motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, or has certified 
under 28 U.S.C. ' 1915(a)(3) that an appeal would not be taken in good faith, you may file a 
motion in the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, but you must do so 
within 30 days after service of the district court order that stated that you could not 
proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. 
For additional issues regarding the time for filing a notice of appeal, see Federal Rule of 
Appellate Procedure 4(a). There are many other steps to beginning and proceeding with 
your appeal, but they are governed by the rules of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and 
the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. For more information, visit the Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals website at http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/.
