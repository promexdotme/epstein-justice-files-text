ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

(Rossmiller, Alex) (Entered: 07/07/2020)

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
Case 21-58, Document 1-2, 01/12/2021, 3011673, Page5 of 19

advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

Maxwell. (Pagliuca, Jeffrey) (Entered: 07/21/2020)

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
Case 21-58, Document 1-2, 01/12/2021, 3011673, Page9 of 19

this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

12/08/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three−part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.

redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are

thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the

And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v– 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release 
on bail.  Dkt No. 97.  In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court 
DENIES the Defendant’s motion. 
In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that 
should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose 
any redactions to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by reference to 
the Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 
2006). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, 
the Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.   
This Order provides the bottom line of the Court’s resolution.  On July 14, 2020, this 
Court conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial detention was warranted 
because the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s 
appearance at future proceedings.  Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if 
the Court finds “that information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the 
hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that 
will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.”  The Court concludes that

D:._ -----

none of the new information that the Defendant presented in support of her application has a 
material bearing on the Court’s determination that she poses a flight risk.   
Furthermore, for substantially the same reasons as the Court determined that detention 
was warranted in the initial bail hearing, the Court again concludes that no conditions of release 
can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.  In reaching that 
conclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight 
of the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the 
nature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose.  See 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(g).  The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the 
community.  Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention 
under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).  The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions 
would not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.   
As a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion 
that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial detention continues to be warranted. 
On or before December 30, 2020, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter 
indicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal. 
This resolves Dkt No. 97.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
Case 21-58, Document 3-2, 01/12/2021, 3011691, Page6 of 20

advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

Maxwell. (Pagliuca, Jeffrey) (Entered: 07/21/2020)

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
Case 21-58, Document 3-2, 01/12/2021, 3011691, Page10 of 20

this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 60 Letter filed by USA as
to Ghislaine Maxwell re: The Government respectfully requests that the Court approve
the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,

LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

12/08/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The

And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine

Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 3-2, 01/12/2021, 3011691, Page18 of 20

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to

transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page5 of 24

capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page9 of 24

statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

order directing the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") to release the Defendant into the general
population and to provide her with increased access to the discovery materials. For the
reasons that follow, Defendant's requests are DENIED without prejudice....[See this
Memorandum Opinion And Order]... III. Conclusion: For the reasons stated above,
Defendant's requests contained in Dkt. No. 38 are DENIED without prejudice.
Following the close of discovery, the parties shall meet and confer on an appropriate
schedule for pre−trial disclosures, including the disclosure of § 3500 material, exhibit
lists, and witness lists, taking into account all relevant factors. The Government is
hereby ORDERED to submit written status updates every 90 days detailing any
material changes to the conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular
emphasis on her access to legal materials and ability to communicate with defense
counsel. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 8/25/2020) (bw)

the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

12/08/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three−part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in

States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed
redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are
"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'
thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the
Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).
And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page16 of 24

those materials. The Defendant did not file any opposition to the Government's
proposed redactions. The Court will adopt the Government's proposed redactions after
applying the three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i)
determine whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the
weight of the common law presumption access to the materials; and (iii) balance
competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such
countervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law
enforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting
disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo II"), 71 F.3d
1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995)). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds
that the Governments submissions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial
function and useful in the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial
document" for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v.
Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And the Court also finds that
the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at 146; see also Nixon v. Warner
Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978). Nevertheless, the proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third
parties' personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460
467 (S.D.N.Y.2017). The Government is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits by no later than December 18, 2 (Signed by

12/23/2020
101 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 18, 2020, the Defendant filed her
reply to the Government's opposition to her renewed application for bail. In
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89, she filed these
materials under seal and proposed narrowly tailored redactions on those materials. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three−part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d
110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the
documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common
law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations
against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing factors include
but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency'
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United
States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo II"), 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995)). The proposed
redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are
"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,"
thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the
Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).
And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978). As with the
redactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrowly
tailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties
personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 467
(S.D.N.Y. 2017). See also Dkt. No. 95. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket
the redacted documents and corresponding exhibits by no later than December 23,
2020. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/23/2020) (lnl)

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and
Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page17 of 24

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)

24, 2021. If they conclude that redactions are unnecessary, the Defendant is
ORDERED to docket the unredacted version of the brief by March 24, 2021. (Signed

THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
Case 21-58, Document 21-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page6 of 25

capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
Case 21-58, Document 21-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page10 of 25

statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 60 Letter filed by USA as
to Ghislaine Maxwell re: The Government respectfully requests that the Court approve
the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see

LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of

corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted

tailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties
personal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 467

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and
Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 21-2, 03/24/2021, 3065978, Page18 of 25

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

03/18/2021
168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)

171 REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 160
THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in−court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
Case 21-58, Document 23, 03/29/2021, 3065988, Page5 of 24

capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co−counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial−in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID−19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20−MC−174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855−268−7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214−416−0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial−in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non−speaking co−counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial−in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID−19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in−house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID−19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in−person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of

Maxwell. (Pagliuca, Jeffrey) (Entered: 07/21/2020)

ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be

(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
07/30/2020
MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on
the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any
purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the following reasons, the
Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,
restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." The good
cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the
imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's
interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause
with regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged
victims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. As a general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific
interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
that as a baseline the protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see
also United States v. Corley, No. 13−cr−48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished
for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all
accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a
criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a
public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a
Case 21-58, Document 23, 03/29/2021, 3065988, Page9 of 24

statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33−1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case−by−case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high−profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 60 Letter filed by USA as
to Ghislaine Maxwell re: The Government respectfully requests that the Court approve
the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials...ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see
Dkt. No. 36. (Government Responses due by 3/12/2021) (Signed by Judge Alison J.

LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, and Lara Pomerantz dated December 2, 2020
re: Defense Requests for Sealing Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene)
(Entered: 12/02/2020)
12/03/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request seeking an in camera conference for the
presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the
November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the
sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no
longer fully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and
instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three−part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)

12/08/2020
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all

Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The

And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

104 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine

Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's
Case 21-58, Document 23, 03/29/2021, 3065988, Page17 of 24

motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.

106 OPINION AND ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has
been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a minor to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423
and 2; and two charges of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a
lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the
hearing, the Court concluded that the Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no
conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her appearance. Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwells renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is DENIED.

168 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15−cv−7433, Dkt. No. 1212−1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge

THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)
03/24/2021
172 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20−CR−110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:

Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Motion for Pretrial Release 
Ghislaine Maxwell has a Constitutional right to be able to prepare 
effectively for trial.  The conditions of her pretrial detention deprive her 
of that right.  For over 280 days, she has been held in the equivalent of 
solitary confinement, in deteriorating health and mental condition from 
lack of sleep because she is intentionally awakened every 15 minutes by 
lights shined directly into her small cell, inadequate food, the constant 
glare of neon light, and intrusive searches, including having hands 
forced into her mouth in a squalid facility where COVID has run 
rampant. The medical literature is unanimous that such conditions 
produce mental deterioration, which prevents her from effective 
participation in trial preparation.   
Worse, even if Ms. Maxwell were able to be fully alert and 
mentally acute, she must review over 2,500,000 prosecution pages on a 
gutted computer, which does not have the ability to search, edit, or 
print.  Because of the pandemic, in-person lawyer visits are risky, so 
Ms. Maxwell sees her trial lawyers over a video screen, where she can 
review one page of the discovery at a time that is projected on a wall 
three feet away. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page3 of 31

These conditions would support a complaint for cruel and unusual 
punishment for a convicted felon.  Ms. Maxwell is not one.  She is 
innocent unless and until she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable 
doubt – an event which is highly unlikely given the lack of evidence 
against her.   
Despite the district court’s exhortations regarding the strength of 
the evidence against Ms. Maxwell, the truth is that the government’s 
so-called “evidence,” though voluminous, is palpably weak.  It consists 
of anonymous, untested hearsay accusations about events that are 
alleged to have occurred decades ago, accusations which only surfaced 
when the government faced public outrage over the inexplicable death 
of Jeffrey Epstein, while in their custody.  
The “Epstein Effect” clouded the judgment of the prosecutors into 
charging Ms. Maxwell because it needed a scapegoat, the Bureau of 
Prisons into putting Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch because Epstein died 
on their watch, the media into an absolute frenzy, and many other fair-
minded people into viewing Ms. Maxwell as guilty even though no 
evidence has been presented against her. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page4 of 31

Notwithstanding the cries of the mob, Ms. Maxwell is presumed 
innocent and is entitled to defend herself. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell 
moves this Court for her immediate release. Fed. R. App. P. 9; 18 U.S.C. 
§§3142 and 3145.

ISSUES PRESENTED 
1. Whether Ms. Maxwell can effectively prepare her defense where she 
is being subjected to horrific conditions of detention during a global 
pandemic, including:  
• not being able to regularly see her lawyers in person to prepare 
for trial; 
• being kept awake all night to make sure she does not commit 
suicide even though nothing suggests she is a suicide risk; 
• having her every movement videotaped on multiple cameras 
focused on her every move;  
• being stuck in de facto solitary confinement without safe, in 
person visitation;  
• being forced to review millions of pages of documents on a 
stripped down computer without adequate hardware or 
software such that Ms. Maxwell cannot open tens of thousands 
of pages of discovery and for those she can open, only has the 
ability to review them one page at a time and cannot search, 
edit, copy, or print; 
• having no writing surface in her solitary cell; and  
• not consistently provided edible food or drinkable water. 
2. Whether the trial court erred by relying on the government’s proffer 
— which was comprised of nothing but extremely old, anonymous, 
unconfronted, hearsay accusations — to refuse to set reasonable bail. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page6 of 31

FACTS 
Ghislaine Maxwell is a 59-year-old, law-abiding United States 
citizen with no criminal history.  In July 2020, she was living peacefully 
in her New Hampshire home and was in contact, through her attorneys, 
with the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District New York, 
which had opened an investigation into her only after the death of 
Jeffrey Epstein.  Instead of asking her to surrender, that office had her 
arrested by a SWAT team and other unnecessary but intentionally 
showy tactics. That same day, the acting U.S. Attorney held a press 
conference with large charts, pausing for pictures for the media,1 before 
Ms. Maxwell had even appeared in the Southern District of New York. 
Since her arrest, Ms. Maxwell has faced nightmarish conditions. 
See, e.g., Ex.M. Though she is a model prisoner who poses no danger to 
society and has done literally nothing to prompt “special” treatment, 
she is kept in isolation – conditions fitting for Hannibal Lecter but not a 
59-year old woman who poses no threat to anyone. She is subjected to 
multiple invasive searches every day. Her every movement is captured 
on multiple video cameras. She is deprived of any real sleep by having a 
The press conference is available online at https://tinyurl.com/bku2av7t

flashlight pointed into her cell every 15 minutes. For months, her food 
was microwaved with a plastic covering, which rendered it inedible 
after the plastic melted into the food.2 The water is often cloudy and is 
not drinkable.  Because of the pandemic, it is not safe to meet with her 
lawyers in person, so she cannot adequately prepare for trial. She is on 
suicide watch for no reason. She continues to lose weight, her hair, and 
her ability to concentrate. 
It is obvious that the BOP is subjecting Ms. Maxwell to this 
behavior because of the death of Epstein (and subsequent fallout).  But 
how is this permissible?  Since when are the conditions for one inmate 
dictated by the fate of another?  Perhaps never in the history of the U.S. 
Justice System has the public relations imperatives of the government 
permitted such wildly inappropriate and unconstitutional treatment of 
an innocent human being. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to 
participate effectively in the preparation of her defense under these 
conditions. 
The charges related to three of the anonymous accusers in the 
operative indictment are 25 years old, alleging actions from 1994-1997, 
The prison has now promised to heat the food properly. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page8 of 31

while the just added accuser involves allegations from 2001-04.3 That 
the indictment exists at all is a function – solely – of the untimely death 
of Jeffrey Epstein and the media frenzy that followed. The indictment 
against Ms. Maxwell was brought only in the search for a scapegoat 
after the same U.S. Attorney’s Office had to dismiss its case against 
Epstein because of his death at MCC.  If there truly was any case 
against Ms. Maxwell, she would have been charged with Epstein in the 
SDNY in 2019.  But she was not. She also was not charged – or even 
named – in the 2008 Epstein case in Florida.  She would never be facing 
charges now if Epstein were alive. 
Although there have been a number of orders related to bond in 
this case, the district court held only one detention hearing.  At that 
hearing the government stated that Ms. Maxwell was a flight risk and 
that its case was strong.  But it did not proffer any actual evidence in 
support of its contention, or the district court’s conclusion, that the 
weight of the evidence against Maxwell was strong. Ex.A. Instead, it 
pointed again and again only to the fact that the grand jury returned an 
The government superceded the indictment on March 29, just months 
before the July trial, adding two counts involving a fourth anonymous 
accuser. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page9 of 31

indictment (which is, of course, true in every criminal case) and to the 
nature of the charges in the abstract. The district court bought into the 
government’s conclusory allegations, stating without support that: 
“[M]indful of the presumption of innocence, the Court remains of the 
view that in light of the proffered strength and nature of the 
Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention.” 
(emphasis added).   
The court fundamentally erred in relying on the government’s 
empty assertions that its case is strong.  There was no principled way 
for the court to reach such a conclusion without hearing any evidence 
and without knowing anything at all about the allegations, especially 
here where the case is so old and based on anonymous hearsay which 
the defense has never been able to confront.  The government did not 
even proffer that these anonymous accusers even made their claims 
under oath. Prosecutors refuse to disclose their names, their 
statements, the specifics of their allegations, or anything about them.   
This case is anything but strong.  Ms. Maxwell should be granted 
bail or, at the very least, the case should be remanded for an 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page10 of 31

evidentiary hearing to test whether the government’s case even 
marginally supports detention. 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. The arrest and bail applications 
Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 2020 and since that 
date has been detained in jaw-droppingly appalling conditions. The 
government claims that Ms. Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein’s “associate” 
and helped him “groom” minors for sex back in the 1990s and early 
2000s. Doc. 187. The indictment does not name these accusers and the 
government has refused to disclose their names or the specific dates 
that Ms. Maxwell supposedly did anything criminal.  
After her arrest, the government moved for detention.  Ex.A.  The 
defense responded.  Ex.B.  And the government replied.  Ex.C.  The trial 
judge held the arraignment and bond hearing over Zoom. Ex.D.  The 
government did not call any of the accusers in the indictment or present 
any witnesses related to flight, danger, or the strength of its case.  The 
government conceded that it was not asking for detention based on 
danger to the community.  The court ordered Ms. Maxwell detained at 
the conclusion of the hearing.  Ex.D.  
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page11 of 31

The court said it was detaining Ms. Maxwell, in part, because the 
government proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated 
by significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” Ex.D at 82.  
The court also pointed to Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” 
in the United States, her unclear financial picture, the “circumstances 
of her arrest,” and that although she is a U.S. citizen, she is also a 
citizen of France and Britain.  Id. at 82-87. 
Ms. Maxwell filed a second motion for bail and addressed each of 
these concerns. Ex.E. For starters, the defense explained that none of 
anonymous accusers’ testimony of abuse was corroborated and that it 
all related to Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell. In addition, Ms. Maxwell does 
have significant ties to the United States, her assets were thoroughly 
disclosed and vetted, and she is willing to waive extradition. The 
government responded. Ex.F. The defense replied.  Ex.G.  The judge 
again denied bail, relying, for the second time, on the “strong” evidence, 
even though no evidence was presented to the court to rely on.4 
Ms. Maxwell filed a third motion for bail.  Ex.I. In this application, 
she offered to renounce her foreign citizenship and also to have her 
Ms. Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from this Order, which is 
docketed in Case No. 21-58.   
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page12 of 31

assets controlled and monitored by a former federal judge and former 
U.S. Attorney.  She also cited the 12 pretrial motions she filed.  
“Without prejudicing the merits of any of those pending motions,” the 
judge again denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion for bail, relying in part on the 
“proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,” even though, 
again, no evidence was actually submitted to or reviewed by the trial 
court. This appeal follows. 
In each of her bail requests and in separate pleadings, Ms. 
Maxwell has documented the Kafkaesque conditions that she is forced 
to endure.  See, e.g., Ex.M.   
B. The pretrial motions 
Ms. Maxwell filed 12 substantial pretrial motions. Docs. 119-26; 
133-48.   These include motions to dismiss for violation of the statute of 
limitations (Docs. 143-44) and for pre-indictment delay (Docs. 137-38) 
because the conduct is so old. And to dismiss because the government 
violated the non-prosecution agreement it reached with Epstein that 
protected any alleged co-conspirator from prosecution. Docs 141-42. The 
government needed 212 pages to respond to these motions.  These 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page13 of 31

motions are pending and raise significant legal bars to the prosecution 
of this matter. 
C. The proposed bail package 
Ghislaine Maxwell has proposed a significant, compelling, and 
unprecedented bail package, which gives up or puts at risk everything 
that she has – her British and French citizenship, all of her and her 
spouse’s assets ($22.5 million),5 her family’s livelihood, and the 
financial security of her closest friends and family (totaling $5 million). 
A security company, which will monitor and secure Ms. Maxwell at her 
home, will also post an unprecedented $1 million bond.  Ex.E, I.  
Ms. Maxwell looks forward to confronting the accusers and 
clearing her name. She has no intention of fleeing and will be unable to 
do so if released on bond.  This bail package demonstrates these facts in 
a real way, unlike the government’s claims that the evidence against 
her is strong.  Even though a guarantee of appearance is not necessary, 
the bail package in this case is as close to a guarantee as one can get.  
There is no legally permissible basis to deny bail. 
Her spouse would retain $400,000 for living and other expenses. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page14 of 31

STANDARD OF REVIEW 
The question of whether a bail package will reasonably assure the 
defendant’s presence is a mixed question of law and fact. United States 
v. Horton, 653 F. App’x 46, 47 (2d Cir. 2016). This Court reviews the 
district court’s purely factual findings for clear error. Id. However, the 
district court’s ultimate finding “may be subject to plenary review if it 
rests on a predicate finding which reflects a misperception of a legal 
rule applicable to the particular factor involved.” Id. at 319–20 (quoting 
United States v. Shakur, 817 F.2d 189, 197 (2d Cir. 1987)). That is, 
“even if the court’s finding of a historical fact relevant to that factor is 
not clearly erroneous, [the appellate court] may reverse if the court 
evinces a misunderstanding of the legal significance of that historical 
fact and if that misunderstanding infects the court's ultimate finding.” 
Shakur, 817 F.2d at 197. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
I. 
Ghislaine Maxwell should be released under §3142(i) 
because she cannot effectively prepare her defense 
under the horrific conditions she is facing. 
Trying to defend against exceedingly old, anonymous allegations 
is hard enough.  Doing so while in de facto solitary confinement without 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page15 of 31

the real ability to meet with your lawyers face-to-face while being kept 
up all night and being given inedible food makes it virtually impossible, 
and violates Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights.  
Section 3142(i) makes clear that defendants must have the ability 
to consult with counsel and effectively prepare for their defense.  If this 
is not possible in custody, release is required.  United States v. 
Chandler, 1:19-CR-867 (PAC), 2020 WL 1528120, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 
31, 2020) (extraordinary burdens imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, 
in conjunction with detainee’s right to prepare for his defense, 
constituted compelling reason to order temporary release from 
Metropolitan Correction Center). The COVID epidemic is still raging 
and conditions at MDC are unsafe.6  
Ms. Maxwell’s continued detention would be wrong at any point in 
this nation’s history, even when stealing a loaf of bread was a felony.  It 
is especially unwarranted now. “The hazards of a pandemic are 
immediate and dire, and still the rights of criminal defendants who are 
Just for example, the air is not properly filtered in the small, enclosed 
attorney visit rooms at MDC and has been described as “a death trap” 
for lawyers and inmates. Ex.K, n.8.  Even though the prison is 
technically open for legal visits, lawyers are understandably not willing 
to walk into a viral petri dish. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page16 of 31

subject to the weight of federal power are always a special concern of 
the judiciary.” Chandler, 2020 WL 1528120, at *2; United States v. 
Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 65-67 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (finding that “the 
obstacles the current public health crisis poses to the preparation of the 
Defendant’s defense constitute a compelling reason under 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(i)”); United States v. Weigand, 20-CR-188-1 (JSR), 2020 WL 
5887602, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2020) (holding that a wealthy 
defendant, who the government claimed was a flight risk, would be 
allowed to obtain his release pending trial during the coronavirus 
pandemic). 
“The right to consult with legal counsel about being released on 
bond, entering a plea, negotiating and accepting a plea agreement, 
going to trial, testifying at trial, locating trial witnesses, and other 
decisions confronting the detained suspect, whose innocence is 
presumed, is a right inextricably linked to the legitimacy of our criminal 
justice system.” Fed. Defs. of N.Y. v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 954 F.3d 
118, 134 (2d Cir. 2020); see also United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 
755 (1987) (“In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to 
trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.”). 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page17 of 31

In United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 1155 (D. Kan. 
2020), the court emphasized that “[m]ost courts addressing a motion for 
temporary release under §3142(i) have done so in the context of 
evaluating the necessity of the defendant assisting with preparing his 
or her defense ... This extends to the current COVID-19 pandemic

counsel's 
difficulties 
communicating with the defendant.” See, e.g., Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 
at 65-67 (finding “the obstacles the current public health crisis poses to 
the preparation of the Defendant's defense constitute a compelling 
reason under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i)”); United States v. Robertson, 17-Cr-
2949, Doc. 306 (D.N.M. February 6, 2021).7 
The defendant in Robertson was charged with “frightening 
allegations” involving a shooting. He had previously violated bond. And 
he had a criminal record involving guns and drugs.  But the court 
ordered him released because of his inability to prepare for trial while 
in custody during the pandemic: 
Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his trial 
defense under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). That section allows a judicial 
The 10th Circuit has stayed the Robertson order while it considers the 
government’s appeal.

officer who issued an order of detention to, by subsequent order, 
“permit the temporary release of the person … to the extent that 
the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for 
preparation of the person’s defense or for another compelling 
reason.” § 3142(i). 
The presumption of innocence should not be paid mere lip service, the 
court held, and being held without the ability to see counsel face-to-face 
was “no way to prepare for trial.”  
Ms. Maxwell presents a more compelling case than Robertson for 
temporary release under § 3142(i). Courts considering whether pretrial 
release is necessary have considered: “(1) [the] time and opportunity the 
defendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; 
(2) the complexity of the case and volume of information; and (3) 
expense 
and 
inconvenience 
associated 
with 
preparing 
while 
incarcerated.” Robertson, (citing United States v. Boatwright, 2020 WL 
1639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2020) (unreported) (citations omitted). 
Trial is set for July.  There is precious little time left to prepare 
and participate in that preparation.  The discovery involves millions of 
pages of documents. Ms. Maxwell cannot conduct searches of these 
documents; she cannot print them and spread them out on a desk for 
review; she cannot make notes on the documents; and she cannot move 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page19 of 31

the files around into a different order.  She is stuck looking at one page 
at a time over a screen three feet away without a lawyer in the same 
room. These are textbook untenable conditions. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 
3d at 67 (explaining the importance of legal visits and ordering bail 
during pandemic); Weigand, 2020 WL 5887602, at *2 (ordering bail 
during pandemic because defendant needed ability to review the 
discovery in complex, document-heavy case). This is no way to prepare 
for a trial where the government will be asking for a sentence that will 
imprison her for the rest of her life.  Ex.A 
This Court has recognized that, after a relatively short time, 
pretrial detention turns into prohibited, unconstitutional punishment. 
United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987) (“grave due 
process concerns” are implicated by a seven-month period of pretrial 
detention); United States v. Melendez-Carrions, 790 F.2d 984, 1008 (2d 
Cir. 1986) (Feinberg, J. concurring) (“[G]eneral requirements of due 
process compel us to draw the line [of permissible pretrial detention] 
well short of [] eight months.”). Under the current conditions, it can 
hardly be disputed that Ms. Maxwell is being punished, which in itself 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page20 of 31

requires relief.  Add to that the barriers she is facing to preparing her 
defense and this Court should order her release under 3142(i). 
II. 
The trial court erred in relying on the government’s 
proffer—which comprised nothing but old, anonymous, 
unconfronted, hearsay accusations—to refuse to set 
reasonable bail for Ghislaine Maxwell. 
The government stressed the strength of its case in seeking 
detention, highlighting the “strength of the Government’s evidence” on 
page 1 of its application for detention. Ex.A. For support, the 
government made the circular argument that the evidence is strong 
because of “the facts set forth in the Indictment.”  Id. at 5. It made the 
same argument in the reply. Ex.C at 4 (arguing the case is strong 
because “the superseding indictment makes plain” the allegations 
against Ms. Maxwell).  
Of course, the Indictment is not evidence. See United States v. 
Giampino, 680 F.2d 898, 901 n. 3 (2d. Cir. 1982). Every circuit with 
published pattern instructions inform juries that they are not to 
consider the indictment as evidence. See, e.g., Third Circuit (“An 
indictment is simply a description of the charge(s) against a defendant. 
It is an accusation only. An indictment is not evidence of anything, and 
you should not give any weight to the fact that (name) has been indicted 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page21 of 31

in making your decision in this case.”); Fifth Circuit: (“The indictment 
… is only an accusation, nothing more. It is not proof of guilt or 
anything else. The defendant therefore starts out with a clean slate.”); 
Sixth Circuit: (“The indictment … does not even raise any suspicion of 
guilt.”).  
The government did not provide one single document to the court 
to back up its claims that the accusers’ allegations about events from 
1994-97 were truthful.  The government has refused to disclose even the 
names of these accusers.  Contrary to its assertions to the lower court, 
its allegations are not corroborated.  Ex.E at 30-33 (“[T]he discovery 
contains not a single contemporaneous email, text message, phone 
record, diary entry, police report, or recording that implicates Ms. 
Maxwell in the 1994-1997 conduct underlying the conspiracy charged in 
the indictment.”). 
The government only made these allegations after Epstein’s 
inexplicable death at MCC.  Ms. Maxwell was not named in Epstein’s 
indictment as a defendant or a co-conspirator.  She was charged as a 
substitute for Epstein.  Reverse engineering a charge many years later 
because of the main target’s death is not the makings of a strong case.   
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page22 of 31

Recognizing this weakness, the Government relies on the 
statutory maximum penalty to argue that the case is serious and that 
Ms. Maxwell poses a risk of flight.  But the statutory maximum is 
hardly relevant to determine risk of flight.  In the vast majority of 
federal cases, the statutory maximum penalties are sky-high and are 
not reflective of the real potential penalties.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1658(b) 
(statutory maximum of life imprisonment for turning off a light in a 
lighthouse to expose a ship to danger). 
Even if there were evidence to back up the four anonymous 
accusers, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of the 
commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potential long sentence 
to support a finding of risk of flight.” United States v. Friedman, 837 
F.2d 48, 49-50 (2d. Cir. 1988) (district court’s finding that defendant 
posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long 
sentence of incarceration”); Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing 
detention order where defendants agreed to significant physical and 
financial restrictions, despite the fact that they faced a “lengthy term of 
incarceration”).   
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page23 of 31

This is why defendants charged under the same statute in the 
Southern District of New York are regularly granted bond. United 
States v. Hussain, 18-mj-08262-UA (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2, 2018) (defendant 
charged with 18 U.S.C. 2422 violations granted $100,000 personal 
recognizance bond with home detention, electronic monitoring, and 
other conditions); United States v. Buser, 17-mj-07599-UA (S.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 19, 2017) (defendant charged with 18 U.S.C. 2422 and 2423 
violations granted $100,000 personal recognizance bond, secured by 
$10,000 cash, with electronic monitoring and other conditions); United 
States v. Acosta, 16-mj-08569-UA (S.D.N.Y Mar. 29, 2016) (denying the 
Government’s detention application after argument and granting 
defendant charged with 18 U.S.C. 2422 violations $100,000 personal 
recognizance bond with home detention, electronic monitoring, and 
other conditions); United States v. McFadden, 17-mj-04708-UA 
(S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2017) (defendant charged with 18 U.S.C. 2422 and 
2423 violations granted $250,000 personal recognizance bond, secured 
by property, with home detention, electronic monitoring and other 
conditions). 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page24 of 31

The government shotguns manufactured assertions in support of 
the supposed flight risk. First, the ridiculous contention that she was 
hiding before her arrest.   In fact, she was living in, and arrested in, her 
own home in New Hampshire.  She was in touch with her lawyers and 
as the government has to concede, her lawyers were communicating 
with the government.  Ex.D at 27. Despite plenty of opportunities, she 
had not left the United States since Epstein’s arrest, and had been 
living in the United States for 30 years. She became a U.S. citizen.  She 
lived and worked here for 30 years. The government knew exactly 
where she was.  (FBI New York Assistant Director William Sweeney 
Jr.: “We’d been discretely keeping tabs on Maxwell’s whereabouts as we 
worked this investigation.”)   
The fact that she was holed up in her home because she was being 
relentlessly harassed by the media is not evidence of hiding from the 
government.  In fact, one sensational tabloid put a £10,000 bounty on 
her. “Wanted: The Sun is offering a £10,000 reward for information on 
… Ghislaine Maxwell,” The Sun, November 20, 2019, available at: 
https://tinyurl.com/3vewtnx3. Anyone facing these unprecedented safety 
concerns from the media mob would try to keep a low profile. But a low 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page25 of 31

profile is not flight.  Ms. Maxwell could have left the United States had 
she wanted to flee.  She did not want to do that and she did not do that.  
Instead, she chose to stay here and fight the bogus charges against her.  
This factor weighs heavily in favor of bond. 
The government’s next argument is that she has foreign ties and 
significant assets. But Ms. Maxwell addressed those concerns by 
renouncing her British and French citizenship and by agreeing to have 
her and her spouse’s assets (other than basic living expenses and legal 
fees) placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal 
district judge and former U.S. Attorney who will have authority over 
them. Ex.I.  
Even someone with the government’s imagination can’t conjure up 
anything else Ms. Maxwell could do to show that she is serious about 
staying here to fight the allegations against her.  She will agree to 
whatever condition the court orders and she will take the extraordinary 
step of renouncing her foreign citizenship. The government cannot 
explain how Ms. Maxwell could flee.  She will have no assets (other 
than living expenses).  She will have no country that will protect her. 
Her family and friends will be at risk. She will be heavily and 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page26 of 31

constantly monitored.  And of course, she is recognizable around the 
globe. 
The truth is that wealthy men charged with similar or more 
serious offenses, many of whom have foreign ties, are routinely granted 
bail so that they can effectively prepare for trial. Bernie Madoff. Harvey 
Weinstein. Bill Cosby. John Gotti. Marc Dreier. Dominique Strauss-
Kahn. Ali Sadr. Adnan Khashoggi. Mahender Sabhnani. The list goes 
on and on.  In each case, the court set reasonable conditions of bond and 
the defendants appeared, despite similar arguments by the government 
that the defendant faced serious charges or that the evidence was 
strong or that he had foreign ties or that he had great wealth.   Ms. 
Maxwell is entitled to the same opportunity as male defendants to 
prepare her defense. 
Even putting aside the pandemic and the current conditions of 
Ms. Maxwell’s confinement, pretrial detention “is an extraordinary 
remedy” that should be reserved for only a very “limited group of 
offenders.” United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 8 (2d Cir. 1987). For 
this reason, a judge may deny a defendant bail “only for the strongest of 
reasons.” Hung v. United States, 439 U.S. 1326, 1329 (1978) (Brennan, 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page27 of 31

J.). The Constitution’s “prohibitions on the deprivation of liberty 
without due process and of excessive bail require careful review of 
pretrial detention orders to ensure that the statutory mandate [of the 
Bail Reform Act] has been respected.” United States v. Motamedi, 767 
F.2d 1403, 1405 (9th Cir. 1985) (Kennedy, J.). Because the consequence 
of error – the unjust deprivation of liberty from an individual who is 
presumed innocent – is contrary to our Constitution, “doubts regarding 
the propriety of release should be resolved in favor of the defendant.” Id. 
Even where the government is able to prove that an accused is an 
actual flight risk, pretrial detention generally remains inappropriate. 
United States v. Berrios-Berrios, 791 F.2d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 1986) (“the 
presumption in favor of bail still applies where the defendant is found to 
be a risk of flight”) (emphasis added). Where the only question is 
whether the defendant is a risk of flight, “the law still favors pre-trial 
release subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination 
of conditions, that the court determines will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the person as required.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page28 of 31

The Supreme Court has explained that when “the Government 
has admitted that its only interest is in preventing flight, bail must be 
set by a court at a sum designed to ensure that goal, and no more.”  
The government simply has not come close to satisfying its heavy 
burden of proving that “no conditions” exist that will reasonably assure 
Ms. Maxwell’s presence. It has not articulated with any evidence, let 
alone specific and credible evidence, how Ms. Maxwell could manage to 
flee under the proposed bail conditions. Speculation is not permitted. 
United States v. Bodmer, No. 03-cr-947(SAS), 2004 WL 169790 
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2004) (where government’s argument that no 
conditions could assure defendant’s future presence was based, “in large 
part, on speculation,” defendant was released to home confinement with 
GPS monitoring). We challenge the government to point to a high 
profile defendant who in the recent past has 1) fled and 2) gotten away 
with it. 
The reality is that defendants with far greater likelihood of 
conviction than Ms. Maxwell are granted bond and appear in court.  Ms. 
Maxwell should not be treated differently.  
Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page29 of 31

CONCLUSION 
Ms. Maxwell faces old, anonymous accusations that have never 
been tested.  In any other case, she would have been released long ago.  
But because of the “Epstein effect,” she is being detained and in truly 
unacceptable conditions.  All we are asking for is a chance to defend the 
case. We respectfully request that Ms. Maxwell be released on 
reasonable conditions of bail or that the case be remanded for an 
evidentiary hearing.

Cr. 330 (AJN) 
THE GOVERNMENT'S MEMORANDUM 
IN SUPPORT OF DETENTION 
For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully submits that Ghislaine 
Max well, the defendant, poses an extreme 1isk of flight; that she will not be able to rebut the 
statuto1y presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required, 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E); and that the CoUlt should 
therefore order her detained. 
TI1e charges in this case are unquestionably serious: the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine 
Maxwell, in partnership with Jeffrey Epstein, a serial sexual predator, exploited and abused young 
girls for years. As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell now faces the very real 
prospect of serving many years in prison. TI1e strength of the Govenunent's evidence and the 
substantial prison te1m the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for 
the defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant's extensive international ties, 
her citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United 
States. In sho1t, Maxwell has tlu·ee passports, large sums of money, extensive international 
connections, and absolutely no reason to stay in tl1e United States and face the possibility of a 
lengtl1y p1ison sentence.

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 3 of 10 
BACKGROUND 
On June 29, 2020, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a 
sealed indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of conspiracy to entice 
minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U. S.C. § 3 71 ; one count of enticing 
a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S. C. § 2422 and 2; one count of 
conspiracy to transport minors to paiticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; 
one count of transporting minors to paiticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 
a11d 2; a11d two counts of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. 
TI1e chai·ges ai·ise from a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls at Epstein's prope1ties 
in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, between approximately 1994 and 1997. During that time, 
Maxwell had a personal a11d professional relationship with Epstein a11d was one of his closest 
associates. 
Beginning in at least 1994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Epstein, through a vaiiety of means and methods. In particulai·, she played 
a key role in Epstein's abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse 
underage girls. As a pa1t of their scheme, the defenda11t a11d Epstein enticed a11d caused minor 
victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended 
would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in 
multiple ways. For example, she attempted to befriend ce1tain victims by asking them about their 
lives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with 
Epstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who 
seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page8 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 4 of 10 
the defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein's offers of financial assistance, including 
offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as 14 years old when 
they were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims 
were mmors. 
l11e Indictment fruther alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In 
2016, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern 
District of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in 
facilitating the abuse of minors. l11e defendant repeatedly lied ru1der oath when questioned about 
her conduct with minor girls. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Refo1m Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal coruts are empowered to 
order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the c01mnunity or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). A finding of 1isk of flight must 
be suppo1ted by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarco, 948 F.2d 
789, 793 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); United States v. 
Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400,405 (2d Cir. 1985). A fmding of dangerousness must be supported by 
clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir. 
1995); Patriarco, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. 
l11e Bail Refmm Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circrunstances of the c1imes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character ... landJ 
fmancial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page9 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 5 of 10 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (Government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial." 
U.S.C. § 3142(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be 
presumed, subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure 
the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the c01mnmlity. 
U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
II. 
Discussion 
For the reasons set fo1th below, the defendant presents an extreme 1isk of flight, and 
therefore she cannot overcome the statuto1y presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every 
one of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight 1isk - the nature and circumstances of the 
offense, the strength of the evidence, and the hist01y and characte1istics of the defendant - counsel 
strongly in favor of detention. 
A 
The 
ature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
TI1e "nature and circumstances" of this om~nse favor detention. As the Indictment alleges, 
the defendant committed se1ious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(g)(l) (specifically enumerating ' whether the offense ... involves a minor victim" as a 
factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transpo1ting minors for illegal sex 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page10 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 6 of 10 
acts are so serious that both crimes cany a statuto1y presumption that no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 
(e)(3)(E). l11e defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as 14 years 
old, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors. 
l11ese offenses cany significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years' 
imprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in 
assessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, 
at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) (' lTJhe steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight 
risk is, especially considering the strong case of the government .... ") ( quoting United States v. 
AlindaterPere::., 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory 
maximum of decades in prison. l11is fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone 
to flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at 
age 58, faces the ve1y real prospect of spending a substantial p01tion of the rest of her life in prison. 
l11e strength of the evidence in this case underscores the 1isk that the defendant will become 
a fugitive. As the facts set fmth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong. 
Multiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and c01rnborated information against the 
defendant. l11e victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony, 
and other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entlies, business records, and other evidence 
co1rnborate the victims' account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any tiial 
in this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
l11e passage of time between the defendant's conduct and these charges does not counsel 
otherwise. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations pe1iod for conduct that was timely as of the 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page11 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 7 of 10 
date of the amendment, 1 to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor 
victim. See United States v. Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because 
Congress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the 
previous statute was still running, the extension was pe1missible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, 
No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at * 1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). Moreover, while 
the conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occUITed years ago, the risk of a significant term 
of incarceration - and thus the motive to flee - is of course only very recent. 
Each of these factors - the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration - creates an extraordinaiy incentive to flee. And as fu1ther 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
B. 
The Chai·acte1istics of the Defendai1t 
The history ai1d chai·acteristics of the defendai1t also strongly suppmt detention. As an 
initial matter, the defendant's extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her 
to flee ai1d live abroad. The defendai1t was born in Frai1ce ai1d raised in the United Kingdom, 
where she attended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 
2002, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom ai1d France. Travel records from 
United States Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") reflect that she has engaged in frequent 
international travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last tlu·ee years to locations 
including tl1e United Kingdom, Japai1, ai1d Qatai·. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent 
with her citizenship status, the defendai1t appears to possess passpmts from the United States, 
France, and tl1e United Kingdom. 
P1ior to the ainendment, tl1e statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until 
tl1e victim reached the age of 25, ai1d as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment 
remained timely as of the 2003 amendment desc1ibed above. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page12 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 8 of 10 
In addition, the defendant appears to have access to significant financial resources that 
would enable her flight from prosecution. Based on the Government's investigation to date, the 
Government has identified more than 15 different bank accounts held by or associated with the 
defendant from 2016 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those 
accounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than 
million. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as 
recently as 2019. For example, the defendant t:ransfe1rnd 500,000 from one of her accounts to 
anotl1er in March 2019, and transfe1Ted more than 300,000 from one of her accounts to anotl1er 
in July 2019. She has also reported, including as recently as 2019, that she holds one or more 
foreign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars. 
The defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2016 property sale. 
In paiticular, in 2016, tl1e defendant appeai·s to have sold a New York City residence for 15 
million through a limited liability compai1y. On or about the date of the sale, ainounts totaling 
more than 14 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as 
the owner. Several days later, more than 14 million was transfo1Ted from that account into 
anotl1er account opened in the name of the defendant.2 In short, the defendant's financial resources 
appeai· to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her 
total fu1ai1cial picture opaque ai1d indetenninate, even upon a review of bailk records available to 
the Government. 
The Govermnent additionally notes that, somewhat fu1ther back in time, in transactions occuning 
between 2 007 ai1d 2011 , approximately more thai1 20 million was trai1sfe1Ted from accounts 
associated witl1 Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in 
the millions of dollars that were then subsequently trai1Sferred back to accounts associated with 
Epstein. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page13 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 9 of 10 
The defendant's international co1mections and significant financial means would present a 
clear risk of flight under 1101mal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by 
the transient nature of defendant's current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively 
been in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July 
2019. Thereafter, the defendant -who had previously made many public appearances - stopped 
appearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears 
that she made intentional effo1ts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice, 
switching her primaiy phone number (which she registered under the name ' G Max") ai1d email 
address, and ordering packages for delive1y with a different person listed on the shipping label. 
Most recently, the defendant appeai·s to have been hiding on a 156-acre prope1ty acquired in an 
all-cash purchase in December 2019 (tlu·ough a cai·efully ai1011ymized LLC) in Bradford, New 
Hainpshire, an area to which she has no other known connections. 
TI1e defendant appeai·s to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United 
States. She has no children, does not reside with ai1y ilmnediate family members, ai1d does not 
appeai· to have ai1y employment that would require her to remail1 in the United States. 
or does 
she appear to have any pennanent ties to any paiticular location in the United States. As such, the 
Government respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of 
overcomil1g the presumption of detention, because there ai·e no bail conditions that could 
reasonably assure the defendai1t's contilmed appeai·a11ce il1 this case. 
In pai·ticulai·, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to 
mitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring 
device. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head stait 
should she decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at * 1

(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application for bail in part because 
home detention with electronic monitoring ' at best ... limits a fleeing defendant's head stait"); 
United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) 
(same); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. 
Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same). 
CONCLUSION 
As set fo1th above, the defendant is an extreme risk of flight. TI1e Government respectfully 
submits that the defendai1t caimot meet her burden of overcoming the statutory presumption in 
favor of detention. There are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in 
cowt proceedings in this case. Accordingly, any application for bail should be denied.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Opposition to the 
government’s July 2, 2020 Memorandum in Support of Detention (“Gov. Mem.”). 
It is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public attention than the 
government’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2019, Epstein was indicted for 
offenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media attention focused on the 
nature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August 10, 2019, Epstein died in 
federal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute 
her for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had 
never been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always 
denied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were 
threatening and harassing to our client and those close to her. 
But sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not 
Jeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2019, despite 
the fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current 
indictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years 
ago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the 
presumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since 1991, has 
litigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even 
once since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly 
publicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes 
before this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and 
other circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject 
to the strict conditions proposed below.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 6 of 26 
Background.  Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the 
United States since 1991. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United 
Kingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell 
graduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in 1991, and has lived in this 
country ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her 
six siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2019 
indictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her now. She is especially close to two of her 
sisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has 
numerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to 
many of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained committed to her because they 
do not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have known for 
decades. 
The Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in showing 
that detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that 
will secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government 
relies on the presumption of detention in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms. 
Maxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of 
the United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for 
each country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing 
recent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law 
enforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular 
contact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government 
argues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant

detention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government 
does not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section 
3142(g)(4). 
Ms. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms. 
Maxwell, on the strict conditions proposed below (or as modified by the Court), for two 
compelling reasons. 
First, the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As 
this Court has noted, the COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to 
incarcerated individuals, and COVID-19-related restrictions on attorney communications with 
pretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put, 
under these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious 
risk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9). 
Second, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under 
the Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government 
may be rebutted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S. 
citizen and has lived in this country for almost 30 years; she ran a non-profit company based in 
the United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it down to 
protect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with 
family members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct 
indicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil 
litigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from 
the time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the 
government. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page22 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 8 of 26 
purpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online attention 
and its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities, 
and reputational damage simply for knowing her. The government’s remaining arguments— 
about Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they 
would require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail, 
which is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed below, the government’s position regarding 
the nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged 
conduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail 
analysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 21). 
Proposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the following bail 
conditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous 
situations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible 
people, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United 
Kingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ii) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of 
New York; (iii) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict 
supervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of 
New York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate 
family, close friends and counsel; (vii) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s 
office, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (viii) such other 
terms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3142. 
The Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is 
entitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) 
(“Nothing in this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page23 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 9 of 26 
innocence.”). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell 
presents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3142. The strict bail 
conditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive” 
set of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the 
health and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be 
detained pending trial. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (c)(1)(B). Under the controlling legal standards, 
Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail. 
ARGUMENT 
There are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release 
on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed: 
First, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-19 if she is detained, 
and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the 
restrictions that have been placed on attorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic. 
Second, the government has failed to carry its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142 that no 
combination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in 
court. 
I. 
The Conditions Created by the COVID-19 Pandemic Mandate the Release of 
Ms. Maxwell. 
Impact of COVID-19 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by 
the COVID-19 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions. 
Four months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, 15-CR-95 (AJN), 2020 WL 
1295155 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020), that COVID-19 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily 
dangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. Id. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no 
underlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page24 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 10 of 26 
prior detention order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-19. At the time, COVID- 
had only begun to take its devastating toll on New York, and there was no known outbreak in 
the prison population. Nevertheless, the Court noted that “inmates may be at a heightened risk of 
contracting COVID-19 should an outbreak develop,” and, based in part on this changed 
circumstance, ordered the defendant released. Id. 
Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-19 risks to inmates have 
increased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-19 in correctional 
facilities. In the last month alone, the number of prison inmates known to have COVID-19 has 
doubled to 68,000, and prison deaths tied to COVID-19 have increased by 73 percent.1 Indeed, 
as of July 2, 2020, nine of the ten largest known clusters of the coronavirus in the United States 
are in federal prisons and county jails.2 As this Court noted last month, “the ‘inability [of] 
individuals to socially distance, shared communal spaces, and limited access to hygiene 
products’ [in correctional facilities] make community spread all but unavoidable.” United States 
v. Williams-Bethea, No. 18-CR-78 (AJN), 2020 WL 2848098, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 2, 2020) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The risks are further enhanced by the possibility 
of a second wave of coronavirus cases.3 
In particular, COVID-19 has begun to spread through the Metropolitan Detention Center 
(MDC), where Ms. Maxwell has been housed since the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred her 
there on July 6, 2020. According to the MDC’s statistics, as of April 3, 2020, two inmates and

five staff had tested positive; by June 30, 2020, those numbers had risen to 14 and 41, 
respectively.4 The increased spread among prisons means that the COVID-19 risks that were 
present in the Stephens case four months ago are far more serious for Ms. Maxwell now and 
mandate her release. 
Impact of COVID-19 on the Ability to Prepare the Defense. The Stephens opinion 
provides yet another independent basis that, we submit, requires Ms. Maxwell’s release: if she is 
detained, her ability to meet with her attorneys and prepare for her defense will be significantly 
impaired and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense. 
In Stephens, the Court found that this factor required the defendant’s release under 18 
U.S.C. § 3142(i), which provides for temporary release based on a determination that such 
release is “necessary for preparation of the person’s defense.” Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at 
*3. The Court noted that the spread of COVID-19 had compelled the BOP to suspend all in- 
person visits, including legal visits, except as allowed on a case-by-case basis. Id. at *3. That 
suspension persists to this day.5 In a case such as this, which will require assessing evidence 
relating to events that occurred approximately twenty-five years ago, including documents and 
personal recollections, numerous in-person meetings between counsel and Ms. Maxwell will be 
critical to the preparation of the defense. The recent resurgence of the pandemic calls into 
question whether these meetings will ever be able to happen in advance of her trial. As in

Stephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her attorneys while this policy is in effect 
constitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at *3.6 
Even speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID- 
19-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in 
which case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week, 
however, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required. 
At approximately 5:30 p.m. on July 6, 2020, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell 
about waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and 
ordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:00 p.m. that night with a proposed date 
and time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call, 
making specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until 
9:00 p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to 
reach our client in time if she is detained.7 In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has 
not been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials. 
The prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her 
review, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case 
compound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review 
Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants 
released on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to 
prepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 20-MJ-3073 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2020) (releasing 
undocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and 
risk of COVID-19); United States v. Hudson, 19-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020) (releasing defendant in 
drug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-19 bail applications were denied, 
because of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-19); United States v. Chandler, 19-CR-867 
(PAC), 2020 WL 1528120, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with 
prior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-19 restrictions). 
The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell 
each morning until the initial appearance to facilitate attorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate 
these efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shows no signs of abating. Nor would it be 
appropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our 
communications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.

documents and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist 
in the preparation of her defense. These restrictions are additional “compelling reasons” 
justifying her release. See id.8 
II. 
The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. 
The grave concerns raised by the current COVID-19 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell 
must be released because she has met her limited burden of production showing that she does not 
pose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition 
or combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court. 
A. 
Applicable Law 
As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention 
prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481 
U.S. 739, 755 (1987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v. 
Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)). The Bail Reform Act 
provides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (18 U.S.C. § 3142(b)) 
(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the 
appearance” of the defendant in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c). Where conditions are necessary, 
such release shall be “subject to the least restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court] 
determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a 
limited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
See also Letter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2020), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v. 
Federal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. 19 Civ. 660 (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc. No. 78) (detailing absence of in-person 
visitation, highly limited VTC and telephone call capacity, and issues pertaining to legal mail and legal documents). 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page28 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 14 of 26 
The government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government 
must show “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of 
flight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this 
burden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or 
combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his 
presence in court.” Id. 
In determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant, the court must consider (1) the nature and circumstances of the 
offense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and 
characteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or 
the community that would be posed by the person’s release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). 
In this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms. 
Maxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply. 
The Bail Reform Act contains a rebuttable presumption, applicable based on certain of 
the crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of 
production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with 
evidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d 
311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted).  This rebuttable presumption can be readily 
satisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4–11–70756 MAG (DMR), 2011 WL 3421321, at *2 
(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2011), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a 
category listed in § 3142(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption. United States v. 
Dominguez, 783 F.2d 702, 707 (7th Cir. 1986); see also United States v. Mattis, No. 20-1713, 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page29 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 15 of 26 
2020 WL 3536277, at *4–5 (2d Cir. June 30, 2020). Although the presumption “remains a factor 
to be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of production, “[a]t all times . . . 
the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the 
evidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions. 
English, 629 F.3d at 319 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States 
v. Deutsch, No. 18-CR-502 (FB), 2020 WL 3577398, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July 1, 2020). And 
regardless of the presence of the presumption or the nature of the charges alleged, “[n]othing in 
this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.” 
U.S.C. § 3142(j); see also United States v. Crowell, No. 06-CR-291E(F), 2006 WL 3541736, 
at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2006) (those charged with crimes involving minors “continue to enjoy 
the presumption of innocence in setting conditions of release.”). 
B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Rebutted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight 
Risk, and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No 
Combination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her 
Presence In Court 
The government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions 
will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth below, Ms. 
Maxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior 
to her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same 
reasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which 
are consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release, 
will not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms. 
Maxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.

1. 
Ms. Maxwell’s Personal History and Characteristics 
Demonstrate That She Is Not a Flight Risk 
a. 
Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has 
Significant Ties to the United States and the New York Region 
Ms. Maxwell’s history and characteristics do not “strongly support detention,” as the 
government contends (Gov. Mem. at 6), but instead demonstrate that she is firmly rooted in 
this country and that her appearance can be reasonably assured with appropriate bail 
conditions. Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty- 
five-year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the 
present. Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this 
country for almost 30 years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. Ms. Maxwell 
also has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign 
her bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-born 
citizens.  Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with 
them, as well as with her nieces and nephews.  Ms. Maxwell also has numerous close 
friends and professional colleagues who reside in this country. In sum, the United States has 
been Ms. Maxwell’s home for decades. 
b. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Actively Litigated Civil Cases in this District 
and Has Not Left the United States Since Epstein’s 2019 Arrest 
Ms. Maxwell has never once attempted to “hide” from the government or her 
accusers, and has never shown any intent to leave the country. To the contrary, Ms. 
Maxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct 
related to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully 
intends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her. For example, 
since 2015, and continuing through today, Ms. Maxwell has actively litigated several civil 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page31 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 17 of 26 
cases related to Epstein in the Southern District of New York and has sat for depositions in 
those cases. Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case, 
which has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the 
United States. Indeed, on July 7, 2019, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached 
out to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and 
maintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest. 
The government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent 
international travel” in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she 
has not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain 
in the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2019 is 
particularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been 
even more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press 
articles began turning the public’s attention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for 
Epstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s 
investigation.9 Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be 
victims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution. 
Despite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was 
redirected toward her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave 
the country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was 
arrested. These actions weigh heavily in favor of release. See United States v. Friedman, 
See, e.g., Spotlight turns on Jeffrey Epstein’s British socialite ‘fixer’ Ghislaine Maxwell after his suicide – but will 
she be prosecuted?, Daily Mail (Aug. 10, 2019), https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7344765/Spotlight-turns-

837 F.2d 48, 49-50 (2d Cir. 1988) (overturning district court’s decision that defendant posed 
a flight risk based in part on the ground that the defendant took “no steps” to flee

defendants did not present a flight risk because each of them “for three years knew there 
was substantial evidence of the likely charges against them and did not attempt to flee 
before indictment”). 837 F.2d 48, 49-50 (2d Cir. 1988) (overturning district court’s decision 
that defendant posed a flight risk based in part on the ground that the defendant took “no 
steps” to flee jurisdiction in three-week period between execution of search warrant at home 
and arrest); United States v. DiGiacomo, 746 F. Supp. 1176, 1179-80 (D. Mass. 1990) 
(concluding defendants did not present a flight risk because each of them “for three years 
knew there was substantial evidence of the likely charges against them and did not attempt 
to flee before indictment”). 
ƒ 
Indeed, the absence of any allegation by the government that Ms. Maxwell was 
taking steps to leave the country at the time of her arrest is conspicuous. The government 
has offered no proof that she was making plans to leave the country. In fact, had the 
government alerted her counsel that she was about to be arrested, we would have arranged 
for Ms. Maxwell’s prompt, voluntary surrender. Instead, the government arrested Ms. 
Maxwell without warning on the day before the July 4th holiday, thus ensuring that she 
would be in federal custody on the one-year anniversary of Epstein’s arrest.

Coverage and Death Threats Do Not Demonstrate an Intent to

Furthermore, the steps Ms. Maxwell took to leave the public eye after Epstein’s 
arrest are not indicative of a risk of flight. The government notes that Ms. Maxwell dropped

out of public view after Epstein’s arrest, which the government seeks to portray as “hiding” 
from the law. The government further argues that she has taken several steps to avoid 
detection, including moving residences and switching her phone and email address. (Gov. 
Mem. at 8). But Ms. Maxwell did not take these steps to hide from law enforcement or 
evade prosecution. Instead, they were necessary measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to

take to protect herself, her family members, her friends and colleagues, and their children, 
from unrelenting and intrusive media coverage, threats, and irreparable reputational harm. 
Ever since Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell has been at the center of a crushing 
onslaught of press articles, television specials, and social media posts painting her in the 
most damning light possible and prejudging her guilt. The sheer volume of media reporting 
mentioning Ms. Maxwell is staggering. Since Epstein’s arrest, she has been mentioned in 
literally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content. The media 
attention also spawned a carnival-like atmosphere of speculation about her whereabouts. In 
November 2019, the British tabloid, The Sun, even offered a £10,000 bounty for information 
about Ms. Maxwell’s location. A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read: 
“WANTED: The Sun is offering a £10,000 reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal 
Ghislaine Maxwell.”10 And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media 
reports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid 
questioning by the FBI.11 She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in 
the bushes. Indeed, since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest on July 2, 2020, her counsel has been flooded 
with hundreds of media inquiries and solicitations from members of the public. 
The “open season” declared on Ms. Maxwell after Epstein’s death has come with an  
even darker cost – she has been the target of alarming physical threats, even death threats, and 
has had to hire security guards to ensure her safety. The media feeding frenzy, which has only 
intensified in recent months, has also deeply affected her family and friends. Some of Ms. 
Maxwell’s closest friends who had nothing whatsoever to do with Epstein have lost their jobs or

suffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms. 
Maxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do – she separated herself from 
everyone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and 
her friends out of harm’s way.12 
Lacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell 
presents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk 
argument is reduced to the following: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign 
citizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who now faces serious charges. 
But if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any 
meaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United 
States 439 U.S. 1326, 1329 (1978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must show 
more than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of 
[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in 
this Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of 
flight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial 
foreign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v. 
Hansen, 108 F. App’x 331 (6th Cir. 2004); United States v. Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C. 
2009); United States v.  Bodmer, No. 03-cr-947(SAS), 2004 WL 169790, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y.  
Jan. 28. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.D.C. 2004); United States v. 
Kashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). 
Finally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would 
pose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to flee the United States, particularly to 
The media spotlight has also drawn out people who claim to speak for Ms. Maxwell, and even purport to have had 
direct communications with her, but who, in fact, have no ties to Ms. Maxwell whatsoever. One such person has 
even given numerous television interviews on news shows in the United Kingdom.

France and the United Kingdom.13 Notably, two weeks ago, this Court recognized in United 
States v. Abdellatif El Mokadem, No. 19-CR-646 (AJN), 2020 WL 3440515 (S.D.N.Y. June 
23, 2020) that “concerns regarding risk of flight are mitigated by the ongoing [COVID-19] 
pandemic, which has understandably curtailed travel across the country, and, indeed, around 
the world.” Id. at *1. In that case, despite finding detention to be warranted on two prior 
occasions, the Court concluded that the government could no longer establish flight risk and 
ordered the defendant released pending sentencing. Id. (“Taking account of the COVID-19 
pandemic, which had not yet reached this country when the Court last considered 
Defendant’s custody status, the balance now clearly and convincingly tips in Defendant’s 
favor ....... ”). Consideration of this factor weighs heavily in favor of release on the proposed 
bail conditions here. 
2. 
The Nature and Circumstances of the Charges and the 
Weight of the Evidence Militate in Favor of Bail 
The Defense Has Rebutted the Presumption Relating to Certain of the Charges. The 
government relies on the statutory presumption of detention applicable to offenses involving 
minor victims. (Gov. Mem. at 4-5.) But unlike the position it took with Epstein, the 
government does not contend that Ms. Maxwell poses any danger to the community, or that 
she suffers from compulsive or addictive sexual proclivities. See United States v. Epstein, 
425 F. Supp. 3d 306, 314-15 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Even according to the indictment, Ms. 
Maxwell’s alleged participation in offenses involving minors ended in 1997. Here, the only

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 23 of 26 
applicable presumption relates to risk of flight, and, as noted, Ms. Maxwell has rebutted that 
presumption based on her ties to the United States, her decision to remain in this country 
after Epstein’s arrest, and all of the other reasons discussed above. This Court should follow 
other courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebutted the 
presumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged 
offenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2020 WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres, 
No. 3:20-CR-18-J-32JBT, 2020 WL 1042051, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2020); Conway, 
2011 WL 3421321, at *4-5. 
The Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that 
detention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem. 
at 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential 
punishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of 
the commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a 
finding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-50 (district court’s finding that 
defendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence 
of incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order 
where defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact 
that they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a 
long sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.14 
The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009), cited 
approvingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) for 
the proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering 
the strong case of the government . . . .” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts 
from Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 20-year old conduct as here, but 
instead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 60-61. The 
evidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and 
the defendant faced a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. Id. at 61-64. These factors are not present in this case. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page38 of 200

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 24 of 26 
Moreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend 
“decades in prison” if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure 
even if she were convicted on all counts is 10 years, assuming the Court were to follow the 
traditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a 10-year 
sentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further 
demonstrating that the government has not met its burden of showing Ms. Maxwell is an 
actual risk of flight. 
The Government’s Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the 
strength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal 
challenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s 
September 24, 2007 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which 
covers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ii) the conspiracy, enticement of minors, 
and transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (iii) 
the two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.15 In addition, as 
we understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on 
the testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago 
between 1994 and 1997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to 
decades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s 
case, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail. 
The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to 
Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.

3. 
The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than 
Adequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence 
For the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the 
circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk 
and prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government 
has not carried its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. We respectfully submit that the proposed 
bail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms. 
Maxwell’s presence in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (c)(1)(B). 
The package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and 
friends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her 
despite the unrelenting media attacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered 
as a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an 
extremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is 
also to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million. 
The package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering 
all passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern 
Districts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell, 
for personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release. 
Under the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial 
Services.16 
In United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2019), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under 
which a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed 
security guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant 
“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a 
condition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” Id. (emphasis in original). We submit 
that a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United 
States, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 26 of 26 
Ms. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal 
circumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond. She is not relying on them in 
connection with this bail application in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them 
and their families from harm. 
The proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this 
Circuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here. See, e.g., United States v. 
Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family 
who was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions), 
aff’d, 749 F. App’x 20 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831, 832 
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Marc Dreier, accused of “colossal criminality” and alleged to be a “high 
flight risk,” granted release subject to conditions); United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 
240, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Bernie Madoff, charged with “largest Ponzi scheme ever” and 
alleged to be a “serious risk of flight,” granted release subject to conditions). 
not have Ms. Maxwell’s means, would be released on bail conditions. Accordingly, if the Court deems it necessary, 
it may impose private security guards as a condition of release.

CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her 
release on bail pursuant to the conditions she has proposed.

Cr. 330 (AJN) 
THE GOVERNMENT'S REPLY MEMORANDUM 
IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF DETENTION 
l11e Government respectfully submits this reply memorandum in fruther suppmt of its 
motion for detention, dated July 2, 2020 (the "Detention Memorandum") (Dkt. 4), and in response 
to the defendant's memorandum in opposition (the "Opposition Memorandum") (Dkt. 18). 
l11e charges against Ghislaine Max well a1ise from her essential role in sexual exploitation 
that caused deep and lasting harm to vulnerable victims. At the heart of this case are brave women 
who are victims of se1ious c1imes that demand justice. l11e defendant's motion wholly fails to 
appreciate the diiving force behind this case: the defendant's victims were sexually abused as 
minors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell's actions, and they have caiTied the trauma from 
these events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial. 
l11ere will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the 
jurisdiction, and there is eve1y reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released. 
For the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorai1dum, and as fu1ther discussed below, the 
defendai1t poses a cleai· 1isk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her 
continued appeai·ance in this case. Among other concerns: (1) she is a citizen of a country that 
does not extradite its own citizens; (2) she appeai·s to have access to considerable wealth 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page46 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 3 of 19 
domestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly 
declines to provide the Comt with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears 
to be skilled at living in hiding. l11ese are glaring red flags, even before the Comt considers the 
gravity of the charges in this case and the serious penalties the defendant faces if convicted at trial. 
Instead of attempting to address the 1isks of releasing a defendant with apparent access to 
extraordinfily financial resources, who has the ability to live beyond the reach of extradition in 
France, and who has ah-eady demonstrated a willingness and ability to live in hiding, the defendfil1t 
instead proposes a bail package that amounts to little more thfil1 fill unsecured bond. Among other 
things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole secmity a 
prope1ty that is beyond the te1Tit01y and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is 
of no value as collateral. She proposes six unidentified co-signers, fill unknown number of whom 
even reside in the United States, and none of whose assets fil·e identified. The Court filld the 
Government have no info1mation whatsoever regfil·ding whether these co-signers would be able to 
able to pay the proposed 5 million bond should the defendfil1t flee - or it~ of equal concern, the 
co-signers fil·e themselves so wealthy that it would be no financial burden whatsoever to do so. 
l11e defendant does not identity what residence she proposes to live at in the Southern Distlict of 
New York, nor does she identify any meaningful ties to the fil·ea. And most importantly, tl1e 
defendant's memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her own 
fmfil1ces or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Comt the ve1y information 
that would info1m any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant - and 
which the Government submits would reveal the defendant's financial means to flee and live 
comfo1tably abroad for the rest of her life.

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 4 of 19 
Finally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic is - and should be - a 
relevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. However, the Bureau of P1isons ("BOP") 
is taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason 
why she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are curTently detained at 
the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") pending hial, including defendants who have medical 
conditions that place them at heightened 1isk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their own 
defense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to 
eve1y prehial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special ti·eahnent she requests. 
TI1e defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties, 
she has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant's crimes seek 
her detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably 
assure the defendant's appearance, the Government urges the Corut to detain her. 
ARGUMENT 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk - the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the sti·ength of the evidence, and the hist01y and characte1istics of the defendant -
weigh sti·ongly in favor of detention, and the defendant's proposed package would do absolutely 
nothing to mitigate those 1isks. 
I. 
The Defendant's Victims Seek Detention 
As the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act (' CVRA"), a crime 
victim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the disti·ict cou1t, 
including proceedings involving release. 
U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). 
Consistent with that 
requirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in c01mection with 
its application for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page48 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 5 of 19 
their client opposes bail for the defendant, and has asked the Government to convey that view to 
the Comt. The Government also expects that one or more victims will exercise their right to be 
heard at the July 14, 2020 hearing in this matter, and will urge the Court not to grant bail. More 
generally, as noted above, the Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the 
victims will be denied justice in this case. That outcome is unacceptable to both the victims and 
the Government. 
II. 
The Government's Case Is Strong 
The defendant's motion argues, in a concluso1y fashion, that the Government's case must 
be weak because the conduct charged occmTed in the 1990s. That argument, which ignores the 
many specific allegations in the Indictment, could not be more wrong. As the superseding 
indictment (the ' Indictment'') makes plain, multiple victims have provided detailed, credible 
evidence of the defendant's criminal conduct. And while that conduct did take place a number of 
years ago, it is unsurprising that the victims have been unable to forget the defendant's predatory 
conduct after all this ti.me, as traumatic childhood experiences often leave indelible marks. The 
recollections of the victims bear striking resemblances that co1rnborate each other and provide 
compelling proof of the defendant's active pa1ticipation in a disturbing scheme to groom and 
sexually abuse mi.nor girls. In addition to compelling victim accounts, as the Government has 
explained, the victims' accounts are co1Toborated by documentary evidence and other witnesses. 
In paiticular, the victims' accom1ts are supported by contemporaneous documents and 
records, such as flight records, diaiy entries, and business records. The powerful testimony of 
these victims, who had strikingly similar experiences with Maxwell, together with documentary

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 6 of 19 
evidence and witness testimony, will conclusively establish that the defendant groomed the victims 
for sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. 1 
The defendant's motion alludes to defenses in this case, all of which are legal or procedural 
in nature, and none of which pass muster, let alone counsel in favor of bail. To begin with, the 
notion that the defendant is protected from prosecution by the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
(''NP A") between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida 
(' SDFL") is absurd. That agreement affords her no protection in this District, for at least three 
reasons. First, the defendant was not a paity to that agreement nor named in it as a third-pai·ty 
beneficiaiy, and the defendant offers no basis to think she would have standing to claim any rights 
under the NP A. Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that an agreement 
she was not a paity to ai1d that does not even identify her by naine could possibly be invoked to 
bar her prosecution. Second, ai1d equally i.mpo1tant, the NP A does not bind the Southern District 
of New York, which was not a paity to the agreement. See United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 
672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam) ("A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States 
Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.")); United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 
(2d Cir. 2010). This rnle applies even when the text of the agreement refers to the signing party 
as the "Government." Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. 
Thi.rd, ai1d perhaps most impo1tai1t, even assuming the NP A could be read to protect this 
defendant and bind this Office, which are both legally unsound propositions, the Indictment 
Additionally, and beyond the strong evidence set forth in the Indictment, in just the past week, 
and in response to the chai·ges against the defendant being made public, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI") ai1d the U.S. Attorney's Office have been in touch with additional 
individuals who have expressed a willingness to provide info1mation regai·di.ng the defendant. The 
Government is in the process of receiving and reviewing this additional evidence, which has the 
potential to make the Government's case even stronger.

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 7 of 19 
charges conduct not covered by the NP A, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 
2001 to 2007, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations 
of statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government fu1ther notes that the 
Indictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two 
of the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL, 
and had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2019. 
or is there any force to the defendant's assertion - without explanation, much less legal 
authority - that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its 
opening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, which pe1mits the 
prosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim. 
The defendant's claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in 
law. For similar reasons, the Comt should not give any weight to the defendant's bare assertions 
that the indictment is somehow "legally flawed" in unspecified ways or that the perjmy counts are 
' subject to dismissal" for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at 19. These conclusory 
claims are baseless. 
ill. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight 
As the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant's international ties, 
considerable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is 
fu1ther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite 
its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed fu1ther below, 
the defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The 
defendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that 
would tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page51 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 8 of 19 
appear to depend on any job - or to have depended on any employment in the past 30 years - for 
the privileged lifestyle she has maintained for the entirety of that period. The defendant clearly 
has the means to flee. 
More troubling still, the defendant's conduct at the time of her a1Test fllither underscores 
the risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents anived at the defendant's remote prope1ty in New 
Hampshire on the morning of July 2, 2020, they discovered the prope1ty was barred by a locked 
gate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later dete1mined to be 
a private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they 
announced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a 
window, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee 
to another room in the house, quickly shutting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced 
to breach the door in order to enter the house to aiTest the defendai1t, who was found in an interior 
room in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also 
noticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effo1t to evade 
detection, not by the press or public, which of comse would have no ability to trace her phone or 
intercept her communications, but by law enforcement. 
Following the defendant's ai-rest, the FBI spoke with the secmity guai·d, who informed the 
agents that the defendant's brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of 
the British militaiy to guard the defendai1t at the New Hainpshire prope1ty, in rotations. The 
defendant provided one of the guai·ds with a credit card in the saine naine as the LLC that had 
pmchased the New Hainpshire prope1ty in cash. The guard info1med the FBI that the defendant 
had not left the prope1ty during his time working there, and that instead, the guai·d was sent to 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page52 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 9 of 19 
make purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be 
no question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding. 
The defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by 
arguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press attention. This argument entirely 
misses the point. First, the defendant's conduct is clearly relevant to the Court's assessment of her 
risk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so 
indefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be attributed solely to her desire 
to avoid media attention, that should give the Corut se1ious concerns about what steps she would 
be willing to take to avoid federal p1ison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures 
to conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this Distiict - and after the Government announced 
that its investigation into Epstein's co-conspirators was ongoing - cannot be ignored. To the 
contrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also 
sought to evade detection by law enforcement. 
In attempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant 
points to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government's 
investigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the countly during an 
ongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world 
of ditforence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts 
by a federal grand jruy. The defendant now faces the reality of se1ious charges, suppo1ted by 
significant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in p1ison. The return of the 
indictment fundamentally alters the defendant's incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far 
beyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation ( one the defendant may have 
wrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page53 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 10 of 19 
spent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before 
her aiTest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had gotten away with her crimes. That 
illusion has now been shattered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources 
to flee. 
Moreover, the defendant's willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct, 
including some of the conduct chai·ged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her t:J.ue motive has 
been and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather tha11 to avoid the media. 
As alleged in the Indictment, in 2016, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address 
her conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies ai·e, of course, 
the subject of two counts of pe1jury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to 
protect herself. l11e defenda11t's lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about tlusting 
this defendant to comply with conditions of bail. 
IV. 
The Defendant's Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance 
In its opening memora11dum, the Government highlighted the defonda11t's extensive mea11S 
to flee and her opaque finances. In her respo11Se, the defenda11t's brief provides zero information 
about her assets in the United States or abroad. l11e Court should be t:J.·oubled by this. First, so 
far as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty 
of pe1jury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Cou1t has no reliable 
insight into the magnitude or scope of the defenda11t's resources.2 However, what the Court does 
have ai·e st:J.·ong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large 
prope1ty she was found on, the private security guai·d being retained to live with her on that 
The Government understands from Pret:J.·ial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has 
less than a million dollai·s in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed 
below, the Cou1t should have se1ious pause before accepting this unverified info1mation. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page54 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 11 of 19 
prope1ty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral. 
Indeed, it is revealing that the defendant's memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets 
to which she plainly has access. Without knowing the full scope of the defendant's fmancial 
resources, it would be impossible for the Comt to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of 
bail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has 
met her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed 
to provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of pe1jmy. 
Although the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the 
defendant's continued appearance, the defendant's proposed bail package offers almost no security 
whatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and 
is a citizen of a countly that does not exti·adite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged 
with serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors - and yet, she asks the Comt to 
grant her bail secured only by a foreign prope1ty, which provides effectively no security at all. 
Indeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has 
not offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she 
offers as security a foreign prope1ty, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical matter, the 
Government has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail 
fodeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen's assets abroad or sell property 
in another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be 
required to attempt to litigate a property dispute in another countly, with a lengthy process and an 
uncertain outcome. 
Additionally, the defendant proffers no info1mation about her proposed co-signers other 
than that they are friends and relatives - in particular, she provides no infmmation about the assets 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page55 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 12 of 19 
of those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to 
collect from them. Nor does she provide information sufficient to know whether her proposed 
co-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant's freedom 
for 5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant's means. In any event, as 
fu1ther described below, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-
signers whole if she were to flee. 
l11e defendant's failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial 
information about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jani.ng because she appears to 
have access to millions of dollars, p1i.ncipally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant 
has been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the "Swiss Bank") and multiple 
accounts with at least one bank headquaitered in Englai1d (the "English Bailk"). In 2018 ai1d 2019, 
Form 114 (' FBAR") submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury 
Depaitment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over 2 million. 
In cmmection with the Swiss Bank, the defendai1t appeai·s to be the grai1tor of a trust account 
(the "Trust Account") with a balance in June 2020 of more thai1 4 million. Among other 
transactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately 500,000 in Mai·ch 2019 
from one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trnst Account, and records fruther reflect a 
trai1sfer between those same accounts in June 2019 of more than 750,000. The Trustees of the 
tlust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevai1t Trnst Account 
documents, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally, 
the defendant was aiTested last week at a prope1ty in New Hampshire that was purchased for more 
than 1 million in cash in December 2019. It is unknown whether the defendai1t purchased the 
prope1ty in cash, or whether she has a wealthy patron who did so on her behalf, but either scenario

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 13 of 19 
should raise concerns about the defendant's access to financial resources that would enable her to 
flee. 
Moreover, and as set fo1th in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been 
associated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2016 to the present, and during that period, 
the maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded 20 million. l110se accounts 
engaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently 
as 2019. To the extent the defendant now refuses to account for her ownership of or access to vast 
wealth, it is not because it does not exist - it is because she is attempting to hide it. 
l11e defendant's proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the 
Comt. In pruticular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to 
prevent the defendru1t's flight after it has been removed At best, home confinement ru1d electronic 
monitoring would reduce her head strut should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United 
States v. Banki, 10 Cr. 008 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21 , 2010) (denying bail to a naturalized 
citizen who was native to Irru1, who was single ru1d childless ru1d who faced a statutory maximum 
of20 years' imprisonment, ru1d noting that electronic monitoring is "hru·dly foolproof."), aff'd, 369

l11e defendant has no children in the United States, she does not reside with any immediate 
family members, and while the Government does not dispute that she is close with several of her 
siblings, as her time in hiding makes cleru·, she is cleru·ly capable of maintaining those relationships 
remotely, which of comse she could continue to do from abroad. Moreover, she has citizenship in

a country that does not extr·adite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has eve1y 
motivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. 
Supp. 3d 246, 255 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) ("l TJhe combination of Defendant's alleged deceptive actions, 
access to substantial financial resources, frequent international tr·avel, complete lack of ties to the 
United States, and extensive ties to foreign countr·ies without extr·adition demonstr·ates Defendant 
poses a serious risk of flight.") (citing United States v. Zarrab, No. 15 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2016 WL 
3681423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2016)). The defendant's proposed bail package is essentially 
nothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to CoUit. Given the gravity of the charged 
crimes, the defendant's substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under 
oath, the CoUit should take the proposed bail package for what it is w01th: nothing. 
V. 
The COVID-19 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant's Release 
Finally, the cmTent pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, comts in 
this district have regularly rejected applications for release based on asse1tions about the 
generalized 1isks of COVID-19. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. 19 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2020 
WL 1847914, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2020) (Gardephe, J.) (denying bail application by defendant

(' lBJecause there is a pandemic does not mean that the jailhouse doors ought to be thrown 
open")). Significantly, tl1e defendant has not claimed tl1at she is at a higher 1isk from COVID-19

than any other inmate at the MDC, and thus she cannot claim any greater need for bail than the 
many inmates awaiting trial there.3 
Tue vims, of course, presents new and complex challenges for protecting inmates' health, 
but the BOP generally, and the MDC specifically, are prepared to handle the risks presented by 
COVID-19 and other health issues. The MDC's response to the pandemic was the subject of 
extensive evidentiary hearings in the context of a civil lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York. 
See Chunn v. Edge, No. 20 Cr. 1590, 2020 WL 3055669 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2020). In Chunn, the 
District Comt conducted extensive fact gathering about the conditions at the MDC before 
concluding that "MDC officials have recognized COVID-19 as a serious threat and responded 
aggressively." Id. at *l; see also id at 25 ("The MDC's response to COVID-19 has been 
aggressive and has included, among other steps, massively restricting movement within the 
facility, enhancing sanitation protocols, and creating quarantine and isolation units. And the data-
though limited-suggests that these measures have been quite effective in containing COVID-19 
thus far."). 
Numerous judges in this District have rejected applications for release based on asse1tions 
about the hypothetical risks of COVID-19, including multiple cases involving defendants who, 
unlike this defendant, suffer from underlying health conditions. See, e.g., United States v. Hanes-
Calugaru, No. 19 Cr. 651, ECF No. 257 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2020) (Swain, J.) (denying pre-trial 
bail application by defendant who was on MDC's initial high-risk list but subsequently removed 
following new CDC guidance (see ECF Nos. 239, 242, 257)); United States v. Cuny, 19 Cr. 742,

The defendant also argues that the circumstances of the pandemic would pose a ' significant 
hurdle" to the defendant's ability to flee. Opposition Memorandum at 16. Tue Government 
submits that the defendant has the means and resources to find her way out of the country, and a 
sho1t quarantine pe1iod abroad would be a small price to pay to avoid years in p1ison.

inmates because of the spread of the COVID-19 virus). As the foregoing citations make clear, the 
defendants in many of these cases asse1ted underlying health conditions that purpo1tedly placed 
them at heightened 1isk with respect to COVID-19, but cou1ts nevertheless denied their

applications in view of the applicable factors under the Bail Reform Act. This Court should reach 
the same conclusion based on the extraordinaiy risk of flight described in detail above. 
The defendant's argument that bail is required for her to prepare her defense is equally 
unpersuasive. Judges in this district have repeatedly held that the current restrictions on inmate 
access to counsel do not waiTant releasing defendants who should othe1wise be detained under the 
Bail Refo1m Act. See United States v. Tolentino, 20 Cr. 007 (DLC), 2020 WL 1862670, at *2

This Comt's decision in Stephens does not compel a different result here. In that case, this 
Comt concluded that bail was necessaiy in order to permit the defendant to prepare for a significant 
heaiing, which was scheduled for six days later. United States v. Stephens, No. 15 Cr. 95 (AJN), 
2020 WL 1295155, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mai·. 19, 2020) (finding that the limitations on the defenda11t's 
access to counsel "impacts the Defenda11t's ability to prepare his defenses to the alleged violation 
of supervised release in advance of the merits hea1ing scheduled for March 25, 2020."). By 
contrast, no evidentiaiy heai·ings have been requested, much less scheduled, in this case, and a trial 
date has not yet been set. See United States v. Gon:::,a/e:::,, No. 19 Cr. 906 (JMF), 2020 WL 1911209,

at * 1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2020) ("Gonzalez fails to demonstrate that temporaiy release is 
'necessaiy' for the prepai·ation of his defense because, among other things, his trial is not scheduled 
for another five months."); United States v. Eley, No. 20 Cr. 78 (AT), 2020 WL 1689773, at * 1 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2020) ("Defendant's request for release is not compelled under the Sixth 
Amendment; with trial scheduled for nine months from now, this case is distinguishable from other 
instances in which an imminent evidentiai·y hearing may supp01t a defendant's temporai·y 
release."). 
In fact, the defenda11t's own motion makes cleai· that the MDC has been responsive to 
defense counsel's concerns and has ensured that they have access to their client. As their motion 
notes, the MDC provided defense counsel with access to their client within three hours of a request 
eai·lier this week, despite having zero notice a11d receiving the request after close of business in the 
evening. See Opposition Memora11dum at 12. For non-emergencies, defense counsel ca11 avail 
themselves of the scheduling system that has been instituted at the MDC to request regulai· calls 
with their client a11d will be able to coordinate with MDC legal counsel should an urgent need 
a11se.

CONCLUSION 
As set fo1th above, the defendant is an extreme risk of flight. l11e Government respectfully 
submits that the defendant cannot meet her burden of overcoming the statuto1y presumption in 
favor of detention. l11ere are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in 
corut proceedings in this case. Accordingly, any application for bail should be denied.

THE COURT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  This is
Judge Nathan presiding.
This is United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 
330.   
I will take appearances from counsel, beginning with 
counsel for the defendant. 
MS. MOE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Mark Cohen,
Cohen & Gresser, for Ms. Maxwell.  Also appearing with me today
is my partner Chris Everdell of Cohen & Gresser and Jeff
Pagliuca and Laura Menninger of the Haddon Morgan firm.  Good
afternoon, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen.  
And for the government. 
MS. MOE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Alison Moe for
the government.  I'm joined by my colleagues Maurene Comey and
Alex Rossmiller.  And also, with the court's permission, we
learned that the executive staff for the U.S. Attorney's office
were unfortunately not able to Connecticut at the overflow
dial-in so, with the court's permission, we would like to dial
them in from a phone here if that's acceptable to the court.
THE COURT:  The last word, the overflow dial-in was
not full.  Just a moment and we will make sure that they can
connect in.
And let me say good afternoon, Ms. Maxwell, as well. 
THE DEFENDANT:  Good afternoon, Judge.

THE COURT:  Ms. Maxwell, are you able to hear me and
see me okay?
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, thank you.
THE COURT:  And are you able to hear Mr. Cohen and
counsel for the United States as well?
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  All right.  If at any point you have
difficulty with any of the technology, you can let someone
there know right away, let me know, and we will pause the
proceedings before going any further.  Okay?
THE DEFENDANT:  Thank you, Judge.
THE COURT:  All right.
Just a minute while we check on the call-in line.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
(Pause)
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, apologies.  We have also heard
from colleagues in the office that the line is full.  We have,
however, been able to dial in the executive staff to a phone
number here and my understanding is that they can hear and
participate that way, if that's acceptable to the court.  But
of course we defer to the court's preference.
THE COURT:  We are concerned about feedback from being
on a speakerphone in that room.  The phone number for
nonspeaking co-counsel that was provided, that line is not
full, and I would assume the executive leadership of the office

            (212) 805-0300

falls within that category, so they may call in to that number.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.  We will do
that.
THE COURT:  All right.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.  Then we will go
ahead and proceed.
I have called the case.  I have taken appearances.
Counsel, let me please have oral confirmation that the court
reporter is on the line.
THE COURT REPORTER:  Good afternoon, your Honor.
Kristen Carannante.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon, and thank you so much.
We also have on the audio line Pretrial Services
Officer Leah Harmon and -- 
THE PRETRIAL SERVICES OFFICER:  Hello, your Honor.
Good afternoon.
THE COURT:  Good afternoon.  Thank you.
We are here today for the arraignment, the initial
scheduling conference, and bail hearing in this matter.
As everyone knows, we are in the middle of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  I am conducting this proceeding remotely, 
pursuant to the authority provided by Section 15002 of the 
CARES Act and the standing orders issued by our Chief Judge 
pursuant to that act.

            (212) 805-0300

I am proceeding by videoconference, which I am
accessing remotely.  Defense counsel and counsel for the
government are appearing remotely via videoconference and the
defendant, Ms. Maxwell, is accessing this videoconference from
the MDC in Brooklyn.
Ms. Maxwell, I did confirm that you could hear me and
see me; and, again, if at any point you have any difficulty
with the technology, please let me know right away.  Okay?
THE DEFENDANT:  Thank you, your Honor.  I will do
that.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  And if at any point you would
like to speak privately with Mr. Cohen, let me know that right
away, and we will move you and your counsel into a private
breakout room where nobody else will be able to see or hear
your conversation, okay?
THE DEFENDANT:  Again, thank you, your Honor.  I
appreciate that.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Mr. Cohen, likewise, should you request to speak with
Ms. Maxwell privately, don't hesitate to say that.
MR. COHEN:  Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  We will turn now to the waiver of physical
presence.  I did receive a signed waiver of physical presence
form dated July 10, 2020.
Mr. Cohen, could you please is describe the process by
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page68 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
which you discussed with Ms. Maxwell her right to be present
and the indication of her knowing and voluntary waiver of that
right provided on this form.
MR. COHEN:  Yes, your Honor.  We, given the press of
time, we were not able to physically get the form to our
client, but my partner Chris Everdell and I went through it
with her, read it to her, and she gave us authorization to sign
on her behalf and that's reflected on the form in the boxes
where indicated, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  Ms. Maxwell, is that an accurate
account of what occurred?
THE DEFENDANT:  That is completely accurate, your
Honor.  Yes.
THE COURT:  And you have had the form read to you or
you have it physically now at this point?  
THE DEFENDANT:  That is correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And you have had time to discuss it
with your attorney?
THE DEFENDANT:  I have, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And do you continue to wish to
waive your right to be physically present and instead to
proceed today by this videoconference proceeding?
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  I do find a knowing and
voluntary waiver of the right to be physically present for this
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page69 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
arraignment, scheduling conference, and bail hearing.
Counsel, as you know, to proceed remotely today, in
addition to the finding I have just made, I must also find that
today's proceeding cannot be further delayed without serious
harms to the interests of justice.
Ms. Moe, does the government wish to be heard on that? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The government submits that proceeding remotely in 
this fashion would protect the interests of the parties and the 
safety in view of the pandemic.  We further submit that this 
proceeding can be conducted remotely with full participation of 
the parties in view of the preparation and steps everyone has 
taken to ensure proper participation. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Mr. Cohen?
MR. COHEN:  Your Honor, we have agreed to proceed
remotely as your Honor just laid out.
THE COURT:  Okay.  I do find that today's proceeding
cannot be further delayed without serious harms to the
interests of justice for, among other reasons, that the
defendant, who is currently detained, seeks release on bail.
The final preliminary matter I will address is public
access to the proceeding, which has garnered significant public
interest.  As I have indicated in prior orders, the court has
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page70 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
arranged for a live video feed of this proceeding to be set up
in the jury assembly room at the courthouse.  This is the
largest room available and, with appropriate social distancing,
it can safely accommodate 60 people.  The court has further
provided a live video feed to the press room at the courthouse
where additional members of the credentialed in-house press
corps can watch and hear the proceeding.
Additionally, the court has provided a live audio feed
for members of the public.  My prior order indicated that the
line can accommodate 500 callers, but with thanks of the court
staff, that capacity has been increased to 1,000 callers.
Lastly, the court has provided through counsel a
separate call-in line to ensure audio access to nonspeaking
co-counsel, any alleged victims identified by the government,
including those who wish to be heard on the question of
pretrial detention, and any family members of the defendant.
That line is operational now as well.
Counsel, beginning with Mr. Cohen, any objection to
these arrangements regarding public access?
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Then I will make the following findings:
First, COVID-19 constitutes a substantial, if not 
overriding, reason that supports the court's approach to access 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page71 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
in this case.  As the chief judge of the district has 
recognized in order number 20MC176, COVID-19 remains a national 
emergency that restricts normal operations of the courts.  
Conducting this proceeding in person is not safely feasible.   
Second, the measures taken by the court are no broader 
than necessary to address the challenges posed by the pandemic.  
Although the number of seats in the jury assembly room is 
limited to 60, it is necessary to do so for public and 
courthouse staff safety and is closely equivalent to the number 
of people who would be able to watch an in-court proceeding in 
a regular-sized courtroom.  The number of people who will be 
able to hear the live audio of this proceeding far exceeds 
access under normal in-person circumstances.   
Lastly, given the safety and technology limitations, 
there are no reasonable alternatives to the measures the court 
has taken.   
Accordingly, the access provided is fully in accord 
with the First and Sixth Amendment public trial rights. 
With those preliminary matters out of the way,
counsel, I propose we turn to the arraignment.
Ms. Moe, am I correct that this is an arraignment on
the S1 superseding indictment?
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Can you explain what the difference is
between the S1 and the original indictment?
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page72 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The difference is a small ministerial correction, a 
reference to a civil docket number contained in the perjury 
counts, which are Counts Five and Six of the superseding 
indictment.  Aside from the alteration of those docket numbers, 
the reference to them, there are no other changes to the 
indictment. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Again, I will conduct the
arraignment on the S1 indictment.
Ms. Maxwell, have you seen a copy of the S1 indictment
in this matter?
THE DEFENDANT:  I saw the original indictment, your
Honor.  The original --
THE COURT:  Okay.
All right.  Mr. Cohen, did you have an opportunity to 
discuss with Ms. Maxwell the ministerial change that was 
completed by way of the superseding indictment? 
MR. COHEN:  Yes, yes, Judge.  We have, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Any objection to proceeding on the
arraignment of the S1 indictment, Mr. Cohen?
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.
Ms. Maxwell, have you had an opportunity to discuss
the indictment in this case with your attorney?
THE DEFENDANT:  I have, your Honor.
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page73 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
THE COURT:  All right.
(Indiscernible crosstalk)  
THE COURT:  Go ahead.
THE DEFENDANT:  No.  I said I have been able to
discuss it, your Honor, with my attorney.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
You are entitled to have the indictment read to you 
here in this open court proceeding or you can waive the public 
reading.  Do you waive the public reading? 
THE DEFENDANT:  I do, your Honor.  I do waive -- 
THE COURT:  How do you wish to -- 
THE DEFENDANT:  -- your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you.  And how do you wish to plead
to the charge?
THE DEFENDANT:  Not guilty, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  I will enter a plea of not
guilty to the indictment in this matter.
Counsel, we will turn now to the scheduling
conference.
I would like to begin with a status update from the 
government.  Ms. Moe, you should include in your update a 
description of the status of discovery.  Please describe the 
categories of evidence that will be produced in discovery.  I 
will also ask you to indicate how you will ensure that the 
government will fully and timely meet all of its constitutional 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page74 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
and federal law disclosure obligations.   
Go ahead, Ms. Moe. 
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
With respect to the items that the government 
anticipates will be included in discovery in this case, we 
expect that those materials will include, among other items, 
search warrant returns, copies of search warrants, subpoena 
returns, including business records, photographs, 
electronically stored information from searches conducted on 
electronic devices.  In addition, the materials with respect to 
the core of the case also include prior investigative files 
from another investigation in the Southern District of Florida 
among other items.   
With respect to the status of discovery, the 
government has begun preparing an initial production and are 
prepared to produce a first batch of discovery as soon as a 
protective order is entered by the court. 
With respect to the status of the proposed protective
order, the government sent defense counsel a proposed
protective order last week.  We have touched base about the
status of that with defense counsel, and they conveyed that
they would like to continue reviewing and discussing it with
the government, which we plan to do shortly after this
conference, with an eye towards submitting a proposed
protective order to the court as soon as possible.  Following
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page75 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
the entry of that protective order, as I noted, your Honor, the
government is prepared to make a substantial production of
discovery.
Your Honor, in advance of the conference, the
government and defense counsel proposed a joint schedule for
discovery, motion practice, and a proposed trial date, in
particular, the date selected in that schedule with an eye
towards assuring that there was sufficient time for the
government to do a careful and exhaustive and thorough review
of all of the materials that I just referenced to make sure
that the government is complying with its discovery obligations
in this case, which we take very seriously.  We expect that the
bulk of the relevant materials will be produced in short order,
primarily by the end of this summer, with additional materials
to follow primarily in a category I mentioned before, your
Honor, of electronically stored information, which is subject
to an ongoing privilege review which we discussed and
communicated with defense counsel about.  We have proposed a
scheduling order again to be very thorough in our review of
discovery and in files in various places where they may be
located and we are taking an expansive and thoughtful approach
to our obligations in this case, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Let me just follow up specifically, since
you have referenced prior investigative files, to the extent we
have seen in other matters issues with complete disclosure of
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page76 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
materials, it has been in some instances due to precisely that
factor.  So has there been a plan developed to ensure that down
the road we are not hearing that there were delays or problems
with discovery as a result of the fact that part of the
disclosure obligation here includes materials from other
investigative files?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The files in particular that I am referring to are the 
files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in connection 
with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.  The 
physical files themselves were shipped to New York and are at 
the New York F.B.I. office.  They have been imaged and scanned 
and photographed to make sure that a comprehensive review can 
be conducted, and they are physically in New York so that we 
can have access to those files.  And again, as we have heard in 
ongoing information, we are particularly thoughtful about those 
concerns given the history of this case and the volume of 
materials and the potential sensitivities, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Beyond the paper files which you have just
indicated, the physical files, have you charted a path for
determining whether there is any other additional information
that must be disclosed?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, just to clarify, is your
question with respect to the previous investigation or -- I
apologize, your Honor.  I wasn't sure what you meant.
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page77 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
THE COURT:  Among other things, but, yes, I'm drilling
down specifically on that since that has been, in somewhat
comparable circumstances in other matters, the source of issues
related to timely disclosures.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Our team met personally
with the F.B.I. in Florida to make sure that we had the
materials, and it was represented to us that the materials that
the F.B.I. provided in Florida were the comprehensive set of
materials.  We will certainly have ongoing conversations to
make sure that that is the case and if, in our review of files,
we discover other materials, we will handle that with great
care, and we are particularly sensitive to that concern.
THE COURT:  And I expect here, and in all matters, not
just accepting of initial representations made regarding full
disclosure, but thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of
questions and issues with respect to actively retrieving any
appropriate files.  Are we on the same page, Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Very much so.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
With that, why don't you go ahead and lay out the
proposed schedule that you have discussed with Mr. Cohen, and
then I will hear from Mr. Cohen if he has any concerns with
that proposal.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
We would propose the completion of discovery, to 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page78 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
include electronic materials, to be due by Monday, November 9 
of this year, and following that we would propose the following 
motion schedule: that defense motions be due by Monday, 
December 21 of this year; that the government's response be due 
on Friday, January 22, 2021; and that replies be due on Friday, 
February 5, 2021. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Cohen, based on the
government's description of both the quantity and quality of
discovery, is that schedule that's been laid out sufficient
from your perspective to do everything that you need to do?
MR. COHEN:  Your Honor, just two points in that
regard.  I think counsel for the government did not mention in
the e-mail we had sent to your Honor's law clerk that August 21
would be the deadline for production of search warrant
applications and the subpoena returns.  I think she just failed
to mention it for the record.  That would also be part of the
schedule.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Ms. Moe, do you agree? 
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.  I apologize.
We did include that in the e-mail to your Honor's chambers, and
that is correct.
And thank you, counsel, for clarifying that. 
MR. COHEN:  Two additional points, your Honor.  The
trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page79 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
the court's approval, assumes there will be no substantive
superseding indictment.  If there is one, which the government
has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I assume not
at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not
just trial schedule but other schedule as well.
And I am assuming -- we take your Honor's points about
the issues on discovery, and we agree with them, particularly
as to electronic discovery; and I am assuming that, as this
unfolds, if we spot an issue we think needs further attention,
we will be able to bring it to the court's attention.
Those are my points. 
THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Cohen.
Let me go ahead and ask, Ms. Moe, Mr. Cohen has made a 
representation but I will ask if you do anticipate at this time 
filing any further superseding indictments adding either 
defendants or additional charges? 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, our investigation remains
ongoing, but at this point we do not currently anticipate
seeking a superseding indictment.
THE COURT:  All right.  So with that -- and also let
me ask, Ms. Moe, just because it is next on my list, what
processes the government has put in place to notify alleged
victims of events and court dates pursuant to the Crime Victims
Rights Act.
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  I am happy to give the
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page80 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
courts details about the process we used for notification for
this conference and also what we anticipate to use going
forward.
So to begin with, the government notified relevant
victims or their counsel immediately following the arrest of
the defendant on July 2 about the fact of the arrest and the
initial presentment scheduled for later that day.
In advance of the initial presentment, those victims 
were provided the opportunity to participate through the 
court's protocol for appearances in New Hampshire.   
On July 7, the court set a date for arraignment and 
bail hearing on July 14, today, and by the following day from 
the court's order, the government had notified relevant victims 
or their counsel of that scheduling order and advised victims 
and counsel of their right to be heard in connection with the 
bail hearing.   
On that same day, the government posted to its victim 
services website, including a link to the indictment, as well 
as scheduling information relating to the hearing.   
On July 9, the government updated the website to 
include the dial-in information that the court provided.   
In addition, on July 8, the government sent letter 
notifications to individuals who have identified themselves as 
victims of Ghislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein that were not 
specifically referenced in the indictment.   
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page81 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
Our process going forward, as we noted in that letter 
to victims, is that we will use an opt-in process so we will 
not notify individuals who do not wish to receive additional 
notifications but will continue to provide ongoing information 
about upcoming conferences and relevant details on the 
government's victim services website. 
With respect to this specific hearing, the government
has been advised by counsel to three victims of their interest
in being heard in connection with today's bail proceeding.  One
victim's views are expressed in the government's reply
memorandum; one victim has submitted a statement to the
government and asked that the government read it during today's
proceedings; and one victim has asked to be heard directly, and
the government anticipates that she will make a statement at
any time during this proceeding as necessitated by the court.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Then, with that, returning to the schedule that you 
have laid out, and I thank counsel for conferring in advance, 
as to a proposed schedule, Mr. Cohen, let me just finalize if 
you agree to the proposed schedule that has been laid out by 
Ms. Moe and supplemented by you? 
MR. COHEN:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
And, Ms. Moe, you continue to support the proposed 
schedule? 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page82 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Then I will set the schedule
as jointly proposed by counsel.  To reiterate, I am setting --
let me ask, Ms. Moe, if we are going to proceed to trial, how
long of a trial does the government anticipate?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, the government anticipates that
its case in chief would take no more than two weeks.  But in
terms of the length of time to block out a trial date, in an
abundance of caution, in view of the need for jury selection
and the defense case, we would propose blocking three weeks for
trial.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
With that, I will adopt the schedule.  I hereby set
trial to commence on July 12, 2021, with the following pretrial
schedule:
Initial nonelectronic disclosure generally, to include
search warrant applications and subpoena returns, to be due by
Friday, August 21, 20.
Completion of discovery, to include electronic
materials, to be due by Monday November 9, 2020.
Any initial pretrial defense motions, based on the
indictment or disclosure material and the like to be due by
Monday, December 21, 2020.
If any motions are filed, the government's response 
due by Friday, January 22, 2021.   
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page83 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
Any replies due by Friday, February 5, 2021.   
If any motions seek an evidentiary hearing, I will 
reach out, chambers will reach out to schedule an evidentiary 
hearing.   
And, as indicated, trial to commence on July 12, 2021.   
In advance of trial, following motion practice, the 
court will put out a schedule regarding pretrial submissions, 
including in limine motions and the like. 
With that, counsel, other matters to discuss regarding
scheduling?
Mr. Cohen? 
MR. COHEN:  Not at this time, your Honor, not from the
defense at this time.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  Nothing further from the government
regarding scheduling, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Okay.  And, Ms. Moe, does the government
seek to exclude time under the Speedy Trial Act?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  In view of the schedule
and the interests of producing discovery and permitting time
for the defense to review discovery, contemplate any motions
and pursue those motions, the government would seek to exclude
time from today's date until our trial date as court set forth
today.
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page84 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
THE COURT:  Mr. Cohen, any objection?
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  I will exclude time from today's
date until July 12, 2021, which I have said is a firm trial
date.  I do find that the ends of justice served by excluding
this time outweigh the interests of the public and the
defendant in a speedy trial.  The time is necessary for the
production of discovery and view of that by defense, time for
the defense to consider and prepare any available motions and,
in the absence of resolution of the case, time for the parties
to prepare for trial.
To Ms. Moe and Mr. Cohen, although I have not set an 
interim status conference in the case, we do have our motion 
schedule, but for both sides, if at any point you wish to be 
before the court for any reason, simply put in a letter and we 
will get something on the calendar as soon as we conceivably 
can.  
With that, Mr. Cohen, let me ask counsel if there is
any reason that we should not turn now to the argument for
bail?
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  All right.  I will hear on that question.
It is the government's motion for detention, so I propose
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page85 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
hearing from the government first, and then any alleged victims
who have indicated that they wish to be heard pursuant to 18
U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), and then I will hear from Mr. Cohen.
Any objection to proceeding thusly, Mr. Cohen? 
MR. COHEN:  No, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
Your Honor, as we set forth in our moving papers, the
government strongly believes that this defendant poses an
extreme risk of flight.  Pretrial Services has recommended
detention, the victims seek detention, and the government
respectfully submits that the defendant should be detained
pending trial.
Your Honor, there are serious red flags here.  The
defendant has significant financial means.  It appears that she
has been less than candid with Pretrial Services.  She has not
come close to thoroughly disclosing her finances to the court.
She has strong international ties and appears to have the
ability to live beyond the reach of extradition.  She has few,
if any, community ties, much less a stable residence that she
can propose to the court to be bailed to.  And she has a strong
incentive to flee to avoid being held accountable for her
crimes.
Because the defendant is charged with serious offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors, your Honor, there is a 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page86 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
legal presumption that there are no conditions that could 
reasonably assure her return to court and, your Honor, the 
defendant has not come anywhere close to rebutting that 
presumption. 
Turning first to the nature and seriousness of the
offense and the strength of the evidence, the indictment in
this case arises from the defendant's role in transporting
minors for unlawful sexual activity and enticing minors to
travel to engage in unlawful sexual active and participating in
a conspiracy to do the same.  The indictment further charges
that the defendant perjured herself, that she lied under oath
to conceal her crimes.
Your Honor, the charged conduct in this case is
disturbing and the nature and circumstances of the offense are
very serious.  The defendant is charged with participating in a
conspiracy to sexually exploit the vulnerable members of our
community.  In order to protect the privacy of the victims, I'm
not going to go into details, your Honor, about the particular
victims beyond what's contained in the indictment and our
briefing; but, as the indictment alleges, the defendant enticed
and groomed girls who were as young as 14 years old for sexual
abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, a man who she knew was a predator
with a preference for underaged girls.  The indictment alleges
that the defendant participated in some of these acts of abuse
herself, including sexualized massages in which the victims
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page87 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
were sometimes partially or fully nude.  She also encouraged
these minors to engage in additional acts of abuse with Jeffrey
Epstein.  The indictment makes plain, your Honor, this was not
a single incident or a single victim or anything isolated but,
instead, it was an ongoing scheme to abuse multiple victims for
a pattern of years.  This is exceptionally serious conduct.
Given the strength of the government's evidence and
the serious charges in the indictment, there is an incredibly
strong incentive for the defendant to flee, an incentive for
her to become at that fugitive to avoid being held accountable
and to avoid a lengthy prison sentence.
The history and characteristics of the defendant 
underscores the risk of flight that she poses.  The Pretrial 
Services report confirms that the defendant has been moving 
from place to place for some time, your Honor; and most 
recently it appears that she spent the last year making 
concerted efforts to conceal her whereabouts whilst moving 
around New England, most recently to New Hampshire, which I 
will discuss momentarily with respect to that particular --  
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe? 
MS. MOE:  -- property.
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe, there is one assertion in the
defense papers that I don't think I have seen the government's
response to, and that is the contention that Ms. Maxwell,
through counsel, kept in touch with the government since the
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page88 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
arrest of Mr. Epstein.  Is that accurate and did that include
information as to her whereabouts?
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, that information did not include
information about her whereabouts for starters; and, second,
your Honor, the defendant's communications through counsel with
the government began when the government served the defendant
with a grand jury subpoena following the arrest of Jeffrey
Epstein.  So it is unsurprising that her counsel reached out to
the government, which is in the ordinary course when an
investigation becomes overt.
The government's communications with defense counsel 
have been minimal during the pendency of this investigation.  
Without getting into the substance, those contacts have not 
been substantial, your Honor.  And to the court's question, 
they certainly have not included any information about 
defendant's whereabouts. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
It appears that the defendant has insufficient ties to
motivate her to remain in the United States.  With respect to
her family circumstances, she does not have children, she does
not appear to reside with any immediate family members, and she
doesn't have any employment that would require her to remain in
the United States.
But, by contrast, she has extensive international 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page89 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
ties.  While she is a naturalized citizen of the United States, 
she is a citizen of France and the United Kingdom.  She grew up 
in the United Kingdom and has a history of extensive 
international travel.  She owns a property in the 
United Kingdom.  Your Honor, there is a real concern here that 
the defendant could live beyond the reach of extradition 
indefinitely.   
The government has spoken with the Department of 
Justice attachés in the United Kingdom and France.   
With respect to France, we have been informed that 
France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States 
as a matter of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of 
the United States.   
As well, we have been informed that there is an 
extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United 
States.  The extradition process would be lengthy, the outcome 
would be uncertain, and it's very likely that the defendant 
would not be detained during the pendency of such an 
extradition proceeding.   
Those circumstances raise real concerns here.  
Particularly because the defendant appears to have the 
financial means to live beyond the reach of extradition 
indefinitely.  As we detailed in our briefing, your Honor, the 
defendant appears to have access to significant and 
undetermined and undisclosed wealth.   
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page90 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
In addition to the financial information described in 
the government's memoranda, we note, your Honor, that in the 
Pretrial Services report it appears that the defendant tried 
initially to brush off the subject of her finances when the 
Pretrial Services officer asked her, noting that she didn't 
have those details.  The defendant ultimately provided limited, 
unverified, and questionable information that now appears in 
the Pretrial Services report.  She listed bank accounts 
totaling less than a million dollars and a monthly income of 
nothing.  Zero dollars per month of income.   
In addition to the matter of her finances, the report 
raises other concerns about whether the defendant has been 
fully transparent with the court or whether she is being 
evasive. 
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe, you have emphasized the
indication on the financial report of zero dollars of the
income.  Does the government think that there is income?  Is
there some uncertainty as to whether that is investment income
as opposed to employment income or the like?  What is the
reason for the emphasis on that or to the extent it is an
indication that the government finds that implausible?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
Separate from the matter of employment, it is very 
unclear whether the defendant is receiving proceeds from trust 
accounts or an inheritance or means of other kinds.  It is 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page91 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of 
assets and no other stream of income, especially given the 
lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the 
Pretrial Services report.  It just doesn't make sense.  Either 
there are other assets or there is other income.  We can't make 
sense of this lifestyle and this set of financial disclosures.  
This just doesn't make sense.  And as I will detail in a 
moment, your Honor, it is inconsistent with the limited 
reference we have been able to obtain as we have been making an 
effort to trace the defendant's finances.   
On that subject, your Honor, the report does raise 
concerns about whether the defendant has been fully transparent 
about her finances.  As one example, the defendant told 
Pretrial Services that the New Hampshire property was owned by 
a corporation, that she does not know the name of the 
corporation, but that she was just permitted to stay in the 
house.  It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming 
answer because it is implausible on its face and very 
confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the 
circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire 
property.   
This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent 
who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that 
transaction in New Hampshire.  The real estate agent told the 
F.B.I. that the buyers to the house introduced themselves to 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page92 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
her as Scott and Janet Marshall, who both have British accents.  
Scott Marshall told her that the -- that he was retired from 
the British military and he was currently working on writing a 
book.  Janet Marshall described herself as a journalist who 
wants privacy.  they told the agent they wanted to purchase the 
property quickly through a wire and that they were setting up 
an LLC.  Those conversations took place in November 2019.  Your 
Honor, following the defendant's arrest, the real estate agent 
saw a photograph of the defendant in the media and realized 
that the person who had introduced herself as Janet Marshall, 
who had toured the house and participated in these 
conversations about the purchase, was the defendant, Ghislaine 
Maxwell.   
That series of facts, which I just learned about this 
morning, your Honor, are concerning for two reasons.  First, 
additionally, it appears that the defendant has attempted to 
conceal an asset from the court, and at the very least she has 
not been forthcoming in the course of her Pretrial Services 
interview; and, second, it appears that the defendant has used 
an alias and that she was willing to lie to hide herself and 
hide her identity and we discussed the additional indicia in 
our briefing your Honor.  So that raises real concerns. 
Moreover, the defendant's claims about her finances to
Pretrial Services should be concerning to the court for
additional reasons.
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page93 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
THE COURT:  I'm sorry, Ms. Moe, if I may pause you
before moving on from those points.
There is a basic dispute within the papers as to, I 
think, efforts similar to the ones you have described that are 
efforts to hide from authorities, which would certainly be an 
indication of risk of flight or whether, in light of the 
notoriety and public interest that the case has generated 
following the indictment of Mr. Epstein, whether it was an 
effort to protect privacy and hide from press for privacy 
reasons.   
How does the government suggest that that factual 
determination be resolved, if you agree that it should, and 
what is your general response to the veracity of that 
assertion? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
As we discussed in our reply brief, your Honor, in our
view, there is no question these circumstances are relevant to
the court's determination with respect to bail for a number of
reasons.
The first is, irrespective of the defendant's motive, 
these facts make clear to the court that the defendant has the 
ability to live in hiding, that she is good at it, that she is 
willing to do it even if it compromises her relationship and 
contacts with other people and, as the information provided by 
the real estate agent underscores, she is good at it and that 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page94 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
she passes.  In other words, even though, as defense claims, 
that she is widely known, that there is press everywhere, she 
was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate 
transaction under a fake name and not be detected.  So there 
really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie 
about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the 
means to do so.  All of those things should be extremely 
concerning to the court, your Honor, as the court evaluates 
whether the defendant has the ability and willingness to live 
off the grid indefinitely.  A year is an extremely long period 
of time to live in hiding, undetected by the public.  And so 
all of those things are concerning. 
With respect to the question of motive, your Honor,
the government submits the court need not reach that ultimate
issue, but we noted, your Honor, that there are indicia during
the circumstances of the defendant's arrest that suggested that
there was a motive to evade detection by law enforcement.  But
the bigger picture, your Honor, is the defendant's --
THE COURT:  Ms. Moe -- 
MS. MOE:  -- ability -- 
THE COURT:  -- I was surprised that that information
wasn't provided until the reply brief.  Was there a reason for
that?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  The government wanted to
be very careful to make sure we had full and accurate
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page95 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
information.  So we were first notified about the circumstances
the morning of the defendant's arrest, but I wanted to
personally confer with the agent who was involved in breaching
the door and verify that before including that information in a
brief before the court.  That's the reason for the delay, your
Honor.
THE COURT:  Okay.  But the government has done that
confirmation process and is confident of the information
provided and the basic contention there is -- the basic
contention there is that she resisted opening the door in the
face of being informed that authorities were seeking entry and
there is a suggestion of an effort to conceal location
monitoring of some type by placing a cell phone in foil of some
kind.
Could you explain what the government's understanding 
factually is and what you think I should derive from that? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
And, with apologies, we were very careful to make sure 
that the specific language in our briefing was accurate in 
consultation with the agents, so I don't want to add additional 
facts or speak extemporaneously about that; but, in short, that 
is correct that the defendant did not respond to law 
enforcement announcing their presence and directing her to open 
the door; that, instead, she left and went into a separate 
room.   
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page96 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
And then, separately, the details about the cell 
phone, as the court noted, are contained in our brief and we 
submit that there could be no reason for wrapping a cell phone 
in tinfoil except for potentially to evade law enforcement, 
albeit foolishly and not well executed. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
I believe I was discussing the defendant's finances, 
which underscore the concern about the defendant's ability to 
flee and about her questionable candor to the court.  We submit 
there are concerns there for two reasons, your Honor.   
The first is that we learned that records relating -- 
reflecting to client information for a SWIFT bank include 
self-reported financial information from the defendant.  In 
other words, when the account was opened, there were 
disclosures made about the defendant's finances.  In those 
records, which are dated January 2019, the defendant's annual 
income is listed as ranging from $200,000 to approximately half 
a million dollars.  And both her net worth and liquid assets 
are listed as ranging from $10 million and above.   
Second, as we noted in our reply, the defendant is the 
grantor of a trust account in the same SWIFT bank with assets 
of more than $4 million as of last month.  Bank documents 
reflect that the trust has three trustees, one of whom has the 
authority to act independently.  One of those trustees is a 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page97 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
relative of the defendant and the other appears to be a close 
associate. 
Despite having put millions of dollars into this
trust, your Honor, and despite its assets being controlled by a
relative and close associate, the defendant mentions it not
once in her motion before the court or in her Pretrial Services
interview; and, in fact, despite the fact that the government
said in its opening brief that the defendant's finances and her
uncertain amount of wealth, including issues about whether her
wealth was stored abroad, are serious concerns with respect to
the defendant's risk of flight, the defendant's opposition does
not discuss this at all.  There is no mention of the
defendant's finances and no effort to address those concerns
whatsoever.
In sum, your Honor, the court has been given virtually 
no information about the defendant's possession of and apparent 
access to extensive wealth.  The court should not take that 
concealment, your Honor, we respectfully submit, as an 
invitation to demand further details, but instead to recognize 
that if the court can't rely on this defendant to be 
transparent at this basic initial stage, the court cannot rely 
on her to return to court if released.  In short, she has not 
earned the court's trust. 
Finally, your Honor, turning to the defendant's
proposed bail package, in light of all of the red flags here --
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page98 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300

the defendant's demonstrated willingness and ability to live in
hiding, her ability to live comfortably beyond the reach of
extradition, her strong interactional ties and lack of
community ties, significant and unexplained wealth, and the
presumption of detention in light of very serious charges -- in
light of all that, your Honor, it is extremely surprising that
the defendant would propose a bail package with virtually no
security whatsoever.
In addition to failing to describe in any way the 
absence of proposed cosigners of a bond, the defendant also 
makes no mention whatsoever about the financial circumstances 
or assets of her spouse whose her identity she declined to 
provide to Pretrial Services.  There is no information about 
who will be cosigning this bond or their assets and no details 
whatsoever. 
The government submits that no conditions of bail
would be appropriate here.  But it is revealing, your Honor,
that the defendant had both declined to provide a rigorous,
verified accounting of her finances and that she does not
propose that she pledge any meaningful security for her
release.  She identifies no stable residence where she could
reside.  Instead, she proposes, among other proposals, that she
stay at a luxury hotel in Manhattan, the most transient type of
residence.  And it is curious, your Honor, that the defendant
offers to pay for a luxury hotel for an indefinite period and

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
yet does not offer to post a single penny in security for the
bond she proposes.
Your Honor, the defendant is the very definition of a
flight risk.  She has three passports, large sums of money,
extensive international connections, and absolutely no reason
to stay in the United States to face a potential significant
term of incarceration.
The government respectfully submits that the defendant 
can't meet her burden of overcoming the statutory presumption 
in favor of detention in this case.  There are no conditions of 
bail that would assure the defendant's presence in court 
proceedings in this case, and we respectfully request that the 
court detain the defendant pending trial. 
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Moe.
Just to make explicit what is clear by the 
government's written presentation and oral presentation, you 
are not resting your argument for detention on dangerousness to 
the community at all.  It is resting on risk of flight, 
correct? 
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Ms. Moe, you have indicated that you have heard from
victims who are entitled, under federal law, to be heard at
this proceeding.  Could you indicate -- I think you indicated

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300

that you have a written statement and then that there is an
alleged victim who wishes to be heard.  Is that correct?
MS. MOE:  That is correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Why don't you begin with the written
statement and then after that you can identify, as you like,
the alleged victim who wishes to be heard, and my staff will
unmute at that time that person so that they can be heard.
Go ahead. 
MS. MOE:  Thank you, your Honor.
As I mentioned before, your Honor, the government has
received a written statement from a victim who prefers to be
referred to as Jane Doe today in order to protect her privacy.
The following are the words of Jane Doe which I will read from
her written statement.  
Jane Doe wrote: 
"I knew Ghislaine Maxwell for over ten years.  It was
her calculating and sadistic manipulation that anesthetized me,
in order to deliver me, with full knowledge of the heinous and
dehumanizing abuse that awaited me, straight to the hands of
Jeffrey Epstein.  Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey could not have
done what he did.  She was in charge.  She egged him on and
encouraged him.  She told me of others she recruited and she
thought it was funny.  She pretends to care only to garner
sympathy, and enjoys drawing her victims in with perceived
caring, only to entrap them and make them feel some sense of

            (212) 805-0300

obligation to her through emotional manipulation.  She was a
predator and a monster.
"The sociopathic manner in which she nurtured our 
relationship, abused my trust, and took advantage of my 
vulnerability makes it clear to me that she would have done 
anything to get what she wanted, to satisfy Mr. Epstein.  I 
have great fear that Ghislaine Maxwell will flee, since she has 
demonstrated over many years her sole purpose is that of 
self-preservation.  She blatantly disregards and disrespects 
the judicial system, as demonstrated by her perjuring herself 
and bullying anyone who dared accuse her.   
"I have great fear that she may seek to silence those 
whose testimony is instrumental in her prosecution.  In fact, 
when I was listed as a witness in a civil action involving 
Maxwell, I received a phone call in the middle of the night 
threatening my then two-year-old's life if I testified.   
"I have fear speaking here today, even anonymously.  
However, I have chosen to implore the court not to grant bond 
for Ms. Maxwell because I know the truth.  I know what she has 
done.  I know how many lives that she has ruined.  And because 
I know this, I know she has nothing to lose, has no remorse, 
and will never admit what she has done.   
"Please do not let us down by allowing her the 
opportunity to further hurt her victims or evade the 
consequences that surely await her if justice is served.  If

she believes she risks prison, she will never come back.  If 
she is out, I need to be protected.  I personally know her 
international connections that would allow her to go anywhere 
in the world and disappear at a moment's notice or make others 
disappear if she needs to."   
Your Honor, those are the words of Jane Doe. 
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Ms. Moe, would you indicate how the victim who wishes 
to be heard should be recognized? 
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.
The government has been informed through the victim's 
counsel that the victim wishes to speak in her true name, which 
is Annie Farmer. 
THE COURT:  All right.  I will ask my staff to please
unmute Ms. Farmer.
MS. FARMER:  Can you hear me, your Honor?
THE COURT:  I can, Ms. Farmer.  You may proceed.
MS. FARMER:  Thank you.  I appreciate the opportunity
to speak.
I met Ghislaine Maxwell when I was 16 years old.  She 
is a sexual predator who groomed and abused me and countless 
other children and young women.  She has never shown any 
remorse for her heinous crimes, for the devastating, lasting 
effects her actions caused.  Instead, she has lied under oath 
and tormented her survivors.

The danger Maxwell must be taken seriously.  She has 
associates across the globe, some of great means.   
She also has demonstrated contempt for our legal 
system by committing perjury, all of which indicate to me that 
she is a significant flight risk.   
We may never know how many people were victimized by 
Ghislaine Maxwell, but those of us who survived implore this 
court to detain her until she is forced to stand trial and 
answer for her crimes. 
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Farmer.  All right.
And, Ms. Moe, is the government aware of any other
victims who are entitled to -- alleged victims who are entitled
to and wish to be heard at this proceeding?
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.
THE COURT:  And, Ms. Moe, again, just to confirm,
because there was allusion in the statements of the victims to
fear and danger, the government is not seeking the court to
make any findings regarding danger to the community in coming
to its ultimate conclusion regarding pretrial detention,
correct?
MS. MOE:  That's correct, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Moe, anything further
before I hear from Mr. Cohen?  
MS. MOE:  No, your Honor.  Thank you very much.

THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Moe.
Mr. Cohen, you may proceed.
MR. COHEN:  Thank you, your Honor.  Thank you very
much for the opportunity to be heard and also for accommodating
us with regard to the briefing schedule.  We appreciate that,
your Honor.
Your Honor, this is a very important proceeding for my
client.  It is critical and we submit, as we laid out in our
papers, that under the Bail Reform Act and related case law,
none of which, by the way, was discussed in the government's
presentation, she is -- she ought to be released on a bail
package with strict conditions, your Honor.
And, frankly, in order to defend a case like this 
during the COVID crisis, with the extent of discovery which was 
discussed earlier in the proceeding, that's going to take the 
government until November to produce to us, the notion of 
preparing a defense with our client while she is in custody 
under these conditions is just not realistic. 
I would also like to take a moment, your Honor, to
address a few things.  As we noted in our papers, our client is
not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially
endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up
in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to
portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister
person.  
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page105 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
I do want to note, before I go further, to pick up on 
something the court said.  We have a proceeding now where the 
government is dribbling out facts or what they claim are facts 
that they could have and should have put in their opening 
memorandum so we would have had an opportunity to address them 
in writing before the court.  That's not how this is supposed 
to proceed, your Honor, and I thank your Honor for pointing 
that out.  Each -- 
THE COURT:  But, Mr. Cohen, please, by all means, you
have had the reply in the time that I have as well.  You
shouldn't hesitate to respond to any of those facts now.
MR. COHEN:  I appreciate that, your Honor, and I'm
going to proceed by proffer.  I would have preferred to be able
to submit something in writing, but obviously the way it was
done, we were deprived of that chance.
I also want to make clear that our client is not
Epstein.  She is not the monster that has been portrayed by the
media and now the government.  She is part of a very large and
close family, with extensive familial relations, extensive
friendships, extensive professional relationships.  Many of
these folks are on the call today, your Honor, and thank you,
your Honor, for making that available, though not identified,
which is something one would normally do in a traditional bail
hearing, because of the very real concern that they have and
our client has about her safety and about her privacy and her
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page106 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
confidentiality, as your Honor pointed out.  And as you will
see in a moment, that explains a lot of the spin the government
is putting on facts in this case.
Your Honor, people have received physical threats.  My 
client has received them.  Most of those close to her have 
received them.  They have received death threats.  They have 
been injured in their jobs, in their work opportunities, in 
their reputations, simply for knowing my client.  It's real.  
It's out there.  The facts of all the steps the court had to go 
through just to make the public access available to this 
proceeding is also a reality.   
There is a real thing out there having a very 
significant impact on our client.  There are folks who would 
normally come forward as part of a bail package who your Honor 
is aware of from the Pretrial Services report who can't now, at 
least at this point, because of the safety and confidentiality 
concerns.  Since last week our firm alone and my colleagues at 
Haddon Morgan have been besieged with e-mails and posts, some 
of them threatening.  This is all very real.  The government 
attempts to poo-poo it, to give it the back of the hand.  It is 
very real, and we submit it is a factor for the court to 
consider in its discretion. 
Before I go further, your Honor, I would like to go
through the 3142(g) analysis.  But before I do that, I would
like to make one comment about the CVR -- CVRA proceeding under
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page107 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
377(1), and we understand that the court is following the
statute.  The statute gives alleged victims the right to speak
through counsel, through the government, or directly, and be
heard, and we understand that, your Honor.
The question today before the court, we submit, is 
whether or not our client could be released or should be 
released on a condition or combination of conditions to assure 
her appearance.  And as to that question, the presentations 
today do not speak, they do not speak to risk of flight, and 
the courts have -- in this circuit have thought about and 
researched what weight should be given to that.  There is an 
opinion by Judge Orenstein in the Eastern District, United 
States v. Turner, from April 2005, not cited by the government, 
in which the court, after carefully surveying the legislative 
history and background of the CVRA and its interplay with the 
bail reform statute, concluded, "In considering how to ensure 
that the rights are afforded, I am cognizant that the new law 
gives crime victims a voice but not a veto.  Of particular 
relevance to this case, a court's obligation to protect the 
victim's rights and to carefully consider any objections that 
victim may have never requires it to deny a defendant release 
on conditions that will adequately secure the defendant's 
appearance," going on to cite the Senate legislative history 
that's being cited with approval of United States v. Rubin, 
also an Eastern District case.   
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page108 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
So we understand why the court has to follow this 
process, but we submit that these presentations just are not 
relevant to the determination before the court today.  And, 
again, we don't have spin.  The big fact that the government, 
Ms. Moe tried to put before you through the victim is that 
supposedly someone had called in a civil action threatening the 
two-year-old child.  Notice how carefully that was phrased, 
your Honor.  It wasn't tied to Ms. Maxwell.  It's more spin, 
spin, spin.   
So we are here to consider bail.  We should consider 
the statute.  We should consider your Honor's guidance under 
the statute.  So let me just put that to one side.  I determine 
that that really disposes of the issue of what weight to give. 
In turning to the statute, your Honor, turning to the
factors, I don't want to spend a lot of time on the standard,
because I know your Honor is very familiar with it, but I do
want to point out that, in an opening brief and reply brief and
now an oral presentation, the government has not once
represented the standard to your Honor nor the burden that it
has.  And that is the statute, under 3142(c), says that "even
the case where there is not to be release ROR" -- which this is
not that case -- "the court shall order pretrial release
subject to the least restrictive condition or combination of
conditions."  That as you now read, of course, in light of
3142(e), (f), and (g), the provisions on detention, that the
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page109 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
law of the statute, by its structure, favors release.  The
Supreme Court has and the Second Circuit has advised us that a
very limited number of people should be detained prior to trial
because of the statute's structure, and the government nowhere
mentions that.  It basically acts as if all it has to do is
invoke the presumption on the client and then we are done, and
that's just not the legal standing, your Honor.
They also say nothing about the burden, which is
discussed on a case written for the Second Circuit by Judge
Raggi, and also the U.S. v. English case.  Without going into a
lot of detail, as the court is aware, the burden of persuasion
is the government's.  It never shifts.  The presumption can be
rebutted, and we submit it is here, and then it is the burden
of the government to show that the defendant is a risk of
flight and that there are no conditions or combination of
conditions to secure the release, which we submit they haven't
done here.
So let me turn, your Honor, if I may, to the factors 
under 3142(g), and before I do that, I also want to address 
some of the government's comments about the bail package.  We 
decided that we should come before your Honor with a package 
that was set out subject, of course, to the ruling provided by 
the court, subject of course to verification as to suretors by 
Pretrial Services and the court.  We didn't want to just walk 
in and say, Judge, we should be entitled to bail, please set 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page110 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
conditions.  So what we did is we went through all the high 
profile cases in this courthouse in the past several years and 
other cases, cases like Madoff, cases like Dreier, cases like 
Esposito, where Judge Marrero ruled in 2018 relating to an 
alleged member of organized crime, and we went through those 
cases to find the conditions that were listed under 3142(c), 
and in those cases that would we believe be relevant and 
applicable here, and we believe we have listed them all.  We 
understand that of course they would be subject to 
verification; and as we noted in our papers and I noted today, 
if we could have a guarantee of safety, if we could have a 
guarantee of privacy and confidentiality, and if the court 
required it, we believe there are other suretors who we could 
provide and perhaps other amounts of property as well.  That is 
an issue.  It is a real issue in this case.  It is something 
the government is just avoiding, but it is real.   
So let me talk now, your Honor, if I might, about the 
3142(g)(3) factors, which are the factors relating to the 
history of the defendant. 
The government said --
THE COURT:  Mr. Cohen, just before you move to that,
the three cases that you cited -- Esposito, Dreier, Madoff --
factually did any of those cases involve defendants with
substantial international and foreign connections?
MR. COHEN:  No, I don't believe they did.  The cases
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page111 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
that are relevant to that, which I was going to get to, your
Honor, are Khashoggi, U.S. v. Khashoggi, U.S. v. Bodmer, U.S.
v. Hanson, and Sabhnani itself, all of which involve defendants
with substantial connections.  
And I might follow up on your Honor's question, when 
you take off the spin and you take off the media -- and I'm 
going to get to it in a moment, because your Honor is going to 
allow me to respond -- here is their case:  Defendant is a 
citizen of more than one country, England and France, not 
exactly exotic places.  The defendant has three passports.  The 
defendant has traveled internationally in the past, not in the 
past year.  There is no refutation from the government on that, 
and they have been all over her travel records.  The defendant 
has resided here in the past year.  She has traveled 
internationally and, according to the government, she has 
financial means.  I will get to that in a moment, Judge.  But 
let's assume for the purposes of this discussion that she has 
financial means and not the lies that the government laid out.  
What do those cases teach?  They teach that that is something 
the court can and should address in the bail conditions.  They 
teach that they may require stricter bail conditions.  They 
don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all.  In 
Sabhnani, a Second Circuit case, the allegation was that the 
defendants have held two individuals in slavery for five years, 
and they had many more international ties or international 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page112 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
travel than alleged as to our client, certainly in the past 
year, and strict release was approved with strict bail 
conditions. 
In Bodmer, which was before Judge Scheindlin in 2004,
the defendant was a Swiss citizen, and Switzerland had taken
the position it would not extradite its citizens for
proceedings in the United States.  And Judge Scheindlin
observed, well, if that becomes the test for bail, then no
citizen of Switzerland can ever get bail in the United States.
So, too, here.  If that's the test for France, then no French
citizen, under the government's reasoning, could ever get bail
in the United States.  
And in Bodmer it was even the allegation -- the case 
was a fraud case -- the allegation was that the defendant who 
was a Swiss attorney had, according to the government, been 
opening up Swiss accounts overseas and that that was some form 
of hiding.  Even with all that, the court said what many courts 
have said in this courthouse, to be addressed in the 
conditions.  Doesn't mean the government has carried its burden 
of showing there is no combination of conditions.   
In the Khashoggi case, written by Judge Keenan in 
1989, this was a person of extraordinary wealth, way more than 
anything the government alleges that our client has, he was, 
according to the government, a fugitive, a Saudi citizen who 
had not been in the United States for three years prior to his 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page113 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
arrest.  That defendant was released on bail conditions, strict 
bail conditions.   
And I mention Esposito, which is the 2019 case from 
Judge Marrero, that is a case in which the allegation was that 
the defendant was a senior ranking member of organized crime 
and had access to financial means as well.   
But all of those cases, as well as Madoff and Dreier, 
which I'm sure the court is familiar, with involved allegations 
of defendants with hundreds of millions of dollars, in all of 
those cases, the courts held that bail should be set subject to 
strict conditions.  And by the way, Judge, in all of those 
cases, the defendants appeared for court.  They all made 
appearances and appeared for trial.   
There are also cases from the context involving 
pornography or sex crime allegations, such as the Deutsch case 
coming from the Eastern District several years ago, the Conway 
case in the Northern District of California.  Again, 
understanding those are the allegations, the decision was made 
that release could be awarded on conditions. 
You even had one recently in the Second Circuit that
I'm sure everyone is familiar with United States v. Mattis,
different setting, because that was a dangerousness case and
the government is not proceeding on dangerousness grounds, but
that is the case where the allegation is that two attorneys
threw a Molotov cocktail into a police car; challenge to bail
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page114 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
appealed by the government; decision of the court, release on
strict conditions.  That is how the law works and comes out in
this area, but that's something, your Honor, that the
government did not address.  And if the court determines that
the conditions that we have proffered are insufficient or need
further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of
safety and confidentiality, we would recommend that the court
keep the proceeding open, and we should be able to get whatever
the court needs to satisfy it.  So that's the legal analysis
that was absent in the government's presentation today and its
papers.
Let me now, because I have to, because this has been
put out before your Honor in, of course, a public proceeding,
let me respond to some of the allegations made for the first
time in the reply brief, trying to spin facts to make my client
look sinister to your Honor.
Here is fact one:  She is a risk of flight because she 
has been hiding out.  Well, let's think about this.  She has 
been litigating civil cases in this courthouse and other parts 
of the country since 2015, denying, as she does here before 
your Honor, that she did anything improper with regards to 
Mr. Epstein.  We submit, your Honor, that is the opposite of 
somebody who is looking to flee.  And in fact, one of the 
people who spoke before your Honor is a plaintiff in one of 
those lawsuits seeking millions of dollars from our client and 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page115 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300

seeking millions of dollars from a fund that's being set up.  
Something for the court to consider. 
She has also, as we mentioned, remained in the United
States, even though she has known of the investigation.  How
could she not?  It's been unbelievably public for the past
year.  And we have been in regular contact with her -- with the
government.  Your Honor asked that question, very careful
question from the court, and we got a shimmy from the
government in response.  We have been in contact with them,
conservatively -- as we checked last night, because we thought
you might ask -- conservatively eight to ten times in the past
year, all for the same purpose, to urge them not to bring this
case, which shouldn't have been brought.
The notion that experienced counsel, and counsel at
Haddon Morgan is also experienced, is in regular contact with
the government, would surrender their client, and they turn
around and deny that to the court and deny that voluntary
surrender would and could have and should have been possible
here is, we submit, another factor for the court to consider.
So let me turn to the reply brief.
THE COURT:  Sorry.  If I may, Mr. Cohen, I just want
to make sure I understand that last point.  Are you saying that
defense counsel indicated to the government that, should there
be an indictment returned, you were seeking to arrange a
voluntary surrender?  Is that the contention?
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page116 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
MR. COHEN:  To be precise, we were urging them not to
return an indictment and saying we were always available to
speak.  And, frankly, your Honor, I have been doing this kind
of work for 33 years, everyone knows what that means.
THE COURT:  So you were implying --
(Indiscernible crosstalk) 
THE COURT:  You were implying that, though you were
urging --
MR. COHEN:  Yes.
THE COURT:  -- or seeking to forestall the indictment,
should there be an indictment, you were implying that you
should be contacted for voluntary surrender.
MR. COHEN:  Yes, of course.  And the day after our
client was arrested, we got a note from the government sending
the application to detention addressed to us and Haddon Morgan
saying your client, Ms. Maxwell, was arrested yesterday.  So
there was no doubt that we represented her along with Haddon
Morgan.  There was no doubt that we were available and could
have been contacted and worked this out.  There was no doubt
that we are confident we would have.
Let me turn to the reply brief and the effort to throw
some more dirt on my client that we again submit should not be
considered as part of the governing legal standards here and
the precise question before the court.  You heard it today and
in the brief we hear that at the time of her arrest, the agents
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page117 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
breached the gate and they saw her through the window try to
flee to another room in the house, quickly shutting the door,
and that she -- agents were ultimately forced to breach the
door.  So here is the spin.  It's as if the government is just
sort of giving it for the media, here is the spin given to your
Honor to try to influence your Honor's discretion.  What
actually happened?  At least the court has said we can respond
by proffer.  We weren't given a chance to respond in writing.
My client was at the property in the morning in her pajamas.
She was there with one security guard.  Two people in the
house.  The front door was unlocked.  All the other doors of
the house were open.  The windows were open.  Dozens of agents
came storming up the drive, creating a disturbance.  My client
had to hire security because of the threats to her that I have
already relayed before, and the protocol was that in a
disturbance to go into new room.  That's all she did.  Not
running out of the house, not, you know, looking for some
secret tunnel, went in the other room.  The F.B.I. knocked down
the door which, by the way, was open, and my client surrendered
herself for arrest.  That's far from the picture painted by the
government.
Let me turn to another thing that the government
mentioned today in an effort to sort of spin the facts, make
everything look sinister with respect to my client.  The
government said in its opening brief, well, Judge, she is
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page118 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
hiding.  She is a risk of flight because she changed her e-mail
and phone number.  That's what we heard in the opening brief.
Well, what happened?  Something the government, frankly, should
know about, because it was certainly public, last year, in a
civil litigation, in August of 2019, right around the time of
the arrest of Mr. Epstein, the Second Circuit ruled that
certain records in one of the civil cases should be unsealed
and released to the public.  That was done.  There was no stay
at the moment.  The demand was issued, and the documents were
released.  Certain of those documents were supposed to be
redacted and sometimes they were and sometimes they were not,
documents including e-mail addresses, Social Security numbers,
names, phone numbers, the sorts of things your Honor, I am
sure, has to deal with all the time in these kinds of
situations.
But as it turned out, for whatever reason, some of the 
documents were not redacted and her e-mail address was 
revealed.  Shortly after that, she starts getting strange 
e-mails.  Her phone is hacked, and she had to change e-mails 
and change the account.   
Now she has got a phone that has legal materials on 
it, correspondence with her counsel in civil litigation that's 
been hacked, so she keeps it.  Why does she keep it?  Because 
she is in civil litigation.  Her obligation is to keep 
evidence, not destroy it, and is advised that a way to keep it 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page119 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
from being hacked, again, is to put it in the equivalent of a 
Faraday bag, whether it be tinfoil or the bags they now make in 
briefcases, and that's it.  That's all that she does.  And I 
guarantee to your Honor, given the tenor of the government's 
presentation, that had she said, well, this phone was hacked, 
I'm just going to throw it away, the government would be 
standing before your Honor today say, ah-ha, she destroyed 
evidence, that adds to risk of flight.  And she had she put it 
in a safe deposit box, rather than to destroy it, they would be 
saying we cracked into a safe deposit box, your Honor.  This is 
evidence of a risk of flight.  It just does not fit the test, 
we submit. 
And the last point on this, your Honor, which,
frankly, in some ways is the most telling point of all, the
agents do a security sweep, considering this is a house where
there are two people in it -- and I will put that to one side
for a moment -- they talk to the security guard, apparently now
they are going to do the thing multiple times because the
government is dribbling out facts, and they say, well, who
lives in the house?  Ms. Maxwell does.  Okay?  She lives in the
house.  What do you -- how do you get groceries and so forth?
I go out and get them for her.
So let's stop and think about this, your Honor.  The 
government's allegation is that the person who is aware of a 
criminal investigation in the United States, has her counsel in 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page120 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
regular contact with the government, is removed in a property 
in the United States.  That's the opposite of hiding.  So we 
think that those kinds of facts, I'm sure, your Honor, if your 
Honor decides to keep the proceedings open and give us a chance 
to come on some issues, I'm sure we will have some more facts 
tomorrow and the next day, all with the disclaimer, we just 
learned this, your Honor.  They have been investigating this 
case for ten years, your Honor, okay? 
So let me turn now to another factor that the
government made argument about briefly, two more factors under
31(g)(3), the history and characteristics of the defendant.  We
heard several times that there was a -- that detention should
be warranted because there is a perjury charge.  Very quickly,
your Honor, we submit this does not tip the balance in the 3142
analysis that the court has to perform.
First and foremost, the defendant is, of course, 
presumed innocent; and, secondly, the allegation and nature of 
the perjury, if the court has been through the indictment, is 
someone who denies guilt, who says they are innocent, is asked 
in a deposition did you do that and says no, the government 
charges them with perjury.  That is not -- other than the fact 
that it's an indicted charge, they are still entitled to the 
weight the court would give a not indicted charge.  That's all 
the weight it should be given . 
Let me turn to another factor that the government
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page121 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
mentioned in its presentation, both in its papers and today,
that relates to 3142(g)(3), which is the defendant's financial
situation.
Again, when you look at the case law, which is not 
addressed by the government at all, this is a person who has 
passports that can be surrendered, who has travel that can be 
restricted, who has citizenship that the courts have taking 
account of, and does have financial means.  Does she have the 
financial means that the government says she has?  We doubt it.  
But does she have hundreds of millions of dollars like those in 
the Madoff and Dreier case?  No.   
But it doesn't matter.  Even if the court were to 
assume for purposes of today's proceeding that she has the 
means that the government claims she does, it does not affect 
the analysis.  That is to be addressed in conditions, to be 
addressed if the court requires it, through verifications and 
further proceedings before the court.   
And let me just address some of the allegations made 
in the government's brief about her financial situation.  The 
government goes out and arrests our client even though she 
would have voluntarily surrendered, arrests her the day before 
a federal holiday, so she spends extra time in the 
New Hampshire prison before being transported here, and then 
says, how come you don't have a full account of your financial 
condition?  How come, when Pretrial Services asked about it, 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page122 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
you can't, off the top of your head, explain your financial 
condition to them?  You must be lying.  That assertion is 
absurd.   
We have been working since our client was detained, 
with our client, trying to access family members to put, as 
best we could, a financial picture before the court to the 
extent it is relevant to this application and only this 
application.  This bail proceeding should not turn into some 
mini investigation of our client's finances.  The government 
has had ten years to investigate my client. 
Let me address some of the specific allegations in the
government's brief.  They point to a sale of property in 2016.
According to the government, the property was sold for $15
million.  There is no secret about that.  Those records are out
there.  The government claims our client cleared $14 million
from that in 2016 and apparently has it all today, which would
probably make it the first New York real estate transaction to
that effect.  There has been liabilities.  There has been
expenses.  Our client has been through extensive, substantial
litigation all over this country denying these claims.  We
think the number is far less than what the government asserts.
But even taking that number, it's a number far lower than that
in Khashoggi, far lower than that in Dreier, far lower than in
many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,
should be addressed by bail conditions.
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page123 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
The government also says, well, she has 15 different
bank accounts -- and here we get some hedging language -- that
are by or associated with her.  No detail, no explanation to
the court, just more dirt.  Well, she has three bank accounts
that she disclosed.  She believes that there are more, for
example, with respect to the not-for-profit that she ran for
almost a decade before she was forced to shut it down because
of the issues in the media and the attention and the firestorm.
So it is some number less.  And if it's important to the court,
we will do our best to pull it together.  But under the
relevant cases, it doesn't change the analysis.
And then we go through the last one, your Honor.  They 
say in their brief that she did transfers of funds.  One was a 
transfer of 500,000.  We believe that what that is was a bond 
maturing.  So when a bond matures, it is transferred out.   
And then there was another one, and the government 
sort of changes its mind between its opening brief and its 
reply brief and I'm sure by tomorrow they will have some new 
speculation for your Honor, but essentially let's call it a 
several hundred thousand transfer out of and account in June 
and July of 2019.  What's that refer to?  It refers to one of 
the themes we have been talking about in our submission and 
today your Honor.  When Mr. Epstein was arrested, it had all 
kinds of effects on our client, one of which was that the bank 
in question referenced in the government's submission dropped 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page124 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
her.  Well, when the bank drops you, you have to transfer your 
funds out.  That's true.  That's what happened.  So there is 
nothing in there that's sinister, there is nothing in there 
that shows an intent to evade, an intent to evade, and nothing 
there that we think warrants detention. 
One last point on the financial stuff, your Honor, if
I might.  In the reply brief, we get a new allegation that an
SDAR, a foreign filing was made in 2018 and 2019, disclosing
that our client had a foreign bank account.  Let's stop there.
Our client makes a legally required filing with the Treasury
Department, obeys the law, and discloses a foreign bank
account, and the government is claiming that's evidence of
hiding.  This is all upside-down, your Honor.  These are not
factors to be considered in exercising your discretion under
3142.
Let me turn very quickly to the other two factors that
are relevant for today's purposes because, as your Honor has
pointed out, the government is not proceeding on a
dangerousness claim.  That is the (g)(1) and (g)(2) factors,
the nature and circumstances of the case, and the weight of the
evidence.
Here, I think we -- if you bear with me a moment, your 
Honor, here, one thing to keep in mind is an observation   
Judge Raggi made in the Sabhnani case, at page 77, where she 
said, "The more effectively a court can physically restrain the 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page125 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
defendant, the less important it becomes to identify and 
restrain each and every asset over which defendants may 
exercise some control in order to mitigate risk of flight."  So 
if the court -- and we have suggested them, but they may be 
modified by the court -- can put in place stringent bail 
conditions, we don't need to have a side-long, month-long 
hearing about my client's assets which is just designed to keep 
her in detention.  That was an observation by Judge Raggi in 
Sabhnani. 
Judge, very quickly on the nature and circumstances of
the offense and the weight of the evidence, we don't think,
your Honor, this is the place to litigate legal motions.  This
is a bail hearing.  It is not the place to litigate complex
legal questions that we will be presenting to your Honor.  It's
very soon on the motion schedule, and we thank the court for
agreeing to the schedule.  But there are a few things that are
worth pointing out.
We believe there are very significant motions here 
that will affect whether this indictment survives at all or the 
shape of this indictment and, given the government's 
representation that it is not planning to supersede, will 
affect the shape of the entire case, or any case at all that 
proceeds before the court at trial, if there is a trial.  That 
is exactly what we submit the court can consider, again, in 
exercising its discretion as to the weight of the evidence.   
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page126 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
We believe there are significant motions relating to 
the reach of the NPA, which we are not going to litigate here 
before your Honor in a bail proceeding, that are not even 
foreclosed by the cases the government does cite to you.  They 
cite to you the -- I'm going to skip this one, the Annabi case, 
A-N-N-A-B-I case, which says, "The plea agreement binds only 
the office of the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the 
plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction," and that in part 
is going to be our argument.  So we will make it to your Honor 
at the appropriate time.  For today's purposes, it should be in 
the mix in evaluating the weight of the evidence as should the 
points I just made about the perjury charge and we think that 
there are other significant legal challenges to the indictment.   
We also think there are significant issues with the 
weight of the evidence.  The government chose to indict conduct 
that's 25 years old, your Honor.  You will see when you get our 
motions that this, we think, is an effort to dance around the 
NPA, to come into an earlier time period, a related time 
period.  It's all tactics.  That's all this is about.  This 
case is about tactics.  It's an effort to dance around the NPA.  
But the fact of the matter is the government -- 
THE COURT:  Mr. Cohen, I'm sorry, by that do you mean
that the time period charged is not covered by the NPA.
MR. COHEN:  Right.  Exactly.  There is going to be
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page127 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
litigation before your Honor about what is in the NPA, and the
government, we expect, is going to take the position that
unlike '07 is covered and nothing else.  We disagree with that,
which we will lay out for your Honor.  What do they do?  They
decide we will reach back and indict '94 to '97, totally
tactical, your Honor.  So now we have a case where the conduct
is 25 years old, no tapes, no video, none of the sort of things
you would expect in that age of case, that we are going to have
to defend, and we are going to defend.  And I think it goes to
the court's consideration of the weight in the context of the
only application that's before your Honor, which is how to
weigh the 3142 factors with the structure of the statute, with
the guidance of the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court, which
is in favor of bail, in favor of bail on appropriate
conditions.
So we submit that the package we laid out for the 
court is sufficient that we are certainly willing if the court 
deems it necessary to leave the proceeding open and we think we 
could be back before the court within a week if that is what 
the court wants or there is more detail which has been hammered 
by the fact that our client has been, by design, by design, 
kept in custody.  And let me just give your Honor a little 
flavor. 
THE COURT:  Wait, Mr. Cohen.  I missed that last point
could you repeat it, please.
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page128 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
MR. COHEN:  I'm sorry.  If the court desires to leave
the proceeding open for a week and allow us to come back, if
the court has concerns about the number of suretors, for
example, verification information, information about financial
issues, we think that, now that we have some ability to breathe
a little bit, that we should be able to pull this together for
the court's consideration.  We came forward with the best
package we could put together on a limited notice with a client
who was arrested, held in custody, has been since she came to
the MDC held in, I will call it, the equivalent of the layman's
term of solitary confinement.  There is probably a BOP word,
like administrative seg., or some other word they have for it
now.  
We have had a client who has been kept alone in a room 
with the lights on all the time, is not allowed to speak with 
us in the jail at all, wasn't allowed to shower for 72 hours, 
had her legal materials taken away from her, only recently 
given back.  So working with that, we have been trying to 
answer questions about financial situation and others, but it 
is very difficult, your Honor, under circumstances that are of 
the government's creation, of the government's creation, and 
we -- 
THE COURT:  So I do want to understand that point.  I
think that's the "by design" point that you are making.  Just
for clarity, I understand that there was consent to detention
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page129 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
originally without prejudice obviously for precisely the
proceeding we are having, but it sounded like you were
suggesting that her current detention was in some way by design
to prevent you from providing a full picture of her financial
situation.  Is that the implication you are making?
MR. COHEN:  No, I am not saying that, your Honor.  I
am not going that far.  What I am saying is, when you have a
client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the
country despite an investigation, and the government instead
chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early
instances your access to the client.  It is complicated by the
COVID crisis and the other factors your Honor has pointed out
in Stephens and in Williams-Bethea, and so it is very hard for
us to pull together this financial information, and we have
done it as quickly as we could before the court.  But the
notion that my client should have been able to answer off the
top of her head the questions from Pretrial Services about a
real estate transaction, for example, just doesn't make any
sense.  That's the point we are making.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. COHEN:  One last point in that regard, your Honor,
in the schedule we set today -- thank you, your Honor, for
approving that -- the government is saying that it needs at
least until November to complete all discovery, including
electronic discovery.  They have told us that there are two
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page130 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
investigations.  There is the investigation of our client and
there is the investigation of Mr. Epstein.  And they are, in
the government's words, in our words together, voluminous
materials.  We haven't seen any of it yet, but voluminous,
including voluminous electronic materials.  The notion that we
would be able to in any meaningful way review these with our
client to prepare the case for motion and for trial under the
current pandemic situation is just not realistic.  It is not
meaningful.  It is not fair.  And I should say, as your Honor
noted, in the Stephens case, we are not faulting the Bureau of
Prisons.  We are not faulting the Marshal Service.  We
understand they are doing the best they can under the
circumstances.  But this is just not realistic.  We have
conduct that's alleged to be 25 years old.  You have extensive
discovery that's going to take the government, if they hit the
deadlines your Honor set -- and we all know that sometimes it
doesn't happen -- four and a half months to provide, and the
government wants our client to remain in custody that whole
time, without being able to meet with us in person, with
limited access in some form of administrative seg., apparently
because they are afraid of what happened with Mr. Epstein, I
don't know, and it is just not a realistic way to prepare a
case, particularly, your Honor, when, as we submit, the
conditions and combination of conditions to secure her release
can be satisfied here under your Honor's guidance.  
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page131 of 200

            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
And in response to that, the government said, well, 
too bad, COVID crisis, too bad, Ms. Maxwell, we are not going 
to let you out.  We are not going to let you out because you 
might get infected, we are not going to let you out because, 
you know, because it will be tough preparing your trial.  And 
they cite to your Honor, in reply, two pages of cases, very 
limited parentheticals.  If you actually read those cases, they 
are totally different from our situation, your Honor.  The 
cases they cite on health risks in the prison environment, they 
cite 14 cases, 12 of them are dangerousness cases, people who 
are convicted of multiple felonies, including weapons felonies.  
The courts in those cases determined the COVID factors do not 
outweigh that analysis.  They cite nine cases on the 
preparation and access to counsel.  Several of them are 
dangerousness cases, and the other ones that have some 
discussion of flight risk are so extremely different from our 
case as to not be relevant. 
Judge, I don't know how we could possibly prepare this
case, getting four months of discovery, including electronic
discovery, and in over 25 years of conduct, with a client who
is in custody, who we can't meet with in person.  And I'm not
faulting the BOP.  I understand why they have to do what they
have to do, and your Honor has made the same point, but it is
just we have to be in the real world here.  We have to --
THE COURT:  Whether defendants are detained because of
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page132 of 200

            (212) 805-0300

risk of flight or dangerousness, they are still entitled to the
same Sixth Amendment rights to access defense counsel to
prepare their case.
MR. COHEN:  Of course, your Honor.  My point was a
more narrow point.  My point is that the facts in those cases
are different from our case in a meaningful way and the court
was doing a different evaluation.  That was the point I was
making on this case.
So in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case
for bail.  We believe that the government, which has the burden
of persuasion that never shifts, has not made a showing as
required, that our client is a risk of flight.  When you
consider the risk, as Judge Raggi put it, in Sabhnani, the
actual risk of flight, not fantasy and not speculation, when
you consider that the only factors they really point to are
ones that the cases have already addressed, such as
international travel and passports.
We also submit that the government has not carried its 
burden of showing there is no condition or combination of 
conditions that secure release.   
So we would ask the court to grant bail today.  And if 
the court needs more information from us, we would respectfully 
request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so 
that we can try to satisfy the court because we want to. 
Thank you, your Honor, for your time.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Cohen.
Ms. Moe, would the government like a brief reply?
MS. MOE:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you very much.
Your Honor, I want to begin by addressing head on the
notion that the government's presentation in this case is
somehow about spins or about throwing dirt or about the media.
Your Honor, my colleagues and I are appearing today on behalf
of the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District
of New York.  Our presentation of the defendant's conduct is
detailed in an indictment that was returned by a grand jury in
this court.  These are the facts.  It is not dirt.  It is not
spin.  That is the evidence and that is what we have proffered
to the court.
And the notion that anyone could read the indictment
that has been returned in this case and now reach the
conclusion that an adult woman, cultivating the traffic of
underage girls, knowing that they will be sexually abused and
exploited by an adult man, and conclude that that is chilling
conduct, that is, on the face of the indictment, your Honor.
Turning to the facts we have proffered to the court 
about the defendant's finances, and particularly about the 
defendant's conduct in hiding, it appears, your Honor, that it 
is undisputed that the defendant was living in hiding and took 
those actions.  There cannot be any spin or characterization of 
this spin.  Those are the facts that appear to be undisputed. 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page134 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
Turning to several specific points, your Honor, that I
would like to respond to.  I want to address the notion that
the defendant would have surrendered if the government had
asked her to.  As defense counsel conceded, no offer along
those lines was ever made.  And of course the government
doesn't have to accept the defense counsel's representation
that their client would surrender.
In fact, the fact that the government took these 
measures to arrest the defendant reflects how seriously the 
government takes the risk of the defendant of flight.  Why on 
earth would the government notify the defendant through her 
counsel that she was about to be indicted and arrested if the 
government had serious concerns that she was a risk of flight?  
That is exactly what occurred here. 
In addition, it is interesting that defense counsel
notes that it should have been obvious to the government that
the defendant would have surrendered when, at the same time, in
civil litigation in this district, defense counsel declined to
accept service on behalf of plaintiffs who were seeking to sue
the defendant in connection with some of these allegations, and
they were required to seek leave of the court to serve the
defendant through their counsel.
Your Honor, turning to the question of the defendant's 
finances there is still at this point no substantive response 
regarding defendant's finances or about the lack of candor to 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page135 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
the court, significantly. 
And while we recognize that it appears that the
defendant's extensive resources may be in complicated banking
records, at a basic level, the defense argument is that she
cannot remember off the top of her head just how many millions
of dollars she has.  That should cause the court serious
concern.
A bail hearing, your Honor, is not an opportunity for
the defendant to slowly reveal information until the court
deems it sufficient.  That is not sufficient process here.
That is not appropriate.  This information is coming out in
dribs and drabs, and defendant should not be in a position to
slowly but surely concede, as the government reveals, that she
has been less than candid with the court about her finances.
There are serious concerns here.
With respect to the notion that the defendant could
just surrender her passports, there are of course no
limitations this court could set on a foreign government
issuing travel documents to defendant or accepting her if she
were to enter into that country.  
And finally, your Honor, with respect to the case law 
that defense has cited, they ignore the obvious comparator 
case, which is Judge Berman's decision regarding Jeffrey 
Epstein, who was arrested both on risk of flight grounds and on 
dangerousness grounds.  And as Judge Berman detailed, the 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page136 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
detention was appropriate in that case on risk of flight alone.  
And, again, that conduct was -- at that point significant time 
had passed, and Jeffrey Epstein was not a foreign citizen. 
I want to respond with respect to the NPA.  At this
point, your Honor, the defense has articulated no legal basis
to suggest that the defendant is shielded by the nonprosecution
agreement, and it simply doesn't make sense that the decision
in this case is somehow tactical to avoid concerns about the
NPA, when the government charged Jeffrey Epstein with conduct
that fell within the scope of the time period within the
nonprosecution agreement and stated before the court in
connection with bail proceedings in that matter that this is
the government's strong view that that agreement does not bind
this office whatsoever with respect to any kind of conduct or
any kind of individual.  That agreement does not bind this
office whatsoever.
Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to
evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the
circumstances.  The defense's argument, in essence, attempts to
view each of the government's arguments as absolute.  But when
you review the totality of the circumstances -- the defendant's
extensive international ties, her conduct over the past year,
her unknown finances and unwillingness to be more candid with
the court about her resources to flee, her specific bail
proposal which provides absolutely no security to the court --
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page137 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
it is clear that defendant has not met her burden to rebut the
presumption of detention in this case.  The government urges
the court to detain this defendant, consistent with the
recommendation of Pretrial Services and the request of the
victims.  It is important, your Honor, that there be a trial in
this case, and the government has serious concerns that the
defendant will flee if afforded the opportunity.
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Briefly, Ms. Moe, just a couple of legal
questions.
Mr. Cohen argued that you failed to address directly 
the standards, the burdens under the statutory provision, and 
that you have avoided the fact of the government continuing to 
carry the burden by a preponderance of the evidence with 
respect to risk of flight and whether there are measures that 
could assure appearance.  Do you dispute anything legally 
suggested by Mr. Cohen in terms of the standard that applies? 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, the government submits that the
standard is clear.  It is the defendant's burden of production
to rebut the presumption that there are no set of conditions
that could reasonably assure her continued appearance in this
case.  The government has the ultimate burden of persuasion,
but it is the defendant's burden of production.  She has failed
to meet that burden for the reasons we set forth in our
briefing and arguments today.
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page138 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
THE COURT:  Okay.
And then the other legal question I had, I think 
Mr. Cohen began his presentation by noting -- by raising case 
law suggesting the lack of relevance of the statements of the 
alleged victims, although fully recognizing their entitlement 
under the law to be heard.  What is the government's position 
with respect to the relevance of the alleged victim statements 
in the 3142 analysis? 
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, the government has not proffered
victim's testimony or information in an effort to support its
motion.  To the contrary, the victims have appeared consistent
with their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act.  Of
course, as we noted in our reply brief, it is very important to
the government that the victims receive justice in this case
and that there be a trial so that that could happen.  That is
very important to the government, and we respectfully submit
that the court should take that into account.  However, again,
the victims' participation in this proceeding is pursuant to
their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act.  It is not
part of the government's presentation in this case.
THE COURT:  Okay.  So I should not consider it --
should not consider the substance of the statements in the
overall bail analysis.
MS. MOE:  Your Honor, with respect to the nature and
circumstances of the offense, the offense conduct, the
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page139 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
government submits that the statements of the victims certainly
shed light on the gravity of the offense conduct, the harm it
has caused, and how serious that conduct is.  The court can and
should take that into account.  My point was a procedural one;
that it is not the case that the government is submitting this
as evidence in support of its motion, but it is certainly the
case that the victims' experiences, the harms that they have
been caused can be considered by the court with respect to the
nature and circumstances of the offense conduct, which we
submit is gravely serious.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
Mr. Cohen, very briefly, any final points?
MR. COHEN:  Yes, your Honor, very briefly.  I won't
get into it, but I don't think she just answered your question
about what they are doing with respect to the CVRA victims, but
I will leave that to the court.
Just very quickly, two points, your Honor.
The government says in its response now that the case 
to be relied upon and distinguished is U.S. v. Epstein.  They 
didn't raise it in their opening memorandum or their reply or 
in their oral presentation before your Honor.  To the extent 
your Honor considers it, and we have certainly looked at it and 
the transcript of the proceeding before Judge Berman, most of 
that case is about dangerousness, your Honor, which is 
something the government is expressly not proceeding under here 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page140 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
because the conduct is 25 years old, among other reasons.   
And as to the risk of flight factors, Mr. Epstein had 
a prior felony conviction for conduct similar to that alleged 
in the indictment.  The package before Judge Berman was only 
two suretors, and any properties that were offered to 
Judge Berman at the proceeding were already subject to 
forfeiture and so could not be proposed.  So it is a very, very 
different situation in that case which was not raised by the 
government, and that's why we didn't address it. 
The last point which I meant to raise earlier, your
Honor, and I will end with this, and I should have raised it
earlier, what we sometimes see in bail cases, and I'm sure your
Honor has seen this, is the government says, well, the
defendant was hiding and we have evidence, your Honor, that the
defendant was making plans to leave the country.  That is the
situation, frankly, in the U.S. v. Zarger case, the case by
Judge Gleeson in 2000, that the government cites in its brief,
but of course doesn't discuss the facts.  There is nothing to
that effect here.  To the contrary, the defendant, our client,
is sitting in New Hampshire at the time of the arrest.  So
there is no evidence that there was some sort of imminence for
the court to consider.
So not to repeat all the arguments we made, we thank
the court for your time and for reading the submissions and
listening, and we just think, Judge, when you step back, the
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page141 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
concerns raised by the government can be addressed, they have
not carried their burden, and this is really a case that should
be subject to strict bail conditions to be set by the court,
among other things, to give us any reasonable chance of
fighting this -- preparing and fighting this case to trial.
Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you, counsel.
I am prepared to make my ruling.
Several provisions of federal law govern the court's
determination whether to detain the defendant or release her on
bail pending trial.  A court must apply that law equally to all
defendants no matter how high profile the case or well off the
defendant.  It is therefore important to begin here with a
clear articulation of the governing law.
It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell,
like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption of
innocence, that is, she is presumed innocent and the only
grounds for detention at this stage are, under the law, risk of
flight or danger to the community.
I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by 
the government at this stage in making this determination, but 
unless this matter is resolved by a plea, it will remain 
entirely for a jury to decide the question of Ms. Maxwell's 
guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment. 
Turning to the government's standard under Title 18 of
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page142 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
the United States Code, Section 3142, the court may order
detention only if it finds that no conditions or combination of
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person
as required and the safety of any other person in the
community.
In making a bail determination the court must consider
the defendant's dangerousness, if that's raised, and the
defendant's risk of flight.  A finding of dangerousness, if
that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing
evidence.  A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be
supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
In a case such as this one, where the defendant is
accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal
law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or
combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance
of the person as required.  That's citing 18 U.S.C. 3142(a)(3).
The Second Circuit has explained that, in a
presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a limited
burden of production, not a burden of persuasion, to rebut the
presumption by coming forward with evidence that she does not
pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.
Furthermore, once a defendant has met her burden of production
relating to these two factors, the presumption favoring
detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to
be considered among those weighed by the district court.  But
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page143 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
even in a presumption case, the government retains the ultimate
burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant presents a danger to the community, if that were an
issue, and a showing by the lesser standard of a preponderance
of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.
The statute further mandates that the court take into
account four factors in making its determination: the nature
and circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of the
evidence against the person, the history and characteristics of
the person, and the nature and circumstances of the danger to
any person or the community that would be posed by the person's
release.  That is 18 U.S.C. 3142(g).
Now that the court has laid out the federal statutory
requirements that guide its bail determination, it turns to the
government's specific application in this case for detention
pending trial.
The government does not argue, as has been repeatedly 
made clear today, for detention based on danger to the 
community.  Instead, it rests its argument for detention on 
Ms. Maxwell's alleged risk of flight.  As noted in a 
flight-risk case, the government bears the burden of proving by 
a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant 
presents an actual risk of flight and that no condition or 
combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant 
that would reasonably assure her presence in court.  And I'm 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page144 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
quoting there from United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, (2d 
Cir. 2019).   
The court concludes as follows:   
First, the nature and circumstances of the offense 
here weigh in favor of detention.  As noted, the crimes 
involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of 
are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor 
of detention.  And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed 
innocent until proven guilty, but if she were convicted of 
these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to 
incentivize her to flee.  In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58 
years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment 
if convicted.  And even if sentences are run concurrently, she 
would still face up to a decade of incarceration.   
Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to 
the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to 
consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the 
government in assessing risk of flight.  The government's 
evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.  
Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the 
indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed 
accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes.  The 
government also proffers that this witness testimony will be 
corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary 
evidence.  While the defense states that it intends to assert 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page145 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
legal defenses based on untimeliness and the nonprosecution 
agreement, those arguments are asserted in a conclusory fashion 
and have been directly countered by the government with 
citations to law.  Although the court does not prejudge these 
matters at this stage, based on what's been asserted thus far, 
they do not undermine the strength of the government's case at 
the bail determination stage.  Ms. Maxwell is now aware of the 
potential strength of the government's case against her and 
arguments countering these defenses, thus creating a risk of 
flight. 
Third, the court considers the defendant's history and
characteristics and finds that paramount in a conclusion that
Ms. Maxwell poses a risk of flight.  Ms. Maxwell has
substantial international ties and could facilitate living
abroad if she were to flee the United States.  She holds
multiple foreign citizenships, has familial and personal
connections abroad, and owns at least one foreign property of
significant value.  And, in particular, she is a citizen of
France, a nation that does not appear to extradite its
citizens.
Moreover, as the government has detailed in its
written submission and today, Ms. Maxwell possesses
extraordinary financial resources which could provide her the
means to flee the country despite COVID-19-related travel
restriction.  Given the government's evidence, the court
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page146 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
believes that the representations made to Pretrial Services
regarding the defendant's finances likely do not provide a
complete and candid picture of the resources available.
Additionally, while Ms. Maxwell does have some family 
and personal connections to the United States, the absence of 
any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the 
United States leads the court to conclude that flight would not 
pose an insurmountable burden for her, as is often the case in 
assessments of risk of flight. 
In sum, the combination of the seriousness of the
crime, the potential length of the sentence, the strength of
the government's case at this stage, the defendant's foreign
connections, and this defendant's substantial financial
resources all create both the motive and opportunity to flee.
Now, in the face of this evidence, the defendant 
maintains she is not a flight risk.  She notes that even after 
the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and even after the implication by 
authorities and the press that there was an ongoing 
investigation into his alleged coconspirators and that she may 
be implicated, she did not leave the United States.  She hasn't 
traveled, apparently, outside the United States in over a year  
To the contrary, through counsel, she has stayed in 
contact with the government.  The government doesn't contest 
these factual representations.  The fact that Ms. Maxwell did 
not flee previously, given these circumstances, is a 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page147 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
significant argument by the defense and it is a relevant 
consideration, but the court does not give it controlling 
weight here.   
To begin, in spite of the Epstein prosecution, 
Ms. Maxwell herself may have expected to avoid prosecution.  
After all, she was not named in the original indictment.  The 
case was therefore distinguishable from United States v. 
Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988), a case where release was 
ordered in part because the defendant took no steps to flee 
after a search warrant was executed against the defendant and 
he had been arrested on state charges several weeks earlier.   
Likewise, the mere fact that she stayed in contact 
with the government means little if that was an effort to stave 
off indictment and she did not provide the government with her 
whereabouts.  Circumstances of her arrest, as discussed, may 
cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the 
government, a claim that she makes throughout the papers and 
here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may 
face such serious charges herself may not have set in until 
after she was actually indicted.   
Moreover, Ms. Maxwell's argument rests on a 
speculative premise that prior to indictment Ms. Maxwell had as 
clear an understanding as she does now of the serious nature of 
the charges, the potential sentence she may face, and the 
strength of the government's case.  Whatever calculation and 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page148 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
incentive she had before this indictment may very well have 
changed after it.  In other words, her federal indictment may 
well change her earlier decisions and, given the defendant's 
resources, the court concludes that Ms. Maxwell poses a 
substantial actual risk of flight. 
Having made this determination, the court next turns
to whether the government has met its burden to show by a
preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions
could reasonably assure the defendant's presence.  The court is
persuaded that the government has met this burden and concludes
that even the most restrictive conditions of release would be
insufficient.
As an initial matter, the financial component of 
Ms. Maxwell's proposed bail package appears to represent a 
relatively small component of the access available to her and 
is secured only by a foreign property said to be worth about 
several million dollars.  But even a substantially larger 
package would be insufficient.  The extent of her financial 
resources is demonstrated by some of the transactions and bank 
accounts discussed in the government's submission and here 
today, and Ms. Maxwell has apparently failed to submit a full 
accounting or even a close to full accounting of her financial 
situation.  She has provided the court with scarce information 
about the financial information of her proposed cosigners, for 
example.  Without a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances and 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page149 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
the resources available to her, it is practically impossible to 
set financial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her 
appearance in court. 
Even if the picture of her financial resources were
not opaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.
Personally, the defendant not only has significant financial
resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those
resources and herself.  After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,
Ms. Maxwell retreated from view.  She moved to New England,
changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have
made anonymous transactions both big and small.  The defense
said that she did all of this not to hide from the government
but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press
scrutiny.  Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide
from the press and public, an assumption that the court does
not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent
conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade
detection, even in the face of what the defense has
acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.
Because of these concerns, even a bail package with 
electronic monitoring and home security guards would be 
insufficient.  Were she to flee, the defendant could simply 
remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have 
observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not 
prevent flight.  At best it limits a fleeing defendant's head

start.  Likewise, the possibility that Ms. Maxwell could evade 
security guards or monitoring is a significant one. 
The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that no combination of conditions could reasonably assure her
presence in court.  The risks are simply too great.
Defense cites a number of cases, including Esposito,
Dreier, and Madoff, as examples of serious and high-profile
prosecutions where the courts, over the government's objection,
granted bail to defendants with significant financial
resources.  But unlike those defendants, Ms. Maxwell possesses
significant foreign connections.
This case is distinguishable for other reasons, as 
well.  For example, the risk of flight in Esposito appears to 
have been based on the resources available to defendant, not 
foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from 
being found.   
In Madoff, the defendant had already been released on 
a bail package agreed to by the parties for a considerable 
period of time before the government sought detention.  The 
court there found there were no circumstances in the 
intervening period showing that the defendant had become a 
flight risk.  Because of these crucial factual differences, the 
court finds the cases not on point and not persuasive. 
Finally, in arguing for release, the defense raises
the challenges and risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page151 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

k7e2MaxC kjc
court is greatly concern by the Bureau of Prisons' ability to
keep inmates and detainees safe during the health crisis and
has found those considerations to be significant in other
cases.  The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several
reasons.  Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in
which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-19,
Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health
conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk
from the virus.  In other words, she doesn't argue that she is
differently situated than many other federal inmates with
respect to the risk posed by COVID-19.  In light of the
substantial reasons that I have already identified favoring
Ms. Maxwell's detention and her not making any arguments based
on her age or health, the COVID-19 pandemic alone does not
provide grounds for her release.
Second, the defense argues that pretrial release is
necessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, as
COVID-19-related restrictions at the prison at which she is
held, the MDC, will hamper her ability to meet counsel and
review documents.  The court notes that this case is at the
early stages.  There will be no hearings, let alone a trial,
for a significant period of time.  The case does stand in stark
contrast to United States v. Stephens, invoked by the defense,
in which this court at the beginning of the pandemic granted
temporary release to a defendant who was scheduled to have an
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page152 of 200

          SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
            (212) 805-0300
k7e2MaxC kjc
evidentiary hearing within one week.  In contrast, the
defendant is in the same position as any newly indicted
defendant who is incarcerated in terms of the need to access
counsel.  Indeed the defense's logic, all pretrial detainees
currently incarcerated at MDC and any federal facility would
need to be released to prepare their defense.  To the contrary,
the MDC has continued to develop procedures to ensure
attorney-client access at the facility, and the defendants
detained at MDC are able to conduct video and phone conferences
with their attorneys.  There is ongoing litigation before 
Judge Brodie in the Eastern District of New York about the
adequacy of attorney-client access at the MDC.  That is case
No. 19 Civ. 660.  Public filings from the court-appointed
mediator in that case describe the availability of legal phone
calls and video calls, video conferences for the purposes of
reviewing discovery between detained defendants and their
counsel, and that same report indicates that MDC is currently
developing a plan to resume in-person attorney-client visits in
the near future.
At this stage in this case and at this point in the 
pandemic in New York City, these measures are sufficient to 
ensure Ms. Maxwell has access to her counsel.  To further 
assuage these concerns, the court orders the government in this 
case, and frankly all others before it, to work with the 
defense to provide adequate communication between counsel and 
Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page153 of 200

k7e2MaxC kjc
client.  If the defense finds this process inadequate in any 
way, it may make a specific application to this court for 
further relief. 
In sum and for all of the foregoing reasons, the court
finds that the government has met its burden of showing by a
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is a risk of
flight and that no combination of conditions could reasonably
assure the presence of the defendant at court.
The defendant is hereby ordered to be detained pending
trial.
Counsel, is there anything else that I can address at
this time?
Mr. Cohen?
MR. COHEN:  Not from the defense, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Ms. Moe? 
MS. MOE:  Not from the government, your Honor.  Thank
you.
THE COURT:  All right.  My thanks to counsel for your
advocacy and my thanks to the staff of the court who worked
hard to provide the access to these proceedings in the
pandemic.
We are hereby adjourned.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Suppmt of her Renewed 
Motion for Release on Bail. 
As set fo1th more fully below, Ms. Maxwell is proposing an expansive set of bail 
conditions that is more than adequate to address any concern regarding risk of flight and 
reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's presence in court. Ms. Maxwell also provides compelling 
additional information in this submission, not available at the time of the initial bail hearing 
(which was held 12 days after her a1Test), that squarely addresses each of the COLut's 
concerns from the initial hearing and fully suppmts her release on the proposed bail 
conditions. This infonnation includes: (1) evidence of Ms. Maxwell's significant family ties in 
the United States; (2) a detailed financial repmt, which has also been reviewed by a fonner IRS 
CID special agent, concerning her financial condition and assets, and those of her spouse, for the 
last five years· (3) inevocable waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United 
Kingdom and France and expert opinions stating that it would be highly unlikely that Ms. 
Maxwell would be able to resist extradition in the implausible event of her fleeing to either 
country- (4) evidence rebutting the Government's contention that Ms. Maxwell attempted to 
evade detection by law enforcement prior to her aiTest and (5) a discussion of the weakness of 
the government's case against Ms. Maxwell, including the lack of c01rnborative, 
contemporai1eous documentaiy evidence in suppmt of the three accusers. 
Ms. Maxwell vehemently maintains her innocence and is committed to defending herself. 
She wants nothing more than to remain in this country to fight the allegations against her, which 
are based on the LU1COIToborated testimony of a handful of witnesses about events that took 
place over 25 yeai·s ago. The Comt should grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the resn·ictive 
conditions proposed below to ensme her constitutional 1ight to prepare her defense.

The Propo ed Bail Conditions 
Ms. Maxwell now proposes the following 28.5 million bail package which is 
exceptional in its scope and puts at risk everything that Ms. Maxwell has- all of her and her 
spouse's assets, her family's livelihood and the financial ecmity of her clo est friends and 
family-if she were to flee, which she has no intention of doing. 
• 
22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by 
s. Maxwell and her 
spouse and seemed by approximately $8 million in property and$ 00 000 in ca h. 
noted in the financial report the $22.5 million figure repre ents the value of all of 
Ms. Maxwell and her spouses assets. The three prope1tie 
ecuring the bond include 
all of the real property that Ms. Maxwell and her spouse own in the United States 
including their primaiy fainil re idence. 
• 
Five additional bonds totaling approximately $5 million co-signed by seven of Ms. 
Maxwell clo est friend and family members. The individual bonds are in amount 
that would cause significant financial hardship to these smetie if Ms. Maxwell were 
to flee. The e include:

service to Ms. Maxwell if she i granted bail and transfened to restrictive home 
confinement. This bond is significant as we ai·e unaware of a security company e er 
po ting its own bond in support of a bail application. The head of the security

identified an appropriate residence in the Ea tern District of ew York that has been 
cleared b Ms. Maxwell s security company.

Travel restricted to the outhern and Eastern Districts of ew York and limited as 
necessary to appear in cowt attend meetings with counsel and visit with

Ms. Maxwell will provide the owt irrevocable written waivers of her right to contest 
extradition in France and the United Kingdom.

Such other te1ms as the Cowt may deem appropriate under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. 
For her own safety M . Maxwell will also ha e on-premises security guards 24 
hours a day 7 days a week. The security guards will prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the 
residence at any time without prior approval by the ourt or Pretrial Service and will e cort 
her when she is authorized to leave. If the owt wishe to make private security a condition 
of her bond the guard could report to Pretrial ervices.1 We belie e these conditions are 
more than sufficient to reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell' pre ence in court.

New Information for the Court's Consideration 
The defense has devoted substantial time and effmt to compile information that was not 
available to Ms. Maxwell at the time of the initial bail hearing that squarely addresses each of the 
factors the Court considered at that hearing. Because of these effo1ts, Ms. Maxwell can now 
present the following additional infmmation in support of her renewed bail application: 
• 
Letter from Ms. Mal..'Well's spouse. This letter demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell has 
powerful family ties to the United States that she will not abandon. It describes the 
committed relationship between Ms. Maxwell and her s ouse, who is a U.S citizen, 
and how they lived a quiet family life together 
in the 
United States for over four years immediately prior to her anest. The letter further 
explains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public 
eye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense 
media frenzy and threats following the anest and death of Jeffi:ey Epstein threatened 
the safety and wellbeing of herself and her family, 
For 
these same reasons, Ms. Maxwell's spouse did not come fo1ward as a co-signer at the 
time of the initial hearing. (Ex. A). 
• 
Letters from numerous other friends and family members. These letters from 
Ms. Maxwell's other sureties and several family members and friends attest to Ms. 
Maxwell's strong, forthright character and their confidence that she will not flee. The 
sureties also describe the significant financial distress they would suffer if Ms. 
Maxwell were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. B- , W-X). 
• 
Financial report. The financial repmt, prepared by the accounting film Macalvins 
Limited, provides an accounting of Ms. Maxwell's financial condition from 2015-
2020, and discloses (i) all of her own assets, (ii) all assets held in trust, and (iii) all of 
the assets held by her spouse over that same time period. The report reflects that the 
total value of assets in all three categories is approximately $22.5 million, which is 
the amount of the proposed bond. (Ex. 0). 
• 
Report from former IRS agent. 
a fmmer IRS agent with over 40 
years of experience in criminal tax and financial fraud investigations, reviewed the 
Macalvins repmt and confinned that it presents a complete and accurate picture of 
Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets from 2015-2020. (Ex. P). 
• 
Statement from the person in charge of Ms. Maxwell's security. This statement 
rebuts the gove1mnent's claim that she attempted to hide from law enforcement at the 
time of her anest. (Ex. S). 
• 
Extradition waivers and expert affidavits. To address the Comt's concerns about 
extr·adition, Ms. Maxwell will present in-evocable written waivers of her right to 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page166 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 11 of 45 
contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France.2 We also pro ide 
opinions from experts in the extradition laws of the France and the United Kingdom 
stating that it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to resist extradition 
from either country in the event she were granted bail and somehow fled to either 
count:Iy which she has no intention of doing. Their opinion also state that any 
extradition proceeding would be re olved promptly. (Exs. T-V). 
• 
Lack of corroborating evidence. The government represented to the Court that it 
had contemporaneous documents ' including diary entries ' in suppmt of its case. 
(Dkt. 4 at 5). The defense ha now reviewed the discovery produced to date 
including all of the documents that the go emment described as the core of its case 
against Ms. Maxwell. 
explained more fully below the disco ery contains no 
meaningful documentaiy c01rnboration as to Maxwell and only a small number of 
document from the time period of the cons irac charged in the indictment. 
exam le, the ovemment roduced onl 
The eVIdence m this ca e boils down to witne s te timony about e 
place over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk the lack of co1Toboration 
only reinforce M . Maxwell's con iction that she ha been falsely accu ed and 
strengthens her long- tanding desire to face the allegations against her and cleai· 
her name in cow1. 
• 
Oppre sive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has now been detained 
for over 150 days in the equi alent of solitaiy confinement since she was 
indicted and auested on July 2 2020 despite the fact that she is not a suicide 
ri k and has not received a ingle disciplinaiy in.fraction. The draconian 
conditions to which Ms. Max ell is subjected are not only unjust and 
punitive but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery 
produced by the go emment and to participate meaningfully in the 
prepai·ation of her defense. Fmthennore the recent OVID-19 outbreak 
at the MD threatens her safety and well-being. 
M . Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Condition 
During her more than five months in. i olation Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has

was a1Tested and has shown no signs of abating. Indeed, in the three months after her a1Test, Ms. 
Maxwell was the subject of over 6,500 national media articles. That exceeds the number of 
a1ticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin 
"El Chapa" Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 90-day period following their anests, 
combined. The media coverage has rnthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has 
exposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences. 
But Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And 
her response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently 
denies them, and she is steadfastly committed to remaining in this country, where she has been 
since Epstein's aiTest in July 2019, to fight them in comt. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would 
have to abandon her spouse 
. She will not risk desn·oying tl1e lives 
and financial well-being of those she holds most deai· to live as a fugitive during a worldwide 
pandemic. In fact, eve1y action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein's a1Test up to 
the time of the first bail heai·ing was designed to protect her spouse 
from 
harassment, economic haim, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wai1ts to stay in ew York and 
have her day in comt so that she can cleai· her name ai1d return to her family. 
Justice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime· it is for the accused as well. 
Here, justice would be se1ved by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions 
we propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are 
unprecedented for a non-violent pren·ial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to 
participate in her defense and prepai·e for n·ial and which jeopardize her physical health ai1d 
psychological wellbeing.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Reconsideration of the Court's Bail Decision is Appropriate Under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(t) 
A prior determination that a defendant should not be released on bail does not preclude 
the Court from reconsidering its decision in light of new information. To the contrary, a bail 
hearing 
may be reopened .. . at any time before tJ:ial if the judicial officer finds that 
infonnation exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing 
and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release 
that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the 
safety of any other person and the c01mnu11ity. 
U.S.C. § 3142(f). 
Comts have relied on§ 3142(f) in revisiting bail detenninations where the defendant 
presents material testimony or documentaiy evidence that was not available to her at the time of 
the i.tlitial heai·i.t1g, even if the underlyi.t1g facts might have been withi.t1 the defendai1t's 
knowledge. For exainple, in United States v. Ward, 63 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (C.D. Cal. 1999), the 
comt granted the defendant's request to reopen llis bail hearing to present evidence of his 
i.tmnediate family's willi.t1gness to act as sureties for Iris release. Id. at 1207. The comt held that 
although "his i.tnmediate family and relatives were obviously known to" the defendant at the time 
of llis anest, his inability to contact them and secure thei.t· appearai1ce at his i.tlitial bail heai·ing 
justified reconsideration. Id. 
Coutts also have found§ 3142(f) satisfied where there is new i.t1formation regai·di.t1g the 
defendant's guilt or innocence or the nature and seriousness of the alleged offense-facts 
generally not known to a crimi.tial defendant at the ti.tne of the i.tlitial heai·i.t1g-paiticularly where 
the evidence m1denni.t1es the government's prior representations to the Comt regai·di.t1g the 
strength of its case. See, e.g., United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2020)

(Nathan, J.) (reconsidering bail decision based, in pait, on evidence suggesting government's 
case weaker thai1 alleged at initial hearing ai1d concern about possible outbreak of COVID-19 in 
BOP facilities)' United States v. Lee, No. CR-99-1417 JP, 2000 WL 36739632, at *3 (D. .M. 
2000) (reopening hearing to consider, inter alia, affidavits relating to seriousness of the offense 
that defendant "could have not have maitialed" in the 17 days between his indictment and the 
original heai·ing). Chai1ged circumstai1ces also have been found to satisfy§ 3142(f) even when 
the change was within the defendant's control. See United States v. Bradshaw, No. 00-40033-
04-DES, 2000 WL 1371517 (D. Kai1. July 20, 2000) (reopening heai·ing where defendant 
decided to seek substai1ce abuse treatment following initial heai·ing). 
In addition, the Corut may exercise its inherent authority to reconsider its own decision. 
"lAJ release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence protlered on reconsideration 
was known to the movant at the time of the original heai·ing." United States v. Rowe, 
o. 02 CR. 
756 LMM, 2003 WL 21196846, at* 1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003); see also United States v. 
Petrov, 
o. 15-CR-66-LTS, 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting 
"CoUit's inherent authority for reconsideration of the Colllt's previous bail decision"). 
Here, Ms. Maxwell has obtained substai1tial information ai1d evidence that was not 
available to her at the time of her initial detention heai·ing. Ms. Maxwell ai1d her coU11sel have 
also received ai1d reviewed the voluminous discovery produced by the government ( over 2. 7 
million pages), which was not available at the initial heai·ing and which raises serious questions 
about the strength of the government's case. As a result, Ms. Maxwell can now present for the 
Cou1t's consideration the additional evidence discussed above in suppmt of her bail application. 
It cannot be reasonably disputed that this new evidence meets the other requirement of 
§ 3142(t): that it have a "material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions ofrelease 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page170 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 15 of 45 
that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other 
person and the community." The evidence submitted herewith relates directly to factors on 
which the CoUit relied in its initial detention order. Among the bases for the CoUit's initial order 
denying bail were its findings that: 
Ms. Maxwell's lack of"significant tinnily ties" in the United States suggested 
''that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her" (Tr. 84)-
• 
the Cornt lacked "a clear pictme of Ms. Maxwell's finances and the resources 
available to her" that would allow it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87)" 
• "l c Jircrnnstances of her anest . .. may cast some doubt on the claim that she 
was not hiding from the government" (Tr. 85)-
• 
Ms. Maxwell "is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite 
its citizens" (Tr. 83)- and 
the government had protlered that its "witness testimony will be conoborated 
by significant contemporaneous documentary evidence" (Tr. 82). 
The additional evidence submitted herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have 
significant family ties in the United States· that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and 
reasonable bail conditions can be set that Ms. Maxwell has never attempted to hide from the 
government that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would 
be extradited from the United Kingdom or France· and that the government's case against her is 
not suppmted by the c01rnborating documenta1y evidence which the gove1mnent represented at 
the initial hearing. 
The evidence submitted herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have 
reasonably been obtained, assembled, and submitted in the 12 days between Ms. Maxwell's 
anest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether 
reasonable bail conditions can be set, and it shows that the proposed set of conditions will 
reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance in court.

II. 
Ms. Maxwell Should Be Granted Bail Under the Proposed Strict Bail Conditions 
A. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Deep Family Ties to the United States and Numerous 
Sureties to Support Her Bond 
Attached to this submission are letters from Ms. Maxwell's spouse and from 
munerous close family members and friends, many of whom have agreed to serve as smeties 
to support Ms. Maxwell's renewed bail application. (See Exs. A-N, W-X). Far from the 
cruel caricatme that the press has so recklessly depicted since the aiTest of Jeffrey Epstein, 
these letters demonstrate that Ms. Maxwell is generous, loving, and devoted to her family 
and friends, and that her life is finnly rooted in this country with her spouse-
. The signatories of these letters have known Ms. Maxwell for decades, and 
some for her entire life. All know her to be the antithesis of what the government has 
alleged. They trust her completely, including with their minor children. 
These people have stepped forwai·d to support Ms. Maxwell, despite the considerable 
risk that, if their names ever become public, they will be subjected to some of the same 
relentless and harassing media intrusion and personal threats that Ms. Maxwell has 
experienced for years. As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this 
country, the smeties have agreed to sign their own bonds and to post meaningful pledges of 
cash or prope1ty in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms. 
Maxwell were to violate her bail conditions. 
These letters directly address the concern the Comt expressed at the last bail heai·ing 
that Ms. Maxwell did not have "any dependents lorj significant family ties" to the United 
States. (Tr. 84). If Ms. Maxwell were to flee, she would be leaving behind the fainily that 
has been the center of her life 
, she would be abandoning her spouse ■

who a1·e already suffering without her presence and he would cause financial 
min to her elf and her closest family and friends. 
1. 
Ms. Maxwell is De oted to Her pouse -
and Would 
e er Destroy Her Family By Leaving the Countly 
The letter submitted by Ms. Maxwell's pouse powerfully demonstrate that M . 
Maxwell ha deep roots in the 
nited tates and is not a flight risk. The letter describes Ms. 
Maxwell's domestic life with her spouse 
in the 
four years prior to her arrest. Her pou e de cribes Ms. Maxwell as a 'wonderful and loving 
person ' who 
the person depicted in the indictment. (Ex. 
does not remotely resemble 
4). 
onti·a1y to the government s as ertion 
that M . Maxwell lived a rootles "transient" lifestyle (Dkt. 
at 9) 
s. Maxwell li ed a 
quiet family life with her spouse 
until 
Ep tein sanest in July 2019 ignited a media frenzy that has ripped the family apart. 
The person described in the criminal charges is not the person we know. I ha e 
never witnessed anything close to inappropriate with Ghislaine· uite to the 
conn· 
the Ghislaine I know is a wonderful and lovin 
(Id. 1 4-5). 
The letter from Ms. Maxwell s family members similaTly describe how Ms. 
Maxwell s home is in the United States with her spouse 
and how deeply 
committed she is to her family. See Ex. D 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page173 of 200

It is very ob ious that they lo e 
her deeply. They are an incredibly strono and close family unit. ')- Ex. F ( I 
joined a large family event hosted by Ghislaine and her 
husband in which she wa very hospitable and obviously ve1y much at home and in love. ')-
Ex. C ( '[Ghislaine] has called the United States her home for almost 30 years. She has deep 
affective family ties here in this country 
Most of 
all, her own husband-
are here. )- Ex. B ( 'I wi h ... to attest to the loving 
relationship she has with her husband 
many different occasions. ') . 
which I ha e personally witnessed on 
Indeed it wa because of Ms. Maxwell s devotion to her family and her de ire to 
protect her spouse 
from haras ment and threat that she went 
forward at the fir t bail hearing without relying on her spouse a a co- igner even though 
she knew his support would greatly strengthen her bail application. As her pouse writes: 
I did not initial! 
fo1ward 
• er of her first bail application ... 
ecause w 
from ferocious media 
(Ex. A 
13). Her spou e is coming forward now because he is deeply concerned about how 
she is being treated in the MDC and because the teITible consequence that he and Ms. 
Maxwell were tiying to prevent have already occuned.

(Id. 
10-11). 
Ms. Ma>..-well s spouse fully supports her and is prepared to put up all of his and Ms. 
Maxwell's a set to ensme that M . Maxwell abides by the t:rict conditions propo ed. He 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page174 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 19 of 45 
has agreed to co-sign Ms. Maxwell's $22.5 million bond and to post all three prope1ties he 
owns-all located in the United States and wmth a total of approximately $8 million 
combined as secu1ity for the bond. As the financial repmt discussed later in this 
submission makes clear, $22.5 million represents all of the cuITent assets of Ms. Maxwell 
and her spouse. One of the prope1ties is the family home where Ms. Maxwell, her spouse, 
have lived together 
. If Ms. Maxwell were to violate her bail 
conditions, which she has no intention of doing, she would be leaving her spouse ■ 
-
with virtually nothing. It is unfathomable that Ms. Maxwell would abandon her 
family, which she has fought so hard to protect, under these circumstances. 
2. 
A Nmnber of Ms. Maxwell's Family and Friends, and the Security 
Company Protecting Her, Are Prepared to Sign Significant Bonds 
In addition to her spouse, a number of Ms. Maxwell's family members and friends, 
many of whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have volunteered to step forward as co-
signers. These smeties, as well as the others who have written letters on Ms. Maxwell's 
behalf, know that Ms. Maxwell has never run from a difficult situation and will not do so 
now. To show the depth of their suppmt and their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will abide 
by her bail conditions and remain in this country, the sureties have agreed to sign separate 
bonds for Ms. Maxwell in amounts that aTe significant and meaningful to them, and each 
would cause severe financial hardship if she were to violate her bail conditions. 
For example, one smety, who is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post the only 
property she owns. This property is wmth approximately $1.5 million and is her "only nest-
egg for retirement." (Ex. C). She writes: 
I do not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating 
financially and in every way to my own fa~e house to be taken 
over by the Government due to a breach of-
bail conditions. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page175 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 20 of 45 
(Id.). Neve1theless, she has "no hesitation" posting her home because she knows "in every 
fibre of l herj being" that Ms. Maxwell ''will never try to flee." (Id.). 
Similarly, another surety who has agreed to sign a $3.5 million bond writes: 
This amount re resents the value of effective! all of m assets, including my 
home 
Ifl lost these assets 
because Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be 
financially ruined. I make this pledge without reservation because I know that 
Ghislaine will remain in the United States to face the charges against her. 
(Ex. F). Two other smeties, one of whom is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post cash bonds 
in the amount of $25,000, and another will post $2,000 in cash, which are significant 
pledges for these individuals. 
In addition to these bonds, the seCLffity company that will provide secLui.ty services to 
Ms. Maxwell upon her transfer into home confinement has agreed to post a $1 million bond 
in suppmt of her bail application. In our collective experience as defense counsel, we are 
not aware of a previous example where a security company has posted a bond for a 
defendant. The head of the seCLffity company has confirmed that they have never done this 
for a defendant in the past but are willing to do so here because of his company's "long-
standing relationship with Ms. Maxwell" and because he is "confident that she will not n·y 
to flee." (Ex. S). 
In SLUTI, these bonds reflect the depth of suppmt that Ms. Maxwell has from her 
family and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live 
without constant media harassment to suppmt her. (See Ex. B) ("Absolutely anyone who 
dares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... suppmt Ghislaine personally, gets it 
shot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational 
slaughtering."). Ms. Maxwell would never desn·oy those closest to her by fleeing, after they 
have risked so much to s uppmt her.

B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the 
Past Five Years 
The government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and 
completeness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Se1vices. 
(Dkt. 22 at 11-12; Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Comt stated that it did not have "a clear picture of 
Ms. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her" and therefore had no way "to set 
financial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearnnce in comt." (Tr. 86-87). 
To address the Comt's questions about Ms. Maxwell's finances, defense counsel 
retained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting finn in the United Kingdom, to conduct 
an analysis of Ms. Maxwell's assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins 
accountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial docmnents, including bank statements, 
tax retmns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear pictme of the assets held by 
Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms. 
Maxwell, and the source of those assets from 2015-2020. This analysis, which is based in 
substantial pa1t on docmnents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a 
significant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible 
to pe1fonn this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell's anest and the initial bail 
hearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained following her anest. 
The Macalvins rep01t was also reviewed by 
a Ce1tified Fraud Examiner 
and a fonner IRS Special Agent with over 40 years of experience in complex financial fraud 
investigations. As a Special Agent, -
investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal 
tax cases, including several in this District. -
reviewed the Macalvins rep01t and the 
U11derlying documents and dete1mined that it presents a complete and accurate surmnary of the 
assets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are cuITently, held in 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page177 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 22 of 45 
trust for the benefit of Ms. Maxwell, from 2015-2020. The Macalvins repmt and -
's 
repmt are attached as Exhibits O and P. 4 
As set fo1th in the Macalvins repmt, Ms. Maxwell's net wmth at the beginning of 
2015 was approximately $20,200,000. (Ex. 0 ,r 11). The 2015 tax retmn records the sale of 
a residential prope1ty in New York City for $15,075,000. The address of this prope1ty is 
. The proceeds of the sale were deposited at 
(Id. ,r 12). The sale of Ms. 
Maxwell's New York apartment coincided with her intention 
to 
live with her spouse 
(See Ex. A ,r 2). 
Ms. Maxwell manied her spouse in 2016 and commenced filing joint U.S. tax retmns 
from the 2016 tax year until today. (Ex. 0 ,r 13). In 2016 Ms. Maxwell transfened the 
majority of her assets into a trust controlled by her spouse and _
_ (Id.). All assets in 
the trust were distributed to Ms. Maxwell's spouse in 2019. (Id. at 9). Ms. Maxwell and her 
spouse's net wmth as of October 31, 2020 was approximately $22,500 000. (Id. ,r 15). 5 
There has been no alienation of any assets and no significant sum of cash has been 
transfe1Ted outside of the control of Ms. Maxwell or her spouse in the period from 2015-
We have not provided the Court with the appendices to the Macalvins rep01t because they are voluminous. If the 
Court would like copies of the appendices, we are happy to provide them. 
:, At her Pretrial Services interview, Ms. Maxwell reported that she believed she had approximately $3.8 million in 
assets, which included her London residence wmth approximately $3 million, and approximately $800,000 in bank 
accounts. Ms. Maxwell was detained at the time and had no access to her financial records and was tlying to piece 
together these numbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, these figures are a close approximation of 
the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her own name at the time of her atTest. (Id. at 9). For the reasons 
already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was relucta11t to discuss anything about her husband and expressed that to Pretrial 
Services. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page178 of 200

2020 other than daily li ing expenditures for her famil and for professional services in the 
defense of Ms. Maxwell from the charge she faces. (Id. 16). 
The Macalvins report confirms that Ms. Maxwell disclosed all of her foreign bank 
account in FBAR filings and properly di closed her bank accounts investments and other 
assets in her U .. tax filings at all times. (Id. 
30). The report al o explains that the 
transfers of funds between various accounts in the pa t few years which the go ernment 
highlighted in their initial bail submission (Dkt. 22 at 11-12) reflected movement between 
banks triggered by the closure of one banking relationship and the opening of new 
relationship as well mo ements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial 
inve tment . (Id. ,r 18). 
At the last bail hearing the government sugge ted that Ms. Maxwell' finances were 
' opaque ' and that she potentially had significant [] undetermined and undisclo ed wealth." 
(Tr. 27· Dkt. 22 at 11-12). The Macalvins repo1t lifts this cloud of unjustified intrigue and 
provides a st:raightf01wai·d an wer: Ms. Maxwell and her pou e currently ha e assets worth 
approximately 22.5 million. 6 
ccordingly the proposed bond amount of $22.5 million 
represents all of the couple s current as ets. 
The repo1i ftuiher shows that M . Maxwell ha no undisclo ed wealth and i not 
hiding assets o erseas. To the contra1y for the past se eral years Ms. Maxwell and her 
husband have disclosed their foreign assets by submitting FBAR filings regarding their

event, we ask that the Cow1 establish guidelines limiting what the government can do vvith the information.

foreign bank accounts. Ms. Maxwell is not trying to hide anything from the government. 
She has been entirely transparent with her finances and has filed accmate and timely joint 
tax returns with her spo use for the last four years, and she has put it all at risk of forfeiture if 
she flees under the proposed bail package. The Macalvins repmt and the repmt of-
-
give the COLut a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances. Accordingly, the COLut 
should have no pause about granting her on bail on the proposed terms. 
C. 
Ms. Maxwell Was Not Hiding from the Government Before Her Arrest 
1. 
Ms. Max well Was Tr in to Protect Herself 
Media Frenzy and from Physical Threats 
from a 
The letter from Ms. Maxwell's spouse also forcefully debunks the fiction that Ms. 
Maxwell was trying to conceal her whereabouts from the government before her a1Test, as 
the government argued at the first bail hearing. (Tr. 25). Ms. Maxwell made efforts to 
remove herself from the public eye solely to prevent the intrusion of the frenzied press into 
her personal family life and to protect herself, her spouse, 
from third parties 
who threatened violence. To suggest that she was a fugitive is patently wrong. 
After Epstein's a1Test and subsequent death in BOP custody, the media coverage of 
Ms. Maxwell spiked dramatically, as the press rushed to substitute Ms. Maxwell for Epstein 
as the target of the scandal. The graph below illustrates the volmne of press articles relating 
to Ms. Maxwell over the course of the last five years. 7 The graph shows that Ms. Maxwell 
was mentioned in news articles only sporadically between October 2015 and June 2019. It 
was not until Mr. Epstein's arTest in July 2019 that Ms. Maxwell was thrown into the media 
spotlight. For exarnple, Ms. Maxwell was mentioned in only 59 articles in total from 
October 2015 to June 2019. Ilrunediately following Epstein's auest, however, she was

again in November 2019 when the British tabloid The Sun ran an adve1tisement offering a 
£10,000 bounty for infonnation about Ms. Maxwell's whereabouts and it continued at a 
heightened level over the next several months.

This graph depicts in stark visual tenns the sea change in media attention that 
upended Ms. Maxwell's life at the time of Epstein's aITest. But it was not only harassment 
from the press that Ms. Maxwell suddenly encountered at this time. She also faced a deluge 
of threatening messages on social media in the days immediately following Epstein's aITest 
and death. (See Ex. Q). The hatred directed towards Ms. Maxwell in these posts is palpable 
and unsettling. Despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell was not chru·ged- indeed, not even 
mentioned-
in the Epstein indictment, and had not been charged with any crimes, the 
authors refeITed to her as a "crazy, pedophile, pimp, bitch" and a "subhuman c*nt," and 
called for her to "rot in jail." These people also encomaged all manner of violent acts

against 
s. Maxwell. For example one post stated 'they need to get this bitch n string her 
up by her neck ... f"'ckin monster. ' Another stated: 
I hope someone find her and kill her. That would be justice. Ob iously her 
lawyers know's [sic] where she is omeone should stick them up to batteries 
until we find out where she is. 
These posts were paiticularly chilling because some of them suggested that the 
authors 
might-
caiTy out the 
violent acts they had been threatening. For example in re ponse to an Augu t 14 2019 
news rep011 that M . Maxwell might be living in Mas achu ett , one per on wrote:

2. 
Ms. Maxwell's Counsel Was in Regular Contact with the Government 
Prior to Her AlTest 
At no time, however, did Ms. Maxwell intend to flee or hide from the government, as the 
government argued at the last bail hearing. In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her 
spouse's letter makes clear, after spending a few months away 
moved 
so that she could 
, Ms. Maxwell 
be within 
driving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. A 
12) (" l Ghislaine J was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against 
her, but to be witllin driving distance of New York."). Contrary to the impression given by the 
government, Ms. Maxwell was not "changing locations on multiple occasions" as if she were a 
fugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms. Maxwell moved into the house in ew Hampshire in 
December 2019, she remained there continuously for approximately seven months until her 
aITest. (See Ex. B) (" l S Jhe was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving 
around constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name."). 
Ms. Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with the government 
from the moment of Epstein's anest up the time of her own aITest, as would be customary in 
such situations. Defense counsel conesponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-
person meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2019, and also 
in Janua1y and March 2020. The timeline attached to this submission illustrates the extent 
of these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an oppmtunity to be heard in the 
event that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell. 
We were never given that oppmtunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern Distiict of 
New York, nor were we given any notice of her impending ruTest. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page184 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 29 of 45 
The government argued to the COLut that defense counsel's contact with the 
prosecutors in the months leading up to Ms. Maxwell's aITest prove little about her intent to 
stay in this country simply because she never disclosed her location. (Tr. 26). While Ms. 
Maxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the 
intensity of the press attention, her counsel would have provided that infmmation had the 
government asked for it. The government never did. 
3. 
Ms. Maxwell Did Not Tty to Avoid Anest, Nor Was She "Good At" 
Hiding 
Similarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell's 
anest, we would have willingly aITanged for her self-sLUTender. We were never given that 
chance. Instead, the government aITested her in a totally unnecessa1y early morning raid 
with multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year 
am1iversaiy of the anest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell 
was hiding from them. That is simply not the case. 
The government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell's aITest-in pa1ticular, that 
she moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that 
they found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil-evidence an attempt to evade law enforcement. 
(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the COLut, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself 
from the press, not t1ying to avoid aITest. (Tr. 54-57). 
Since the heai·ing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from -
-
the head of the secmity company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her anest, 
which was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). 
statement 
demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding aITest, but was following an agreed-upon 
procedme to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or secLuity. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page185 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 30 of 45 
According to _
, the secmity guard on duty that day had seen helicopters flying 
over the house, which he assumed to be the press. (Id.). When the guard saw the FBI 
agents walking up the driveway to the house, he again assumed that they were members of 
the press. (Id.) . Accordingly, he radioed Ms. Maxwell to ale1t her that the press was on the 
grounds and approaching the house. (Id.). In accordance with the procedme that Ms. 
Maxwell's secmity personnel had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away 
from the windows and into a safe room inside the house. (Id.). Ms. Maxwell was not trying 
to avoid aiTest" she was simply following the established security protocols to protect herself 
from what had been infonned was an ambush by the press. 
Regarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Comt at the initial 
bail heai·ing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone 
after the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed ce1tain comt records with the phone munber 
Lmredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having now reviewed the discovery produced by the government, 
it is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the "master spy" the government makes her out to 
be and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement. 
First, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of "Ten-ainai· Project, 
Inc.," which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell's charity. 
Second, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2020, just before her 
anest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities 
were using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of 
"G Max" that she was using as her primaiy phone, which was not covered. It would make 
no sense for her to t1y to wrap one phone in tin foil to avoid detection and not the other. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page186 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 31 of 45 
Indeed, the discovery reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms. 
Maxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her prima1y phone. 
In sum, the cellphone clearly shows that Ms. Maxwell was not "good at" hiding or 
that she was avoiding aiTest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 31-32). She was trying to 
protect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not captme by law 
enforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bai· to granting bail. The proposed conditions 
enslffe her presence at home in plain sight of-
(and the security guards), GPS-
monitored, and under su·ict Preu·ial supervision. 
D. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek 
Refuge in the United Kingdom or France 
At the initial heai·ing, the government ai·gued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen 
who has lived in the United States for almost 30 yeai·s, might tlee to the United Kingdom or 
France if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the counu·y for neai·ly a yeai· after 
Epstein's aiTest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) TI1e government asserted in its reply brief that Frai1ce "does not 
exu·adite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law." (Id.) At the bail heai·ing, the 
government represented that "France will not exu-adite a French citizen to the United States as a 
matter of law, even if the defendai1t is a dual citizen of the United States," and that exu·adition by 
the United Kingdom would be "lengthy" and "unce1tain" with bail "ve1y likely" pending the 
exu·adition proceeding. (Tr. 27 .) These asse1tions are inconect, paiticulai·ly given Ms. 
Maxwell's inevocable waiver of her exu·adition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom 
and France. 
As we noted for the Comt at the initial heai·ing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would 
attempt to flee the United States is entirely unfom1ded given that Ms. Maxwell had eve1y motive 
and oppmtunity to flee after the anest ai1d death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page187 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 32 of 45 
country. (Dkt. 18 at 12-14, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche 
of media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is now one of the most recognizable and infamous 
people in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be 
camped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell 
could somehow tlee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane), 
while being supe1vised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps 
on her every minute, without being caught, is absurd. 
To the extent the Comt is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her anest 
because the threat of prosecution has now crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms. 
Maxwell has addressed that concern head-on-she will execute iffevocable waivers of her right 
to contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers 
demonstrate Ms. Maxwell's firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges 
against her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the attached expe1t rep01ts, because of these 
waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully 
resist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely 
event she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition 
proceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (Id.). 
Comts have addressed concerns about a defendant's ties to a foreign state that enforces 
extradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a condition of 
release-including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U.S . citizens. 
See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, o. 99-1514, 1999 WL 1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999) 
(vacating di.strict comt's detention order and reinstating magistrate's release order, which 
required foreign citizen and resident to sign an "iffevocable waiver of extradition" as a condition 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page188 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 33 of 45 
ofrelease)" United States v. Salvagno, 314 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 ( .D .. Y. 2004) (ordering each 
of two defendants to "execute and file with the Clerk of the Cornt a waiver of extradition 
applicable to any nation or foreign territory in which he may be found as a condition of his 
continued release'')" United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 132-33 (D.D.C. 2004) 
(requiring Israeli citizen who lived in South Africa and had "no ties to the United States" to sign 
waiver of rights not to be extradited under Israeli and South African extradition treaties with 
United States)" United States v. Chen, 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1212 ( .D. Cal. 1992) (ordering as a 
condition of release that defendants "execute waivers of challenges to extradition from any 
nation where they may be found"). Moreover, a defendant's waiver of the right to appeal an 
extradition order has been recognized as an indication of the defendant's intent not to flee. See, 
e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1052 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (Judge Keenan found 
defendant's extradition appeal waiver "manifests an intention to remain here and face the 
charges against him"). 
In response to the government's assertions, Ms. Maxwell has obtained the accompanying 
repmts of expe1ts in United Kingdom and French extradition law, who have analyzed the 
likelihood that Ms. Maxwell, in the event she were to flee to the United Kingdom or France, 
would be able to resist extradition to the United States after having executed a waiver of her right 
to do so. Both have concluded that it is highly rn1likely that she would be able to resist 
extradition successfully. 
United Kingdom. With respect to the United Kingdom, submitted herewith is a repmt 
from David Peny ("Peny Rep."), a U.K. banister who is widely considered one of the United 
Kingdom's preeminent extradition practitioners. (Peny Rep. Annex B 2.1) (attached as Exhibit 
U). Mr. Peny has acted on behalf of many overseas governments in extradition proceedings· has 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page189 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 34 of 45 
appeared in the High Cou1t, House of Lords and Supreme Couit in leading extradition cases· and 
has acted as an expe1t consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on international cooperation. 
(Id.). In 2011 and 2012, Mr. PeITy was pa1t of a select team appointed by the U K. government 
to conduct a review of the United Kingdom's extradition anangements, a review that fonned the 
basis of changes to the 2003 Extradition Act. (Id. Annex B 3 .1 ). 
In Mr. Peny's opinion, it is "highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able 
successfully to resist extradition to the United States" in connection with this case. (Peny Rep. 
2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human 
rights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell's extradition, Mr. PeITy explains that Ms. 
Maxwell's waiver of her extradition rights "would be admissible in any extradition proceedings 
and, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the 
extradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete." (Id. 
24-39). 
Mr. PeITy's repmt also undercuts the government's representation at the initial hearing regarding 
likelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that "a person who absconded from laJ US criminal 
proceeding in breach of bail .. . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail" in a subsequent UK. 
extradition proceeding. (Peny Rep. 23). 
France. The accompanying repmt of William Julie ("Julie Rep.") reviews the French 
extradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expe1t on 
French extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European 
Union and regularly appears as an extradition expe1t in French comts. (Julie Rep.) (attached as 
Exhibit V). Mr. Julie explains that, contrary to the government's representation, "the extradition 
of a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law." (Id. at 1). 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page190 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 35 of 45 
Mr. Julie opines that the French entity with jurisdiction over the legality of extradition 
requests would not oppose Ms. Maxwell's extradition on the ground that she is a French citizen, 
and that it is "highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an 
extradition decree" against her. (Id. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms. 
Maxwell's U.S. citizenship· (ii) her inevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to 
the United States; (iii) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France 
in violation of strict bail conditions in the United States· (iv) the fact that a failure to extrndite 
would obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French comts for the same 25-year-old 
conduct alleged in the indictinent, which did not take place in France· and (v) France's 
diplomatic interest in accommodating an extr·adition request from the United States. (Id.). Mr. 
Julie adds that the extr·adition process would likely be "disposed of expediently"· where the 
requesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extr·adition request, "the extr·adition decree is 
generally issued in only a few weeks." (Id. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition 
proceedings are pending, "the French judicial authorities would most ce1tainly decide that lMs. 
Maxwellj has to remain in custody given her tlight from the USA and the violation of her bail 
tenns and conditions in this requesting State." (Id. at 12). 
Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her rights to 
contest extr·adition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the 
allegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee 
after being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extr·adited 
expeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no 
weight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countr·ies. 8 
~ Ms. Maxwell would also have very little incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French 
authorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell. See

E. 
The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of 
the Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell 
At the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Comt that "the evidence 
in this case is strong" and that the allegations of the alleged victims were "backed up l by J 
contemporaneous documents ... lincludingJ flight records, diaiy entries, business records, 
and other evidence." (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Comt credited those representations ai1d accepted 
the government's proffer that the witness testimony would be "c01Toborated by significant 
contemporaneous documenta1y evidence." (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of 
comse, could not rebut the government's representations at the heai·ing because the 
government had not yet produced discove1y. 
Since then the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of 
thousands of pages of discove1y, including the entire initial tranche of discove1y that the 
government represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell. 
The discove1y 
contains no meaningful documentary c01Toboration of the allegations whatsoever much less 
"significant" c01Toboration that the Comt was led to believe existed. The vast majority of 
the discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2000s ai1d the 
2010s, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (1994-1997). These documents 
include 
In fact, only 
Daily Mail, "French prosecutors probing Jeffrey Epstein over rape and abuse of children in Paris widen probe to 
include Ghislaine Maxwell to see if British socialite was involved in his offending," (Oct. 25, 2020), 
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/ruticle-8878825/French-prosecutors-probing-Jeffrey-Epstein-widen-probe-
include-Ghislaine-Maxwell html. 
The defense has not yet completed its review of the over 1.2 million documents produced on 
ovember 9, 2020 
ru1d 
ovember 18, 2020. This production includes documents ru1d images seized from electronic devices found at 
Epstein's residences in searches of his residences in 2019. Our initial review, however, shows that the documents 
ru·e from the 2000s ru1d 201 Os, well after the chru·ged conspiracy. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page192 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 37 of 45 
a very small fraction of the discovery pe1tains in any way to the individuals we believe to be 
the three complainants named in the indictment, and none of it conoborates any allegations 
of"grooming" or sexual assault or a conspiracy with Epstein involving Ms. Maxwell. 
For example, the government represented to the Comt that it had "diaiy entries" that 
conoborated the witness testimony, suggesting that more than one of the complainants had 
kept contemporaneous diai·ies that implicated Ms. Maxwell. (Dkt. 4 at 5). The discove1y 
produced thus far contains only 
In addition, the flight records that the government touted at the bail heaiing, which 
include

The disco ery also does not contain any police rep01ts in which the people we 
belie e to be the complainants reported the alleged crimes to law enforcement. To the 
contra1y the only police reports provided are exculpatory. 
In sum, the di co ery contains not a single contemporaneous email text mes age 
phone record, diary ent:J.y police rep01t or recording that implicates Ms. Maxwell in the 
1994-1997 conduct underlying the conspiracy charged in the indictment. The few 
documents in the discove1y that pertain to the people we belie e to be the three 
complainants referenced in the indictment do little if anything to support the go emment' s 
case against Ms. Maxwell:

In addition, the discove1y appears to show that 
-
the go ernment did not is ue subpoenas for documen related to Ms. Maxwell until 
after Epstein s death. Although the discove1y does not include the grand jm subpoenas 
them elve the subpoena returns appear to indicate that the government began i suing 
subpoenas for M . Maxwell' financial information on ugu t 16 2019 six days after 
Epstein s death, and is ued additional ubpoenas in the months that followed. The facts 
strongly imply that government only chose to pmsue a case against Ms. Maxwell-who wa 
not named in the Epstein indictment-because the main ta1·get Jeffrey Epstein had died in 
their cu tody. The lack of con-oboration in the disco e1y confmns that the ca e against Ms. 
Maxwell wa an afterthought and was re erse engineered ba ed on allegations of 25-year-
old conduct from a small number of alleged victims. 
Thus notwithstanding the statement in the go ernment' bail ubmission we have 
been provided with no meaningful documentary conoboration in this case. It appear that 
the evidence in this ca e boil down to witness testimony about events that allegedly took 
place o er 2 year ago. Far from creating a flight risk the lack of con-oboration only 
reinforces Ms. Maxwell's convi tion that she has been falsely accused and t:rengthens her 
long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and cleru· her nrune in court. This 
factor should weigh heavily in favor of granting Ms. 
axwell bail.

F. 
The Proposed Bail Package Is Expansive and Far Exceeds What Is 
Necessary to Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell's Presence in Court 
In light of the additional infonnation that Ms. Maxwell has provided in connection 
with this submission, which responds to each of the concerns raised by the government at 
the initial bail hearing, the government cannot meet its bmden to establish that no set of bail 
conditions would reasonably assme Ms. Maxwell's appearance in comt. The proposed bail 
package is exceptional in its scope, addresses all of the factors that the Comt considered in 
evaluating risk of flight, and is more than sufficient to wanant her release from BOP 
custody and transfer to restricted home detention. 
CoUits in this Circuit have ordered release of high-profile defendants with financial 
means and foreign citizenship on bonds in lower amounts with less or no security with similar or 
less restrictive conditions:

The Comt should also not give any weight to the gove1mnent's speculative assertions that 
others might provide money and other support to Ms. Maxwell if she were to flee. (Dkt. 22 at 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page196 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 41 of 45 
11-12). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government 
might raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not 
the standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The 
legal standard required by the lBail Refmmj Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute 
guarantees."). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail 
conditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to 
protect since Epstein's arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail. 
G. 
The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions 
that Impact Ms. Maxwell's Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense 
Granting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past 
few months have shown that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately pa1ticipate in her defense and 
prepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued 
confinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but 
also meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell's ability to review the voluminous discove1y produced by 
the government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense. 
Ms. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention now over five months 
in de facto 
solitaiy confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence AD MAX to 
supervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and ai·e tantamount to imprisonment 
as a defendant convicted of capital murder ai1d incarcerated on death row. In fact, multiple 
wai·dens ai1d interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they 
have never seen anything like her cmTent regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms. 
Maxwell is subjected ai·e not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms. 
Maxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions ai·e an 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page197 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 42 of 45 
exaggerated response to Epstein's death, etlectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP's own 
negligence with respect to Epstein. 11 
Counsel has attempted to address the restrictions in numerous letters, emails and calls to 
the MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than 
repeating these points here at length, we refer the Comt to our letter to the MDC warden, dated 
October 29, 2020, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of 
confinement. 12 TI1ese include: 
• 
De Facto Solitary Confinement 
• 
Excessive Surveillance 
• 
Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching 
• 
Deprivation of Food 
• 
Deprivation of Sleep 
• 
Deprivation of Co1mnunication with Family and Friends 
• 
Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel 
The conditions of Ms. Maxwell's detention are utterly inappropriate, and totally dispropmtionate 
for a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal histmy facing non-violent charges a 
quarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepai·e her defense ai1d 
compromise her physical health ai1d psychological wellbeing. 
In addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with 
numerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discove1y that the government 
has produced to her thus fai·. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous 
occasions. As we advised the Court in our letter of October 23, 2020, defense counsel first 
These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not 
received any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is 
the highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is 
being constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever 
released from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide. 
The Warden never responded to the letter. In our response to the government's 90--day status report concerning 
MDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Colllt and coll11Sel. Following 
Court directive for a report from the MDC, MDC Legal submitted a letter that recited BOP policy but failed to 
address a number of concerns. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page198 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 43 of 45 
ale1ted the gove1mnent on August 27, 2020 that there were significant pmtions of the first three 
discove1y productions that Ms. Maxwell could not read. (Dkt. 66). Despite numerous attempts 
to fix these problems over the succeeding weeks, including producing a replacement hard drive 
containing these productions, the problems were not resolved and the replacement hard drive was 
broken. In addition, the fomth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense 
ale1ted the govenunent to these problems, contained some of the same teclmical problems and 
included a significant number of m1readable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the 
sixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has 
not had access to a complete set ofreadable discovery for over four months.13 Ms. Maxwell 
caimot defend herself if she caimot review the discovery. 
Most recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quai·a11tine. On 
ovember 18, 2020, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in 14-day quai·antine due 
to contact with a statler who tested positive. TI1e revolving teain of guards assigned to Ms. 
Maxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their own COVID outbreaks, 
heightens her exposure to the virus. As repmted by the associate wai·den to the Criminal Justice 
Advismy Board on December 2, MDC does not mai1date testing ainong its staff A temperature 
check and response to a few questions does little to detect an asymptomic caiTier. TI1e constant 
strip seai·ching, touch wai1ding, ai1d in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for 
exposure to COVID-19. 
On ovember 18, 2020, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC, 
which it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive 
containing all of the discovery. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the 
technical problems. We note, however that now that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has 
access to the laptop from 8am-5pm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot 
because of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page199 of 200
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 44 of 45 
Ms. Maxwell's quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal 
visits. TI1is is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID infection within and outside the 
MDC. Within a two-day period from December 1 to December 3, 55 inmates tested positive, 
compared with 25 from March to December 1. As of the date of this filing, the BOP repo1ts 80 
MDC inmates and staff with COVID.
Iflegal visits are suspended, it will fmther limit our 
ability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms. 
Maxwell and will fmther compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court 
obse1ved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs "substantial medical and secmity 
challenges would ahnost certainly arise." Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Cou1t to 
weigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens. 
CONCLUSION 
Ghislaine Max well is committed to defending herself and wants nothing more than to 
remain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the 
allegations against her and clear her name. She is detennined to ensure that her sureties and her 
family do not suffer because of any breach of the tenns of her bond. We have presented a 
substantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Couit and the government, which 
contains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell 
remains in ew York and appears in cou1t. TI1e Cou1t has the obligation to ensure that a 
defendant's constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. TI1e c01Tect-and only 
legitimate-decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.

THE GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO THE DEFENDANT’S 
RENEWED MOTION FOR RELEASE 
The Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s 
renewed motion for release on bail, dated December 8, 2020 (the “Renewed Bail Motion”).  Five 
months ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court concluded that the 
defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of conditions could 
ensure her appearance in court.  The defense now asks this Court to reverse that finding by 
essentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package.  However, 
at the July 14, 2020 bail hearing in this case, this Court rejected the defendant’s request to keep 
the record open to allow the defendant to do precisely what she has done here—namely, present 
more detailed information about her finances and a more concrete package—determining that 
further information about her financial picture would be irrelevant because no combination of 
conditions could ensure this defendant’s appearance.  The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct, 
and the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it.  The offense conduct outlined in the 
Indictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the 
defendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 4 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page5 of 165

demonstrated ability to live in hiding for the long term.  In short, the defendant poses an extreme 
flight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this 
District, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect. 
BACKGROUND 
As detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of 
multiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997.  The defendant 
played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage 
in sex acts with Epstein.  The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s 
abusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse.  Together, the 
defendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences 
in different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and 
subjection to sexual abuse.  Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath 
during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.   
Based on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts.  Count One 
charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage 
in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Two charges the defendant with enticing 
a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2.  Count 
Three charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to 
participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Count Four charges the defendant 
with transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.  
Counts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.

On July 2, 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) arrested the defendant.  
Following extensive briefing, on July 14, 2020, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing.  In its written 
and oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.   
Among other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in 
the United States (Dkt. 18 at 2, 3, 12), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the 
defendant (Id. at 20), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the 
Government through counsel following Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. 18 at 12-13; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued 
that the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. 18 at 14-16; Tr. 55-56), and 
argued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69).  Responding 
to the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and 
six proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if 
the Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail 
determination.  (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are 
insufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and 
confidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be 
able to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for 
purposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does 
not affect the analysis.  That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires 
it, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to 
leave the proceeding open for a week and allow us to come back, if the court has concerns about 
the number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues, 
we think that, now that we have some ability to breathe a little bit, that we should be able to pull 
this together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 70 (“And if the court needs more information 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 6 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page7 of 165

from us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that 
we can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).   
The Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a 
serious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.  First, the 
Court found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,” 
given the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the 
potential penalties those charges carry.  (Tr. 82).  Second, the Court determined that “[t]he 
government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple 
victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well 
as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.”  (Id.).  
Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the 
defendant poses a risk of flight.  (Tr. 83). 
In addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial 
international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,” including “multiple foreign 
citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of 
significant value.”  (Tr. 83).  The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a 
nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.”  (Id.).  The Court further found that the 
defendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to 
Pretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid 
picture of the resources available.”  (Tr. 83-84).   
Although the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal 
connections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents, 
significant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 7 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page8 of 165

would not pose an insurmountable burden for her.”  (Tr. 84).  The Court recognized the defense 
arguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in 
contact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have 
expected that she would not be prosecuted.  (Tr. 84-85).  The Court also noted that the defendant 
“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest 
. . . may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that 
she makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may 
face such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.”  (Tr. 85).  
Based on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of 
demonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.”  (Tr. 86).  
The Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be 
insufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance.  (Id.).  Acknowledging that the defense’s initial 
bail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a 
substantially larger package would be insufficient.”  (Id.).  Although the defendant “apparently 
failed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the 
Court implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that 
“[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be 
appropriate.”  (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)).  That conclusion was informed not only by the 
defendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding 
those resources and herself.”  (Tr. 87).  “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide 
from the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct 
underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has 
acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.”  (Id.).  Given that sophistication, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 8 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page9 of 165

the Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient” 
because the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards.  (Tr. 87-88).  Finally, 
the Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-19 and the difficulty of 
preparing a defense with an incarcerated client.  In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant 
has no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-19 
and emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial.  (Tr. 89-90). 
Viewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending 
trial.  (Tr. 91). 
APPLICABLE LAW 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of 
flight.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).  When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the 
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual 
risk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the 
defendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’”  United States v. Boustani, 932 
F.3d 79, 81 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007)).  The 
Bail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government 
seeks detention based on flight risk: (1) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) 
the weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the 
defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.”  See 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(g).  If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will 
reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the 
detention of the person before trial.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 9 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page10 of 165

Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with committing an offense involving 
a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, that no 
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as 
required and the safety of the community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E).  In such a case, “the 
defendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut 
that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”  
United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 
254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001)).  The act of producing such evidence, however, “does not 
eliminate the presumption favoring detention.”  Id.  Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to 
be considered among those weighed by the district court,” while the Government retains the 
ultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight.  Mercedes, 254 F.3d 
at 436. 
When the Court has already issued a detention order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the 
detention hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was 
not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of 
whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the 
defendant.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(f).  Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an attempt to reopen 
a detention hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”  
United States v. Petrov, 15 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 
2015).  Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered 
even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the 
original hearing,” United States v. Rowe, 02 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 
May 21, 2003), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page11 of 165

reconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or 
incorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”  
Petrov, 2015 WL 1102286 at *3. 
DISCUSSION  
Having already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial 
bail hearing in this case, the defense now asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the 
same arguments it already rejected.  The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same 
claims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest 
that the Court already found unpersuasive.  To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents 
new information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly known to the defendant 
at the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made 
available (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention.  Ultimately, nothing in the 
Renewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant 
“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her 
appearance.  (Tr. 86).  All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor 
of detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-
reasoned and thorough prior decision. 
A. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense 
The first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case.  The 
egregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and 
the Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature 
and circumstances of the offense support detention.  The charges in the Indictment describe 
horrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims.  If convicted, the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 11 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page12 of 165

defendant faces up to 35 years of incarceration, and may very well spend the remainder of her 
natural life in prison.  The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility 
upon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the 
chance.   
In light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have 
asked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.  
Additionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a written 
statement urging the Court to deny bail, which is attached as Exhibit A hereto.  That unanimous 
view of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of 
detention.  First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to 
evade justice.  Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s 
conduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy 
sentence.  Third, as discussed further below, the victims’ attention to this case and willingness to 
convey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial, 
demonstrating the strength of the Government’s case. 
In short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order. 
B. The Strength of the Evidence 
Further incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong.  As 
the Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July 14, 2020 hearing, the central evidence 
in the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who 
will each independently describe how the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual 
activity with Jeffrey Epstein.  (Tr. 82).  The Indictment itself contains a description of the accounts 
these victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 12 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page13 of 165

Further, and as set forth below, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence, 
including contemporary documents and other witnesses. 
In challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.  
At the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested 
heavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago.  (See Dkt. 18 at 19; Tr. 64-65).  
Having received and reviewed the discovery, the defense now contends the Government’s 
corroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates 
defense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.1  (See Mot. at 30-
33). 
None of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor.  Three 
different victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in 
Epstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors.  As demonstrated by the information 
outlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the 
same techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in 
sex acts.  Each victim will describe how the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions 
about her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein.  Each victim will describe the 
use of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity.  Each victim will describe how the 
presence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation.  In other words, 
this is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially 
corroborating each other. 
At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to 
make on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.  
After receiving discovery, the defense now appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least 
insofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 13 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page14 of 165

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 14 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page15 of 165
In addition to conoborating each other, these victims' accounts are finiher corroborated by 
other witnesses and by documentary evidence, which has been produced in discove1y. That 
evidence will make it viliually indisputable that these victims in fact met and interacted with both 
the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein at the times and locations they describe. 
Beyond this documentary 
evidence, additional witnesses will confum that both the defendant and Epstein knew and 
interacted with ce1iain minor victims when those victims were minors. In other words, the 
Government's evidence strongly conoborates the victims' testimony that they met and interacted 
with the defendant and Epstein at pariicular· times and in pariicular places. 
In the instant motion the defendant complains that the documentary evidence relevant to 
the three victims identified in the Indictment and produced to date is not sufficiently voluminous 

and that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.  
Leaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive 
sexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence.  But, as 
described above, 
.  To the extent other 
corroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which 
will detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein.  In other 
words, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of 
multiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses 
confirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and 
places they say they did, makes this a strong case.  (Tr. 82).   
Taken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it 
was at the time of the defendant’s arrest.  Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in 
favor of detention. 
C. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of 
dollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets, 
and a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding.  The bulk of the 
arguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims 
that this Court already considered at the July 14, 2020 hearing.  Any new information provided 
was either known by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the 
Court analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 15 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page16 of 165

French law, is simply incorrect.  Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at 
avoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention. 
First, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties.  She is a citizen 
of three countries and holds three passports.  As was already noted at the original hearing and is 
again evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends 
who live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank 
account.  (Tr. 83).  In an attempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes 
the defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States, 
and United States citizenship.  But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its 
original detention decision.  (See Tr. 84; Dkt. 18 at 2, 12).  The letters and documentation included 
in the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute.  What that 
documentation does not do, however, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this 
country that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.  
Indeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children 
and has no current employment.  (Pretrial Services Report at 3). 
The Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that 
would prevent her from fleeing.  Although the defendant now claims her marriage would keep her 
in the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to 
Pretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the 
defendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.”  (Id.).  On this point, it bears 
noting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permitted to live with 
 if granted bail, 
not her spouse.  Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only now come forward to 
support the defendant should be afforded little weight given that he refused to come forward at the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 16 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page17 of 165
-

time of her arrest.  While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s 
desire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s 
inconsistent statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her 
marriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States.3  As for the defendant’s asserted 
relationships with 
 and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not 
appear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New 
Hampshire, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States.  In 
any event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad, 
and, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad. 
In addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further below, 
the defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition.  Attempting 
to downplay that concern, the defense relies on two legal opinions to claim that the defendant can 
irrevocably waive her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom and France.  
(Mot. at 25; Def. Ex. U; Def. Ex. V).  But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable 
waiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance 
whatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position 
on the extradition of its nationals.  (Mot. at 25).   
As an initial matter, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before 
such a waiver would even come into play.  Even assuming the defendant could be located and 
apprehended—which is quite an assumption given the defendant’s access to substantial wealth and 
Adding to this confusion, bank records reflect that when the defendant and her spouse established 
a trust account in or about 2018, they filled out forms in which they were required to provide 
personal information, including marital status.  On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse 
listed their marital status as “single.”  It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital 
status to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial 
Services in this case, discussed further below.

demonstrated ability to live in hiding—numerous courts have recognized that purported waivers 
of extradition are unenforceable and effectively meaningless.  See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 
425 F. Supp. 3d 306, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“The Defense proposal to give advance consent to 
extradition and waiver of extradition rights is, in the Court’s view, an empty gesture.  And, it comes 
into [play] only after [the defendant] has fled the Court’s jurisdiction.”); United States v. Morrison, 
No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2016); United States v. Kazeem, 
No. 15 Cr. 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug. 3, 2015); United States v. Young, Nos. 12 
Cr. 502, 12 Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, at *7 (D. Utah Aug. 27, 2013); United States v. Cohen, 
No. C 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v. Bohn, 
330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. 2004); United States v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 
1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000); United States v. Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1028, 1035 (S.D. 
Fla. 1985).4  For very good reason: Any defendant who signs such a purported waiver and then 
flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of the waiver, and will get to do so in 
The defense argues that several courts “have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a 
foreign state that enforces extradition waiver by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver 
as a condition of release.”  (Mot. at 26).  In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved 
the release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of 
whether a waiver of extradition is enforceable.  See United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 
1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,” 
and presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to 
appeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for 
arraignment, and that his country’s government committed to ensuring his appearance at trial);

820 F. Supp. 1205, 1209, 1212 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (reconsidering pretrial release where case had 
“taken a number of surprising turns,” including the “suppression of video evidence, the 
indeterminate stay of proceedings, the overall uncertainty of the government’s evidence”); United 
States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 133 (D.D.C. 2004); United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-1514,

M, 2008 WL 4306750, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 22, 2008) (distinguishing Cirillo on the facts and

Canada, a fact the court in Cirillo did not mention in its opinion”).

the jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chose to flee).  The Department of 
Justice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world 
that would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding.  Indeed, the defendant’s own 
experts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she 
would be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she 
could avoid extradition.   
Such an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is 
a citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States.  To confirm this fact, after 
receiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry 
of Justice (“MOJ”) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would 
extradite a French citizen to the United States.  In response, the MOJ provided the Government 
with a letter setting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite 
its citizens to the United States.  That letter in its original French, as well as an English translation 
of the letter, are attached hereto as Exhibit B.  In that letter, the MOJ makes clear that France does 
not extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual 
citizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside 
the European Union.  See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. 13 Cr. 315 (WHP), 2013 WL 
3802012, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins 
can avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”). 
In other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to 
France, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition.  Any purported waiver 
of extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in 
France because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 19 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page20 of 165

to other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States.  As set forth in 
Exhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the 
extradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for 
which extradition is requested.”  (Ex. B at 3).  That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries 
is of no moment.  (See id.).  In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States 
and France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France 
systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial 
authorities.”  (Id. at 4).  Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any 
anticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be 
recognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.   
The defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French 
authorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition 
of a French citizen who was also a United States citizen.  Thus, there is no precedent to draw from 
in that regard.”  (Def. Ex. V. at 2).  That is not so.  France has previously rejected such a request.  
For example, in 2006, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in 
to French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to committing a murder in the United States.  
Despite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law 
enforcement despite the repeated requests of OIA and U.S. officials.  See Durbin, Schakowsky,

Justice on August 22, 2007 which provides that the “Ministry of Justice considers the American-
born, U.S. citizen Peterson to also be a French national and that the extradition request has been 
denied”).  Indeed, the Government is unaware of any instance in which France has ever extradited 
a French citizen to the United States.  (See Ex. B at 4 (“[T]he principle of non-extradition of 
nationals is a principle of extradition law from which France has never deviated outside the 
framework of the European Union.”)).  Simply put, the Court was correct when it determined at 
the initial bail hearing that France does not appear to extradite its own citizens.  (Tr. 83). 
The defendant’s supposed waiver of her extradition rights with respect to the United 
Kingdom should similarly be afforded no weight.  Although an anticipatory waiver of extradition 
may be admissible in extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom, such a waiver is by no means 
binding, authoritative, or enforceable.  See United States v. Stanton, No. 91 Cr. 889 (CHS), 1992 
WL 27130, at *2 & n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 1992) (denying modification of defendant’s bail where 
defendant indicated willingness to waive extradition proceeding by providing extradition waivers, 
as British authorities advised that extradition waivers were possible only in cases where the 
fugitive actually appeared before a British magistrate after the filing of an extradition request, and 
concluding that such a waiver was not an “enforceable undertaking”).  Under the United 
Kingdom’s Extradition Act of 2003, consent to extradition is permitted, “if (and only if) [a person] 
has the assistance of counsel or a solicitor to represent him in the proceedings before the 
appropriate judge.”  Extradition Act 2003, § 127(9), https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/ 
2003/41.  As such, a judge in the United Kingdom must independently evaluate any waiver of 
extradition in real time, thereby necessarily rendering any anticipatory waiver executed before the 
defendant is found in the United Kingdom meaningless.  Id. at §127.  In other words, consent given 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 21 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page22 of 165

to authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant 
could easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.   
Further, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition 
based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of 
time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition.  See, e.g., id. at 
§§ 82, 83A, & 91.  Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary 
of State still has the discretion to deny extradition.  See id. at § 93.  The Government understands 
from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain, 
and subject to multiple levels of appeal.  Moreover, even where the process is ultimately 
successful, it is lengthy and time-consuming. 
Ultimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge 
being extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the 
United Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries.  And, of 
course, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with 
which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.  The defendant’s written waivers of 
extradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant 
will not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be 
impossible.  Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a 
defendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants 
pending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2000 WL 1872012, at *2 (6th Cir. 
Dec. 12, 2000); Cilins, 2013 WL 3802012 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433, 
443 (D.N.J. 2007) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of 
detention.”).  Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 22 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page23 of 165

complicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims 
who would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.  The strong possibility that the 
defendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.  
Second, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her 
sophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection.  The Court noted as much in denying 
bail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion.  (Tr. 87).  
Indeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even 
to the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut 
herself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding.  She did so by purchasing a home 
using a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing 
her assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card 
under other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.   
The Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media 
frenzy that followed Epstein’s death.  (Tr. 44, 56-57).  However, as the Court already recognized, 
regardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly 
establishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family 
and friends in order to avoid detection.  (Tr. 87).  Rare is the case when a defendant has already 
demonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when 
purchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances.  Here, the defendant has 
indisputably taken all of those steps.  She was able to do so because of both her finances and her 
willingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.  
And she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 23 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page24 of 165

the media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were 
searching for her.   
The charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s 
skill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that 
the defense already made at the prior hearing.  (See Dkt. 18 at 14-16).  That said, there is still 
reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law 
enforcement.  It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government, 
never disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged.  (Tr. 
53-54).  The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in 
the year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new 
on that score.  (Id.).  Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI attempted to serve 
the defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2019.  Prior to her arrest, 
the Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and 
October of 2019, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March 
of 2020.  At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the 
defendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed. 
Moreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their 
directives and ran away from the arresting agents.  Although the defense has submitted an affidavit 
from the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s 
determination that detention is appropriate here.  The defense already informed the Court at the 
July 14, 2020 bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if 
her security was breached.  (Tr. 55).  Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who 
entered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 24 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page25 of 165

(Def. Ex. S ¶ 12).  Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant 
when they first approached her.  Thus, even if the defendant was following her private security’s 
protocol when she fled, she did so knowing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents, 
not members of the media or general public.  Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly 
in light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of 
her private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement.  Further, the act of 
wrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press.  The 
defense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number 
had been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only 
number of which law enforcement was aware.  In other words, there is still reason to believe, as 
the Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade 
not only the press, but also law enforcement.  (Tr. 87). 
Third, the defendant has access to significant wealth.  At the initial bail hearing, the 
Government expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8 
million she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than 
candid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control.  (Tr. 28-30, 72-73).  The finances 
outlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has 
access to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial 
Services (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a 
person of substantial means with vast resources.5  The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive 
As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than 
those disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more 
fulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could 
provide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.  (See Tr. 87).   
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 25 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page26 of 165

this Court already weighed in favor of detention, and confirmation of that deception only 
reemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions. 
Now, the defense has submitted a financial report that reflects the defendant has 
approximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial 
Services.  (Def. Ex. O).  Accepting the financial report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s 
proposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.  
Not only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,6 but she would 
also have a $2 million townhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself.  In 
other words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would 
still have millions of dollars at her disposal.  She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and 
family to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their 
losses.  In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately 
following her release,7 given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her 
proposed bail package.  
Moreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future 
revenue streams to which the defendant may have access.  The financial report only addresses the 
defendant’s assets without detailing her income at all.  The defendant has similarly provided the 
Court with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective 
In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in 
unrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other 
items. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the 
retainer paid to her attorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled. 
The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents 
of the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond 
amount.  These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as 
a result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.

basis in addition to their substantial assets. The financial repmt submitted by the defense is also 
careful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. 0 at 
5). 
The financial repmt fmther shows that the defendant apparently spent the last five yearn 
moving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through 1:Iusts to her spouse. 
That pattern suggests the defendant has used the process of 1:I'ansfening assets as a means to hide 
her 1:Iue wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant cmrently has 
approximately $3 .4 million worth of assets held in her own name which is close to the amount of 
wealth she told Pre1Ii.al Services she possessed in July 2020. lmpoliantly, though, that number 
omits the millions of dollars of assets that she has 1:I·ansferred from her name through 1:Iust accounts 
to her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire propeliy where the 
defendant was residing when she was anested. 8 This confirms that the Government was right to 
be concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services. 
That practice fmther demons1I·ates the defendant's sophistication in hiding her assets and 
maintaining assets that are under her conu-ol in other names. 
In this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than 
$20 million to her mani.age, but that her husband brought only $200,000.9 (See Def. Ex. 0 at 10). 
On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Preu-ial Services that the property was owned 
by a corporation, and that she was "just able to stay there." (Pre1I·ial Services Repmt at 2). The 
defendant's lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be 1:Iusted to comply with bail 
conditions. 
The Government has not been able to verify this financial information-in pa.Ii because the

Setting aside whether the defendant's spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the 
financial repo1t the vast majo1ity of the assets contained in the repo1t itself apparently 01iginated 
with the defendant. (See Def. Ex. 0 at 10). Based on the report, it seems cleai· that the defendant 
slowly funneled the maj01ity of her wealth to trnsts and into her husband's name over the last five 
yeai·s. As a result, if the Comt were to grant the defendant's proposed bail package and the 
defendant were to flee, her spouse would p1imaiily lose the money that the defendant gave him 
rather than his own independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee she would 
largely be sacrificing her own money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse 
co-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant's submission does not change the Government's 
position at the original bail heaiing that the defendant has considerable financial resomces, and 
could live a comfortable life as a fugitive. 
The combination of all these factors including the defendant's foreign ties, demonstrated 
ability to live in hiding, and financial resomces, confnm that the defendant's chai·acte1istics 
continue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention 
this is not one of the rai·e cases in which a private secmity company could conceivably be 
considered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019). The 
Second Circuit has squai·ely held that "the Bail Refo1m Act does not pe1mit a two-tiered bail 
system in which defendants of lesser means ai·e detained pending trial while wealthy defendants 
ai·e released to self-funded p1ivate jails," and that "a defendant may be released on such a condition 
Comt need not resolve this question, however, because regai·dless of whether the defendant's 
husband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the 
financial rep01t is that the vast majority of the spouse's reported assets upon which the proposed 
bond is based, originated with the defendant meaning he would not be losing his own money if 
the defendant fled. 

only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.”  Id.  Here, detention is warranted 
not only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and 
willingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and 
the strength of the evidence, among other factors.  The defense suggestion that the defendant’s 
private security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus.  There 
is no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which 
she has no personal stake losing $1 million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape 
conviction and sentencing.  Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is 
not warranted here.  Id. at 83. 
Relatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers 
little value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to 
prevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed.  At best, home confinement and electronic 
monitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cutting the bracelet.  See United States v. 
Banki, 10 Cr. 008 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2010) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen 
who was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 20 
years’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff’d, 369 F. 
App’x 152 (2d Cir. 2010); United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773 (JG), 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 
(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention

Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099 (JG), 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) (same).  Simply 
put, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient 
to ensure that this defendant appears in court.

In urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its 
initial briefing and at the July 14, 2020 hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are 
consistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with 
financial means and foreign citizenship.”  (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. 18 at 16, 21; Tr. 48-51).  The Court 
should reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into 
consideration when denying bail.  “A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle 
for relitigating issues already decided by the Court.”  Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 307, 313 
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court already considered and rejected 
the defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the 
courts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial 
resources.”  (Tr. 88).  Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases, 
including United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), United States v. Dreier, 
596 F. Supp. 2d 831 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of 
reasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.”  (Tr. 88; see id. 
(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources 
available to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being 
found”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail 
package agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought 
detention”)). 
The Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.  
Among the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant 
financial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”

(Tr. 87).  Following the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the 
defendant are readily distinguishable.  See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 
1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other 
things, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that 
he traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government 
committed to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v. Bodmer, No. 03 Cr. 947 (SAS), 
2004 WL 169790, at *1, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2004) (setting conditions of bail where defendant 
arrested abroad had already consented to extradition to the United States and finding that the 
Government—whose argument was “based, in large part, on speculation” as to the defendant’s 
financial resources—had “failed to meet its burden”).  And there is support in the case law for 
detaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff’d, No. 19-344, 2019 WL 2070656 (2d Cir. 
Mar. 7, 2019) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk 
of flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible 
sentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent 
international travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries 
without extradition”); United States v. Patrick Ho, 17 Cr. 779 (KBF), Dkt. 49 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 
2018) (ordering defendant detained based on defendant’s risk of flight and citing the strength of 
the Government’s evidence, lack of meaningful community ties, and “potential ties in foreign 
jurisdictions”); United States v. Epstein, 155 F. Supp. 2d 323, 324-326 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (finding 
that defendant’s dual citizenship in Germany and Brazil, lucrative employment and property 
interests, and lack of an extradition treaty with Brazil weighed in favor of detention despite the 
fact that defendant and his wife owned “substantial” property and other significant assets in the

United States).  Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged 
here involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing 
further in favor of detention.  See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.  
“Each bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the 
Court.”  Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326.  Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government 
seeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign 
citizenship.  Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign 
countries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,” 
“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with 
a demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons 
discussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense, 
the strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a 
substantial flight risk.  (Tr. 82-91).  The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and 
the defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior 
finding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. 
D. Conditions of Confinement 
Finally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential 
harms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing.  (Tr. 42, 68-
69).  As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release. 
The defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review 
her discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her attorneys.  Specifically, the 
defendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.  
Also during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 32 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page33 of 165

counsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant 
has access to legal visits.  Due to the recently implemented lockdown at the MDC, visitation is not 
currently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call 
with legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday.  Defense counsel will 
also be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed.  Given those facts, the defense 
argument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—
a patently incorrect claim.  
The defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the 
Government, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material 
defense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents 
provided by defense counsel.  The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical 
difficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives.  These steps included 
modifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the 
defendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a 
laptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.10  Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to 
review some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her 
discovery.   
The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the 
laptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer 
thirteen hours per day seven days per week.  The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because 
the MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the 
laptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends.  The MDC 
previously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and 
arranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would 
not have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine.  Now that she is out of 
quarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 33 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page34 of 165

As to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that 
the defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the 
ground, and that drive has been replaced.  When the defense informed the Government that the 
drive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have 
IT staff review the drive.  In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable 
and declined to have IT staff review it.  Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that 
the defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC.  At the defense’s request, 
the Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive 
so that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.11  Throughout 
the defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns 
regarding access to discovery and counsel.  The Government will continue to work with MDC 
legal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with 
defense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial. 
As to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the 
defense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.  
Indeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while 
detained is to be away from general population.  Unlike other inmates in protective custody, 
however, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her own 
shower, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her own phone to use, and has her own 
television.  Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention 
On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery 
produced to date contains little of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and 
the simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have 
temporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which, 
according to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 100   Filed 12/18/20   Page 34 of 36
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page35 of 165

other inmates in protective custody.  Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the 
defendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly attuned to any complaints the defendant has raised, 
and following initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has 
ensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from 
which she can supplement her diet.   
The MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the 
institution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.  
In that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit, 
searches of her cell, pat downs when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual 
inspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which 
every other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution.  MDC legal counsel has assured 
the Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls 
and visits with legal counsel.  To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring 
of the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the 
security of the institution and the defendant. 
With respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-19, the Government recognizes, as 
it did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility.  At least for 
this defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked.  When the defendant 
was potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested 
negative, and then was released from quarantine.  As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the 
defendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications 
from COVID-19.  (Tr. 89).  For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that 
the pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.

CONCLUSION 
As this Court previously found, the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.”  
(Tr. 86).  Nothing in the defense submission justifies altering the Court’s prior conclusion that 
there are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in 
this case.  Accordingly, the Renewed Bail Motion should be denied.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
Annie Farmer submits the following statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed 
motion for bail. 
*** 
I appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this matter and once more 
request that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of 
myself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell.  Ghislaine 
Maxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure 
that she stands trial for her crimes.  I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she 
exploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her 
position of power to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would 
fit with her long history of anti-social behavior.  
Drawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of how she has 
lived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children 
and young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has 
demonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and 
demonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.  
She was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with 
what many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including 
repeatedly lying about me and my family.  Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle 
relying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.  
Maxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her own welfare, and 
that she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She 
will not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially 
for her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others. 
She would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued 
imprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last 
several years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more

important to her than being connected. Even more concerning, is if she is let out she has the ability 
to once again abuse children and the painful consequences of that type of trauma can last a lifetime.  
I implore the Court to make sure that Ghislaine Maxwell does not escape justice by keeping her 
incarcerated until her trial.

Par !'intermediaire d'Andrew .f-'JNKELMA_,_"\J, magistrat de liaison 
Ambassade des Etats-Unis d'Amiriqtte a Paris 
J'ai l'honneur de vous informer de ce que !'article 696-2 du code de procedure penale frarn;:ais 
prevoit que la France peut extrader << tottte personne n 'qyant pas la nationaliti franraise i>, etant precise que la 
nationalite s'apprecie au jour de la commission des faits pour lesquels !'extradition est demandee 
(article 696-4 1 °). 
Le code de procedure penale franc;:ais proscrit done de maniere absolue !'extradition 
!'extradition d'une personne qui avait la nationalite franc;:aise au moment de la commission des faits 
pour lesquels l' extradition est demandee. 
La loi penale etant d'interpretation stricte, il n'y a pas lieu de discriminer entre les nationaux 
et les binationaux. A partir du moment ou elle etait franc;:aise au moment des faits, la personne reclamee 
est inextradable, peu importe qu'elle soit titulaire d'une ou de plusieurs autres nationalites. 
Lorsque le refus d'extrader est fonde sur la nationalite de la personne reclamee, la France 
applique le principe « aut tradere, aut judicare » selon lequel l'Etat qui refuse la remise doit juger la 
personne. Ainsi, !'article 113-6 du code penal donne competence aux juridictions franc;:aises pour juger 
des faits commis a l'etranger par un auteur de nationalite franc;:aise. 
Certains Etats, en general de droit anglo-saxon, acceptent d'extrader leurs nationaux et n'ont 
en revanche pas competence pour juger les faits commis par leurs ressortissants sur un territoire 
etranger. C'est notamment le cas des Etats-Unis d'Amerique.

L'article 3 du Traite bilateral d'extradition signe le 23 avril 1996 entre les Etats-Unis 
d'Amerique et la France stipule que << l'Etat requis n'est pas tum d'accorder !'extradition de l'un de ses 
ressortissants, mais le Pouvoir exicutif des Etats-Unis a la faculte de le faire, discritionnairement, s'ii le juge 
approprii JJ. 
En application de ce Traite et du principe general de non-extradition des nationaux en droit 
franc;:ais, la France refuse systematiquement d'accorder !'extradition de ressortissants franc;:ais aux 
autorites judiciaires americaines tandis que les autorites americaines acceptent regulierement d'extrader 
leurs ressortissants vets la France. 
Il convient de faire observer que le principe de non-extradition des nationaux vaut non 
seulement a l'egard des Etats-Unis mais egalement de taus les autres Etats a l'exception des Etats-
membres de l'Union europeenne, aux termes de la loi du 9 mars 2004 transposant la decision-cadre 
du 13 juin 2002 sur le mandat d'arret europeen qui prevoit que la remise de la personne reclamee ne 
pourra pas etre refusee au seul motif de sa nationalite franc,:aise. 
Ce temperament au principe de non-extradition des nationaux s'inscrit clans le contexte 
particulier de la construction de l'espace judiciaire europeen qui s'inscrit lui-meme clans un processus 
d'integration politique tres specifique entre les Etats-membres de l'Union europeenne. Ce haut niveau 
d'integration politique existant entre les Etats membres de l'Union europeenne va de pair avec une 
certaine homogeneite, au sein de ces Etats, en matiere d'echelle des peines ainsi qu'en ce qui concerne 
les modalites d'amenagement de peine, les Etats membres etant lies par les memes obligations 
internationales (notamment les obligations decoulant de la convention europeenne de sauvegarde des 
droits de l'homme et des libertes fondamentales et de la jurisprudence de la Cour europeenne des 
droits de l'homme). 
En tout etat de cause, le principe de non-extradition des nationaux est un principe du droit 
de l'extradition auquel la France n'a jamais deroge en dehors du cadre de l'Union europeenne.

Paris, December 11, 2020  
Mr. Keeper of the Seals, Minister of Justice 
to 
Department of Justice (DOJ) 
Through Andrew FINKELMAN, Liaison Magistrate  
Embassy of the United States of America in Paris 
I have the honor to inform you that Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure 
provides that France can extradite "any person not having French nationality," it being specified that 
nationality is assessed on the day of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested 
(Article 696-4 1°). 
The French Code of Criminal Procedure therefore absolutely prohibits the extradition of a 
person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is 
requested. 
The penal law being of strict interpretation, there is no reason to discriminate between 
nationals and binationals. From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person 
claimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities. 
When the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France 
applies the principle "aut tradere, aut judicar" according to which the State which refuses the 
surrender must judge the person. Thus, Article 113-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the 
French courts to judge acts committed abroad by a person of French nationality. 
Some countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the 
same time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts committed by their nationals on foreign territory. This is 
particularly the case of the United States of America.

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page42 of 165

Article 3 of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty signed on April 23, 1996 between the United 
States of America and France stipulates that “The requested State is not bound to grant the extradition 
of any of its nationals, but the Executive Power of the United States has the right to do so at its 
discretion if it deems it appropriate.”   
In application of this Treaty and of the general principle of non-extradition of nationals under 
French law, France systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American 
judicial authorities, while the American authorities regularly agree to extradite their nationals to 
France. 
It should be noted that the principle of non-extradition of nationals applies not only to the 
United States but also to all other States except the Member States of the European Union under the 
terms of the Law of March 9, 2004 transposing the framework decision of June 13, 2002 on the 
European arrest warrant, which provides that the surrender of the requested person may not be refused 
on the sole ground of his French nationality. 
This principle of non-extradition of nationals fits into the context of the construction of the 
European judicial area which itself is part of a very specific process of political integration between 
the Member States of the European Union. This high level of political integration existing between the 
Member States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these 
States in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the 
member states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising 
from the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and 
from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights). 
In any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from 
which France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The only issue before the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure 
Ms. Maxwell's appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put 
before the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant 
her release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have committed to signing a bond in the full 
amount of their net worth, regardless of the ownership of the underlying assets. She has 
proffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are 
U.S. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have 
pledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona tides of 
these proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm, 
which was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, setting forth a statement of her 
financial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not 
challenge the report's findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to 
give up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard 
travel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the 
initial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate -
and there is no "significant contemporaneous documentary 
evidence" that corroborates its case. 
With regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict 
bail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute 
for Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the 
significant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot 
be eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee 
against all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887,888 n.4,

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page50 of 165
892-93 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one ofreasonable 
assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released 
unless there are "no conditions" that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed 
package satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the 
Testimony of Three Witnesses 
In evaluating the strength of the government's case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on 
the government's proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by 
"significant contemporaneous documentary evidence." (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The 
government now expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the 
government's response that it has no "significant contemporaneous documentary evidence"- in 
fact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all- and that its case against Ms. Maxwell 
is based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified, 
concerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no 
specificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged 
incidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling. 
The few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government-which 
are the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing- pertain to Epstein, 
not Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that 
(Gov. Mem. at 11 (emphasis added)). The 
government further states that 
(Id. 
(emphasis added)). The strength of the government's case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 7 of 15
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page51 of 165
here. Whether or not the accusers' recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to 
the strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell. 
The only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal 
value. The government references 
■ (Id. at 11 ). But even the government concedes that, at best, 
It is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly "groomed" the accusers or 
knowingly facilitated or participated in Epstein's sexual abuse of minors will come solely from 
the testimony of the three accusers. The government's case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests 
entirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses. 2 Moreover, the substantive 
counts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-I . 
It is also telling that the government does not even attempt to rebut the defense's assertion that it 
did not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death 
of Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact 
The government also proffers that they will have "additional witnesses." (Gov. Mem. at 11). But these are not 
"outcry" witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers. 
Instead, they will testify only that "both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims 
when those victims were minors." (Id.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have "met and interacted with" 
someone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing. 
One of the witnesses has submitted a letter to the Court. While the CYRA permits the right to be heard, the letter 
should be given no legal weight in the Court's bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 331-
(E.D.N.Y. 2005) 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 8 of 15
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page52 of 165
as a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein. 3 The government's case is not what it represented 
to the Comt at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail. 4 
II. 
The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden 
A. 
The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell's Substantial 
Ties to the United States, Including Her Spouse 
The government inconectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new 
infonnation and that the Court was "akeady awaTe of' the defendant's friends and family in 
the United States. (Gov. Mem. at 13). The government ignores that, since the initial bail 
heaTing, Ms. Maxwell's spouse has come fo1ward as a co-signor and has submitted a 
detailed letter describing his committed relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over fom years 
and the important role she has played, and continues to play 
-
It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell's closest friends and family, many of 
whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come fo1ward, at considerable personal risk, 
to support her bond with pledges of assets or letters of suppoli. This information which 
was not available to the Comt at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell's 
strong ties to this countiy and weighs heavily in favor of bail. 
Rather than address the merits, the government attempts to dismiss the significance 
of Ms. Maxwell's relationship with her spouse noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial 
Services that she was in the process of getting a divorce and that her spouse did not step 
fmwaI"d as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing. (Id. at 13-14). The government is entirely 
Moreover, the government failure to request---- regardless of whether it was legally obligated to 
do so, shows that the government has accepte~mts without serious scrutiny. Given the 
government's ongoing Brady obligations, it is unsettling that the government would simply accept 
Contrary to the government's assertion, the defense has not abandoned our legal challenges to the indictment. 
(Gov. Mem. at 10 n.l). We believe we have strong arguments that have only gotten stronger with the production of 
discovery. We will be making those arguments to the Com1 in our pretrial motions to be filed next month. 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 9 of 15
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page53 of 165
mistaken. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of getting 
a divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to 
protect him 
from the terrible consequences of being associated with her. 
Nevertheless, in the weeks following the initial bail hearing, 
She and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue 
discussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any 
reason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer. In sum, the 
government has offered nothing but unsupported innuendo to suggest that Ms. Maxwell's 
relationship with her spouse 
is not a powerful tie to this country. 
The government's assertion that Ms. Maxwell must not have a close relationship 
with 
is particularly callous 
and belied by the facts. (Gov. Mem. at 14). As her spouse explains, 
(Ex. A ,-r 12). 
B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Thoroughly Disclosed Her Finances and Pledged All of 
Her and Her Spouse's Assets in Support of Her Bond 
The government's attempts to rebut the financial condition report are unavailing. 
Significantly, the government does not contest the accuracy of the report, nor the 
voluminous supporting documentation. In fact, the government has proffered nothing that 
calls into question the report's detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets for 
the last five years, which addresses one of the Court's principal reasons for denying bail. 
Rather than question the report itself, the government attempts to argue that Ms. 
Maxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets. (Gov. Mem. at 22-23). 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 10 of 15
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page54 of 165
The report shows nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was sitting in a jail cell at the time, 
was asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best 
estimate of the assets she held in her own name, which the government concedes she did 
with remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements. 5 
The government's arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will 
view at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the 
government asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated "sophistication in hiding her assets" 
and characterizes her transfers to a trust as "funneling" assets to her spouse to "hide her true 
wealth." (Id. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly 
sophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully 
disclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets 
disclosed in the financial report, whether they are owned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are 
included in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees. 
The government further argues that the fmancial condition report shows that Ms. 
Maxwell has access to millions of dollars of "unrestrained funds" that she could use to flee 
the country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (Id. at 23). That 
characterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell 
has procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property. 
Second, the $4 million controlled by her spouse 
could only be liquidated with considerable difficulty. 
The government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future 
contingent assets and income that may never materialize. (Id. at 23-24). For example, ■ 
Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
about her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview. 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 11 of 15
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page55 of 165
Similarly, the financial report does not include 
a future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical 
and current assets. Even so, Ms. Maxwell has no certain future income stream. Her spouse 
-
and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the 
reference to 
is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knowledge of-
But the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package 
with multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of 
their assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell's wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It 
is a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial 
consequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The 
proposed bail package does exactly that. 6 
C. 
The Government's Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is "Adept" at Hiding and 
Therefore a Flight Risk Is Specious 
The government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had "an 
expertise at remaining hidden," and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive. 
The government's argument that her spouse's moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the 
majority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (Id. at 24-25). Regardless of whose m~gin with, 
all of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her spouse- - will be 
left with nothing. Furthennore, the government's assertion that they could not verify the spouse's financial 
infonnation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (Id. at 24 n.9). The 
defense provided the spouse's current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank. 

(Gov. Mem. at 20).  The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing 
a pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding 
and somehow forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee.  (Id.).  These arguments are just further 
evidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible 
light.  As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne 
out of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.  
Moreover, they are not predictive of flight.  There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the 
measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would 
then willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice.  To the contrary, she 
remained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case. 
D. 
Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly 
Unlikely 
The government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as 
to France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee 
with absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver.  (Gov. Mem. at 14).  The 
government misses the point:  Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate 
her ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment 
to remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K. 
experts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver 
as part of any extradition request. 
In an attempt to counter William Julié’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that 
the French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the 
government attaches a letter from the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) that references neither 
Mr. Julié’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.  (Gov. Mem., Ex. B).  But

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page56 of 165

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 13 of 15
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page57 of 165
as Mr. Julie's accompanying rebuttal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ letter ignores that the 
extradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absence of an 
international agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at 1 ). This rule is necessitated by the French 
Constitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (Id.). 
Thus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition 
treaty between the United States and France provides for it-which it does. (Id. at 3). 
The government's reliance on a 2006 case-in which France refused to extradite a 
French national who was also a U.S. citizen- provides no precedent as to how a French court 
would rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the 
United States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (Id. at 2-3). Nor does it 
undermine Mr. Julie's opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries 
has executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a 
U.S. court, it is "highly unlikely" that an extradition decree would not be issued. (Id. at 3). 
The government offers no rebuttal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell's U.K. extradition 
expert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry's opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be "highly 
unlikely" to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be 
admissible in any extradition proceeding, and that--contrary to the government's representation 
at the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)- bail would be "extremely unlikely." (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at 
, 39). Mr. Perry's addendum opinion (attached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the 
waiver would be "a highly relevant factor" in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of 
extradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Id. , 3). 7 
Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general "discretion to deny extradition" after a 
court has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). That discretion is limited to a handful of 
exceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell's case. (Id. ,i,i 4-5). 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103   Filed 12/23/20   Page 14 of 15
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page58 of 165
Finally, the government's argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country 
other than the United Kingdom and France holds her- and any defendant- to an impossible 
standard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). By the 
government's reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail, 
because there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they 
had no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be 
enforced. However, "Section 3142 does not seek ironclad guarantees." United States v. Chen, 
820 F. Supp. 1205, 1208 (N.D. Cal. 1992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell's ties to France and 
the United Kingdom- where she has not lived for nearly 30 years- create a flight risk, her 
extradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it. 8 
E. 
The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail 
The government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell, 
though quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become 
infected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell's mouth, 
which heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has now surged to 113 positive 
cases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that "[i]t 
has not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue." As the Court is well 
aware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be 
discontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her 
release on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed. 
Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France 
of Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,

WILLIAM JULIE 
AVOCAT A LACOUR 
Response to the government's memorandum in opposition to the defendant's renewed 
motion for release. 
I was asked to review the United States government's memorandum and notably pages 15 to 
alongside the French Minister of Justice's letter dated 11 December 2020 produced as 
Exhibit B to this memorandum. 
The French Minister of Justice's letter (Exhibit B) 
The letter of the French Minister of Justice, on which the US government relies to argue that 
the French government does not extradite its citizens outside the European Union and thus to 
the United States, quotes Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, which 
provides that France can extradite "any person not having French nationality". 
It remains unclear whether the author of such letter had actually access to my opinion which is 
not even quoted, and more generally it seems the letter responds to a question which 
unexpectedly was not disclosed. 
The letter fails to mention, however, that Article 696 of the same Code provides that provisions 
of the French Code of Criminal Procedure on the conditions of extradition apply in the absence 
of an international agreement providing otherwise (Article 696 of the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure: "In the absence of an international agreement stipulating otherwise, the 
conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this 
chapter1. These provisions shall also apply to matters which would not have been regulated by 
international conventions"). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international 
agreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: "Treaties 
or agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an 
authority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by 
the other party"). It follows from these provisions that the key question is whether France may 
extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or 
under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France 
extradites its citizens under French legislation. 
In accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of 11 March 2004, 
published by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying how the then recently 
amended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the 
following: "Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of 
The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-1 to Article 696-47-1 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, 
and thus includes Article 696-2.

subsidiarity of domestic law in relation to international instruments as stated by the 
aforementioned law of 10 March 1927: the legislative provisions on extradition are applicable 
only in the silence or in the absence of international conventions."2 
It follows from the provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure that the 
key question is whether France may extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty 
between the USA and France and/or under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union 
and the USA, not whether France may extradite its citizens under French legislation. 
As previously outlined, the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not preclude 
the French government from extraditing a French national and must therefore be distinguished 
from a number of other international agreements signed by France which contain a clear 
prohibition to that extent. The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French 
government discretion as to whether or not to extradite its own citizens to the USA. 
It is noted that the letter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue. 
The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case 
In support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine 
Maxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French 
American citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2007. 
The Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, I am not aware that this 
case has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the 
support of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has 
referred to in its memorandum, I doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case: 
as mentioned by the 2007 letter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the 
French Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision 
refusing extradition on August 22nd 2007, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the 
beginning of August 2007). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision 
from the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could 
have been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed 
on to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process. 
A refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the 
French Conseil d 'Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative matters, as for 
example the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the 
French authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested ( Conseil 
d 'Etat, 15 October1993, no. 142578). In the Peterson case, the American government did not

AVOCAT A LACOUR 
challenge the refusal before French courts, while such challenge could have led to a judicial 
review of the request, in accordance with the ordinary extradition procedure. 
Secondly, in the absence of a published judicial decision, it is impossible to determine what the 
outcome of this case would have been if it had come before the courts. 
Third, as was rightly pointed out by US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama in their 
aforementioned letter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in 
its memorandum: 
"Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in 
pertinent part that "There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the 
extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State". While this Article 
does not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not 
appear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such 
extradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in 
Javor of extradition ". 
I am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I 
came to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule 
against the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary power is not a legal rule. 
Indeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these 
reasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of 
this case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an 
extradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable 
waiver in the USA. 
Finally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations 
of the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would 
also need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and 
the United States of America, which came into force on February 1st, 2010, several years after 
the Peterson case. Article 1 of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between 
Contracting Parties, provides that: "The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of 
applicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America 
governing extradition of offenders". The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken 
into account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to 
grant the extradition of a French national to the USA.

IN THE MATTER OF AN OPINION 
ON THE EXTRADITION LAW OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
RE GIDSLAINE MAXWELL 
ADDENDUM OPINION 
1. 
This Addendum Opinion is provided in response to the Government's Memorandum 
in Opposition to the Defendant's Renewed Motion to Release dated 16 December 
2020, insofar as it pertains to matters of English extradition law and practice. 
2. 
The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2020 ('the Opinion') 
remain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and 
Wales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it 
is virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances 
where the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United 
States prior to trial and in breach of bail; and ( c) on the basis of the information 
currently known, it is highly unlikely ' that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able 
successfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the 
superseding indictment dated 7 July 2020. In addition to those conclusions, the 
following three points may be made. 
3. 
First, as noted in the Opinion2, Ms Maxwell's waiver of extradition would be 
admissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a 
document cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in 
the United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any 
contested extradition proceedings. In particular: 
(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United 
States and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that 
The Government observes, at p.16 of the Motion, that this leaves open a "possibility " that extradition could be 
resisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is 
that, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently known, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances 
in which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone 
conclusion. 
Opinion, para. 39. 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103-2   Filed 12/23/20   Page 3 of 4
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page66 of 165
document to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be 
refused for the duration of the extradition proceedings. 
(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell3 require 
the extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be 
oppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars 
unavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to 
conceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made 
in relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances 
where she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her 
extradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her 
bail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in 
assessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under 
Article 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights 
bars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in 
the Opinion 4 . 
(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly 
likely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to 
treat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism. 
4. 
Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2003 ('the 2003 Act') 
confers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is 
sent to her by the extradition judge5. The ambit of the power in section 93 is 
described at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse 
extradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable 
bar to extradition6 is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the 
request has been withdrawn 7; ( c) there is a competing claim for extradition from 
Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition. 
Opinion, paras. 27-29 and 36-37. 
As appears to be submitted by the Government at p.19 of the Memorandum. 
The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality 
(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the 
United Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A). 
Extradition Act 2003, s. 93(4)(a). 

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 103-2   Filed 12/23/20   Page 4 of 4
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page67 of 165
another state8; (d) the person has been granted asylum or humanitarian protection in 
the United Kingdom9; or (e) extradition would be against the interests of UK 
national security 10. On the information currently known, none of these bars or 
exceptions would arise in the case of Ms Maxwell. 
5. 
The exceptional nature of the Secretary of State's power is illustrated by the fact that 
it has been exercised in the favour of a requested person on only one occasion since 
the enactment of the 2003 Act, and that that single exercise of the power was based 
on grounds on which reliance may not now be placed. 11 
6. 
Third, as to the timescales of extradition proceedings arising from requests for 
extradition made by the Government of the United States, it is to be noted that the 
purpose of the 2003 Act to streamline extradition procedures 12 and, in practice, the 
legislation works to facilitate extradition. As noted in the Opinion 
the majority of 
extradition cases conclude within two years, or three months in cases where consent 
to extradition is given.

UNITED STA TES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
V 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
OPINION AND ORDER 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy 
to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy 
to transport minors to paiticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; t:ra11sporting 
minors to paiticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 a11d 2; a11d two charges 
ofpe1jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Cou1t held a lengthy bail heaiing on July 14, 
2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the heaiing, the Comt concluded that the 
Defendant was a cleai· 1isk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would 
ensure her appea1·a11ce. Bail was therefore denied. 
TI1e Defendant has now filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending tlial, which 
the Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant attempts to respond to the 
reasons that the Cow·t provided in denying bail a11d proposes a substa11tially lai·ger bail package. 
But by and lai·ge, the ai·guments presented either were made at the initial bail heai·ing or could 
have been made then. In any event, the new infonnation provided in the renewed application 
only solidifies the CoU1t's view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page70 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 2 of 22 
combination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which 
cany a presumption of detention, are serious and cany lengthy te1ms of imp1isonment if 
convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple c01rnborating and 
c01rnborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties 
(including citizenship in a countly that does not exti·adite its citizens); and the Defendant, who 
lived in hiding and apait from the family to whom she now asse1ts important ties, has not been 
fully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court 
denied the Defendai1t's first motion for release on July 14, 2020, the Court DENIES the 
Defendant's renewed motion for release on bail. 1 
I. 
Background 
On June 29, 2020, a grandjmy in the Southern Distiict of New York returned a six-count 
Indictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of 
multiple minor victims between approximately 1994 ai1d 1997. See Dkt. No. 1. On July 2, 2020, 
the Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was aiTested in New Hampshire. 
On July 8, 2020, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small 
ministe1ial co1Tections. Dkt. No. 17. 
On July 14, 2020, this Comt held a heaii.ng regarding the Defendant's request for bail. 
After a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant's arguments and of the factors set fo1th in 
U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Comt concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant's appearai1ce, dete1mining as a result that the Defendai1t was a 
flight risk ai1d that detention without bail was wa1Tai1ted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(l). The 
TI1is Opinion & Order will be temporaiily sealed in order to allow the paities to propose 
redactions to sensitive or confidential information.

case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 3 of 22 
Defendant did not appeal the Comt's determination that detention was required, and she has been 
incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time. 
II. 
Legal Standard 
Pretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution, which prohibits the imposition of "le Jxcessive bail," and under the Bail Reform 
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3141, et seq. TI1e Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant 
"subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that litJ 
determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the 
factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Comt concludes that "no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of 
any other person and the community," may the Court order that the defendant be held without 
bail. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(l). 
If there is probable cause to find that the defendant committed an offense specifically 
enumerated in § 3142( e)(3 ), a rebuttable presumption arises "that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure" the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or 
others. 18 U.S.C. § 3142( e)(3). In such circumstances, ''the defendant 'bears a limited burden of 
production ... to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose 
a danger to the community or a risk of flight."' United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d 
Cir. 201 1) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001)); see also 
United States v. Rodrigue-:., 950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1991) (' lAJ defendant must introduce some 
evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption."). Nonetheless, '"the 
government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page72 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 4 of 22 
defendant presents a danger to the community,' and 'by the lesser standard of a preponderance of 
the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight."' English, 629 F.3d at 319 (quoting 
Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 (2d Cir. 1986) 
("The government retains the burden of persuasion l in a presumption case J ."). Even when "a 
defendant has met his burden of production," however, "the presumption favoring detention does 
not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district 
corut." United States v. Mattis, 963 F.3d 285, 290 91 (2d Cir. 2020). 
After a comt has made an initial detennination that no conditions of release can 
reasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Corut may reopen the bail 
hearing if "i.nfonnation exists that was not known to the movant at the ti.me of the hearing and 
that has a material bearing on the issue" of whether pretrial detention is waiTanted. 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(f). But the Comt is not required to reopen the heai·ing or to conduct a11other heaii.ng if it 
determines that a11y new info1mation would not have a material beaii.ng on the issue. See United 
States v. Raniere, No. 18-CR-2041 (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 
5, 2018) (noting that ' laJs the court has already held one detention heaii.ng, it need not hold 
a11other" the sta11dai·ds set fo1th in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2) ai·e met); United States v. Havens, 487 
F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing because the 
new i.nfonnation would not have changed the comt's decision to detain the defendant until hi.al). 
m. 
Discussion 
The Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f) a11d the 
Comt's inherent powers to review its own bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7 9. As already 
noted,§ 3142(f) provides that a bail heaii.ng "may be reopened ... at any ti.me before ti·ial if the 
judicial officer finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at the ti.me of the 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page73 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 5 of 22 
hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that 
will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other 
person and the community." A corut may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent 
authority, even where the circumstances do not match§ 3142(f)'s statut01y text. See, e.g., 
United States v. Rowe, 
o. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 21 , 
2003) (noting that "a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on 
reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing."); United States v. 
Petrov, 
o. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the 
'Comt's inherent authority for reconsideration of the Corut's previous bail decision"). 
In line with this, the Defendant's new motion aims to address the reasons that the Comt 
provided when it originally detennined that no conditions could reasonably assure her 
appearance and that pretrial detention was wairnnted. First, the Defenda11t proposes a more 
expa11sive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses a11y concerns regai·ding 1isk of flight. 
The newly proposed conditions include a 28.5 million bail package, which consists of a 22.5 
million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defenda11t and her spouse and secured by 
approximately 8 million in prope1ty a11d 500,000 in cash, along with six additional bonds-
five co-signed by the Defendant's friends a11d family members and the sixth posted by the 
secmity company that would provide secmity services to the Defendant if she were granted bail 
and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide 
that the Defendant would be released to the custody of a fainily member, who would serve as her 
third-paity custodia11 under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(l)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home 
confinement with GPS monito1ing and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and 
Eastern Distlicts of New York and would be limited to appeai·ances in Comt, meetings with 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page74 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 6 of 22 
counsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Comt or Pretrial Services. Id at 2 3. 
Fmthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who 
would prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Comt or 
Pretrial Services and who would esco1t her when she is authorized to leave. Id. at 3. 
The motion also presents new infmmation that, according to the Defendant, addresses the 
concerns that the Comt aiticulated when it detennined that detention was waiTanted. This newly 
presented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail 
heaii.ng, includes evidence of the Defendai1t's fainily ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at 
14; a detailed financial repo1t that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the 
Defendant's financial conditions and assets, see id at 15-18; evidence that according to her 
rebuts the Government's 01i.ginal contention that she attempted to evade law enforcement p1i.or 
to her atTest, see id at 18-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United 
Kingdom ai1d Frai1ce, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendai1t would not be able 
to resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id at 25-29; and evidence that she 
argues lays bai·e the weakness of the Government's case against her, see id. at 30---34. 
Finally, the Defendai1t argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result 
of the COVID-19 pai1demic, present ai1 additional factor fav01i.ng release. She claims that the 
conditions imposed ai·e punitive and that tl10se conditions interfere with her ability to paiticipate 
in her defense, and she asserts that these factors fu1ther militate in favor of release. See id at 34 
38. 
Having cai·efully considered all of the Defendai1t's ai·gmnents, the Comt again concludes 
tl1at no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page75 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 7 of 22 
detention without bail is wairnnted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(l). l11e Corut accordingly denies 
Defendant's request to reopen the original bail heaiing and denies her renewed motion for bail. 
A. The presumption in favor of detention applies 
l11e Comt is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of 
pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. Tue Bail Reform Act 
provides that if a defendant is chai·ged with committing an offense involving a minor victim 
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, "it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assme the appea1·a11ce of the person as required a11d the safety of the 
community if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person 
committed." 18 U.S.C. § 3142( e)(3)(E). Tue Defendant's indictment by a grand jmy suffices to 
establish that there is probable cause to believe that she committed the offenses chai·ged in the 
indictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 51, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1985) (noting that 
that a11 indictment returned by a properly constituted gra11d jmy "conclusively dete1mines the 
existence of probable cause" and that ''the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a 
prelirninary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursua11t 
to Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedme." (citations omitted)). In light of the 
crimes charged in the indictment, the Comt begins with the presumption that no condition or 
combination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant's appeai·ance. 
When the presumption applies, the Defendant beai·s a limited burden of production 
''tending to coru1ter the § 3142(e) presumption of flight," Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The 
Defenda11t's bmden of production only requires that she' introduce a ce1tain a1noru1t of evidence 
contrai·y to the presumed fact." United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 380 (1st Cir. 1985), 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page76 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 8 of 22 
abrogated on other grounds by United States v. O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810 (1st Cir. 1990). l11at 
burden is "limited." United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433,436 (2d Cir. 2001). The 
Defendant's proffer of evidence and info1mation 
including info1mation relating to her financial 
conditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things-satisfies this limited 
burden. As the Comt discussed at the July 14, 2020 hearing, these factors bear on the question 
of whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed 
motion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight 1isk. In that sense, 
this evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively low threshold 
imposed by the burden of production. 
l11e presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, however, and it "remains a factor 
to be considered among those weighed by the district coUit." United States v. Mercedes, 254 
F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144). As a result,' laJ judicial officer 
conducting a detention heating should, even after a defendai1t has come fo1wai·d with rebuttal 
evidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that 
Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ' a strong probability 
aiises' that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appeai·a11ce." Martir, 
782 F.2d at 1144 (citation omitted). 
B. The new information does not alter the Court's initial determination 
When dete1mining whether there ai·e conditions of release that will reasonably assure the 
appeai·a11ce of the person as required, courts ai·e required to consider the factors outlined in 18 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Thus, the Court considers (1) the nature ai1d circumstai1ces of the offense 
charged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence, 
(3) the defendant's hist01y and chai·acteristics, and (4) the natme and se1iousness of the danger to 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page77 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 9 of 22 
any person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also 
u.s.c. § 3142(g). 
At the July 14, 2020 bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding 
that no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required. 
And the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged 
with offenses involving mi.nor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of 
the offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On 
the other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a 
danger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The 
Defendant's arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors. 
As explained below, neither the arguments put fo1th in the Defendant's renewed motion 
for bail nor the evidence she submitted in conjunction with her motion rebut the CoUit's 
conclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no 
conditions ofrelease will reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance at future proceedings. 
1. The Weight of the Evidence 
The Comt will address the strength of the Government's case first. The Defendant 
argues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary co1rnboration of the witness 
testimony and that the discove1y produced to date has included only a "small number of 
documents from the ti.me period of the conspiracy." Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result, 
that the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July 14, 2020 bail 
hearing. See id at 30 33. So she ar·gues that the second § 3142(g) factor supports release. 
TI1e Comt disagrees. Arguing that the case against her "is based almost exclusively on 
the recollections of the tlu·ee accusers, who remain unidentified," tl1e Defendant contends tl1at tl1e 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page78 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 10 of 22 
weight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness 
testimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that 
the three witnesses will provide detailed and c01Toborating accounts of the Defendant's alleged 
role in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov't Opp'n at 10; see also Dkt. No. 17, Sl 
Superseding Indictment, 
7, 11, 13, 17. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional 
evidence, including flight records and other witnesses' corroborating testimony, will fu1ther 
suppo1t the main witnesses' testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein's conduct. Gov't 
Opp'n at 10--11. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on 
Epstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking 
the Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government's charges against 
her. As the CoUit stated in the July 14, 2020 hearing, although the CoUit does not prejudge the 
merits of the Government's case or of the Defendant's defenses, for pmposes of the bail 
determination stage, the Government's proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See 
Dkt. No. 93 ("Tr.") at 83:4- 83:10. The Comt again concludes that the Defendant's awareness of 
the potential strength of the government's case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the 
Defendant's new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor 
suppmts detention. 
2. The Defendant's History and Characteristics 
At the July 14, 2020 bail hearing, the Comt dete1mined that the Defendant was a flight 
risk in part because of her substar1tial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships 
ar1d familial ar1d personal connections abroad ar1d her ownership of at least one foreign prope1ty 
of significant value. See Tr. at 83: 13- 83:18. And the Comt further noted that the Defendant's 
extraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page79 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 11 of 22 
COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Id. at 83:21 83:25. l11e Cmut also observed that the 
Defendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the 
absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also 
suppo1ted the conclusion that flight would not pose an insmmountable burden for her. Id. at 
84:4 84:9. While the Defendant's renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it 
does not alter the Court's conclusion. 
l11e first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to 
have substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have 
familial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the 
present motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the CoUit's concern that the 
Defendant's French citizenship presented the opportllility that she could flee to France and that 
she would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:18-83:20, the Defendant now 
offers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with 
expert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an 
extradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the 
Government points out in its brief, however, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested. 
The French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a letter submitted in conjunction to the 
Government's opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure "absolutely prohibits" the 
extradition of a French national. See Gov't Opp'n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant's own 
expert attempts to rebut the Ministry ofJustice's letter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the 
Defendant's own expe1ts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the 
possibility that extr·adition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 ("On the basis of 
the infonnation cmTently known, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page80 of 165

successfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding 
indictment dated 7 July 2020."); Def. Mot., Ex. V, 76 ("It would .. . become a matter for the 
French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against Ms. 
Ghislaine Maxwell."); id 
("llJt is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse 
to issue and execute an extradition decree against Ms Maxwell. ... "). Nor has the Defendant 
presented any cases where comts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of 
extradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition, 
the reasoning in those cases tmned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the 
enforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-1514, 1999 WL 
1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999); United States v. Salvagno, 314 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 
(N.D.N.Y. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 132 33 (D.D.C. 2004); United 
States v. Chen, 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1212 (N.D. Cal. 1992). In those cases, the courts included 
such waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express 
dete1mination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly 
opined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g. , United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d 
306, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing the "Defense proposal to give advance consent to 
extradition and waiver of extradition rights" as' an empty gesture."); United States v. Morrison, 
No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2016) ("Although the defendants 
have signed a waiver of extradition, such a waiver may not become valid until an extradition 
request is pending in Canada and may be subject to withdrawal."); United States v. Stroh, No. 
396-CR-139 (AHN), 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. C01m. Nov. 3, 2000) (' llJt appears that there 
is a substantial legal question as to whether any country to which he fled would enforce any 
waiver of extradition signed under the circumstances presented in this case. At any event, 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page81 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 13 of 22 
extradition from Israel (or any other countly) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process 
and, at worst, impossible."). 
Having carefully reviewed the expe1ts' repmts and the cases cited by the Defendant,2 the 
Comt's analysis of the relationship between the Defendant's French citizenship and the risk of 
flight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in pa1t by the substantial legal 
questions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory exti·adition waivers and the likelihood that 
any exti·adition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood 
that the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to 
resolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any 
extradition requests---even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop exti·adition 
entirely weighs strongly in favor of detention. 
In addition, the Defendant's extraordina1y financial resources also continue to provide 
her the means to flee the countly and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not 
by itself justify continued detention. But as the Comt noted at the initial bail hearing, the 
Defendant's financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and 
foreign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the 
press, or othe1wise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23 
(distinguishing tl1is case from United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), 
The Defendant also argues that ' a defendant's waiver of the right to appeal an exti·adition order 
has been recognized as an indication of the defendant's intent not to flee." Def. Mot. at 27 
(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1052 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)). The Comt places 
little weight on this argument. Under the Defendant's theo1y, a defendant could sti·ategically 
offer to waive the right to exti·adition while intending to resist any subsequent exti·adition that 
might result. TI1e Comt is unpersuaded. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page82 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 14 of 22 
United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), and United States v. Madoff, 586 
F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)). 
The Comt's concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or 
employment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the 
evidence submitted in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has 
submitted a litany of letters of suppo1t written by friends and family members. See Def. Mot., 
Exs. A N, W X. These letters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has 
significant ties to the United States and attest to the Defendant's character. The Defendant 
places particular emphasis on the letter written by her spouse, whose identity and connection to 
the Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at 11- 13. 
In that letter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her anest, noting in pa1ticular that 
the Government's characterization of the Defendant's "transient" lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was 
belied by the ' quiet family life" that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at 11 ; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A 
4-5. Other letters similarly highlight that the Defendant's family and affective ties in the 
United States are stronger than was 01iginally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing. 
These letters substantiate the Defendant's claim that she has impo1tant ties to people in 
the United States, but they leave unaltered the Court's conclusion that flight would not pose an 
insunnountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant now argues that 
her newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the countly, but 
at the time she was a1rnsted, she was not living with him and claimed to be getting divorced. See 
Pretrial Services Rep01t at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be 
released on bail, undercutting her argument that that relationship would create an insmmountable 
burden to her fleeing. Fruthennore, the fact that she has :fiiends and family in the United States 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page83 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 15 of 22 
does not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country. 
In addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States--another 
factor weighing in favor of detention. Fmthennore, it is apparent from the letters that the 
Defendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the 
renewed motion for bail alters the Court's fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an 
insmmountable burden to the Defendant. 
Other factors that similarly speak to the Defendant's hist01y and characteristics weigh in 
favor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant's pattern of providing incomplete or e1Toneous 
information to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court's application of 
the third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2020 the Defendant represented 
to Pretrial Services that she possessed around 3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her 
spouse's assets and assets that had been transferred to t:rnst accounts) and the representation that 
the New Hampshire prope1ty was owned by a corporation and that she was ' just able to stay 
there." See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant now claims that she "was detained at 
the time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these 
numbers from mem01y. According to the Macalvins repo1t, l the financial figures J are a close 
approximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her own name at the time of 
her arrest. ... For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
about her lspouseJ and expressed that to Pretrial Services." Def. Mot. at 16 n.5. Even if the 
Defendant was unable to provide an exact number, however, the difference between the number 
she originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number now presented to the Court in the 
Macalvins repo1t, a report on the Defendant's finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm 
for purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. 0 , makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page84 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 16 of 22 
was the result of the Defendant's misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the 
Defendant's concerns regarding her spouse's p1ivacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish 
any explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services 
and, by extension, the Comt. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, str·onger 
now than in July 2020, as it is clear to the Comt that the Defendant's representations to Pretrial 
Services were woefully incomplete. TI1at lack of candor raises significant concerns as to 
whether the Court has now been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the 
Defendant's willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release. 
For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh 
in favor of detention. 
C. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted 
In light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of 
persuasion by ' a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a 1isk of flight." 
English, 629 F.3d at 319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3142(g) factors into 
account, the Cou1t concludes that the preswnption in favor of detention, the natw·e and 
characteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and 
characteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the 
Government has also shown, and the Comt concludes for the reasons outlined below, that the 
Defendant's proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Tims, the Comt's 
original conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight 1isk and that no set of conditions can 
reasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered. 
As already noted, the Defendant now proposes a 28.5 million bail package, which 
includes a 22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page85 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 17 of 22 
and secured by approximately 8 million in prope1ty and . 500,000 in cash, along with six 
additional bonds-five co-signed by the Defendant's friends and family members and the sixth 
posted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were 
granted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the 
Court noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant's fmances rendered it difficult to set fmancial 
bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in comt. l11e fmancial info1mation 
that the Defendant presented to the Comt at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete, 
and as the Comt noted, the Comt lacked "a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances and the 
resources available to her." Tr. at 86 87. 
l11e Defendant has now presented to the Comt what is perhaps a more thorough repo1t on 
her fmances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins 
analyzed the Defendant's assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on, 
among other things, bank statements, tax retmns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of 
the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the 
benefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2015 to 2020. See Def. Mot., Ex. 0. 
In addition, the Defendant retained a Ce1tified Fraud Examiner and a fo1mer IRS Special 
Agent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and dete1mined that 
report accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex. 
P. l11e Defendant's new bail proposal is based on the nmnbers derived from the Macalvins 
report. 
But even assmning that the financial rep01t provides an accurate analysis of the 
Defendant's finances, the Comt is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably 
assures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave mu-estrained 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page86 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 18 of 22 
millions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov't 
Opp'n at 23. Fmthermore, the proposed bond is only paitially secured. Taking into account the 
vast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing 
alone, ca1mot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Comt's 
conclusion altered by the fact that a number of third paities have pledged to support her bond; 
the amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and 
future income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her 
to compensate them, in pait or in full, for their losses. And while the Defenda11t argues that she 
has procured "significa11t loa11s on the basis of a negative pledge" over a prope1ty a11d that 4 
million is invested in an "illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable 
difficulty," see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Comt's ultimate conclusion 
that the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight. 
TI1e proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the 
custody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant's third-paity custodian under 18 
U.S.C. § 3142(c)(l)(B)(i); that the Defendant would be placed in home confmement with GPS 
monitoring a11d that her travel would be restricted to the Southern a11d Eastern Districts of ew 
York and would be limited to appeai·ances in CoU1t, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and 
upon approval by the Comt or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of 
Pretrial Services; a11d that she would surrender all travel documents. Id. at 2-3. Fmthermore, 
the Defendant would have on-premises security guards who would prevent her from leaving the 
residence at a11y time without prior approval by the Comt or Pretrial Services and who would 
escort her when she is authorized to leave. Id. at 3. 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page87 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 19 of 22 
None of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. Here, 
too, the Comt's original dete1mination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the 
original hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinaiy capacity to evade detection, 
"le Jven in the face of what the Defense has acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to 
locate her." Tr. at 87:4 87:19. Indeed, regai·dless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the 
press, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her aiTest, her sophistication in 
evading detection reveals the futility ofrelying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring, 
restrictive home confinement, and private security guai·ds, to secure her appeai·a11ce. See Tr. at 
87:4 88:2. As other comts have observed, "home detention with electronic monitoring does not 
prevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant's head stait." United States v. Zarger, No. 00-
CR-773-S-l (JG), 2000 WL 1134364, at* 1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000). Furthermore, while the 
Defendant now represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who 
would serve as the Defendai1t's third-paity custodiai1 under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(l)(B)(i), ai1d 
that she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not 
outweigh the other significai1t factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the 
Defendai1t's argument that private security guai·ds could ensure her appeai·a11ce at future 
proceedings mns afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held "does not 
pe1mit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means ai·e detained pending trial 
while wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails." United States v. Boustani, 
932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be 
detained regai·dless of her wealth, ai1d "if a similai·ly situated defendai1t of lesser meai1s would be 
detained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for 
private detention." Id 

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page88 of 165
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 20 of 22 
In light of the above, the Comt again concludes that the Government has shown by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the 
Defendant's proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assme her appearance. TI1e 
presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the histo1y and characteristics 
of the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant's new arguments change the 
Comt's original dete1mination. 
D. The Defendant's conditions of confinement do not justify release 
Lastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant's argument that the conditions of her 
confinement are uniquely onerous, inte1fere with her ability to pa1ticipate in her defense, and 
thus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35- 38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully 
dispute that she has received "more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her 
discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her attorneys." Gov't Opp'n at 
29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by 
BOP, including a recent lockdown due to COVID-19 that curtailed in-person legal visitations, 
the Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her 
constitutional right to paiticipate in her defense. And while the Comt acknowledges the 
Defendant's concerns regarding the conditions of her confmement, the Defendant has failed to 
provide any basis to conclude that release is waiTanted on those grounds-even after the Comt 
has determined that she continues to pose a flight risk. 3 
TI1e Comt will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regulai·ly 
with her attorneys ai1d to review all necessaiy discove1y materials to prepai·e for her defense. 
Defense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they 
are not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the CoU1t.

Finally, as the Cmut expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the 
spread of COVID-19 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the 
incidence ofCOVID-19 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is tmly 
ala1ming. See COVID-19: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, https://www.bop.gov/ 
coronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2020) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and 11 
staff members who have tested positive for COVID-19). It could be argued that in the face of 
this, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending 
trial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not 
hesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government 
rests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Comt 
found at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at 
heightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. l11e pandemic, including 
increasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Comt 
finds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of 
conditions could reasonably assure her appearance. 
E. A hearing is unnecessary 
Having carefully reviewed the pa1ties' arguments, the Comt dete1mines that a hearing is 
unnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. l11e briefing from both sides 
comprehensively lays out the parties' respective ar·guments For the reasons stated above, none 
of the new inf01mation has a material bearing on the CoU1t's determination that the Defendar1t 
poses a flight 1isk. Indeed, mar1y of the reasons that the Court provided at the July 14, 2020 
hearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force. The Comt need not hold another

INTRODUCTION 
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Third 
Motion for Release on Bail. 
As Ms. Maxwell has stated on numerous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no 
intention or desire to leave this country. She is an American citizen, has lived in United States 
for 30 years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country. 
She wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court 
deems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the 
25-year-old charges in the Indictment.  Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to 
our knowledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her 
appearance. (See Dkt. 97.)  In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. 106), Ms. 
Maxwell now proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily 
restrictive bail package she has already offered. 
• First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate 
any opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires. 
• Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds 
earmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to 
defend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and 
for taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal 
District Court judge and former United States Attorney who will function as asset 
monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.  
The former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed 
insufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to 
seek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom.  (See id. at 11-13).  As a non-citizen, Ms. 
Maxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 160   Filed 02/23/21   Page 2 of 9
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page93 of 165

citizens of those countries.  The latter condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they 
cannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court.  This should 
satisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets 
unrestrained that could be used for such purposes.  (See id. at 17-18). 
In addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submitted twelve pretrial 
motions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or 
all of the charges against her.  Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail 
application (see Dkt. 18 at 19) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the 
chance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of 
January 25.  These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case 
against Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention. 
Ms. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion.  She 
has been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has 
poisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury.  She has been relentlessly 
attacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have 
neither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an attempt 
to turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein.  Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined – 
and welcomes the opportunity – to face her accusers at trial and clear her name.  The additional 
proposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee.  The Court should 
therefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare 
for trial.

I. 
The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s 
Appearance in Court 
As set forth above, Ms. Maxwell now proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate 
any means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country.  The Court should therefore 
reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions.  See United States v. 
Rowe, No. 02 CR. 756 LMM, 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) (“[A] release 
order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was known to 
the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. 15-CR-66-
LTS, 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for 
reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”). 
A. 
Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship 
To demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide 
further assurance to the Court that she will not attempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is 
willing to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom.  Should 
the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submitted to the 
appropriate authorities.   Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s 
passports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made. 
If the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally 
commence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the 
process of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately 
upon granting of bail.  The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate, 
may be expedited. 
Citizenship is a precious and priceless asset.  Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up 
citizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 160   Filed 02/23/21   Page 4 of 9
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page95 of 165

earnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to 
flee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense. 
Her renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of 
waivers of extradition.  (See Dkt. 106 at 13).  Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest 
extradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any 
incentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries. 
B. 
Restraint and Monitoring of Assets 
In denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms. 
Maxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could 
be used to facilitate her flight from the country.  (See id. at 17-18).  To assuage any concerns that 
those assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell 
has taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are 
not used to secure the bond, while still allowing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for 
her spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes. 
1.   
New Account 
All assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in 
escrow for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in 
the name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)1, will be deposited in a newly 
created account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to 
order of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s 
remaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale 
The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s 
Renewed Bail Application. (See Dkt. 97, Exhibit O.) 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 160   Filed 02/23/21   Page 5 of 9
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page96 of 165

of Ms. Maxwell’s London house and any other assets, excluding salary, hereinafter acquired. 
The asset manager will approve the financial institution at which the New Account is created and 
must approve and co-sign any expenditure from the New Account, with the exception of 
disbursements for Ms. Maxwell’s legal fees in connection with the ongoing criminal and civil 
litigation and for payment of taxes, which will not require authorization. No illiquid assets may 
be sold, conveyed or transferred without approval of the asset monitor. 
2.   
Other Assets 
The only funds that will not be included in the New Account are (1) the money currently 
held in escrow by Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys, which will be used exclusively for her defense; and 
(2) the roughly $450,000 in the Personal Account which her spouse will use only for living 
expenses. The asset monitor shall regularly receive information regarding activity of the Personal 
Account, including the account balance, on a weekly basis. The asset monitor must also receive 
five-day advance notice of any check, on-line payment, or transfer of funds in any amount 
exceeding $5,000, and the reason for such payment.  Ms. Maxwell’s spouse agrees to be bound 
by these restrictions and reporting requirements. 
The asset monitor shall report to Pretrial Services any possible non-compliance or 
disbursement in violation of the terms and conditions specified above. 
3.   
Selected Asset Monitor 
The Honorable William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal District Court judge and the 
former United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake the 
position of asset monitor. (Judge Duffey’s bio is attached as Exhibit A.)  Judge Duffey has 
extensive experience evaluating and monitoring funds held in and disbursed from financial 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 160   Filed 02/23/21   Page 6 of 9
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page97 of 165

accounts and will be entrusted with the authority to oversee the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her 
spouse, as described above.   
Restraining Ms. Maxwell’s assets that are not used to secure the bond and placing them under 
the supervision of a former federal District Court judge eliminates any concern that such funds 
could be used to violate the terms of release. 
II.       Ms. Maxwell’s Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues  
           That Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her 
In addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial 
motions now before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.  
Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of 
charges, if not the entire indictment.  Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the 
superseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay, 
and for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s 
constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of 
the Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious 
statements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits.  These 
motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant 
granting bail on the conditions proposed. 
III.   
The Court Should Grant Bail 
Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, a defendant must be released on personal 
recognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release 
will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of 
any other person or the community.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b).  The enhanced bail package proposed 
by Ms. Maxwell contains financial burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 160   Filed 02/23/21   Page 7 of 9
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page98 of 165

assure her appearance as required.  Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3142(e), 
the Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if 
released, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this 
propensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what 
conditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no 
danger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity.  To 
say that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States 
citizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for 
alleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old 
claims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.2 
The additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package 
previously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms. 
Maxwell’s presence at trial.  The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral 
pledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of 
foreign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds 
can be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and 
former United States Attorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the 
government and the Court.  These cnditions are unique and unprecedented.  They profoundly 
See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf. People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, 
02526/2011(S.Ct. N.Y. County). Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a 
Paris-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including 
felony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and attempted rape of a Manhattan hotel 
housekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn’s DNA 
on the accuser’s uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $1 million cash, 24-
hour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards.  After surrendering his 
French passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a 
residence in Manhattan.  See https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/ may/20/dominique-strauss-kahn-new-york-
apartment.

affirm Ms. Maxwell’s earnestness in seeking bail to properly prepare her defense, not to flee.  
The Court should grant bail to Ghislaine Maxwell. 
CONCLUSION 
The proposed additional conditions of release—renunciation of foreign citizenship and 
restraint and monitoring of assets by a retired District Court judge—enhance the already 
extraordinarily restrictive bail conditions proposed in Ms. Maxwell’s Renewed Motion for Bail.  
In combination, these conditions satisfy the Bail Reform Act and reasonably assure Ms. 
Maxwell’s appearance at trial.  To deny Ms. Maxwell bail when such extraordinary and 
restrictive conditions are available would be a miscarriage of justice.

Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse

New York, New York 10007 
Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s third 
motion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2021 (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion”).  
(Dkt. No. 160).  On July 14, 2020, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court 
concluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of 
conditions could ensure her appearance in court.  On December 28, 2020, after the defendant 
renewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her 
prior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a 
thorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied 
the motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.  
(Dkt. No. 106 at 1-2 (“Dec. Op.”)).  The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2020 decision 
to the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending.  Now, the defendant asks the Court yet 
again to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail 
package the Court previously considered and rejected.  For the reasons set forth below, the Motion 
should be denied.  First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in 
which she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed 
that December opinion to the Second Circuit.  Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction 
to grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the 
defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed 
by the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of 
conditions could ensure her appearance.  The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.   
I. 
Background 
The Government’s December 16, 2020 opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion 
details the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference 
herein.  (See Dkt. No. 100 at 2-6).  After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for

Page 2 
bail in July 2020, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2020 in which the 
defendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were 
made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.”  (Dec. Op. at 1).  In denying that 
second application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only 
solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination 
of conditions can ensure her appearance.”  (Id. at 1-2).   
On January 11, 2021, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing 
the Court’s December 2020 opinion denying the Second Bail Motion.  (Dkt. No. 113).  That appeal 
is pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.  
On February 23, 2021, the defendant submitted the Third Bail Motion, in which she 
proposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already 
offered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (1) renunciation of the defendant’s French and 
British citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account 
to be overseen by an asset monitor.   
II. 
The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of 
the Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal 
The defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the 
proposed conditions.”  (Mot. at 4).  More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the 
exact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as now 
“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions.  (Id. at 2, 8).  However, the Court lacks jurisdiction 
to grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second 
Circuit.   
“As a general matter, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional 
significance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its 
control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”  United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 
247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982)).  
“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial 
economy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues 
before two courts at the same time.’”  Rodgers, 101 F.3d at 251 (quoting United States v. Salerno, 
868 F.2d 524, 540 (2d Cir. 1989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir. 
1989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial 
and appellate courts”).  
In January 2021, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2020 
Opinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion.  The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only 
seeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional 
bail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion, 
(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure 
her appearance.”  (Dec. Op. at 16).  Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns 
bail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.”  Rodgers, 101 F.3d at 251.  The 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 165   Filed 03/09/21   Page 2 of 9
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page103 of 165

Page 3 
defendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court.  To 
allow her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy 
underpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal.  See Rodgers, 101 
F.3d at 251.1 
The Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant 
without a remedy.  The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to 
this Court.  Alternatively, the Court can follow the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief 
“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, 
the court may: (1) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it 
would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a 
substantial issue.”  However, the defendant should not be permitted to simultaneously pursue bail 
in both this Court and the Second Circuit. 
III. 
The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail 
Decisions 
Even if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be 
denied.  This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of 
flight.  In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, 
While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court 
is confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not 
presently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion.  In addition to the rule articulated by 
the Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an 
appeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on 
a motion to amend the Section 2255 motion.  298 F.3d 174, 180 n.5 (2d Cir. 2002) (“The district 
court could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second 
Circuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”).  Here, too, 
while the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should 
not grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling.  Rule 9 of the Federal 
Rules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a 
reading.  Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party 
entitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of 
conviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in 
the court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of 
conviction.”  In United States v. Hochevar, 214 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2000), the Second Circuit found 
that Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal 
from the judgment of conviction is filed.  Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of 
conviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after 
a notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed.  In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court 
of appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal.  Such promptness would not 
be necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the 
bail appeal is pending.

are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the 
Government, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the 
Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does 
not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to 
whom she now asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”  
(Dec. Op. at 2).  In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two 
additional bail conditions.  Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s 
appearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an 
extreme flight risk.  Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that 
her pretrial motions have somehow weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been 
adjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the 
defendant’s motions have no merit.   
In short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—
continue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any 
information that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.  
A. Applicable Law   
“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably 
assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if 
‘information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a 
material bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.”  (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting 
U.S.C. § 3142(f)).  “A court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent authority, 
even where the circumstances do not match § 3142(f)’s statutory text.”  (Id. at 5).  Although courts 
in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence 
proffered on reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United 
States v. Rowe, No. 02 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003), 
generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for 
example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or 
that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”  United States v. Petrov, No. 15 
Cr. 66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015). 
B. Discussion 
The defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing.  First, the 
defendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she 
will flee from prosecution.  Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a 
monitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained 
assets.  Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the 
strength of the Government’s case.  None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should 
be denied.

1. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship 
Should Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations 
The defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by 
offering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.”  (Mot. at 2).  She claims 
that such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the 
United Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to 
seek refuge in those countries.”  (Id. at 2, 5).  The defendant is wrong.  That she is “willing” to 
renounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then 
fighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could 
choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does 
not have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible.  The Court previously 
found that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . . 
. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at 13); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis 
to disturb this finding.  Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition 
waivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential 
extradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship. 
First, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.  
As an initial matter, the defendant’s offer is itself of little value, as she would at bare minimum 
have to follow the legal requirements attendant to each country in order to formally renounce her 
citizenship.  Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the 
validity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United 
Kingdom.  For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British 
citizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s 
in your best interest).”  See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality.  The defendant could choose 
to frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her 
citizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.  
Simply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship now, 
there is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in 
the future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time.  And even if the defendant could not 
challenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate matter, she could seek to have her 
citizenship rights restored.  
Second, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer 
to renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she 
reckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of 
her extradition rights.  See United States v. Cohen, No. 10 Cr. 547 (SI), 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 
n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his 
Israeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or 
travel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees 
overseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk. 
Defendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable 
in Israel if defendant were to flee there.”).  The Court placed “little weight” on the defendant’s 
argument in the Second Bail Motion that waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order indicates 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 165   Filed 03/09/21   Page 5 of 9
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page106 of 165

Page 6 
her intent not to flee.  (Dec. Op. at 13 n.2).  The Court recognized that “a defendant could 
strategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent 
extradition that might result.”  (Id.).  So too here.  An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship 
“[s]hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but 
hollow offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom 
or France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee). 
As such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the 
United Kingdom and France is little more than window dressing.  After receiving the defendant’s 
Third Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International 
Affairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the 
defendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to 
deport its own citizens for crimes they have committed.  In response, the MOJ provided the 
Government with a letter setting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the 
defendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from 
France because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged 
offense was committed.  That letter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the 
letter, are attached hereto as Exhibit A.  See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said 
offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of 
nationality.”); see also Dkt. No. 100, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ letter stating that the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality 
at the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”).  The defendant’s 
renunciation of her French citizenship in 2021 would not change the fact that she was a French 
citizen at the time she is alleged to have committed the charged crimes in the 1990s and 2016.  As 
such, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from 
France, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless. 
Meanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she 
will not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United 
Kingdom would be successful.  The Government understands from OIA that a defendant’s 
nationality has historically played little to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom.  Indeed, 
Article 3 of the 2003 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom 
expressly 
prohibits 
using 
nationality 
as 
a 
basis 
to 
deny 
extradition. 
See 
https://www.congress.gov/108/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-108tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be 
refused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Crown Prosecution Service, 
Extradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May 12, 2020), 
https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (setting forth the statutory bars to extradition, 
which do not include nationality).  In any event, assuming the Government could locate and 
apprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the 
Second Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on 
extradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the 
passage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition.  The 
Government understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently 
extensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.  This process is lengthy, 
complicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page107 of 165

Page 7 
would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. 
As the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant 
could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.  (Dkt. No. 
100 at 19-20).  Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute 
anticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any 
extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.”  (Dec. Op. at 13).  The Court further noted 
that the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even 
if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor 
of detention.”  (Id.).  That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer 
to renounce her foreign citizenship. 
As this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial 
and personal connections abroad, and owns at least one foreign property of significant value.  (Dec. 
Op. at 10-11).  The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not 
fundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.   
2.  The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition 
Next, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new 
account that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States 
Attorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”  
(Mot. at 2).  This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure 
that the defendant appears in Court.  
It first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about 
those finances— is not an issue of first impression.  Significantly absent from the defendant’s 
Motion is any attempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor 
raises significant concerns as to whether the Court has now been provided a full and accurate 
picture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of 
release.”  (Dec. Op. at 16).  That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would 
depend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances 
and access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth.  Given the Court’s concerns about the 
defendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with 
a monitor under her employ. 
In any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her 
assets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets 
unrestrained.  In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million 
townhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself.  Although the defendant 
asserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the 
defendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain how the monitor—or this 
Court—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic 
account.  As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically 
recover assets abroad.  Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 165   Filed 03/09/21   Page 7 of 9
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page108 of 165

Page 8 
least $2 million.  In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million 
dollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.2  That figure 
appears to be in addition to the approximately $1 million in “chattels” the defendant has disclosed 
among her various assets.  See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9.  In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave 
her with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.  
Further still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship 
program she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court 
has to establish and oversee such a monitorship.  Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the 
Motion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a 
monitorship.  Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a 
program would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the 
funds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access.  Given that the 
defendant’s Motion suggests that attorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears 
that the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject 
only to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.  
Finally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she 
would pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.  
As a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and 
the monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest.  But at 
bottom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to 
flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.     
In sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid 
about her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal.  (Dec. Op. 
at 2).  Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant 
poses a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution.  The 
Court should reject the proposed bail conditions. 
3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength 
of the Government’s Case 
Finally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions now 
before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.”  (Mot. at 7).  
But the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that 
the strength of the Government’s case has diminished.  To the contrary, as the Government has set 
forth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely 
without merit.  In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—
which have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original 
The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrow for the 
defendant’s legal fees.  See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees); 
see also Mot. at 6.  If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to 
return those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.

determination that the Government’s case is strong.  
IV. 
Conclusion  
The defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight.  (Dec. Op. at 1).  Even 
assuming the Court has jurisdiction to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions 
offer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already 
found that the defendant poses.  (Id. at 21).  The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.

To the

Through Andrew FINKELMAN, Liaison Magistrate on behalf of the 
Embassy of the United States of America located in Paris, France 
I hereby inform you that in France, all removal proceedings and conditions are 
governed by Articles 696 et sq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
Article 696-2 of said Code provides that: “The French government is able to remit to 
foreign governments upon their request any individual who is not a French citizen and who is subject to a 
lawsuit brought on behalf of the requesting State, or who is subject to a sentence passed by the Court of said 
requesting State, and who is located on the territory of the French Republic.” 
Article 694-4 expressly specifies as follows: 
“Removal is not granted: 
1- When the individual claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been 
assessed at the time of the offense on the basis of which removal is being 
requested.” 
WHEREBY, the fact that the wanted individual is a French national constitutes an 
insuperable obstacle to his/her removal. As long as said nationality is assessed at the time the 
offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent to said offense has no bearing upon 
the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of nationality.

Preliminary Statement 
The issue before the Court, as it has been since Ms. Maxwell’s first bail application, 
is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance at trial.  
On her third application (the “Third Bail Motion”) (Dkt.160), Ms. Maxwell has put before 
the Court significant enhancements to the already extraordinary bail package previously 
presented to the Court in her renewed application for bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) 
(Dkt. 97).1  Together, these two motions present a unique and comprehensive bail package 
with the strictest of conditions known in any bail application: 
§ $28.5 million in bonds (including a $1M bond co-signed by a security 
company); 
§ $9.5 million in real property; 
§ $550,000 in cash; 
§ Asset Monitoring by a retired federal district court judge;

Ms. Maxwell’s present motion (the “Third Bail Motion”) (Dkt.160) incorporates her Memorandum in Support of 
Her Renewed Motion for Bail and accompanying exhibits (Dkt. 97, including Attachments 1-24) and her Reply 
Memorandum in Support of Her Renewed Motion for Bail (Dkt. 103, including Attachments 1-2) (collectively, the 
“Second Bail Motion”).  
To assist Ms. Maxwell in making up for lost time preparing for her upcoming trial, one of her lawyers (not trial 
counsel) has agreed to reside with her and serve as an additional residential custodian.

§ On-premises 24/7 private security to prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the 
residence without pre-approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and to 
escort her when authorized to leave the residence; 
§ Visitors to be pre-approved by Pretrial Services; 
§ Strict supervision by Pretrial Services; 
§ Such other terms as the Court deems appropriate. 
The government goes to great lengths to oppose bail arguing technicalities and 
offering unfounded innuendo ripped from the tabloid headlines to avoid addressing the 
merits of Ms. Maxwell’s exceptional bail package, which puts at risk everything she has, 
including the assets of her spouse and the financial security of her family and closest 
friends.   
The Court Retains Jurisdiction to Decide Matters Related to Bail 
The government asserts that the Court should not consider the present bail motion 
because appeal of denial of the Second Bail Motion, not yet briefed, is pending before the 
Second Circuit. (Dkt. 165 at 2-3).  It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it 
created this problem by opposing  Ms. Maxwell’s request for an enlargement of time to file a 
notice of appeal to the Court’s denial of her Second Bail Motion.  Indeed, Ms. Maxwell sought 
the extension to avoid this very issue. (Dkt. 109). The government should not now be allowed to 
turn that procedural sword into a jurisdictional shield to prevent the Court from considering the 
instant motion. 
Divestiture of jurisdiction in the district court while an appeal is pending is not a per se 
rule. Rather, it is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial economy that is 
designed to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues before two 
courts at the same time. Divestiture of jurisdiction, therefore, should not be automatic, but 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 3 of 18
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page116 of 165

instead guided by concerns of efficiency. Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a 
district court’s decision regarding bail “divests the court of its control over aspects of the case 
involved in the appeal.” United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996). Were it so, a 
district court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant 
released while the government appeals the grant of bail.   Such a rule would detract from, rather 
than promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice. 
         Should the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail 
motion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without 
prejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s jurisdiction over the 
present bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits, 
Ms. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals. 
Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release 
Relying on a letter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the 
Court to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.  
But the letter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The letter asserts that the loss of 
French nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have committed 
does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the 
time of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request.  As discussed in 
the opinion from William Julié, French legal counsel (attached as Exhibit A), the 
government’s assertion is entirely incorrect for the following reasons: 
§ The government’s argument goes against the letter of the law. 
§ The government’s argument goes against the spirit of the law. 
§ The government’s argument is contradicted by precedent and case law. 
(Julié Opinion ¶¶ 6-26). 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 4 of 18
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page117 of 165

The language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the 
applicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of 
French citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request.  (Id. ¶ 11).  
The provisions on which the government relies were not intended to apply in cases where the 
person whose extradition is sought had lost French citizenship.  To the contrary, it was 
designed to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the 
commission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of 
offenders seeking to escape extradition.”  (Id. ¶¶ 15-16).  If the person is no longer a French 
national at the time of the request, the provision does not apply.  The government cites no case 
where the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition, 
and we have found none ourselves.  (Id. ¶¶ 19-21).  By contrast, there are numerous examples 
of French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality following the 
commission of an offense.  (Id. ¶ 21).  Accordingly, Mr. Julié concludes: “[I]t cannot have been 
the intention of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person 
who has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from extradition.”  (Id.  
¶ 26). 
Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to give up both British and French citizenship and waive 
any and all right to contest extradition is a formidable challenge to the assertion that Ms. 
Maxwell would likely flee if released from custody and goes above and beyond the 
“reasonable assurances” that the Bail Reform Act requires to grant bail.  While we 
maintain that Ms. Maxwell’s written waivers of the right to challenge extradition should 
suffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and 
profoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at 
trial.

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page118 of 165

Monitoring of Assets is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release 
To address the Court’s concern about Ms. Maxwell’s access to assets, the bail 
motion proposed another extremely significant and restrictive bail condition – the 
imposition of a monitor to supervise the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse and 
approve expenditures.  Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the 
government urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.   
William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United 
States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by 
the Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring 
funds held in and disbursed from financial accounts.  He has agreed to serve by appointment of 
the Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court 
and are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and 
approve disbursement of assets requiring his signature.  Similar to others who have been 
appointed by courts to oversee financial matters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same 
hourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb). 
The proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and 
monitored by Judge Duffey.  As required by court order, documentation concerning the 
proceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the 
financial account approved by Judge Duffey. 
The government tries to steer the Court’s attention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack 
of candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful 
restraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse. As previously stated, despite being 
questioned by Pretrial Services following a period of solitary confinement, suicide watch, sleep 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 6 of 18
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page119 of 165

deprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms. 
Maxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which 
were restricted to her personal assets.  Since then, financial documents - collected and 
professionally vetted by a highly respected accounting firm – have been submitted to the 
government and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning 
Ms. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid 
challenge has been made to those submissions. 
The government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep 
the defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too 
great a risk to release.” (Dkt.165 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it 
undermines most conditions of release.  For example, the same could be said of electronic 
monitoring – i.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place 
him on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to 
release.3 The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act, 
if there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted.  The conditions 
collectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that 
Ms. Maxwell will be present at trial. 
Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government 
desperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in attorney escrow accounts, would be 
released and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive.  To suggest that defense counsel would 
become accomplices to a violation of a court order shows utter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.  
In particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district 
and establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s 
callous assertion. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 7 of 18
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page120 of 165

Conceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case  
As Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has 
continuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and 
actual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and now to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt. 
165 at 1.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case 
against her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case 
in pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has 
persuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in 
2007, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s 
prosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are 
time-barred.  
The government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light 
of the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that 
either Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-34 to travel while she 
was a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein. 
(See Opp.162-65 & fn. 57-58.)5 Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged 
in the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against 
Ms. Maxwell.  More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it 
produced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to  
obtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that 
undermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire 
Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” 
“Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s 
Pre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2021 and not yet publicly filed. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 8 of 18
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page121 of 165

prosecution. 
The ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the 
stale allegations in the indictment.  Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it 
failed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The  
passage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the 
purported strength of the government’s case.  
Bail Must Be Granted 
The detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations – based on the lowest grade 
misdemeanor under New York Penal Law 130.556 – presented in a sensationalized 
indictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy7 –
is unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media 
coverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution, 
has increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued 
detention – providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months–continues to severely 
undermine her presumption of innocence. 
In the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell 
poses “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollow.  The government urges the Court to apply a 
standard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks.  See United States v. 
Orta, 760, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legal standard required by the [Bail 
Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under the Bail 
Counts Two and Four allege violations of New York Penal Law § 130.55 - sexual abuse in the third degree - a 
class B misdemeanor punishable by maximum penalties of three months in jail or one year probation.  
What other purpose could be served by the inclusion of a picture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein taken over a 
dozen years after the period of the conspiracy alleged and pictures of three high-value residences?  
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 9 of 18
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page122 of 165

Reform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are "no conditions" that would 
reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened 
by Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets 
monitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.  
To find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old 
woman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made 
America her home for the past 30 years, and who has established strong roots and forged 
important connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous.  The 
concerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed.  To say 
that renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal 
district court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by 
real property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic 
monitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms. 
Maxwell remains in custody – her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based 
on allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who 
are not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength 
and concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her 
confinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for 
trial.8  
Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing electronic discovery, including discs that can only be 
reviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on 
either the MDC computer or the laptop.  Her receipt of legal mail – including pretrial motions, responses and replies 
– are constantly delayed even after tracking information confirms delivery to the MDC.  The visiting rooms in the 
East Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal 
Defenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of 
installing HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms 
raised early in the pandemic. The alternative – to meet in the open-area where social visiting had been conducted-  
affords no privacy for confidential attorney-client communication, especially under constant oversight by Ms.

Conclusion 
The Court should grant bail for Ms. Maxwell on the extraordinary conditions 
proposed.  Should the Court determine that additional conditions are necessary, Ms. 
Maxwell is willing to satisfy and abide by those terms as well.

Maxwell’s guards and a hand-held camera focused on both Ms. Maxwell and counsel.  Further, confidential 
attorney-client communications conducted during video teleconferencing (VTC)  are now further compromised by 
the repositioning of a camera with sensitive audio recording, putting a chill on privileged communication.  During 
VTC conferences, counsel can hear conversation among the guards, so it is likely that the guards, who seem to be 
writing during those sessions, are able to hear discussions between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. Last night, prior to the 
filing of defense replies to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions, the MDC refused her request to speak with her lawyers 
to provide information bearing on those filings,. Such denial violates the BOP’s Program Statement pertaining to 
providing legal calls upon request of pretrial inmates. See https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/7331_004.pdf at 
par. 24(c). The chronic difficulties related to Ms. Maxwell’s review of the millions of documents of electronic 
discovery are continuing to negatively impact her ability to prepare for a trial that is only a few months away.

Re: Additional opinion on the extradition of nationals by the French government 
1. This memorandum was written pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at 
the French firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as 
counsel for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell. The request was made in the context of ongoing bail 
proceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”), 
where Ms Maxwell is being detained pre-trial on charges relating to her alleged role in 
sexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from 1994 to 1997. 
2. In a previous opinion, I have outlined why French authorities could decide to execute 
an extradition request against a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between the 
USA and France, without violating any superior norm of French and international law.  
3. As I understand the defendant’s French nationality continues to be regarded by the Court 
as a bar to her release pending trial, I am informed that the defendant is prepared to 
renounce French nationality under Article 23-4 of the French Civil Code, if the Court 
so requires. 
4. In a letter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2021, the Head of the International 
Criminal Assistance Bureau of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe Jaeglé, 
asserts that the loss of French nationality after the criminal act which the person is 
alleged to have committed does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, 
as nationality must be assessed at the time of commission of the offence and not at the 
time of the extradition request.  
5. This report was written to provide a counter opinion on this issue, in support of the 
proposition that the French government would be legally entitled to execute an 
extradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national. 
6. The Ministry of Justice’s assertion must be regarded as incorrect for three reasons: 
(i) It is not supported by the letter of the law; 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 171   Filed 03/23/21   Page 13 of 18

wj@wjavocats.com - www.wjavocats.com - palais C1652 
(ii) Nor is it supported by the spirit of the law; 
(iii) Case law and precedents in fact suggest the opposite. 
7. First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the letter of the law.  
8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty 
between the USA and France of 23 April 1996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure for matters not dealt with under the Treaty. 1 
9. Article 3(1) of the Treaty provides: 
“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person 
who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United 
States shall have the power to surrender a national of the United States if, in its 
discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be 
the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed”.  
10. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule, 
under similar wording: 
“Extradition shall not be granted: 
1° When the person claimed has French nationality, the latter being assessed at the time 
of the offense for which extradition is requested”  
11. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where 
French authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French 
national at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of 
Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of 
America and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2003, and the Instrument Amending the 
Treaty of 23 April 1996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 30 September 
2004.

wj@wjavocats.com - www.wjavocats.com - palais C1652 
Criminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested 
State”/”the person claimed has French nationality”), which can only mean that the 
extradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national. If the 
person is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not 
apply.  
12. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French 
nationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have 
expressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to 
qualify the national affiliation of the requested person.  
13. Furthermore, it is a well-known principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions 
that exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an 
exception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application 
to a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.  
14. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law 
15. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact 
not intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but 
only in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the 
commission of the alleged crime.  
16. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for 
which extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French 
nationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after committing an 
offence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to 
escape extradition.

17. This concern over opportunistic nationality applications is precisely the justification of 
the rule mentioned in academic literature (see for example Répertoire de droit pénal et 
de procédure pénale Extradition Pén. – Conditions de fond de l'extradition – 
Delphine Brach-Thiel–October 2018, §59). 
18. Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents 
and case law 
19. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case 
can be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied 
to protect a formerly French national from extradition.  
20. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,1° of the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against 
an individual who had acquired French nationality after committing an offence, which 
is the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber 
of the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2006, n°05-86.258). 
21. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the 
extradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where 
French authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French 
nationality. Both extradition and deportation allow for the removal of a person from 
French territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with 
the consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.  
22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”) treats extradition and deportation 
analogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars 
apply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court 
considers that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 
in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State. The 
Court’s own case-law has shown that, in practice, there may be little difference between

extradition and other removals”, ECtHR 12 April 2012, Babar Ahmad and Others v. 
the United Kingdom, no. 24027/07, §168).  
23. France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by 
application of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may 
give rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen 
named Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of 
terrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality2.  
24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of 
prison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used 
to be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits 
State parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which 
they remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment3. Beghal 
was eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose 
of standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel 
Beghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allow for his removal from 
France, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were 
conceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time 
of the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to 
deported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.  
25. In any case, the deportation of formerly French citizens shows that the loss of French 
nationality prevents any retroactive application of domestic provisions which are 
intended to protect French nationals, be it from deportation or extradition.

Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure be construed as meaning that 
a person who has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from 
extradition since the French government has on several occasions deported to third 
countries individuals who had been deprived of their French nationality following the 
commission of criminal offences.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v– 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy 
to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy 
to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting 
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges 
of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.   
On July 14, 2020, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant 
was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her 
appearance.  It therefore denied bail.  On December 8, 2020, the Defendant filed a renewed 
motion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December 
14, 2020.  Dkt. No. 96.  On December 28, 2020, the Court denied that motion, concluding that 
the Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no combination of conditions could ensure her 
appearance.  Dkt. Nos. 104, 106.   
The Defendant then filed a third motion for release on bail on February 23, 2021.  Dkt. 
No. 160.  In this motion, the Defendant attempts to respond to the reasons that the Court

provided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her 
second motion for bail.  Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship, 
and she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be 
monitored by a retired federal judge.  See Dkt. No. 160 at 2.   
As set forth below, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and 
proposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no 
combination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance.  Thus, for substantially the 
same reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the 
Court DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail. 
I. 
Background 
On July 14, 2020, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.  
After a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in 
U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a 
flight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).  The 
Defendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time. 
The Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2020.  The Court 
again denied the Defendant’s motion.  In doing so, the Court explained that none of the 
Defendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of 
flight.  It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry 
lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, 
including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s 
substantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 2 of 12
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page134 of 165

escape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations 
raised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.  
See Dkt. No. 106.  
On February 23, 2021, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail.  Dkt. No. 
160 (“Def. Mot.”).  The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2021.  Dkt. 
No. 165 (“Gov’t Opp’n”).  The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March 16, 
2021. 
II. 
Legal Standard 
The parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from 
granting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending.  See Gov’t 
Opp’n at 2–3; Reply at 2–3; see also United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996) 
(“As a general matter, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—
it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over 
those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omitted).  Under Rule 37(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer 
considering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court 
of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 
37(a).  Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of 
whether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.   
Pretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3141, et seq.  The Bail Reform Act 
requires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further condition, or 
combination of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 3 of 12
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page135 of 165

person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.”  18 U.S.C. § 
3142(c)(1)(B).  The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after 
considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concludes that “no condition 
or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and 
the safety of any other person and the community.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). 
After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can 
reasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allows the 
Court to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not known to the movant at the 
time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is 
warranted.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(f).  The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new 
information would not have a material bearing on the issue.  See United States v. Raniere, No. 
18-CR-2041 (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2018) (noting that 
“[a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v. 
Havens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing 
because the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant 
until trial).  In addition, the Court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent 
authority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3142(f)’s statutory text.  See, e.g., United 
States v. Rowe, No. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) 
(noting that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on 
reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v. 
Petrov, No. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the 
“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).

If, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant committed an offense 
specifically enumerated in § 3142(e)(3), a rebuttable presumption arises “that no condition or 
combination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the 
community or others.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3).  In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a 
limited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that 
he does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”  United States v. English, 629 
F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 
2001)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1991) (“[A] defendant must 
introduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).  
Nonetheless, “‘the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing 
evidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’”  English, 629 F.3d at 
319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 
(2d Cir. 1986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”).  
Even when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” however, “the presumption favoring 
detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed 
by the district court.”  United States v. Mattis, 963 F.3d 285, 290–91 (2d Cir. 2020). 
III. 
Discussion 
The Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent powers to review 
its own bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of 
the Court’s earlier rulings.  See Def. Mot. at 4.  She also argues that the strength of the 
Government’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions, 
which are currently pending before the Court.  Id. at 7.  Having considered those arguments, the 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 5 of 12
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page137 of 165

Court’s view has not changed.  The Court again concludes that the Government has shown by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no 
set of conditions, including the Defendant’s third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to 
reasonably assure her appearance.  The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the 
evidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that 
conclusion.  The Defendant’s proposed conditions do not alter the Court’s determination.    
A. The Court’s assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors has not changed 
To begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force.  
See Dkt. No. 106 (“Dec. Op.”) at 7–8.  And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant 
has met her burden of production, the presumption “remains a factor to be considered among 
those weighed by the district court.”  Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at 
1144).  The Court is mindful “that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of 
flight, and that ‘a strong probability arises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate 
to secure their appearance.”  Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144 (citation omitted).   
The Court’s analysis of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors also remains unchanged.  
Because the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor 
victim, the first 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention.  
And the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or 
to the community.  The fourth § 3142(g) factor thus weighs against detention.   
With respect to the second § 3142(g) factor, none of the Defendant’s new arguments alter 
the Court’s conclusion as to the weight of the evidence.  The Defendant argues that the pre-trial 
motions “raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire 
indictment,” and she contends that “[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 6 of 12
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page138 of 165

of the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.”  Def. Mot. at 7.  
Those motions became fully briefed one week ago and are now pending before this Court.  The 
Government strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated 
them.  Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the 
presumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength 
and nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention.  See Dec. 
Op. at 9–10.   
 The Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.  
See Dec. Op. at 10–16.  The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial 
and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading 
detection.  Id. at 10–11.  And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor 
regarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same.  As the Court 
emphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the 
information presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2020 and the information 
presented to the Court in December 2020 raised significant concerns about candor.  See Dec. Op. 
at 16.  There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of 
conditions of release.  Id.  While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cutting in 
the opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not 
overcome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.   
As a result, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter 
the Court’s assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors.  While the fourth factor continues to 
favor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 7 of 12
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page139 of 165

that the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight.  Thus, the Court again concludes that there 
are no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.  
B. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted 
The thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new 
proposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight.  The Defendant first 
offers to renounce her French and British citizenship.  Def. Mot. at 2.  And she also proposes to 
have most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a 
retired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority 
over the account.  Id.  Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed 
in December.  See Dec. Op. at 16–17; see also Def. Mot. at 2.  The new bail package does not 
disturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of showing that these 
conditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set 
of conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance. 
The Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom 
citizenship.  She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of 
bail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while 
not immediate, may be expedited.”  Def. Mot. at 4.  As the Government notes, the offer is of 
unclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.  
See Gov’t Opp’n at 5.  With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is 
again confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law.  The 
Government relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of 
the French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French 
national constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 8 of 12
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page140 of 165

nationality is assessed at the time the offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent 
to said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said 
assessment of nationality.”1  Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.  The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the 
opinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the 
extradition request.  See Reply, Ex. A ¶ 11.  The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no 
case law addressing this precise issue.  Id. ¶ 21.   
Exacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend 
themselves to multiple interpretations.  For instance, Article 3(1) the Extradition Treaty between 
the United States and France of April 23, 1996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the 
Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but 
the executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the 
United States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so.  The nationality of the person 
sought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed.”  See Reply, 
Ex. A ¶ 9 (emphasis added)).  Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly 
provides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French 
nationality, the latter being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is 
requested.”2  Id. ¶ 10; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.  Thus, there is considerable uncertainty 
as to the relevance of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her 
ability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition.  The Court’s assessment of the risks largely 
The Court cites the translated version of the letter, though the original letter is in French.   
Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations.  The 
translated letter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual 
claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the 
offense on the basis of which removal is being requested.”  Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 9 of 12
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page141 of 165

parallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition 
waiver.  See Dec. Op. at 12–13.   
Similar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship.  The 
Court is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce 
her UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK.  See 
Gov’t Opp’n at 6–7.  And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the 
proposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the 
Defendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition attempts.  The 
possibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the 
Defendant’s incentive to flee. 
To summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship 
does not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant 
poses.  Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the 
renunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of 
whether the Defendant poses a risk of flight.  See United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547 (SI), 
2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010).  And that same uncertainty—and the 
possibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes 
flight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.  
Nor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no 
condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.  The 
Defendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial 
affairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve 
disbursement of assets requiring his signature.  See Reply at 5.  The Court continues to have 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 169   Filed 03/22/21   Page 10 of 12
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page142 of 165

concerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of 
the lack of transparency when she was first arrested.  But the Court assumes, for purposes of 
resolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it 
accounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets.  See Dec. Op. at 16–17.   
The monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, 
even when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package.  The Defendant 
would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to 
evade prosecution.  These include the $450,000 that the Defendant would retain for living 
expenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry 
and other chattels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  See Def. Mot. at 
5–6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9.  While those amounts may be a small percentage of the 
Defendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate 
flight.  When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3142(g) factors and the presumption 
of detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its 
conclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.  
If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the 
Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.  Yet while her proposed bail package 
is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances.  As a result, the Court again 
determines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis.  18 U.S.C. § 
3142(e)(1).

Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Court 
United States Courthouse 
Foley Square 
New York, NY 10007 
Re:  United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The government’s recent letter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.158) essentially repeats 
the same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing 
the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays.  We appreciate the 
Court’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to 
which she is required to undergo searches. The government’s letter, however, does not include 
the concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In 
addition, the letter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by 
counsel have been denied.   
By ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s letter 
misrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement.  Ms. Maxwell does not have access to 
daily discovery review for the entirety of the 13 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her 
the 50 feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.   
The number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move, 
including to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently, 
she is subject to a minimum of four pat down searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat down 
searches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6th, Ms. Maxwell has been physically 
searched approximately 1400 times, including pat down searches, metal wand searches, mouth, 
hair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 60 body 
scans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker, 
legal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.  
We take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety 
of the institution and the defendant.”  Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six 
guards and approximately 18 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her 
throughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to 
anyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP 
negligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.

As the government states, a flashlight is pointed at the ceiling of her isolation cell every 
minutes, from approximately 9:30 pm to 6:30 am.  It is hard to verbally convey the power of a 
light that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s 
eyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night.  The attenuating effects of sleep 
deprivation are well documented.   
Ms. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who 
are used to guarding hundreds of inmates but now focus their undivided attention exclusively on 
one respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security 
camera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat down 
search.  When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.” 
When Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she 
was threatened with disciplinary action.  Within a week and while the same team was in charge, 
Ms. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms. 
Maxwell into a shower to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom.  Ms. Maxwell’s 
request to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again 
denied.  
Ms. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily 
removal is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted.  Despite claims by MDC Legal 
to the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot 
cell: she is not allowed to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation 
cell, and within two feet from the door.  This directive encroaches on an already restricted and 
confined area and limits her movement and use to the little space that remains.   
Ms. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her.  She has 
repeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal.  For the duration of her detention, she 
has never received a properly heated meal.  Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-
indicated for use in a microwave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microwave 
oven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts 
the plastic container, rendering the food inedible.  While guards finally acknowledged serious 
problems with the food, they continued to microwave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food 
inedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no 
replacement.  Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be 
heated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it 
does little to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her 
health.  
Recently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water.  The water 
in the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was brown. 
Requests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her bottled water or permit her to purchase 
water were denied.  In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily 
newspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP 
system, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.

It is impossible to overstate the deleterious effect of the conditions under which Ms. 
Maxwell is detained.  Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide 
watch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any 
psychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.   
For weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal 
calls, and the opportunity to exercise and shower. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a 
recurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death.  Contrary to the way she is 
hyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CC1-Mh designation: inmate with 
no significant mental health care. 
The overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s 
health and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self – losing weight, 
losing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate.  In addition to the many difficulties impacting 
her review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her 
stamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel. 
Having been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by 
two to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move, 
except when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that 
Ms. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”  
Very truly yours, 
Bobbi C. Sternheim

United States v. Dashawn Robertson, 
Case Number 17-cr-02949-MV1, District of New Mexico
Memorandum Opinion and Order
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page149 of 165

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Plaintiff, 
No. 17-CR-02949-MV-1 
v. 
DASHAWN ROBERTSON,  
Defendant. 
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 
THIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to 
Reconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release.  Doc. 274.  The 
government filed a response in opposition [Doc. 282] and Mr. Robertson filed a reply  [Doc. 284].  
The United States Probation Office (USPO) also filed two memorandums addressing Mr. 
Robertson’s release.  Docs. 277 and 287.  The Court then discussed the motion at length with the 
parties and the USPO at the February 4, 2021 pretrial conference in this case.  Doc. 297 at 4–6.  
After carefully considering the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight of the 
evidence against Mr. Robertson, his history and characteristics, and the potential danger to the 
community posed by his release, the Court found that a combination of extremely strict conditions 
could reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance in court and the safety of the community, as 
required by 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f).  Id. The Court also found that Mr. Robertson’s release was 
necessary to allow him to effectively prepare for his upcoming trial under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i) 
because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hampered his ability to meet or 
communicate with his attorneys.  Id.  The Court accordingly ordered Mr. Robertson to be released 
under strict conditions to La Pasada Halfway House on February 5, 2021.  See Docs. 300 and 301.

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page150 of 165

In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court explains its release analysis under the 
Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3142.  It also explains its decision to deny the government’s 
Amended Emergency Motion for Reconsideration and Stay of Release Order.  Doc. 298.   
BACKGROUND 
Mr. Robertson is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of 
Justice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1513(a)(1)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in Possession of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924.  Doc. 86.  The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting 
an individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September 12, 2017 in 
retaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.  
See Doc. 38 at 2.  Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December 
11, 2017 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2021, about two months from today. 
Although presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention 
in this case for over three years.  He was arrested on December 11, 2017 and was ordered detained 
the same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no 
condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the 
community or his appearance in court.  Doc. 12.  Extensive pretrial litigation followed until the 
case was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2020.  Doc. 63.  The Court held a pretrial 
conference on March 10, 2020 and testimonial writs were issued.  Docs. 127 and 143.  Just days 
later, however, the devastating extent of the global COVID-19 pandemic became clear and the 
Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil 
and criminal jury trials set for the following month.  See In the Matter of: Court Operations in 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 2 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page151 of 165

Light of the Coronavirus Outbreak, 20-MC-00004-9 (D.N.M. Mar. 13, 2020) (Johnson, C.J.).  
Almost a full year later, jury trials remain suspended in the District of New Mexico.  See In the 
Matter of: Superseding Administrative Order 20-MC-00004-49, 21-MC-00004-04 (D.N.M. Jan. 
15, 2021) (Johnson, C.J.) (continuing the suspension of all civil and criminal jury trials through at 
least February 28, 2021).   
In the intervening 11 months, Mr. Robertson has remained in custody.  During that time 
period, the Court set and then continued several trial dates due to the pandemic, including dates in 
December 2020 and February 2021.  See, e.g., Doc. 271.  Mr. Robertson’s trial will now be reset 
for April 5, 2021, and the Court is hopeful that he will finally get his day in court after the extreme 
and unprecedented delay he has endured.  Complicating matters, however, is the fact that the 
pandemic and the resulting passage of time has led to a recent and significant change in Mr. 
Robertson’s defense team: both of his original attorneys withdrew from the case in January of this 
year.  Doc. 295.  As a result, the attorneys with which he will be going to trial in two months were 
appointed in September 2020 and January 2021.  Docs. 197 and 293.  Although the Court would 
not have granted the appointments if it were not sure that Mr. Robertson’s new attorneys would be 
ready for trial this April, they nevertheless face the daunting task of earning their client’s trust, 
preparing for trial, and reviewing three years’ worth of litigation in a matter of months.   
Mr. Robertson first asked the Court to consider his release in July of last year.  Doc. 181. 
He argued that his continued pretrial detention posed a risk to his health because his compromised 
immune system makes him especially vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-19.  Id. 
at 5.  He also argued that there were conditions of release that would satisfy the requirements of 
the Bail Reform Act, including the designation of his father as a third-party custodian.  Id. at 9–
10.  The Court took up the motion at a status conference held on September 11, 2020.  It explained 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 3 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page152 of 165

that it was “very concerned” about the amount of time Mr. Robertson had been in custody up to 
that point, especially given that the already-minimal rehabilitative and mental health services in 
jail had been further reduced by the pandemic.  Transcript of September 11, 2020 Status 
Conference at 43–44.1  The Court nevertheless found that it did not have any conditions available 
that could reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance or the safety of the community given his 
failure to comply with conditions of release in the past.  Id. at 44–45.  The Court also noted that 
while it was concerned about Mr. Robertson’s ability to meet with his attorneys to prepare for trial 
during the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in 
conference rooms in the federal courthouse in Albuquerque.  Id. at 45. 
Mr. Robertson now asks the Court to reconsider its earlier decision denying him pretrial 
release.  Doc. 274.  As grounds for reconsideration, he points to the additional unforeseen trial 
continuances following the September status conference as well as new placement options, 
including the grandmother of his children and La Pasada Halfway House.  Id.; see also Doc. 284 
at 2–3.  The government opposes the requested reconsideration.  Doc. 282.   
DISCUSSION 
I. 
Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.   
As an initial matter, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider 
its earlier release decision.  As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this 
Circuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion 
for reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases.  See United States v. Christy, 739 
F.3d 534, 539 (10th Cir. 2014).  A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to 
entry of final judgment.  See, e.g., Van Skiver v. United States, 952 F.2d 1241, 1243 (10th Cir. 
All references to the transcript are to the draft copy.

1991) (“The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a ‘motion to reconsider.’  Instead, 
the rules allow a litigant subject to an adverse judgment to file either a motion to alter or amend 
the judgment . . .  or a motion seeking relief from the judgment.”); Trujillo v. Bd. of Educ. of 
Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 212 F. App’x 760, 765 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (“A district court 
has discretion to revise interlocutory orders prior to entry of final judgment.”).  Hence, “[w]hen a 
party seeks to obtain reconsideration of a non-final order, the motion is considered ‘an 
interlocutory motion invoking the district court’s general discretionary authority to review and 
revise interlocutory rulings prior to entry of final judgment.’”  Wagner Equip. Co. v. Wood, 289 
F.R.D. 347, 349 (D.N.M. 2013) (quoting Wagoner v. Wagoner, 938 F.2d 1120, 1122 n.1 (10th Cir. 
1991)).  The Court’s authority, then, is sustained by the pragmatic reality that a “district court 
should have the opportunity to correct alleged errors in its dispositions.”  Christy, 739 F.3d at 539. 
Consequently, the district court enjoys “considerable discretion in ruling on a motion to 
reconsider.”  Federated Towing & Recovery, LLC v. Praetorian Ins. Co., 283 F.R.D. 644, 651 
(D.N.M. 2012) (citing Phelps v. Hamilton, 122 F.3d 1309, 1324 (10th Cir. 1997)).  
The scope of reconsideration, however, is narrowly cabined and far more limited than in 
an ordinary appeal.  That is, a motion to reconsider is an “inappropriate vehicle[] to reargue an 
issue previously addressed by the court when the motion merely advances new arguments, or 
supporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.”  Servants of Paraclete 
v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).  Rather, “[g]rounds warranting 
a motion to reconsider include (1) an intervening change in the controlling law, (2) new evidence 
previously unavailable, and (3) the need to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice.”  Id. 
Here, several pieces of previously unavailable evidence justify the request for 
reconsideration.  Servants of Paraclete, 204 F.3d at 1012.  First, when the Court denied Mr. 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 5 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page154 of 165

Robertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial 
detention for three additional months until a December 7, 2020 trial date.  Doc. 194.  As bad as 
the pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a 
state of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more 
to the current April 5, 2021 trial date.  Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last 
September, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his attorneys in person 
in conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the 
defense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial.  See supra at 4.  The Court’s impression on 
that point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with attorneys and 
then bringing COVID-19 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted attorney-client meetings at 
the Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected.  Third, the Court is now able to impose 
significantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La 
Pasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September. 
II. 
Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict 
and Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and 
the Safety of the Community Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). 
On the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s 
recommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form 13 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the 
information contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the 
applicable law.  Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately 
believes that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community 
by releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully 
tailored conditions.   
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 6 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page155 of 165

hearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably 
assure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the 
community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).  The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by 
a preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear 
and convincing evidence.  United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 616 (10th Cir. 2003).  A district 
court’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo.  See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at 
616.  
Section 3142(e)(2) creates a rebuttable presumption that no condition or combinations of 
conditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community 
where there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).  See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(B).  As the Tenth Circuit has held: 
Once the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.  
However, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the 
community always remains with the government.  The defendant’s burden of 
production is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced.  Even if a 
defendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for 
consideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain. 
United States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d 1353, 1354–55 (10th Cir. 1991). 
Here, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c) 
charge, see Doc. 86 at 1–2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebutted the presumption.  He 
has produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk 
because he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining 
his innocence and knowing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted.  Doc. 274 at 
5.  He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence 
here.  Id.  And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a 
condition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.  
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 7 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page156 of 165

Doc. 284 at 2–3.  Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebutted the presumption 
in § 3142(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for 
his release. 
Section 3142(g) then lays out the following factors for courts to consider: (1) the nature 
and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a 
violation of § 1591, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled 
substance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the 
defendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness 
of the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release.  18 
U.S.C. § 3142(g).   
The Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release, 
they do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed.  With regard to the 
nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr. 
Robertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government 
in an earlier criminal case.  As the Court stated at the November 4, 2021 pretrial conference, it 
takes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come 
forward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our 
criminal justice system.   
With regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed.  On the one 
hand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other 
witness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior 
to the shooting.  On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and 
place of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have

Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page157 of 165

been influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who 
came to question him in the hospital.      
With regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past 
conditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last 
September.  See supra at 4.  More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form 13 PSR notes several 
instances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.  
Doc. 188 at 8–10.  Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions.  Id.  However, as the defense 
has pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him 
absconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any 
convictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case.  Id.; 
see also Doc. 274 at 4–5.   
Finally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any 
person or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s 
concerns given the frightening allegations in this case.  Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all 
charges until proven guilty, however.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) (“Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”).  Presuming Mr. Robertson’s 
innocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and 
has failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history 
of violent behavior.2  Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr. 
Robertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided 
no concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims.  For example, the government’s 
cryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case 
While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are 
therefore unproven allegations.  See Doc. 188 at 11–15.  
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 9 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page158 of 165

is not a valid reason to deny Mr. Robertson release because the government has not come forward 
with any details to corroborate N.F.’s account or to link Mr. Robertson to the alleged contact. 
More importantly, the Court has imposed a number of extremely strict and carefully 
tailored conditions of release that it believes will be more than sufficient to reasonably assure Mr. 
Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community.  Mr. Robertson will be placed at La 
Pasada Halfway House, where he will be on home incarceration with active GPS tracking, the 
strictest form of location monitoring available to the Court.  Doc. 301 at 2.  He will not be allowed 
to leave La Pasada for any reason other than to meet with his attorneys, and he will not be allowed 
to transport himself to those meetings; his attorneys will have to transport him.  Id.  He will not be 
allowed any visitors at La Pasada except for his attorneys.  Id.  He will not be allowed to use or 
possess a cellphone, nor to borrow anyone else’s cellphone.  Id.  He will not be allowed to use the 
landline at La Pasada, except to speak to his attorneys.  Id.  He will not be allowed to have contact 
with anyone other than his Pretrial Services officer and his attorneys.  Id.  That includes no contact 
with his family members until he shows the Court that he is fully compliant with all of his 
conditions of release.  Id.  He will not be allowed to use or possess drugs or alcohol.  Id.  He will 
be allowed to participate in counseling at La Pasada to help him cope with the stress of his looming 
trial.  Id.  He will be required to abide by all rules and regulations of the halfway house, however 
small.  Id.   
The Court believes that with all of these conditions, and under the close supervision of the 
staff at La Pasada and his Pretrial Services officer, Mr. Robertson will not pose a danger to the 
community or a risk of flight.  The Court also cautioned Mr. Robertson at the February 4, 2021 
pretrial conference that if he violates any of these conditions of release, the Court will not hesitate 
to reincarcerate him immediately.  The Court accordingly finds that there are conditions, or a 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 10 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page159 of 165

combination of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety 
of any person and the community.  His pretrial release is therefore required by 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).   
III. 
Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense 
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). 
The Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation 
of his trial defense under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i).  That section allows a judicial officer who issued an 
order of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the 
custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial 
officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for 
another compelling reason.”  § 3142(i).3  The defendant bears the burden of establishing their 
entitlement to temporary release under § 3142(i).  United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 
1155 (D. Kan. 2020) (citation omitted).  Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary 
for the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(1) [the] time and opportunity the 
defendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the 
case and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing 
while incarcerated.”  United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:19-CR-00301-GMN-
DJA, 2020 WL 1639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2020) (unreported) (citations omitted). 
Here, all of those factors weigh in favor of release.  Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be 
reset for April 5, 2021, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.  
While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr. 
Robertson’s initial order of detention, this matter is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the 
Court review that detention order under 18 U.S.C. § 3145(b).  See Doc. 274 at 1.  The Tenth Circuit has not 
yet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i) can only be decided by the 
Magistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention.  See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 240, 
268 (D.N.M. 2020).  But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial 
release under that section.  See United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 66–68 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) 
(Nathan, J.); but see Alderete, 336 F.R.D. at 268. 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 11 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page160 of 165

Complicating matters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense attorneys have 
recently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current attorneys have been appointed within 
the past six months (one in the last three weeks).  The defense team therefore has a considerable 
amount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to 
immediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis.  The case is also complex and 
exceedingly serious.  The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc. 
104] and the Court has issued upwards of 30 written orders over the past three years of contentious 
pretrial litigation in this case.  And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing 
decades in prison: according to his Form 13 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range 
would be a staggering 412 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 40 years.  See 
Doc. 188 at 15.   
Finally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be 
impossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under 
the current lockdown conditions due to COVID-19.  In normal times, defense counsel can meet 
with their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and 
do other critical trial preparation.  Now, however, if the jails are allowing in-person client meetings 
at all, it is with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible 
to effectively review documentary evidence.  And while defense counsel represented that the Santa 
Fe County Detention Center is allowing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time 
due to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them 
(including this Court).  Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been 
helpful, the Detention Center has not allowed them to show Mr. Robertson documents by sharing 
their screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 12 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page161 of 165

hopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.   
This is no way to prepare for a trial.  The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr. 
Robertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-
consuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and 
making the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference 
between a verdict of guilty and not guilty.  Mr. Robertson’s attorneys also need unobstructed 
access to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial.  They 
need to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if 
necessary.  They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to 
COVID-19.  As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of 
severe outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdowns to ensure the safety of the 
staff and inmates.  The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States 
Marshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well.  None of this will provide 
Mr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally 
entitled.  Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man, 
until it is safe and practically possible for his attorneys to meet with him there.  The status quo is 
no longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.   
§ 3142(i). 
IV. 
The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a 
Stay. 
Finally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a 
stay pending appeal.  See Doc. 298.  In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr. 
Robertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of 
information following the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 13 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page162 of 165

decision.  First, the government represents that, per the United States Marshal’s Service, “the 
interview room at the courthouse can be made available for [Mr. Robertson] to meet with his 
attorneys to prepare for trial, for unlimited meetings and unlimited durations of meetings during 
business hours, excepting only times when the Aspen courtroom is in use.”  Doc. 298 at 2.  There 
is a catch, however: “There is a screen in the interview room, which will allow for appropriate 
social distancing between [Mr. Robertson] and his lawyers.”  Id.  Second, the government 
represents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person 
attorney visits, and will work to accommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his 
attorneys.”  Id. 
While the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these 
alternatives, they do not change its decision on release.  First, the Court notes that the government 
could have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on 
these alternatives to deny release.  Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December 
21, 2020.  Doc. 274.  The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make 
its argument against release.  It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional 
evidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance.   A motion for reconsideration is 
for presenting new evidence that was “previously unavailable.”  Servants of Paraclete, 204 F.3d 
at 1012.  
Second, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns 
the Court has articulated.  The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is 
inadequate because the room, by the government’s own description, will still contain a “screen” 
between Mr. Robertson and his attorneys.  For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team 
cannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. Robertson and go over documents 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 14 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page163 of 165

line by line in a way that is not possible through a screen.  The fact that the interview room will be 
unavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has 
been, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the 
Daubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4.  The Court’s calendar is also constantly 
shifting, meaning that the defense team will have little to no ability to confidently predict when 
they will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson.  The proposal involving the Santa Fe County 
Detention Center fares no better.  The government’s language is tellingly equivocal.  First, it states 
that “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person 
attorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.”  Doc. 298 at 1 (emphasis added).  Later, the 
government writes that the jail is willing to allow in-person meetings, but that it will “work to 
accommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his attorneys.”  Id. at 2 (emphasis added).  
Rather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of 
uncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year.  The truth remains that the Santa 
Fe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdown at any 
time due to the continued spread of COVID-19 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more 
infectious variants).  The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of 
COVID-19 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety 
practices.  Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the 
consistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense attorneys that he needs. 
Finally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier 
release order.  Doc. 300.  First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for 
such a stay.  See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority 
in support of legal positions advanced.”).  Second, the Court does not agree that the government 
Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV   Document 306   Filed 02/06/21   Page 15 of 16
Case 21-58, Document 39-3, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page164 of 165

is likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal because it believes that Mr. Robertson’s release is 
required by § 3142(e) and permitted by § 3142(i) for all of the reasons stated above.  Nor does the 
Court agree that “[t]here is no immediate need to release [Mr. Robertson] today.”  Doc. 298 at 4.  
As the Court has explained, with Mr. Robertson heading to trial in two months, the defense team 
needs every day it can get to prepare with him, especially if he will be required to quarantine for 
two weeks upon arriving at La Pasada, as was suggested at the pretrial conference. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth above, Mr. Robertson’s Motion to Reconsider Motion for Review 
of Detention Order and Immediate Release [Doc. 274] is hereby GRANTED.  See also Doc. 300.  
All of the conditions of Mr. Robertson’s release can be found in the Order Setting Conditions of 
Release, filed on February 5, 2021.  Doc. 301.  The government’s Amended Emergency Motion 
for Reconsideration of and Stay of Release Order [Doc. 298] is DENIED. 
DATED this 6th day of February, 2021.

ss.: 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ) 
LARA POMERANTZ, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby affirms under penalty of 
perjury: 
1. 
I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the Office of Audrey Strauss, United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and I represent the Government in this 
appeal. I submit this affirmation in support of the Government’s motion to file an unredacted copy 
of Exhibit F, the Government’s Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant’s Renewed Motion 
for Release, under seal.   
2. 
Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant filed publicly a redacted version of Exhibit F, 
which was the version publicly filed on the docket in this case.  (Dkt. No. 100). The redactions to 
that document are narrowly tailored to cover (1) information implicating the privacy interests of 
third parties previously articulated by the defense (Dkt. No. 86), and (2) Confidential Material 
produced by the Government in discovery and governed by the protective order in this case (Dkt. 
No. 36).  The Government believes that some of the redacted information is pertinent to this appeal 
and therefore seeks leave to file an unredacted copy of Exhibit F under seal.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
2. 
Maxwell appeals from orders denying her pre-trial release that 
were entered on December 28, 2020 and March 22, 2021, in the United States 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page1 of 25

District Court for the Southern District of New York, by the Honorable Alison J. 
Nathan, United States District Judge. 
3. 
Indictment 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) was filed on June 29, 2020, 
charging Maxwell in six counts. On July 2, 2020, Maxwell was arrested. On July 8, 
2020, Indictment S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Indictment”) was filed containing the 
same charges with ministerial corrections. (Dkt. 17 (“Ind.”)).1 Count One charges 
Maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charges Maxwell with enticing a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count 
Three charges Maxwell with conspiracy to transport minors to participate in illegal 
sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Four charges Maxwell with 
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 2423 and 2. Counts Five and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 1623.  
4. 
On July 14, 2020, Judge Nathan held a lengthy bail hearing, at 
the conclusion of which she denied Maxwell bail. (Ex. D). Maxwell twice renewed 
“Br.” refers to Maxwell’s brief on appeal; “Ex.” refers to the exhibits to Maxwell’s 
brief; “Gov’t Ex.” refers to the exhibit to this affidavit; and “Dkt.” refers to an entry 
on the District Court’s docket for this case. Unless otherwise noted, case text 
quotations omit all internal quotation marks and alterations.

her bail application (Ex. E, I), which motions Judge Nathan denied in written orders 
dated December 28, 2020 and March 22, 2021 (Ex. H, L). Maxwell filed notices of 
appeal from these two orders (though not the original detention order). 
5. 
Maxwell’s trial is scheduled to begin on July 12, 2021. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
A. 
The Offense Conduct and Evidence 
6. 
The Indictment charges Maxwell with facilitating the sexual 
abuse of multiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 
1997.2 (Ind. ¶ 1). During that period, Maxwell played a key role in Epstein’s sexual 
abuse of minor girls by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor victims to 
engage in sex acts with Epstein. (Ind. ¶ 1). Maxwell befriended victims by asking 
them about their lives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and 
encouraging them to interact with Epstein. (Ind. ¶ 4(a)). Maxwell groomed victims 
for sexual abuse for by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
After Judge Nathan’s bail decisions were issued, Superseding Indictment S2 20 
Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Superseding Indictment”) was filed, charging Maxwell in eight 
counts. In addition to the original six charges, the Superseding Indictment also 
charges Maxwell with sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, 
and sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Among other things, 
the Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged in 
Counts One and Three from 1994 through 2004 and specifically identified a fourth 
victim of those conspiracies. The additional charges strengthen the evidence against 
Maxwell and further support Judge Nathan’s detention orders. 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page3 of 25

front of a victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being 
present for sex acts involving a minor victim and Epstein. (Ind. ¶ 4(b)). Maxwell’s 
presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s abusive behavior, and she took 
part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. (Ind. ¶¶ 4(c), (e)). To make victims feel 
indebted to Epstein, Maxwell encouraged victims to accept Epstein’s offers of 
financial assistance. (Ind. ¶ 4(d)). The victims were as young as 14 years old when 
they were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that 
their victims were minors. (Ind. ¶ 1). 
7. 
Together, Maxwell and Epstein conspired to entice and cause 
minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which Maxwell 
knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
(Ind. ¶ 2). To conceal her crimes, Maxwell lied under oath during a civil deposition, 
including when asked about her interactions with minor girls. (Ind. ¶ 2). 
8. 
The Indictment contains detailed speaking allegations which 
describe: the means and methods of Maxwell’s criminal conduct (Ind. ¶ 4); 
Maxwell’s interactions with three minor victims (Ind. ¶¶ 7(a)-(c)); specific overt acts 
performed by Maxwell (Ind. ¶¶ 11(a)-(d)); and specific false statements that form 
the basis of the perjury charges (Ind. ¶¶ 21, 23). 
9. 
As the Government explained in oral and written proffers, the 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page4 of 25

allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of 
three different victim-witnesses. (See, e.g., Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-10). Each victim-
witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-witnesses, 
but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence, including 
flight records, diary entries, and other evidence. (Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 10-12).3 
B. 
The Initial Bail Hearing 
10. 
Before Maxwell’s bail hearing, the parties filed extensive written 
submissions. (Ex. A, B, C). On July 14, 2020, Judge Nathan heard lengthy oral 
argument from the parties and received statements from two victims. One victim, 
Annie Farmer, addressed the Court, stating that Maxwell “groomed me and abused 
me and countless other children and young women.” (Ex. D at 40-41). An 
anonymous victim submitted a written statement describing Maxwell’s abuse. (Id. 
at 38-40). 
11. 
Judge Nathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis 
of risk of flight and explained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling. (Id. at 79-91). 
First, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here 
weigh in favor of detention,” given the statutory presumption of detention triggered 
Exhibit F was filed in redacted form in the District Court. The Government has 
moved to file an unredacted version under seal in this Court. 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page5 of 25

by charges involving minor victims and the potential penalties those charges carry. 
(Id. at 82). Second, Judge Nathan determined that “[t]he government’s evidence at 
this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple victims who 
provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as 
well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary 
evidence.” (Id.). Third, Judge Nathan found that Maxwell’s history and 
characteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (Id. at 83). 
12. 
In addressing that third factor, Judge Nathan emphasized 
Maxwell’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,” 
including “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections 
abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.” (Id.). Judge Nathan 
noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite 
its citizens.” (Id.). She found that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial 
resources” and “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the 
defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the 
resources available.” (Id. at 83-84). 
13. 
Judge Nathan noted Maxwell “does have some family and 
personal connections to the United States,” but highlighted “the absence of any 
dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States.” (Id. at 84). 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page6 of 25

Although the defense argued that Maxwell did not leave the United States after 
Epstein’s arrest and was in contact with the Government through counsel, Judge 
Nathan emphasized that Maxwell “did not provide the government with her 
whereabouts,” and, in any event, “the reality that Ms. Maxwell may face such serious 
charges herself may not have set in until after she was actually indicted.” (Id. at 84-
85). 
14. 
Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had 
carried its burden of demonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of 
flight” and that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be 
insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s appearance. (Id. at 86). Though the proposed bail 
package represented only a fraction of Maxwell’s assets, Judge Nathan found that 
“even a substantially larger package would be insufficient.” (Id.). She noted that 
although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to 
full accounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial 
resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (Id. at 86-
87). That conclusion was informed by Maxwell’s “significant financial resources” 
and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.” (Id. at 87). 
Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s “recent conduct underscores her 
extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page7 of 25

acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (Id.).4 Judge Nathan 
concluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be 
insufficient” because Maxwell could remove the monitor and evade private guards. 
(Id. at 87-88). She also rejected Maxwell’s comparison to certain other high-profile 
defendants, citing “crucial factual differences” in those cases. (Id. at 88). 
15. 
Finally, Judge Nathan rejected Maxell’s arguments about the 
risks of COVID-19 and the difficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated 
client, noting that Maxwell had many months to prepare for trial and has no 
underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from 
COVID-19. 5 (Id. at 89-90). Judge Nathan found that measures in place were 
sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her counsel, but also directed the 
Government to work with the defense “to provide adequate communication between 
counsel and client” and stated that the defense may make specific applications to the 
District Court for further relief if the process was “inadequate in any way.” (Id. at 
90-91).  
For example, Maxwell did not leave her home but had security guards make 
purchases for her using a credit card in the name of an LLC. Before her arrest, 
Maxwell ignored FBI agents’ directions to open the door and tried to flee to another 
room in the house. A cell phone was found wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk. See, 
e.g., Dkt. 22 at 7-8 (full version of Ex. C), Ex. D at 32-34. 
Maxwell now has been fully vaccinated. (Gov’t Ex. A at 19, 21). 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page8 of 25

C. 
The Second Bail Application 
16. 
On December 8, 2020, Maxwell renewed her request for bail, 
presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex. E). After 
considering multiple written submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan denied 
Maxwell’s application in a written opinion (Ex. H).  
17. 
Judge Nathan found that the arguments presented “either were 
made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new 
information “only solidifies the Court’s view that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of 
flight and that no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at 
1-2). Judge Nathan explained: 
the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are 
serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if 
convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, 
including multiple corroborating and corroborated 
witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial 
resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a 
country that does not extradite its citizens); and the 
Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family 
to whom she now asserts important ties, has not been fully 
candid about her financial situation.  
(Id. at 2). 
18. 
Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s claim that the Government 
overstated the strength of its case at the bail hearing, finding that Maxwell “too easily 
discredits the witness testimony.” (Id. at 9-10). Judge Nathan credited the 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page9 of 25

Government’s proffer that “additional evidence, including flight records and other 
witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further support the main witnesses’ 
testimony and link [Maxwell] to Epstein’s conduct.” (Id. at 10). She thus concluded 
that the case against Maxwell “remains strong.” (Id.).  
19. 
Judge Nathan found that Maxwell “continues to have substantial 
international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have 
familial and personal connections abroad.” (Id. at 11). Judge Nathan was 
unpersuaded by Maxwell’s offer to consent to extradition, noting that the “legal 
weight of the waivers is, at best, contested” and therefore the risk of flight remained 
“fundamentally unchanged.” (Id. at 11-13). Judge Nathan further explained that 
Maxwell’s “extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide her the means 
to flee the country and to do so undetected.” (Id. at 13). Judge Nathan acknowledged 
that “letters of support” written by friends and family “substantiate the Defendant’s 
claim that she has important ties to people in the United States,” but found that the 
letters “leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an 
insurmountable burden” for Maxwell in light of, among other things, her claim at 
the time of arrest that she was getting divorced, her lack of employment, and her 
significant ties to family and friends abroad. (Id. at 14-15). 
20. 
Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s “pattern of providing 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page10 of 25

incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears 
significantly” on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and characteristics. (Id. at 15). 
Judge Nathan highlighted that in July 2020 Maxwell represented to Pretrial Services 
that she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection with her renewed 
request for bail presented a report on her finances that estimated the net worth of 
Maxwell and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2020. (Id. 
at 15). Judge Nathan found that the difference “makes it unlikely that the 
misrepresentation was the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than 
misdirection.” (Id. at 15-16). She explained:  
In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, 
stronger now than in July 2020, as it is clear to the Court 
that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial Services 
were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises 
significant concerns as to whether the Court has now been 
provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as 
to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of 
conditions of release. 
(Id. at 16). 
21. 
Judge Nathan again concluded that Maxwell presented a risk of 
flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her 
appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained millions of dollars and other assets that 
she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed bond is only partially 
secured.” (Id. at 16-18). Judge Nathan explained that the pledge of several third 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page11 of 25

parties to support Maxwell’s bond did not alter this conclusion because “the amount 
of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and 
future income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly 
enable her to compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses.” (Id. at 18). Judge 
Nathan also rejected Maxwell’s proposed conditions of release to a relative’s 
custody and private security guards, reiterating her concern regarding Maxwell’s 
“extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Id. at 18-19).  
22. 
Finally, Judge Nathan was “unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s 
argument “that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere 
with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release.” (Id. at 20). 
Maxwell did not “meaningfully dispute” that she has received more time than other 
inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as 
much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (Id.). Judge Nathan 
reiterated that she would continue to ensure that Maxwell is able to speak and meet 
regularly with her attorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (Id. at 20 
n.3). 
D. 
The Third Bail Application 
23. 
On February 23, 2021, Maxwell filed a third bail application, 
proposing two additional bail conditions: (1) renunciation of her French and British 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page12 of 25

citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new 
account to be overseen by a monitor. (Ex. I). After considering multiple written 
submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another written 
opinion. (Ex. L). 
24. 
Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not 
disturb her prior conclusions. (Id. at 2). She reiterated that detention was warranted 
in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s 
“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial 
financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of 
candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (Id. at 7).  
25. 
Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument that the strength of 
the evidence was diminished by Maxwell’s pending pre-trial motions. (Id. at 5-6). 
She also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the 
“[c]onsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the 
[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed 
monitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—
certainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (Id. at 10-11). Judge 
Nathan concluded, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page13 of 25

while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable 
assurances.” (Id. at 11). 
E. 
Judge Nathan’s Oversight of Maxwell’s Conditions of 
Confinement 
26. 
As she indicated she would, Judge Nathan has closely monitored 
Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the Government to 
submit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A (compiling update 
letters and relevant court orders)), and, in one instance, ordering the MDC to provide 
Maxwell access to a Government-issued laptop on weekends and holidays (see id. 
at 10-11). The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2021, 
noting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to discovery and 
communications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor recreation; the thirteen 
hours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with 
exclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shower; and her 
access to medical care, including the COVID-19 vaccine, which she has now 
received. (Id. at 17-22).

ARGUMENT 
The District Court Properly Denied Maxwell’s Motions for Bail and 
Temporary Release 
27. 
Judge Nathan did not clearly err when she determined that 
Maxwell is a risk of flight and that no conditions would reasonably assure her 
appearance in court. Nor did Judge Nathan abuse her discretion or clearly err by 
denying Maxwell’s request for temporary release. 
A. 
Applicable Law 
28. 
In seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden 
of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of 
flight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure 
her presence in court. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 
63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007).  
29. 
Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including 
offenses involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory 
presumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably 
assure the appearance of the person as required . . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E). In 
such a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of 
persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he 
does not pose a … risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page15 of 25

Cir. 2001). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the 
statutory presumption of detention, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it 
becomes a factor to be weighed and considered in deciding whether release is 
warranted. Id. 
30. 
Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the 
court must consider: (1) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2) 
“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and 
characteristics of the person.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g).  
31. 
This Court generally applies “deferential review to a district 
court’s order of detention.” United States v. Watkins, 940 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir. 
2019). It reviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight 
and whether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s 
appearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011); 
United States v. Shakur, 817 F.2d 189, 196 (2d Cir. 1987), and will reverse only if 
“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a 
mistake has been committed,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75. 
32. 
Once a defendant has been ordered detained, a judicial officer 
may “permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States 
marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page16 of 25

determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or 
for another compelling reason.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). The defendant bears the burden 
of showing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough, 
821 F. App’x 598, 600 (6th Cir. 2020); United States v. Belardo, No. 20 Cr. 126 
(LTS), 2020 WL 1689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2020). This Court has not 
resolved whether it reviews a district court’s temporary release decision for abuse of 
discretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852, 853 n.3 
(2d Cir. 2021). 
B. 
Discussion 
1. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err By Denying Bail 
33. 
Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times, 
that the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell 
is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in 
court. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument 
and receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention 
was appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry 
a presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence, 
which was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary 
corroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page17 of 25

international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections 
abroad, ownership of at least one foreign property of significant value, lack of candor 
about her finances, and “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex. D at 79-
91; Ex. H at 7-20; Ex. L at 6-11). Maxwell does not come close to identifying clear 
error. 
34. 
Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue 
reliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. 19-
21). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in 
the bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine, 
210 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir. 2000). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not 
substitutes for trial or even for discovery. Often the opposing parties simply describe 
to the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce it.” 
Id.; see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (“a 
detention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial … or as a discovery tool for the 
defendant”). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to 
proceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, 149 F. 
App’x 40, 42-43 (2d Cir. 2005); United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 309, 321 n.7 
(2d Cir. 2004); United States v. Vondette, 5 F. App’x 73, 76 (2d Cir. 2001); Martir, 
782 F.2d at 1145.  
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page18 of 25

35. 
Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was 
entirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case. This is not a case where the 
Government “simply stat[ed] in general and conclusory terms what it hoped to 
prove,” or where the Government proffered the statements of a single witness with 
a history of perjury. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d at 131. The Indictment—which reflects 
far more than just a proffer but instead the probable cause determination of the grand 
jury after receiving evidence—sets forth in detail the expected testimony of three 
victim-witnesses, describing specific actions Maxwell took with respect to each. 
(Ind. ¶ 7(a)-(c)). And as the Government explained, each victim-witness’s testimony 
is corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and by documentary evidence. 
(Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-12). Judge Nathan was entitled to rely on these proffers in 
assessing the strength of the evidence. 
36. 
Maxwell’s remaining arguments repeat contentions made below 
but do not meaningfully engage with Judge Nathan’s considered rejection of them. 
Maxwell disputes that she was hiding from law enforcement before her arrest (Br. 
23-24), but Judge Nathan was dubious of that assertion and found that even assuming 
Maxwell was hiding from the media, not the Government, her evasive actions 
demonstrated her “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex. D at 87). 
Maxwell asserts in conclusory fashion that her proposed bail package alleviates any 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page19 of 25

concerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge 
Nathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing 
regarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H 
at 11-14; Ex. L at 8-11). Maxwell attempts to compare herself to other high-profile 
defendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial 
factual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive 
findings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention 
appropriate. None of this was clear error. 
2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by 
Denying Temporary Release 
37. 
Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—
though she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her 
defense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. 13-19). Judge Nathan did not 
abuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.6 To the contrary, Judge 
Nathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access 
to her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense. 
As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an 
application. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release 
is “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail 
determination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Mattis, 963 
F.3d 285, 291 (2d Cir. 2020). The Court need not resolve the matter here, however, 
as Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review. 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page20 of 25

38. 
At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically 
invoked Section 3142(i) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied 
her request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its 
early stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel 
despite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-90). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the 
Government to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and 
invited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were 
“inadequate in any way.” (Id. at 90-91). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first 
detention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise 
concerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant 
oversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when 
Maxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—
though she did not, this time, invoke Section 3142(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan 
observed that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more 
time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not 
more, time to communicate with her attorneys.” (Ex. H at 20). And, again, Judge 
Nathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such 
accommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to 
make further applications. (Id. at 20 n.3). Judge Nathan continued to oversee 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page21 of 25

Maxwell’s access to counsel, and Maxwell did not renew her request for temporary 
release in her third bail motion.7 
39. 
Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to 
have abused her discretion by finding that temporary release is not “necessary” for 
Maxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a 
defendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 821 F. App’x 
at 601. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified, 
retained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the 
average defendant. Maxwell has access to a desktop computer provided by the MDC 
and a laptop provided by the Government for Maxwell’s exclusive use to review 
discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. (Ex. F at 29-30; Gov’t Ex. A 
at 17-18). Also during that time, Maxwell has access to email with defense counsel, 
calls with defense counsel, and legal visits (depending on pandemic-related 
conditions).8 (Ex. F at 29-30; Gov’t Ex. A at 18-19). Maxwell currently receives 
Thus, to the extent Maxwell’s arguments about her ability to prepare for trial are 
tied to any developments since the time of her first bail motion—such as, for 
example, the imminency of trial (see Br. 17)—this Court need not address such 
arguments in the first instance. Cf. United States v. Hochevar, 214 F.3d 342, 344 (2d 
Cir. 2000). 
In-person visitation at the MDC resumed on or about February 16, 2021. Attorney 
visits are permitted seven days per week. (Ex. A at 18-19). 
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page22 of 25

five hours of video-teleconference calls with her counsel every weekday. (Gov’t Ex. 
A at 18). 
40. 
Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a 
suggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released 
on bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That 
cannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’ 
for a defendant’s release under [Section 3142(i)], a court must balance the reasons 
advanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and 
resulted in an order of detention.” United States v. Chambers, No. 20 Cr. 135 (JMF), 
2020 WL 1530746, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020). Here, that balance emphatically 
favors detention, given Judge Nathan’s repeated findings about risk of flight and the 
substantial accommodations made to ensure Maxwell’s ability to prepare her 
defense. 
41. 
The risks presented by COVID-19 do not alter this conclusion. 
Not only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened 
risk of complications from COVID-19 (Ex. D at 89-90; Ex. H at 21), but she now 
has been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at 19, 21). And while some district courts 
have ordered temporary release based in part on the COVID-19 pandemic, each of 
these discretionary decisions rests on its particular facts, as Judge Nathan was well-
Case 21-58, Document 58-1, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page23 of 25

positioned to note with respect to the principal case cited below. (See Ex. D at 90-
(distinguishing United States v. Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d 63, 67 (S.D.N.Y. 
2020))). 
42. 
In sum, Judge Nathan acted well within her substantial discretion 
by denying Maxwell’s motion for temporary release. 
CONCLUSION 
43. 
For the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s motion should be denied.

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the 
defendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to 
the Court’s Order dated August 25, 2020.  (Dkt. No. 49).  Over the past three months, the 
Government has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s 
conditions of confinement.  This update is based on information provided to the Government by 
MDC legal during those conversations. 
Last week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the 
defendant is housed tested positive for COVID-19.  In response, the MDC implemented the same 
quarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.  
Specifically, on November 18, 2020, the defendant was tested for COVID-19 using a rapid test, 
which was negative.  That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine.  As with any other 
quarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she 
will be tested again for COVID-19.  If that test is negative, she will then be released from 
quarantine.  To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-19. 
During her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was 
already housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will 
continue to check on the defendant every day.  Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the 
defendant will be permitted out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes.  During that 
time, the defendant may shower, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.  
In addition, the defendant will continue to be permitted to make legal calls every day for up to 
three hours per day.  These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where 
no MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.   
On November 18, 2020, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant 
to use to review discovery.  During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be 
permitted to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day,

seven days per week.  Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review 
her discovery and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before 
entering quarantine.  The defendant will not, however, be permitted to meet in person with her 
lawyers until she tests out of quarantine.  
After the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the 
MDC implemented approximately three months ago.  Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day, 
the defendant will be permitted out of her isolation cell.  During those thirteen hours, the defendant 
will have access to a computer on which to review her discovery outside of her cell.  Also during 
the day, the defendant will be permitted to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal 
calls, access CorrLinks, and shower.  From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation 
cell.  The defendant will also be permitted to have in-person visits with her attorneys up to three 
days per week for multiple hours per visit.  On days when the defendant does not have in-person 
legal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.   
As was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her 
discovery than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine.  The defendant also has as 
much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her attorneys, even while 
in quarantine. 
As noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated 
both with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of 
confinement.  Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has 
immediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the 
concern.  The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will 
remain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of 
confinement.  Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this 
topic, the Government will promptly provide additional information.

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The parties jointly submit this letter in response to the Court’s November 24, 2020 order 
directing the parties to meet and confer regarding the defendant’s request that the warden of the 
Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) report directly to the Court and counsel on the 
defendant’s conditions of detention.  (Dkt. No. 76).  Over the past week, the Government has 
spoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried 
to gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the 
Government has shared with defense counsel.  The Government has also conferred with defense 
counsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden 
Heriberto Tellez.  The parties have been unable to reach agreement.  Our respective positions 
follow. 
The Government respectfully submits that the Court should allow MDC legal counsel to 
respond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense 
counsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement.  The Government 
understands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a letter by this Friday, December 4, 
2020.  Such a letter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allow the Court to hear 
directly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement.  The 
letter will allow the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by 
the Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary.  Moreover, the Government does not 
understand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials 
or her ability to communicate with her counsel.  As noted in the Government’s letter dated 
November 23, 2020, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any 
other inmate at the MDC.  The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC 
inmate to communicate with her attorneys.  (Dkt. No. 74). 
The defense disagrees.  As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as 
follows: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns 
regarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her.  On October 
29, 2020, the defense emailed a letter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive 
conditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive

searching  (e.g., weekly body scan, 15-minute interval flashlight checks at night, and open-mouth 
inspection) despite being surveilled 24/7 by a dedicated three-guard security detail and two 
cameras; and the reason she is not being moved to the day room, which we understood was the 
original plan (and would reduce searching).  Receipt of the letter was acknowledged, but to date 
there has been no response and little, if any, redress to the most serious conditions.  Upon 
information and belief, decisions concerning Ms. Maxwell’s specialized detention are made by 
Warden Tellez, or from others outside the MDC.  A report from the MDC Legal Department would 
provide second-hand information.  Accordingly, Warden Tellez should be directed to provide a 
first-hand accounting to the Court and counsel why Ms. Maxwell is being detained under such 
individualized conditions. 
Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

Re:

Ghislaine Maxwell, Reg. No. 02879-509 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
This letter is written in response to your order dated December 2, 2020, concerning Ghislaine 
Maxwell, Reg. 02879-509., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn, 
New York.  You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being. 
The Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can 
work and live in a safe and secure environment.  In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing 
assignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for 
her safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population.  We have discussed our decision with 
Ms. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to how to address any concerns through 
her Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.10 – 542.19.  To date, 
staff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies. 
In her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is allowed 
access to the common area of the housing unit from 7:00 AM through 8:00 PM, daily.  She has access to 
recreational space, social calls, television, shower, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery 
material.  A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:00 AM through 5:00 PM.  When Ms. Maxwell 
returns to her cell at 8:00 PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased 
through the commissary, and discovery material.  Since August 3, 2020, Ms. Maxwell has been able to 
purchase items from the full commissary list.  She receives commissary every second week like all other 
inmates. 
MDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure

inmates are breathing and not in distress.  Inmates in BOP custody are subject to searches, including 
body scanners, and inmates may be searched prior to moving from one area of the facility to another. 
The removal of Ms. Maxwell’s face mask complies with the BOP’s COVID-19 Pandemic Response Plan.  
Since Ms. Maxwell’s arrival, she has been provided three (3) meals a day in accordance with BOP 
policy and its National Menu.  Food Service staff have addressed Ms. Maxwell’s requests.  Ms. Maxwell is 
served her breakfast upon entering the common area of the housing unit at 7:00 AM; at noon she is 
served her lunch; and at 5:00 PM she is served dinner. Her medical records show that she currently 
weighs 134 lbs., which fluctuates plus or minus 2 lbs.  Health Services staff make regular rounds of her 
housing unit and she has been instructed on how to request medical care through the sick call 
procedures.  Furthermore, while there has been a number of inmates whom have tested positive for 
COVID-19, Ms. Maxwell remains in good health and is not in contact with those individuals.  The BOP 
staff is assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s unit do not come in contact with the other individuals whom have 
tested positive.  Lastly, the temperature of Ms. Maxwell’s cell is checked three times daily to ensure it is 
in compliance with national standards. 
In accordance with the BOP’s COVID-19 Pandemic Response Plan, inmates are allotted 500 
minutes per month of social telephone calls, which Ms. Maxwell has used throughout her time at MDC 
Brooklyn.  While Ms. Maxwell has received one legal video conference, she continues to have full access 
to legal telephone calls and in person legal visits.  Pursuant to the District Courts guidance, legal 
telephone calls are scheduled through the Federal Defenders, who should be afforded an opportunity to 
address any concerns Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys have with the legal calls.  
I trust this has addressed your concerns.

ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC legal counsel responding to 
the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 letter.  See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; 
see also Dkt. No. 78.  The Defendant responded to the MDC legal counsel’s letter on December 
7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally 
respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant’s conditions of confinement.  See 
Dkt. No. 91.  Having carefully reviewed the parties’ submissions, along with the MDC legal 
counsel’s December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to summon the 
Warden to personally appear and respond to questions.  This resolves Dkt. No. 75. 
Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall 
continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of Ms. 
Maxwell’s confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, including 
legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel.  The updates shall 
also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant.   
The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 
days.  Furthermore, the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant

Re:  United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court 
order the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the 
government so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays. 
At the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop 
computer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard 
drives.  Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays.  On weekends 
and holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery.  
However, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions 
of the discovery recently produced by the government.  As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several 
days of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the 
laptop.  If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in 
discovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July 12, 2021 trial date, she must 
have access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays. 
Defense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms. 
Maxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week.  At the request of defense counsel, the 
government has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to 
request that they lift this restriction, but without success. 
There is no principled justification for this restriction.  Ms. Maxwell was given access to 
the laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire 14-day 
period that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2020 because she had 
come into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID.  In 
addition, the laptop is kept in a locker in the same room where the prison computer is located, so it

would not require any change in Ms. Maxwell’s movements to give her the requested access.  
Furthermore, on at least three occasions since she was released from quarantine, Ms. Maxwell’s 
security team gave her the laptop to review discovery on the weekend. 
There is clearly no actual impediment preventing the MDC staff from providing Ms. 
Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and holidays.  Given the millions of documents that 
Ms. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be 
given as much time as possible with the laptop to review the discovery.  We therefore respectfully 
request that the Court order the BOP to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and 
holidays during the hours that she is permitted to review discovery.

Dear Judge Nathan: 
This letter is written in response to Order granted on January 15, 2021, concerning Ghislaine 
Maxwell, Reg. 02879-509., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center (”MDC”) in 
Brooklyn, New York.  The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given   
MDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection 
had been reiterated to the U.S. Attorney’s Office numerous times. 
Defense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her 
access to discovery.  However, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her 
discovery.  On November 18, 2020, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms. 
Maxwell to use to review discovery.  Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permitted to use that 
laptop to review her discovery for thirteen (13) hours per day, five (5) days per week.  In addition to the 
Government laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers.  Although defense counsel 
has indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic 
discovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery.  Despite defense 
counsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of 
Government laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim. 
Moreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three 
(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this is far more time than any other MDC
inmate is allotted to communicate with their attorneys.

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2021 
order allowing the parties to respond to a letter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention 
Center (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2021.  (Dkt. No. 117).  In particular, MDC legal counsel 
asks the Court to vacate its January 15, 2021 order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to 
use a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays.  While the Government has no 
objection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally 
defers to the MDC regarding how it manages its inmate population.  The Government will continue 
to defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery 
even without laptop access on weekends and holidays. 
Given the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the 
Government and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has 
extensive access to her discovery materials.  Since the Government made its first discovery 
production in August 2020, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in 
the MDC on which to review her discovery.  When the defendant complained of technical issues 
reviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced 
reformatted copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding how to open particular files.  
Because the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files 
on the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in 
her review of discovery.  On November 18, 2020, the Government hand delivered the laptop to 
the MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.   
As the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to 
review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC.  In particular, the MDC permits the 
defendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week.  On weekdays, the 
MDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time.  On 
weekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allow the defendant to use the BOP 
desktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material.  While, as noted 
above, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access

to the laptop, the Government generally defers to the judgment of the MDC in managing inmates 
at its facility, and sees no reason to depart from that practice here.  In this respect, the Government 
notes that the trial date remains approximately six months away, the BOP was already affording 
the defendant access to the laptop for some 65 hours a week, and the BOP was further providing 
weekend access to a desktop computer should the defendant wish to spend more than 65 hours 
each week reviewing discovery.

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the 
defendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to 
the Court’s Order dated December 8, 2020.  (Dkt. No. 92).  Over the past two months, the 
Government has had multiple communications with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s 
conditions of confinement.  This update is based on information provided to the Government by 
MDC legal counsel through those communications. 
The defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate 
at the MDC.  Specifically, the defendant is permitted to review her discovery thirteen hours per 
day, seven days per week.  During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop 
computer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery.  Additionally, pursuant to the 
Court’s January 15, 2021 Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by 
the Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per 
week.  Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer 
to send and receive emails with her attorneys.   
The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to 
communicate with her attorneys.  Due to the elevated number of COVID-19 cases within the MDC, 
in-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2020.  While in-person visits are 
suspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel.  In 
particular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.  
If defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to 
schedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed.  All of these VTCs and telephone calls 
take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her 
communications with counsel.   
The defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at 
the MDC.  All inmate mail is sent to the MDC’s mail room, where every piece of mail is processed

before being provided to the inmate recipient.  Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the 
volume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days.  As noted above, 
however, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has 
regular communication with counsel via VTC. 
MDC staff conduct two pat-down searches of the defendant per day: once when she is 
moved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day 
room to her isolation cell each night.  As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove 
her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches, 
can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth.  These pat-down and mouth searches are 
consistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different 
location within the jail facility.  Previously, the defendant attended VTC conferences in a separate 
part of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with 
counsel.  Recently, however, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that 
the defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to attend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby 
reducing the number of searches.  During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been 
strip searched.  When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip 
searched after any in-person visit. 
In addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day.  MDC staff 
also conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.  
At night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen 
minutes.  To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the 
cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes.  The MDC 
continues to assess that these searches are all necessary for the safety of the institution and the 
defendant. 
Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic, 
the Government will promptly provide additional information.

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the 
defendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to 
the Court’s Order dated December 8, 2020.  (Dkt. No. 92).  This update is based on information 
provided to the Government by MDC legal counsel regarding the conditions of the defendant’s 
confinement over the last two months. 
The defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate 
at the MDC.  Specifically, the defendant is permitted to review her discovery thirteen hours per 
day, seven days per week.  During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to both a 
desktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on 
which to review discovery.  Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the 
MDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her attorneys.1  This discovery review 
Per BOP policy, all inmate emails are routinely purged every six months.  In response to 
complaints from the defendant and defense counsel regarding prematurely deleted emails, MDC 
staff examined the defendant’s inmate email account.  That examination revealed that the 
defendant had herself deleted some of her emails and had archived others.  That examination 
revealed no evidence to suggest that MDC staff deleted any of the defendant’s emails.

takes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s isolation cell.  Accordingly, the 
defendant is permitted out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day.  While in the day room, the 
defendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on 
which to place social or attorney calls, and a shower.  The defendant is also permitted outdoor 
recreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.  
The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to 
communicate with her attorneys.  Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-
teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of attorney 
VTC calls per week.  At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdowns or short 
staffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 30 minutes.  When 
such delay occurs, however, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either 
by extending that day’s VTC call or by permitting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC 
call.  All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC 
staff can hear her communications with counsel.  During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a 
camera approximately 30 feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the 
VTC calls.  The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view 
either the defendant or her attorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls.  The camera does 
not capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her attorneys.  In other words, the 
camera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC 
room.  The defendant is also permitted to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her 
attorneys as needed.   
In addition, defense counsel now have the option of meeting with the defendant in person 
at the MDC.  On or about February 16, 2021, the MDC resumed in-person visitation.  As a result, 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 196   Filed 04/06/21   Page 2 of 6
Case 21-58, Document 58-2, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page18 of 22

Page 3 
in-person attorney visits are now available seven days per week.  The MDC has placed HEPA air 
filters in its attorney visiting rooms to improve air quality during visits.  Additionally, the 
defendant has received the COVID-19 vaccine and is now fully vaccinated.  The Government 
understands that defense counsel have thus far declined to meet with the defendant in person and 
instead rely on VTC calls, email, and supplemental phone calls to communicate with their client.  
The option of in-person visits remains available seven days per week should defense counsel wish 
to meet with the defendant in person. 
The defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at 
the MDC.  All inmate mail is sent to the MDC’s mail room, where every piece of mail is processed 
before being provided to the inmate recipient.  Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the 
volume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days.  As noted above, 
however, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has 
regular communication with counsel via VTC, which can be supplemented by phone calls. 
Like any other inmate, the defendant is patted down by MDC staff whenever she is moved 
to a different part of the facility.  Typically, these searches include at least two pat-down searches 
of the defendant per day: once when she is moved from her isolation cell to the day room each 
morning, and once when returns from the day room to her isolation cell each night.  In addition, 
when the defendant elects to attend outdoor recreation, she is searched two additional times: once 
when she is moved to the recreation area, and once when she returns to the day room from the 
recreation area.  MDC staff also conduct a body scan, which is a non-invasive machine scan, on 
the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.  Because those scans take place 
in a different part of the facility than the day room, the defendant is patted down two additional 
times when these weekly scans occur: once when she is moved to the scan area, and once when 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 196   Filed 04/06/21   Page 3 of 6
Case 21-58, Document 58-2, 04/12/2021, 3075763, Page19 of 22

Page 4 
she returns to the day room from the scan area.  As part of every pat-down search, the defendant 
is required to remove her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked 
during the searches, can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth.2  These pat-down 
and mouth searches are consistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they 
move to a different location within the jail facility.  In the absence of in-person visitation, the 
defendant has not been strip searched.  If the defendant receives in-person visits, then she, like all 
other inmates, will be strip searched after any in-person visit.   
In addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day.  At night, 
MDC staff are required to confirm every fifteen minutes that the defendant is not in distress.  To 
do so, every fifteen minutes, staff point a flashlight to the concrete ceiling of the defendant’s cell 
to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing.  At night, MDC staff 
have observed that the defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance 
caused by the flashlight.  Additionally, MDC staff have observed that the defendant regularly 
sleeps through these nighttime wellness checks.  The MDC continues to be of the view that all of 
these searches are necessary for the safety of the institution and the defendant. 
The Government also inquired regarding certain complaints defense counsel raised in 
February 2021 regarding the defendant’s food, water, and physical wellbeing.  In response, MDC 
Following defense counsel’s complaint in its February 16, 2021 letter of an inappropriately 
conducted pat-down search, the MDC conducted an investigation and found that, contrary to the 
defendant’s claim, the search in question was in fact recorded in full by a handheld camera.  After 
reviewing the camera footage, the MDC concluded that the search was conducted appropriately 
and the defendant’s complaint about that incident was unfounded.  MDC legal counsel further 
confirmed that all pat-down searches of the defendant are video recorded.  Following this incident, 
MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty.  Among other 
things, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which 
caused the cell to smell.  In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing 
the cell to become increasingly dirty.  MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell in 
response to the smell and the dirtiness, not as retaliation for complaining about a particular search.

Page 5 
legal counsel informed the Government that the defendant’s meals arrive in containers that are 
both microwavable and oven safe.  Currently, the defendant’s meals are heated in a thermal oven.  
The tap water available in the MDC is provided by New York City.  As a result, on occasions 
when the City has conducted maintenance near the MDC, the water has been temporarily shut off.  
During those periods, MDC staff have provided all inmates, including the defendant, with bottled 
water.  After the water is turned back on, the water is sometimes cloudy or brown and needs to run 
for several seconds before becoming clear.  MDC staff have not observed any instance in which 
the water in the defendant’s cell did not clear after being run for several seconds.  MDC legal 
counsel emphasized that MDC staff, including the legal staff, drink the same tap water from the 
same water system as the defendant while in the institution.   
MDC medical staff monitor the defendant daily and weigh the defendant at least once per 
week.  During her time at the MDC, the defendant’s weight has fluctuated between the 130s and 
the 140s.  The defendant’s lowest observed weight was 133 pounds in July of 2021.  Since then, 
her weight has fluctuated but has never been lower than 134 pounds.  Most recently, when the 
defendant was weighed last week, her weight was 137.5 pounds.  The defendant is 5’ 7”, meaning 
that even her lowest weight of 133 pounds resulted in a BMI of 20.8, which is considered a normal 
weight for a person of the defendant’s height.  MDC staff have not observed the defendant 
experience any noticeable hair loss.  As noted above, the defendant has received a COVID-19 
vaccine and is now fully vaccinated.  In short, MDC medical staff assess that the defendant is 
physically healthy.

Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page1 of 30

Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Reply in Support of Her 
Motion for Pretrial Release
The Government’s Response underscores why this Court should
order bail for Ghislaine Maxwell so that she can prepare for trial. The
court below erred in accepting the Government’s conclusory proffer
without any actual evidence. And the conditions of her confinement make
it impossible for her to effectively prepare her defense. The Government
concedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community, and her
proposed bail package demonstrates that she is not a risk of flight.
Accordingly, she should be released on bail.
At the very least, this matter should be remanded to the district
court to conduct a real bail hearing to (1) test the actual strength of the
Government’s case, and (2) determine whether Ms. Maxwell should be
granted temporary release so that she can effectively prepare for trial,
which she cannot do under the current conditions of confinement.
Relying almost entirely on a regurgitation of quotations from the
lower court (the first 26 of the 43-paragraph pleading is labeled “Facts”),
only ten paragraphs, labeled “Discussion,” even attempt to address Ms.
Maxwell’s arguments. As much as the Government would prefer that Ms.
Maxwell not have a fair fight, this Court must level the playing field so
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page2 of 30

that the presumption of innocence is more than mere words on a page.
This Reply responds to the arguments the Government does raise:
1. 
The Court did not conduct a “lengthy bail hearing.” Resp.¶2.
The transcript of the video arraignment and bail hearing spans only 91
pages, with the bail arguments on pages 22-79.  The Government did not
present any actual evidence at this brief hearing. Br.7-8,19-21. During the
bail hearing, each time the Government mentioned the strength of its
case, it cited to the Indictment.  See, e.g., Ex.D, p.24 (“Turning first to the
... strength of the evidence, the indictment in this case arises ... . The
indictment further charges that ...”); pg. 25 (“The indictment makes plain
... it was an ongoing scheme ... Given the strength of the government’s
evidence ... there is an incredibly strong incentive for the defendant to flee
...”).  The court erred in agreeing that the Indictment itself demonstrates
strength. Id. at 82 (“[I]t is appropriate to consider the strength of the
evidence proffered by the government in assessing risk of flight. The
government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.
Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the indictment
describes ...”).  At no point did the Government introduce or even proffer
any actual evidence.   
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page3 of 30

The defense has been forced to asked for a continuance of the July
trial because of the expansion of the conspiracy time period. Ex.O. If the
trial is delayed and Ms. Maxwell is not released on bail, she will be
further prejudiced with the inhumane conditions of confinement and the
inability to aid her defense.
The Government makes much of the fact that its Indictment is
“speaking.”  But speaking or not, an indictment is not a substitute for
evidence and cannot be used as proof that the case is strong.  If that were
true, then every single case would be strong because in every case there
is an indictment.  
2.
Similarly, the “additional charges” do not “strengthen the
evidence against Maxwell” and do not “further support Judge Nathan’s
detention orders.” Resp.¶6, n.2.  The new charges are allegations, nothing
more.  Piling allegation on allegation and then calling it proof does not
make it so. Allegations are not evidence. Moreover, these charges will
require Ms. Maxwell to spend more time with her lawyers, not less, and
further illustrate why bail is necessary.   
3.
Contrary to the Government’s assertion, “[e]ach witness’s
testimony” is not “corroborated by that of other victim-witnesses.”
Resp.¶9.  The Government continues to press the false point that the mere
number of accusers provides corroboration for the accusers. To the
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page4 of 30

contrary.  Not a single on of the anonymous accusers saw or heard what
purportedly happened to the other accusers.  Not a single one of the
anonymous accusers will be able to corroborate the 25-year old stories of
the other accusers. Indeed, their stories are contradictory, not
corroborating.  At a real hearing, the defense will demonstrate that each
of the witness’ stories has dramatically changed over the years.  At first,
none of the anonymous accusers even mentioned Ms. Maxwell.  As they
hired the same law firm, sought money and fame, joined a movement, and
only after Epstein died, did the accusers start to point the finger at Ms.
Maxwell.  Far from corroboration, this is fabrication.  The district judge
erred in relying on the Indictment as proof that the Government’s case is
strong.
4.
Because there was no meaningful proffer, the Government’s
reliance on United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir. 2000)
and United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986), is
misplaced. Resp.¶34.  In fact, those cases highlight the court’s error.  In
LaFontaine, for example, the bail revocation hearing lasted three days
where the government’s proffer included providing tape recordings,
transcripts, and an affidavit for the court.  No such evidentiary proffer
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page5 of 30

occurred here.  The LaFontaine Court explained that “while the
informality of bail hearings serves the demands of speed, the … district
judge must also ensure the reliability of the evidence, ‘by selectively
insisting upon the production of the underlying evidence of evidentiary
sources where their accuracy is in question.’” Id. at 131 (quoting Martir,
782 F.2d at 1147).  And in Martir, this Court recognized the “high stakes”
involved in a detention hearing and explained that the power afforded to
the lower courts “should always be exercised ‘with the recognition that a
pretrial detention hearing may restrict for a significant time the liberty
of a presumably innocent person.’” 782 F.2d at 1145 (internal citations
omitted).  It then criticized the government’s proffer as stating in “the
most general and conclusory terms what it hoped to provide,” for failing
to submit any “independent evidence, such as tapes, documents, or
photographs,” and for failing to furnish any testimony or affidavits.  Id. at
1147.  Sounds familiar.  Unlike Martir, where this Court found that it
could not reverse because the defense “did not challenge the proffer in any
way,” Ms. Maxwell absolutely challenged the flimsy proffer from the
initial bail hearing through three renewals.  Instead of properly putting
the Government to the test, the court blindly, uncritically, and
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page6 of 30

erroneously adopted its conclusory proffer.
5.
Ms. Maxwell’s intention to evade the media does not even
marginally amount to risk of flight.  Resp.¶33.  The Government does not
dispute that the media placed a bounty on Ms. Maxwell or that she was
being stalked by them before her arrest.  Of course she took measures to
protect herself and her family, just as government lawyers and judges do
when their safety is at issue. Ms. Maxwell was at her home in the United
States. The Government admits that it knew where she was. It had such
confidence that it could arrest her whenever it chose that it orchestrated
her arrest to coincide with a press conference replete with incendiary
demonstrative aids.  And it is worth repeating that the Government does
not claim that Ms. Maxwell – a 59-year old woman with no prior criminal
history – is a danger to the community.  She is no monster, but she is
being treated like one because of the “Epstein effect.”
6.
The Government’s contention that Ms. Maxwell receives more
time than other inmates at MDC to “review her discovery” and
“communicate with her attorneys” does not prove anything about whether
she is actually able to effectively prepare her defense.  Ms. Maxwell needs
more time with her lawyers and discovery than almost any other MDC
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page7 of 30

To illustrate, for Ms. Maxwell to review the 2.7 million pages, she
would have to do it, page by page, on a computer screen.  If she spent only
minute per page, it would take 45,000 hours or 3,750 days (at 12 hours
a day), without taking any notes, without discussing a single page with
her lawyers, and not including the discovery that is on the way.  Although
the Government labels this new discovery “non-testifying witness
discovery,” it really is Brady material which severely undermines the
already weak case. 
inmate, few of which are preparing for trial.  Over 97% of criminal
defendants plead guilty and, therefore, need far less time with their
lawyers.  Of the remaining 3% who do proceed to trial, the vast majority
are out on bond.  For those few in custody, how many involve anonymous
accusations that are decades old and 2.7 million pages?  And how often is
such a defendant forced to prepare her case during a pandemic where
in-person lawyer visits are unsafe and impractical? It is no wonder that
courts around the country are ordering temporary release under § 3142(i)
for the few defendants who are trying to prepare for trial during the
pandemic.  
The Government’s weak response is that Ms. Maxwell only
mentioned temporary release at the first bail hearing.  The Government
suggests waiver, without saying it. Nonsense. Ms. Maxwell has repeatedly
pressed her inability to effectively prepare her defense, which is properly
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page8 of 30

before this Court.
7.
Ms. Maxwell is not suggesting that “any defendant in a case
with voluminous discovery must be released on bail to prepare for trial.”
Resp.¶40.  Her case and situation is unique.  Other defendants may pose
a danger to the community.  The Government concedes that she does not.
Other defendants may not be U.S. citizens.  She is.  Other defendants may
not have strong U.S. connections.  Ms. Maxwell has lived here for 30
years, has a husband and step-children here, and has two sisters who are
U.S. citizens and live here. Other defendants may not have pledged almost
all of their assets or offer to have a monitor track her expenses.  Ms.
Maxwell has. Other defendants may not be willing to renounce their
foreign citizenship. She is. Other defendants may have prior convictions.
She does not.  But other defendants have no connection to Jeffrey Epstein,
and she does. Although unstated, that old connection is the driving factor
for detention, and that is error.
8.
The Government says that the district judge has “closely
monitored” her conditions of confinement.  Unfortunately, that is not
accurate.  The District Court accepted, without any real inquiry, the
self-serving Government letters. These letters describe a “prison
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page9 of 30

paradise,” not one of the most notorious prisons in America.  A “day room.”
Two computers. Recreation. Eye masks. But the Government’s description
of Ms. Maxwell’s conditions is not true.  For example, she has no eye
mask.  The guards flash lights in her cell every 15 minutes for no reason
so she tries as best as she can to shield her eyes with a towel that is not
secured and not effective against the unwelcome beams.  Even the
Government does not dispute that Ms. Maxwell is in de facto solitary
confinement.  It does not dispute that she has no surface to write on in her
isolation cell.  It does not dispute that there is often cloudy, obviously
unsanitary, water in the jail.  It does not dispute that she is being forced
to prepare for this trial with a computer that cannot do research and
cannot search documents. Attached as Exhibit P, is a response to the
latest Government letter, which outlines her actual conditions.  It is
inconceivable that the government lawyers or its witnesses could prepare
for trial under these conditions. 
It is painfully apparent that the two sides are far apart on how Ms.
Maxwell is being treated. The Government’s letters, however, are based
on multiple layers of hearsay – prison guards to the prison lawyer to the
prosecutor, which get summarized in an unsworn letter to the court.  No
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page10 of 30

affidavits at all, let along from anyone with actual knowledge, were
submitted to the court. And the judge has never had an evidentiary
hearing about the conditions.  
In its most recent letter, the Government contends that Ms.
Maxwell’s allegation of abuse by the prison guards is unfounded because
the Bureau of Prisons has reviewed a video of the incident and has
concluded that there is no abuse.  This self-serving proclamation is no
substitute for evidence. The prosecutors who filed the letter do not even
claim to have watched the video.  The Government should produce it for
the court and defense to review. The court should conduct a hearing to
determine what actually happened.  The Government professes to believe
women, but only when those women are on their side, despite their
inconsistent and self-contradictory statements about old, uncorroborated
allegations. When it is Ms. Maxwell who has been abused, the
Government wants to believe only the abusers who say they did no such
thing and without watching the actual video.  It seems like the only rule
is to get Ms. Maxwell at all costs. And it seems that a conviction is not
even enough for the Government – it wants to go so far as to humiliate
Ms. Maxwell with false statements about the cleanliness of her cell.  See
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page11 of 30

Gov’tEx. (April 6, 2021 letter, n.2).  But as Ms. Maxwell explained, the
Government’s narrative is total fiction – the unsanitary conditions are
caused by other inmates and guards, not Ms. Maxwell.  
9.
The Government also makes much of Ms. Maxwell’s
vaccination.  Again this demonstrates a gross double standard. Imagine
if the defense had publicly filed medical information about the accusers.
There would be hell to pay. The Government insists on secrecy and
redactions when discussing their witnesses, and will not even reveal their
names. Yet it freely discloses private information in violation of HIPAA
about Ms. Maxwell in public filings. 
In any event, whether Ms. Maxwell is vaccinated or not does not
help her search documents on an ancient computer or give her access to
a printer or allow her to meet with her lawyers (who would still need to
come into the jail and interact with numerous other prisoners and guards
who have not been vaccinated).  Ms. Maxwell’s bail motion is not based on
her risk of contracting COVID.  Her vaccination status is irrelevant.
Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page12 of 30

CONCLUSION
Ms. Maxwell should be released.  The allegations against her are
weak, she is not a risk of flight, and her appearance at trial is assured by
an unprecedented bail package.  In the meantime, she cannot effectively
prepare for  trial under these truly appalling conditions.
The Government’s tactic in this appeal, and in the court below, is
transparent – it is “trust us.”  Trust our proffer on the evidence because
we indicted her (and this case relates to Jeffrey Epstein).  Trust us when
we say her conditions are fine because the Bureau of Prisons says they are
fine (and we can’t have another Jeffrey Epstein situation).  The court
below clearly erred, however, in just trusting the Government without any
actual evidence and without a real hearing, notwithstanding Jeffrey
Epstein.  As much as the Government would like this case to be the
Jeffrey Epstein show, Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein.
Ms. Maxwell understands that she and the Government are not
going to agree on the facts.  This is an adversary system, of course.  But
in that circumstance, there must be an adversarial hearing where Ms.
Maxwell can demonstrate that the Government’s case – based on old,
anonymous accusations – is weak.  There must be an adversarial hearing

where she can demonstrate that her conditions of confinement make
preparing for trial impossible.  There must be an adversarial hearing
where she can challenge any contrary evidence.  At the very least, this
matter should be remanded to the trial court to conduct such proceedings.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
We write in reply to the government's April 9th letter opposing a trial continuance. 
TI1e defense has been steadfastly and diligently preparing for a July 12th trial based on tl1e 
01iginal indictment, a date set on the condition that there would be no superseding indictment 
adding substantive charges. TI1e recently filed superseding indictment directly contravenes that 
agreement and adds two new charges which vastly expand tl1e relevant time pe1iod from a four-
year period in the 1990s to an eleven-year period stretching from 1994 to 2004. TI1ese additions 
significantly alter the scope of the government's case and necessarily shift the focus of the 
defense's trial prepai·ation. Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of 
the three accusers from the 1990s, as we have been doing, the defense will now have to spend 
considerable time and resources investigating allegations of new conduct in a completely 
different time pe1iod involving numerous additional witnesses, and with all of the difficulties that 
COVID restrictions still place on a meaningful defense investigation. 
We do not want to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for a continuance. TI1e 
government beai·s responsibility for this need, having filed a late-breaking superseding 
indictrnent based on a witness who has been known to the govermnent since the Florida 

Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page18 of 30
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 202 Filed 04/15/21 Page 2 of 8

investigation in 2007 (see Dkt. 199 at 1-2), long before commencing this prosecution against Ms. 
Maxwell. We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a 
substantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining. 
Government Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable 
l11e government implies that the assumptions underlying the July 12 trial date are 
irrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was "ongoing." But 
"ongoing investigation" does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally 
charged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on 
distinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original 
charges. This is not a situation where the government's "ongoing investigation" has yielded, for 
example, a new ove1t act to an existing conspiracy. l11e government has effectively added a 
brand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against 
Ms. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed, 
by its own admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2020 
interview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding 
indictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any 
additional time to prepai·e to defend against tl1is revised prosecution. l11e government's double-
standai·d approach is simply wrong. l11e defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense 
investigation and must have adequate time to do so. 
l11e govermnent's recent production of 3500 material for non-testifying witnesses 
underscores the significant ainount of time that tl1e defense will need to investigate. On April 13, 
2021 , in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 20,000 
pages of interview notes, rep01ts and other mate1ials related to 226 sepai·ate witnesses whom the 
government does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these 

Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page19 of 30
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 202 Filed 04/15/21 Page 3 of 8 
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEI/\\ 
materials in the MDC. Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the 
materials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpat01y or 
othe1wise favorable infonnation for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to 
investigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as pait of the defense case. Even if defense 
counsel were to attempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and 
conduct any necessa1y follow-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time 
to complete. Tims, while we appreciate receiving these mate1ials, the disclosure has not 
decreased the ainount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it. 
It is also disingenuous for the government to ai·gue that because it previously provided 
discove1y regai·ding the new chai·ges no additional time is required to prepai·e the defense of the 
new indictment. When the pai·ties were 01iginally negotiating a discovery schedule for the 
01iginal indictment, the govermnent represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of 
caution, a significant ainount of discovery from Epstein's seized electronic devices that 
contained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell's case. l11e government 
reiterated this point in its November 6, 2020 letter to the Court requesting additional time to 
finish producing discove1y. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 ("l O Jf the approximately 1.2 million documents, 
only a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the 
chai·ges in the current indictment."). l11ese devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material, 
viltually none of which pertained to the time pe1iod of the 01iginal indictment. Now that the 
superseding indictment has expanded the time pe1iod of the alleged conduct well into the 2000s, 
the 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant ai·e now pertinent, requiling re-review and 
analysis. 1 
The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices 
included forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number. 

Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page20 of 30
case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 202 Filed 04/15/21 Page 4 of 8 
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEI/\\ 
l11e defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of 
superseding indictment by using te1m searches and key word searches. But given the nature of 
the discove1y, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of 
documents it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discove1y contains 
approximately 214,000 photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 250,000 
documents where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. l110se materials are not susceptible 
to text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms. 
Maxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new 
charges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks. 
We have already experienced the difficulties ofreviewing photographs with Ms. 
Maxwell. Over the past tlu·ee days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view 
with Ms. Maxwell. As pait of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hai·d 
drive to review approximately 2,100 "Highly Confidential" photographs tl1at were not produced 
to us in discove1y. Because of technical issues witl1 tl1e laptop, we still have not completed tl1e 
review. 
l11e re-review of tl1e discove1y will not be limited to tl1e materials on tl1e seized devices. 
l11e discove1y also includes numerous bank records and phone records tl1at date from tl1e 2000s 
and later. None oftl1ese records were from tl1e 1990s and were therefore lai·gely iITelevant to tl1e 
chai·ged crimes. However, witl1 tl1e expansion of tl1e chai·ges to include tl1e tiine period of tl1e 
2000s, tl1e defense will need to carefully analyze tl1ese records for relevant payments and phone 
calls, which will, again, take a significant amount of tiine. 
l11e government also attempts to justify its delay in seeking tl1e superseding indictment 
due to the investigative challenges posed by COVID. l11e government has been investigating for 
The forensic images contain thousands of individual documents.

years and elected to commence prosecution of Ms. Maxwell in the throes of the pandemic. All 
counsel have been laboring under the difficulties caused by this unprecedented circumstance. 
TI1e government's challenges pale in comparison to those experienced by the defense. 
Defending quarter-centmy-old allegations has required investigation across this countly and 
around the world. Investigating the new allegations will require the same effo1ts and diligence. 
It is laughable for the government to use COVID as an excuse for its delay in superseding the 
indictlnent and then oppose any continuance for the defense. Defense preparation is not ilmnune 
to the ilnpact of the pandemic. 
A Trial Continuance is Necessary 
While the government's offer to provide discove1y highlights and its representation that it 
will sti·eamline its case to prilnaiily focus on the four accusers ai·e helpful, these gestures do not 
eliminate the need for a continuance. As set fo1th above, the government's hyperbolic clailn that 
it can ' ensure that the defense will be fully prepai·ed to proceed to tiial on July 12, 2021" (Govt 
lti· at 4-5) ignores the reality that tilne is needed to: 
• 
supplement pending pretlial motions; 
• 
c1itically review voluminous discove1y produced in November 2020 that the 
government represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell; 
• 
re-review discove1y for the new tilne period and chai·ges; 
• 
cmmnence new investigations based on the new chai·ges and the govermnent's 
disclosure of 3500 mate1ial for non-testifying witnesses; and 
• 
refocus ti·ial prepai·ation and sti·ategy. 
TI1e govermnent 01iginally represented to the Court and counsel that this tiial would last 
two weeks. The government now predicts the ti·ial will last a month. TI1e estilnates ai·e mere 
guesses which do not factor in tilne-consuming COVID jmy selection in a high-publicity case 
necessitating sensitive and personal disclosures by prospective jurors or the presentation of 
defense evidence. In the absence of disclosure of the number and identity of government tiial

LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEI/\\ 
witnesses, including potential FRE 404(b) witnesses, and trial exhibits, the government's 
speculation about the length of the trial is entirely one-sided and lacking in any reliable estimate 
of a defense case. TI1e government's April 12th disclosure of inf01mation and statements 
regarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory info1mation requires intensive investigation. 
TI1e delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial 
severely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments. 
To assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately dete1mining the length of tiial, Ms. 
Maxwell requests that the Comt order the government to disclose: a list of tiial witnesses, its 
alleged FRE 404(b) evidence, and a list of potential tiial exhibits. With this inf01mation the 
Court and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises. 
At the barest minimum, we require a 90-day continuance. In reliance on the fnm tiial 
date set by the CoUit at Ms. Maxwell's airnigmnent on July 14th, 2020, counsel p1io1itized the 
July 12, 2021 tiial date, cleaiing and scheduling our calendai·s to avoid interference. Counsel 
have other clients and fnm commitlnents to tly cases specifically scheduled to follow the 
smmner ti·ial of this case. TI1ese co1mnit1nents make us unavailable from September tlu·ough 
December, and possibly spill over into J anuaiy, make ti·ying tl1is case unlikely, if not impossible, 
before 1nid-Januaiy. We ai·e exti·emely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one 
which will prolong Ms. Maxwell's 1niserable and punishing detention, but tl1e need for ti.me to 
properly prepai·e Ms. Maxwell's defense as a result of tl1e additional chai·ges requires us to do so, 
causing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to tllis request. 
In addition, motion heaiings, in ii.mine motion practice, and any litigation regai·ding 
expe1t witnesses have not yet c01mnenced, and issues regai·dingjmy selection, including but not 
limited to a jUiy questionnaire, have not yet been settled. Yesterday, we met witl1 tl1e

government in person to confer on a briefmg schedule for supplemental pretrial motions, as well 
as other deadlines, which we are prepared to discuss with the Comt at the arraignment. 
TI1e government's revised trial estimate from two to four weeks remains umealistic and 
does not include jruy selection, which will take longer than usual in this media-saturated case. 
We oppose advancing jmy selection beyond early distribution of questionnaires to prospective 
jurors. Even if the case were tried on the previous indictment on July 12th, carving off any ti.me 
required for trial preparation is unwa1Tanted and unfair. 
A continuance is justified based on the second superseding indictment. TI1e new charges 
up the ante and double Ms. Maxwell's sentencing exposure. To deny her a continuance 
undercuts her constitutional right to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. A 
continuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and 
necessruy in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a misca1·1iage of justice. 
Despite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell 
A delay of the July 12th tiial especially one that accommodates counsel's other tiial 
schedules - has a direct and delete1ious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued 
detention, the details of which ru·e well known to the Court. In addition to her prolonged 
detention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media repo1ting which impacts the ability to seat 
fair and imprutial jurors. 
On Ap1il 26th, Second Circuit will heru· oral ru·grunent on Ms. Maxwell's bail appeal and 
may moot any need for a fu1ther bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her 1ight to 
seek a bail heruing depending on the Circuit's decision.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
                    S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The government’s letter of April 6th is yet another regurgitation of its previous letters 
regarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement.  No matter how often the government tries 
to present Ms. Maxwell’s detention as superior to other inmates, it continues to miss the mark.  
We stand by our previous responses and reiterate that Ms. Maxwell’s detention is unwarranted 
and overly restrictive.  It is tantamount to “pay-it-forward” punishment served pretrial.  
The government’s letter provides the opportunity to flush out the persistent unsanitary 
conditions at the MDC, which long predate Ms. Maxwell’s detention. This past weekend there 
was a pervasive stench of sewage in Ms. Maxwell’s unit necessitating guards to flush pipes by 
pouring water down open drains in an effort to trap and disperse gaseous emissions. As guards 
explained to Ms. Maxwell, there are three drains in the day area, and when the plumbing system 
goes unused, gases escape from the drains and cause the stench. At times the stench in Ms. 
Maxwell’s isolation cell has been overwhelming due to overflowing of toilets in the cellblock 
above. Due to lack of privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from using the toilet in the isolation cell 
and, as directed by the guards, she flushes frequently to avoid plumbing problems. At times, the 
stench is apparent upon entering the visiting area. Of the many defense counsel who visit

regularly, I challenge the government to identify anyone that would risk their health by drinking 
the tap water. Even the guards resort to drinking bottled water.  
Blaming Ms. Maxwell for the filth of her severely restricted environment is utterly 
misplaced. To suggest she willingly lives in squalor is absurd. In an effort to wield power, the 
guards use cleaning as a punishment. The MDC - especially the East Building where Ms. 
Maxwell is held– is permeated with mold and vermin. Cockroaches and rodents are plentiful and 
glue tracks have been placed in Ms. Maxwell’s day area to help remediate the problem. 
While HEPA filters may improve the safety of the legal visiting rooms – characterized by 
an HVAC inspector as “a death trap” – in-person visiting with Ms. Maxwell is uncomfortable 
and unproductive. Relegated to a small “fishbowl” where chairs abut glass walls and a table, 
with no room in between, Ms. Maxwell and counsel are forced to wedge their bodies into chairs. 
There is no opportunity to view electronic discovery or exchange documents; and speaking while 
wearing a face mask while crammed on either side of a plexiglass divider under surveillance of 
three guards and a handheld camera places a chill on any free exchange of confidential 
information. While video conferencing has facilitated on-going communication between Ms. 
Maxwell and counsel, her request for a legal call to confer with counsel regarding pretrial 
motions was denied. 
Ms. Maxwell’s health is deteriorating.  She has not experienced sunshine and fresh air for 
the past eight months.  Referring to an interior gated pen where Ms. Maxwell can exercise (and 
be subjected to even more searches) as the “outside” is a misnomer. Barely a breeze permeates 
that area.   
Medical staff monitor Ms. Maxwell’s health by recording her weight in her medical 
chart.  Guards declined Ms. Maxwell’s request to know her weight, claiming they cannot look it 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 197   Filed 04/07/21   Page 2 of 5

up because it is part of her medical record, which is protected by the American Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act Health Information Policy (HIPAA).  She is weighed while 
clothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set 
above five pounds.  Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning.  The guards are far from 
qualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.  
Releasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without 
inmate consent is a HIPAA violation.  By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the 
MDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s letter. Requesting 
medical attention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk.  We request that the 
Court order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such 
information falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in 
Criminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of sensitive items of 
discovery that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s 
right to privacy.  
The incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her 
isolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and 
investigated within the facility. The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating 
team that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell 
for the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in 
front of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief, 
the camera was not recording at that time.  The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by 
citing a video. We request that the Court direct the government to provide defense counsel with 
that video. In response to any misconduct of guards,  the standard reply is that “the matter will be 
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN   Document 197   Filed 04/07/21   Page 3 of 5

LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEI~ 

taken seriously,” and just like the majority of complaints filed by inmates, the facility refuses to 
provide results of this and other inquiries.   
The mail and food issues persist.  Even a Federal Express envelope from the government 
was not given to Ms. Maxwell until two weeks after it was sent, containing a discovery disc that 
was unreadable.  In mid-March, she received a copy of the New York Times issued in October.  
Any claim that Ms. Maxwell deletes CorrLinks emails, which is disputed, does little to erase the 
fact that the MDC violated its own policy by prematurely deleting Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails.  
That her food is not heated in a thermal oven does little to explain why she was given a salad 
containing mold earlier this week. 
Ms. Maxwell does not have an eye mask; she’s not even provided a suitable face mask. 
She covers her eyes with a towel to shield them from glaring overhead lighting that she cannot 
turn off and from flashlights pointed into her cell every 15 minutes during the night.  That Ms. 
Maxwell chooses not to respond to guards during the nighttime is no indication that she is 
engaged in restful sleep; rather, it’s a respite from having to engage with them. 
No amount of gloss put on Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement can erase the fact 
that she remains in de facto solitary confinement, over-managed by multiple guards, and 
surveilled by multiple cameras 24 hours per day.  The computer equipment provided remains 
inadequate to review the millions of pages of discovery under circumstances that are not 
conducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark, 
save, and print is sufficient to prepare this document-laden case for trial.  The Court need only 
imagine how the government would respond if this was a 25-year-old document-driven fraud 
case.

The Court’s request for updates concerning Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement 
does little to improve her situation.  Quite the contrary. The government’s update letters are 
anything but helpful: They fuel media attention which resounds to Ms. Maxwell’s detriment. The 
government’s attempt to publicly embarrass and humiliate Ms. Maxwell in the hostile court of 
public opinion further erodes the likelihood that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury. 
The government’s review of the MDC may be Yelp-worthy, but it does not justify Ms. 
Maxwell’s inappropriate detention.  If the government wants to compare Ms. Maxwell to other 
defendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail. 
It is debatable whether the public has a “right to know” about Ms. Maxwell’s conditions 
of confinement, but clearly, it does not extend to personal and medical information. The 
government safeguards personal information regarding its witnesses and is reluctant to release 
any unless mandated by statute or court order.  Yet the government fails to accord Ms. Maxwell 
the same treatment. 
Should the Court request further updates from the government, we request that they be 
limited to changed circumstances and filed under seal or subject to appropriate redaction.  
Very truly yours, 
Bobbi C. Sternheim

Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Renewed Motion for Bond 
Although this Court denied Ghislaine Maxwell’s motion for bond 
(see Ex. A, Order, April 27, 2021), it appeared concerned with the 
conditions of her confinement during oral argument and instructed Ms. 
Maxwell that “[t]o the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her 
sleeping conditions, such request should be addressed to the District 
Court.”  (Id.). 
Ms. Maxwell did just that, explaining again to the trial judge the 
grueling conditions of her confinement, which includes shining a 
flashlight in Ms. Maxwell’s eyes every 15 minutes, over the past 318 days 
in solitary confinement, even though she is not suicidal and even though 
no other inmate suffers such abuse. Ex. C, Doc. 256. The government 
responded, Ex. D, and although it previously intimated that Ms. Maxwell 
might be suicidal (she’s not), it now said that the sleep deprivation was 
justified because she is housed alone, because of the nature of the 
charges, and because the case is high-profile. Not one of these reasons 
makes any sense upon any examination. The government did not provide 
an affidavit from anyone at the jail or explain why depriving Ms. Maxwell 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page3 of 14

of sleep would alleviate her stress instead of exacerbate it. Ms. Maxwell 
replied. Ex. E, Doc. 272. 
 The district court then issued an order saying that it would not tell 
the Bureau of Prisons what to do but “admonishe[d] the MDC and the 
Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those 
security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her safety and 
security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with 
the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.” Ex. B, Doc. 282.  
But Ms. Maxwell is not being treated like any other detainee. And 
the horrific conditions make it impossible to prepare for trial.  
Accordingly, we renew our motion for bond and seek relief from this 
Court. Ms. Maxwell simply wants a fair opportunity to fight the charges 
against her at trial.   
Currently, she (1) can’t sleep because the guards wake her every 15 
minutes; (2) oftentimes can’t drink the water because it is brown and 
contains particles; (3) can’t meet in person with her lawyers because the 
guards use a handheld camera to video and audio tape record the 
meetings; (4) can’t manage the smell of overflowing sewage that comes 
up from the drain in her unit; (5) can’t keep the guards from seizing and 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page4 of 14

going through her attorney-client materials; and (6) can’t search, print, 
highlight, or sort the discovery because the “computer” she was given was 
stripped down and does not have the proper software or hardware 
capabilities. The truth is that Ms. Maxwell is not being treated in a 
humane fashion and cannot prepare for trial under these horrific 
conditions. She has been in solitary confinement with no sleep for almost 
a year. The presumption of innocence has been turned on its head. This 
Court should either order her temporary release under 18 U.S.C. 3142(i) 
or remand this matter and order the trial court to conduct an evidentiary 
hearing on the conditions of her confinement.  
It is important to underscore that the government has made a 
number of representations to the trial court and to this Court about the 
conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention that have proven to be false. 
1. 
Government misrepresentation to the district court: “The 
defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance 
caused by the flashlight [every fifteen minutes].” Doc. 196 (April 6, 2021, 
gov’t letter to district court). But the truth is that she has no “eye mask” 
and the government has now admitted that eye masks are “contraband” 
in the jail and that she cannot have one. Doc. 270 (May 5, 2021, gov’t 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page5 of 14

letter to district court) (“MDC legal counsel has informed the government 
that the defendant cannot be provided with an eye mask.”). So Ms. 
Maxwell tries to shield her eyes with a sock or towel. Trying to sleep with 
an unsecured sock over your eyes in an attempt to shield yourself from 
flashlights searches every 15 minutes makes restful sleep impossible. 
The above picture shows how Ghislaine Maxwell looked before her 
arrest in July 2020 (left) and how she looks now after 10 debilitating 
months of tortuous conditions at MDC Brooklyn where, just as an 
example, she is not permitted to sleep. Ex. C, Doc. 256. 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page6 of 14

2. 
Government misrepresentation to this Court during oral 
argument when asked if shining lights in Ms. Maxwell’s face every fifteen 
minutes during the night was routine: “My understanding, Your Honor, 
is that that is a routine; it is routine by BOP officials.”  But then in a 
letter to the district court, the government admitted that Ms. Maxwell is 
the only inmate who receives these targeted flashlight checks every 15 
minutes. Doc. 270 (“MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen 
minutes [only for Ms. Maxwell] because the defendant, while not on 
suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule.”).  
In a response that would make Orwell’s Ministry of Truth proud, 
the government tries to spin this and argue that other inmates are also 
periodically checked throughout the night.  Doc. 270 (stating – without 
an affidavit or other actual sworn testimony – that in general population, 
checks are usually done about once an hour).   
But try as it might, the government cannot escape the bottom line 
that Ms. Maxwell is the only person who is treated this way and wakened 
every 15 minutes while in solitary confinement. In fact, the government 
then tries to justify the treatment by saying – again without support or 
an affidavit – that even though Ms. Maxwell is not suicidal, she should 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page7 of 14

be singled out in this way because she is alone, the nature of the charges, 
and that this is high profile case. But those reasons, individually or 
collectively, do not justify torturing someone by depriving them of sleep.  
Nevertheless, the district judge did not conduct a hearing or otherwise 
question BOP. It simply allowed the government to file a letter saying 
that this is what was relayed to the government from the jail lawyer from 
the jail guards. Even if that hearsay was true (which should be 
questioned based on other representations made by BOP to the 
government to the court), it is not at all sufficient for this type of 
treatment. 
3. 
Government misrepresentation to the district court: Ms. 
Maxwell “caused [her] cell to smell” by not flushing the toilet. Doc. 196, 
n.2 (April 6, 2021, gov’t letter to district court). This claim is absurd, of 
course, and was again made without any sworn statement. Ms. Maxwell 
responded and explained that the smell of sewage was caused by the 
conditions in MDC and not by her.   
This was recently corroborated by another MDC inmate, Tiffany 
Days, who explained to Judge McMahon the sorts of conditions that are 
present at MDC: “I also survived the disgusting feces flood that we were 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page8 of 14

actually told to clean with our own hands. It was humiliating. Floating, 
dead water bugs, mice, chunks of defecation coming out of the pipes and 
urine-filled water gushing all through the area. The water was as high 
as my ankles, and the smell was as bad. It was so bad, the inmates were 
vomiting due to nausea. Chunks of feces. And officers telling us that we 
had to clean it and clean it quick because lunch was on the way.”  She 
continued: “MCC and MDC are the most degrading and humiliating 
memories of my life. I will hold onto these memories forever, but these 
memories are my motivation to stay out of trouble, your Honor.” United 
States v. Tiffany Days, April 29, 2021, which can be accessed at: 
https://tinyurl.com/ytf8cyw5.  The judge in that case was upset, finding: 
“it is the finding of this Court that the conditions to which [Tiffany Days] 
was subjected are as disgusting, inhuman as anything I’ve heard about 
in any Colombian prison, but more so because we’re supposed to be better 
than that.”  See transcript of sentencing hearing, United States v. Tiffany 
Days, 
April

4. 
BOP false accusation to the district court concerning Ms. 
Maxwell’s lawyers: “Those [privileged] materials that defense counsel 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page9 of 14

gave to Ms. Maxwell contrary to MDC Brooklyn’s legal visit procedures 
were confiscated by staff…” Doc. 259.  Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers showed this 
was false and that they did not give anything to Ms. Maxwell. Doc. 258.  
In addition, there was a videotape of the incident. But the government 
refused to review it and refused to provide it to the court. The defense 
insisted on having a hearing and that it be provided with the videotape 
of the attorney-client visit so that it could show that the MDC statements 
to the government were false. The court declined to have a hearing or 
order the videotape turned over. The truth is actually out there. We 
simply want an opportunity to demonstrate it at a hearing. 
Ironically, the court then blamed the defense for failing to provide 
proof of its claims. The defense has, over and over again, requested 
hearings and that the videotapes of what is occurring in jail be produced.  
But the district court said that the defense “describes generalized 
grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application for 
relief.” Doc. 282. This is an odd reason to deny Ms. Maxwell relief, 
especially where even the government admits that guards flash a light in 
Ms. Maxwell’s cell every 15 minutes and that she is not provided an eye 
mask. We have said and continue to say that we would like production of 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page10 of 14

the evidence and a hearing so that we may demonstrate our other claims.  
These requests have been denied.  In any event, the government does not 
even deny most of the allegations we have made – Ms. Maxwell is being 
kept up at night, that oftentimes the water is undrinkable, that the food 
is not delivered or inedible, that her computer cannot perform the 
necessary tasks to prepare for trial, and so on.   
Instead, the government simply says that the district judge is 
managing Ms. Maxwell’s conditions. Again, that is just not true. The 
district court has made it clear – again in its latest order – that it won’t 
tell BOP what to do, even though BOP has not justified in any way the 
treatment that Ms. Maxwell is receiving. As we have said from the start, 
everyone knows the real reason she is being subjected to these abusive 
tactics: because Jeffrey Epstein died on BOP’s watch and it is going to 
treat Ms. Maxwell as though she is Epstein.   
In sentencing another woman who was held at MDC, District Judge 
Colleen McMahon said the defendant “shouldn’t have to suffer for the 
incompetence of the United States Department of Justice and its 
subsidiary agency, the Bureau of Prisons.  I will do what I can to bring 
your situation to the people who, if they give a damn, might do 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page11 of 14

something.”  See transcript of sentencing hearing, United States v. 
Tiffany 
Days, 
April 
29, 
2021, 
which

at: 
https://tinyurl.com/48yw29px. 
We are appealing to this Court to do something, as Judge McMahon 
pleaded. Ghislaine Maxwell has a Constitutional right to be able to 
prepare effectively for trial.  The conditions of her pretrial detention 
deprive her of that right.  For almost a year, she has been held in the 
equivalent of solitary confinement, in deteriorating health and mental 
condition from lack of sleep because she is intentionally awakened every 
minutes by lights shined directly into her small cell, inadequate water 
and food, the constant glare of neon light, and intrusive searches, 
including having hands forced into her mouth in a squalid facility where 
COVID has run rampant.  
Ms. Maxwell understands that she and the government are not 
going to agree on the facts. This is an adversary system, of course. But 
when the government’s representations about the conditions of 
confinement continue to be demonstrably and admittedly false, there 
needs to be an intervention. If the Court is not prepared to temporarily 
release Ms. Maxwell on bond so that she can prepare for trial, it should 
Case 21-58, Document 89-1, 05/17/2021, 3102450, Page12 of 14

order the district court to conduct a hearing on the conditions of her 
confinement so that the defense can make the appropriate showing.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
–v– 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell wrote to the Court requesting that the 
Court address her sleeping conditions, with particular emphasis on counsel’s representation, 
unsupported by affidavit or other factual showing, that guards are shining a flashlight in 
Maxwell’s eyes every 15 minutes at night.  Dkt. No. 256.  Defense counsel claims that the 
flashlight surveillance in Maxwell’s eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her 
ability to prepare for and withstand trial.  The Court sought more information by ordering the 
Government to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain 
questions.  Dkt. No. 257.  In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight 
checks of all inmates as a matter of course.  Dkt. No. 270.  As reported by the Government, 
inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 
minutes. Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per 
night at regular intervals.  The Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights 
are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in 
distress.  As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP’s 
flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates, including 
that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential stress for inmates that

can arise in high-profile cases.  The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more 
frequent safety and security checks.  The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye 
masks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-
contraband items to cover her eyes. 
To the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override BOP’s 
determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that 
request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.  Certainly nothing in the 
record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for 
her trial and communicate with her lawyers.  Defense counsel’s May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 
272, describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application 
for relief.  Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-
trial detainees can be reduced.  The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to 
continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP 
determines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, 
and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.  
The Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel 
for the MDC. 
SO ORDERED.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell  
                  S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
During oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms. 
Maxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while 
detained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court.  In its brief denial 
of her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping 
conditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A.  We press our 
concerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep 
deprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial. 
Ms. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a 
flash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked.  The myth that Ms. 
Maxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest 
during the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim.  In fact, Ms. Maxwell 
is classified with the standard CC1-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health 
care. (See Dkt. 159 at 3.) 
Contrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. 196 
at 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she 
resorts to using a sock or towel to cover her eyes in an awkward attempt to shield them from 
disrupting illumination every 15 minutes.  Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a 
visible bruise over her left eye.  The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B.  Despite 24/7 camera 
surveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as 
they did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who 
has no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point, 
MDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her 
in the SHU if she did not reveal how she got it.  While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of 
the bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has grown increasingly reluctant to report 
information to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. However, there 
is concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the 
lights projected into her cell throughout the night.

 The MDC routinely places inmates in the SHU if they have engaged in physical 
altercation with other inmates or to protect inmates who are the subject of abuse.  It would be 
ironic if the MDC follows through with its threat to place Ms. Maxwell in the SHU: It would 
signal that Ms. Maxwell needs protection from the very staff so intent on protecting her, since 
she has no contact with anyone but staff.  
As suggested by the Circuit, we ask the Court to address Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping 
conditions by directing the MDC to cease 15-minute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or 
justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.  
Very truly yours,

Re:  
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated 
April 29, 2021, which directed the Government to confer with legal counsel at the Metropolitan 
Detention Center (“MDC”) regarding the use of flashlights in security checks at MDC.  (Dkt. No. 
257).  The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court’s 
Order, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.  
MDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a matter of course throughout the facility 
for the safety and security of the inmates at the institution.  During these flashlight checks, MDC 
staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that 
the inmate is present in the cell, breathing, and not in distress.  MDC staff conduct flashlight checks 
every 30 minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the “SHU”) and conduct 
flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular 
intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.   
With respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes 
because the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule.  That is

because MDC has identified a number of factors that raise heightened safety and security concerns 
with respect to this defendant, including: (1) the nature of the charges, (2) the potential stress for 
inmates that can arise in high-profile cases, and (3) the need to ensure the defendant’s safety while 
she is incarcerated in a cell by herself—a housing determination made by MDC staff based on 
various factors, including the defendant’s expressed concern for her safety if she were to be housed 
in the general population.1  
As to the Court’s question whether the defendant can be provided with “appropriate eye 
covering,” MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that the defendant cannot be provided 
with an eye mask.  Eye masks are not available for purchase in commissary and are not issued to 
inmates and, therefore, are considered contraband.  The defendant is permitted, however, to use 
non-contraband items to cover her eyes at night.   
Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic, 
the Government will promptly confer with legal counsel at MDC and provide additional 
information. 
Respectfully submitted,

The MDC has determined the defendant’s current housing assignment based, in part, on her 
concerns about being housed in the general population and as an alternative to her being housed 
in the SHU.  By contrast, in the SHU, most inmates have a cellmate which provides an additional 
check should something go wrong or should an inmate need medical attention in the middle of the 
night.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
       S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
Once again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC, 
the reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable.  In its May 5th letter regarding the 
MDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 270), the government contradicts a 
previous report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her 
counsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s 
bail appeal. Now, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms. 
Maxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband.  This alone is a basis for the Court to 
question the veracity of representations made by the MDC. 
To justify the 15-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive 
sleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security 
schedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns” 
with respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious.  They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of 
other pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants 
charged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of 
release and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves.  The MDC 
attempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s 
“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”  
The MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake 
Screening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2020 posed the 
following question: “Do you know of any reason why you should not be placed in general 
population?”  Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the 
determination regarding general population or degree of segregation.  The Intake Screening

Form listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and 
concerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press 
by other inmates.  Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had 
been vaccinated. 
Further, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell 
completed two programs to assist other inmates- (1) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to 
help update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her  
de facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others. 
Ms. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the 
MDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked 
to her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed 
her at all in a 20-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal 
documents, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an 
effort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s 
and BP-10s only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response 
was told the form was either lost or never filed,   Each and every day of her detention, she is 
guarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera, 
her every move: when she eats, showers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards 
feverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears 
that they go beyond their routine continual 15-minute reporting.   
Further, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time.  It was the staff who 
confronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her 
learning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss 
personal matters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of 
someone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that 
information, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance.  We invite the 
Court and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms. 
Maxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with 
family and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her 
family in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United 
States.

In the face of the Epstein’s death on the BOP’s watch, the MDC would not risk a repeat 
of the debacle that occurred in the MCC.  There can be no doubt that the MDC was following 
directives from Attorney General William Barr and the Director of the BOP in determining that 
Ms. Maxwell should not be placed in general population, not Ms. Maxwell. Regardless, the 
MDC would never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in general 
population, knowing the difficulties it would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from assault and 
extortion by other inmates given that they do not protect her from physical abuse by guards.  But 
that decision does not justify the degree to which the MDC overmanages Ms. Maxwell’s 
detention and its detrimental effect on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for trial. 
We have repeatedly expressed our concern for Ms. Maxwell’s health and the impact her 
conditions of confinement are having on her health and well-being, her ability to prepare for 
trial, and the overall impact the severe conditions will have on her stamina to withstand trial, 
which we moved to the fall. With each passing day, it becomes increasingly more obvious that 
Ms. Maxwell’s extreme conditions of detention will not be improved and health deteriorate 
commensurate with the unprecedented conditions of confinement unparalleled in the MDC.

Maxwell bail. (Ex. D). Maxwell twice renewed her bail application (Ex. E, I), which 
motions Judge Nathan denied in written orders dated December 28, 2020 and March 
22, 2021 (Ex. H, L).  Maxwell filed notices of appeal from these two orders (though 
not the original detention order). 
4. 
On April 27, 2021, this Court affirmed the orders denying 
Maxwell’s pretrial release that were entered by Judge Nathan on December 28, 2020 
and March 22, 2021, and denied Maxwell’s motion for bail, or in the alternative, 
temporary pretrial release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). 
5. 
On May 17, 2021, Maxwell filed a renewed motion for pretrial 
release, seeking to relitigate this Court’s ruling. 
6. 
Maxwell’s trial is now scheduled to begin on November 29, 
2021. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
7. 
This Court is already familiar with the factual and procedural 
background of this case, which were detailed in the Government’s Affirmation in 
Opposition to Defendant’s Appeal of Orders Denying Pretrial Release, dated April 
12, 2021.  The Government respectfully incorporates by reference the facts and 
arguments set forth in its April 12, 2021 opposition. 
8. 
In sum, the Indictment charges Maxwell with facilitating the 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page3 of 24

sexual abuse of multiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 
1994 and 1997.2  (Ind. ¶ 1).  During that period, Maxwell played a key role in 
Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor 
victims, who were as young as 14 years old, to engage in sex acts with Epstein.  
(Id.).  Together, Maxwell and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims 
to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.  (Ind. ¶ 
2).  To conceal her crimes, Maxwell lied under oath during a civil deposition, 
including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.  (Id.). 
9. 
The Indictment contains detailed speaking allegations which 
describe: the means and methods of Maxwell’s criminal conduct (Ind. ¶ 4); 
Maxwell’s interactions with three minor victims (Ind. ¶¶ 7(a)-(c)); specific overt acts 
performed by Maxwell (Ind. ¶¶ 11(a)-(d)); and specific false statements that form 
the basis of the perjury charges (Ind. ¶¶ 21, 23). 
After Judge Nathan’s bail decisions were issued, Superseding Indictment S2 20 
Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “Superseding Indictment”) was filed, charging Maxwell in eight 
counts.  In addition to the original six charges, the Superseding Indictment also 
charges Maxwell with sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, 
and sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.  Among other 
things, the Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged 
in Counts One and Three from 1994 through 2004 and identified a fourth victim of 
those conspiracies. 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page4 of 24

10. 
As the Government has explained in oral and written proffers, 
the allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of 
three different victim-witnesses.  (See, e.g., Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-10).  Each 
victim-witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-
witnesses, but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence, 
including flight records, diary entries, and other evidence.  (See Ex. A at 5; Ex. F 
at 10-12). 
11. 
Maxwell has made three separate bail applications to the District 
Court, each of which was thoroughly briefed.  Judge Nathan denied all three 
applications in careful and thorough decisions.   
12. 
First, after receiving extensive written submissions from the 
parties (Ex. A, B, C), Judge Nathan held a bail hearing on July 14, 2020, at which 
she heard lengthy oral argument and received statements from two victims.  Judge 
Nathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis of risk of flight and 
explained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling.  (Ex. D at 79-91).  In reaching 
this decision, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense 
here weigh in favor of detention” (id. at 82), “[t]he government’s evidence at this 
early juncture of the case appears strong” (id.), and Maxwell’s history and 
characteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight (id. at 83).  Among other 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page5 of 24

things, Judge Nathan emphasized Maxwell’s “substantial international ties,” 
including “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections 
abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.”  (Id.).  Judge 
Nathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,” 
lacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,” 
and made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not 
provide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.”  (Id. at 83-84).  
Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of 
demonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even 
the most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s 
appearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her 
financial] resources and herself.”  (Id. at 86-87).  Judge Nathan also rejected 
Maxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated, 
finding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her 
counsel.  Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to 
provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the 
defense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the 
process was “inadequate in any way.”  (Id. at 90-91).  
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page6 of 24

13. 
Second, on December 8, 2020, Maxwell renewed her request for 
bail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions.  (Ex. 
E).  After considering multiple written submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan 
denied Maxwell’s application in a detailed written opinion (Ex. H).  Judge Nathan 
found that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or 
could have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s 
view that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of 
conditions can ensure her appearance.”  (Ex. H at 1-2).  Among other things, 
Judge Nathan concluded that the case against Maxwell “remains strong” in light of 
the Government’s proffer of evidence.  (Id. at 10).  Judge Nathan further found 
that Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign 
citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary 
financial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and 
to do so undetected.”  (Id. at 11-13).  Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s 
“pattern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial 
Services bears significantly” on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and 
characteristics.  (Id. at 15).  Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell 
presented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot 
reasonably assure her appearance.”  (Id. at 16).  Additionally, Judge Nathan was 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page7 of 24

“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are 
uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus 
justify release.”  (Id. at 20).  In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully 
dispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan 
Detention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to 
communicate with her lawyers.  (Id.). 
14. 
Third, on February 23, 2021, Maxwell filed yet another bail 
application, proposing two additional bail conditions.  (Ex. I).  After considering 
multiple written submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request 
in another written opinion (Ex. L).  Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was 
warranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, 
Maxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, 
substantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s 
“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.  (Id. at 7).   Judge 
Nathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.  
Yet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable 
assurances.”  (Id. at 11). 
15. 
Throughout the pendency of this case, Judge Nathan has closely 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page8 of 24

monitored Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the 
Government to submit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A 
(compiling update letters and relevant court orders)), and by reviewing and 
addressing defense motions regarding Maxwell’s conditions of confinement (see, 
e.g., id. at 10-11). 
16. 
Maxwell appealed Judge Nathan’s latter two bail decisions.  In 
connection with that appeal, Maxwell also moved for pretrial release pending appeal.  
After receiving briefing and hearing oral argument, this Court affirmed Judge 
Nathan’s bail decisions and denied Maxwell’s motion for pretrial release on April 
27, 2021.  (Mot. Ex. A).  Responding to claims about Maxwell’s sleeping 
conditions that had been raised in her briefing and at oral argument, this Court’s 
order noted that any request for “relief specific to [Maxwell’s] sleeping conditions” 
at the MDC “should be addressed to the District Court.”  (Id.). 
17. 
At no point after this Court’s bail decision did Maxwell file a 
renewed motion for pretrial release in the District Court. 
18. 
Following the issuance of this Court’s decision, on April 29, 
2021, Maxwell submitted a letter to Judge Nathan asking the District Court “to 
address Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing the MDC to cease 15-
minute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or justify the need for the disruptive 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page9 of 24

flashlight surveillance.”  (Mot. Ex. C at 2).  That same day, Judge Nathan directed 
the Government to confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the District Court 
with an explanation of what flashlight surveillance the MDC conducts on Maxwell 
at night, the basis for such surveillance, and the availability of an appropriate eye 
covering for Maxwell’s use at night.  (Dkt. 257). 
19. 
On May 5, 2021, the Government submitted a letter to Judge 
Nathan conveying MDC legal counsel’s answers to the District Court’s questions.  
(Mot. Ex. D).  First, the Government confirmed that all inmates at the MDC are 
subject to some form of flashlight checks throughout the night for their safety and 
security.  In particular, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell in 
order to illuminate the cell enough to confirm that each inmate “is present in the cell, 
breathing, and not in distress.”  (Id. at 1).  MDC staff conduct such checks every 
minutes in the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), and approximately once per hour 
for inmates housed in general population.  (Id.).  Because Maxwell is on an 
enhanced security schedule, MDC staff conduct these nighttime checks on her every 
minutes.  (Id.).  Second, the Government conveyed that the MDC has 
determined that, although Maxwell is not on suicide watch, increased frequency of 
nighttime monitoring is warranted in her case due to several factors that “raise 
heightened safety and security concerns,” including the charges she faces, the 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page10 of 24

increased stress of a high-profile case, and her sleeping situation in a cell by herself 
without a cellmate.  (Id. at 2).  Third, the Government noted that the MDC would 
not permit Maxwell to have an eye mask because such an item is not available in 
commissary and is not issued to inmates.  (Id.).  MDC staff do, however, permit 
Maxwell to cover her eyes at night using other items that are available in commissary 
or that are issued to inmates.  (Id.). 
20. 
In response, on May 7, 2021, Maxwell filed a reply letter 
disputing the MDC’s explanation for the implementation of an enhanced security 
schedule for Maxwell and raising additional concerns regarding conditions at the 
MDC beyond Maxwell’s sleeping conditions but without seeking particular relief as 
to those conditions.  (Mot. Ex. E).  At no point did Maxwell file an affidavit in 
support of her claims regarding the conditions of her confinement.  
21. 
On May 14, 2021, Judge Nathan issued a written decision 
denying Maxwell’s request for an order directing the MDC to modify its nighttime 
monitoring schedule.  (Mot. Ex. B).  In reaching this decision, Judge Nathan 
noted that Maxwell’s claim that MDC staff was shining a flashlight directly into her 
eyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual 
showing.”  (Id. at 1).  Judge Nathan emphasized that all MDC inmates are subject 
to nighttime flashlight checks and found that “there are a number of neutral reasons” 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page11 of 24

justifying the MDC’s decision to monitor Maxwell more frequently at night than 
other inmates.  (Id.).  With respect to eye coverings, Judge Nathan noted that the 
prohibition on eye masks “is a generally applicable policy,” but Maxwell is 
nevertheless permitted to “use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes” at 
night.  (Id. at 2).  Judge Nathan concluded that “nothing in the record plausibly 
establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her 
trial and communicate with her lawyers.”  (Id.).  Consistent with the attention she 
has paid to Maxwell’s conditions of confinement throughout the pendency of this 
case, Judge Nathan instructed the Government and the MDC “to continue to ensure 
that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols” that are “necessary for 
her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent 
with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.”  (Id.). 
ARGUMENT 
Maxwell’s Motion Should Be Denied 
22. 
This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s orders denying 
bail or temporary pretrial release to Maxwell and accordingly denied her motions 
seeking such relief on appeal.  The instant motion, which Maxwell styles as a 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page12 of 24

“renewed motion for pretrial relief,” is both procedurally improper and substantively 
meritless.  It should be denied.   
A. 
Applicable Law 
23. 
When seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the 
burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a 
risk of flight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably 
assure her presence in court.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 
493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007).  
24. 
Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including 
offenses involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory 
presumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably 
assure the appearance of the person as required . . . .”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E).  
In such a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden 
of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he 
does not pose . . . a risk of flight.”  United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 
(2d Cir. 2001). 
25. 
Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the 
court must consider: (1) “the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2) 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page13 of 24

“the weight of the evidence against the person”; and (3) the “history and 
characteristics of the person.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(g).  
26. 
This Court applies “deferential review to a district court’s order 
of detention.”  United States v. Watkins, 940 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir. 2019).  It 
reviews for clear error the district court’s findings regarding risk of flight and 
whether the proposed bail package would reasonably assure the defendant’s 
appearance in court, see United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011); 
United States v. Shakur, 817 F.2d 189, 196 (2d Cir. 1987), and will reverse only if 
“on the entire evidence,” it is “left with the definite and firm conviction that a 
mistake has been committed,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75. 
27. 
Once a defendant has been ordered detained, a judicial officer 
may “permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States 
marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer 
determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or 
for another compelling reason.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(i).  The defendant bears the 
burden of showing that temporary release is necessary.  See United States v. 
Scarborough, 821 F. App’x 598, 600 (6th Cir. 2020); United States v. Belardo, No. 
Cr. 126 (LTS), 2020 WL 1689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2020).  This Court 
has not resolved whether it reviews a district court’s temporary release decision for 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page14 of 24

abuse of discretion or clear error.  See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852, 
853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2021). 
B. 
Discussion 
28. 
This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail 
determinations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release.  The only 
changed circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s 
determination that the MDC’s nighttime security protocols do not interfere with 
Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that 
Judge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s 
prior bail applications. 
29. 
As an initial matter, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket 
a new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan.  Instead, she filed her 
“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively 
asking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision.  To the extent 
this motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal 
Rule of Appellate Procedure 40(a)(1) and Local Rules 40.1 and 40.2. 
30. 
In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal, 
Maxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District 
Court based on any alleged changed circumstances.  As this Court has explained in 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page15 of 24

the context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be 
made in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be 
made initially in the district court.”  United States v. Hochevar, 214 F.3d 342, 344 
(2d Cir. 2000) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from 
detention orders); cf. generally Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 6 (1951) (explaining, 
before passage of the Bail Reform Act, that “[t]he proper procedure for challenging 
bail as unlawfully fixed is by motion for reduction of bail and appeal to the Court of 
Appeals from an order denying such motion”).  The Order Maxwell annexes to her 
motion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—is not a bail 
determination, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order.  See Fed. R. 
App. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of 
the district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal”).  
No bail determination is properly before this Court. 
31. 
In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively 
meritless.  This Court has already held that Judge Nathan did not commit clear error 
in finding, three times, that the Government established by a preponderance of the 
evidence that Maxwell is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably 
assure her appearance in court.  This Court has also concluded that Judge Nathan 
did not abuse her discretion or clearly err in determining that Maxwell’s conditions 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page16 of 24

of confinement do not warrant temporary release.  Nothing in Maxwell’s renewed 
motion alters that conclusion. 
32. 
“As a general matter, this Court will adhere to its own decision 
at an earlier stage of the litigation.”  United States v. Plugh, 648 F.3d 118, 123 (2d 
Cir. 2011).  The “law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for 
compelling reasons,” such as where there is “an intervening change of controlling 
law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent 
manifest injustice.”  Id. at 123–24; see also United States v. Tenzer, 213 F.3d 34, 
(2d Cir. 2000) (“We have stated that we will not depart from this sound policy 
absent cogent or compelling reasons.”).  Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason, 
let alone a “compelling” reason, Plugh, 648 F.3d at 123, for this Court to reverse its 
prior decision. 
33. 
The only new events that Maxwell cites as justification for her 
request that this Court reverse itself is additional letter briefing before the District 
Court regarding MDC’s nighttime security checks.  Nothing about that briefing or 
Judge Nathan’s most recent written order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred 
when finding Maxwell poses a flight risk or abused her discretion when determining 
that temporary release is not warranted. 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page17 of 24

34. 
Consistent with her practice throughout the pendency of this 
case, Judge Nathan carefully considered Maxwell’s most recent complaint that 
nighttime security checks by MDC staff interfere with her ability to prepare for trial.  
When Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to direct the MDC either to modify its nighttime 
surveillance procedures or to justify those procedures, Judge Nathan solicited a 
response from the MDC and evaluated the explanation provided.  In so doing, 
Judge Nathan focused on whether the MDC implemented the contested protocol 
based on neutral factors that justify any deviation from the ordinary practice. 
35. 
Maxwell faults Judge Nathan for not “tell[ing] the Bureau of 
Prisons what to do.”  (Mot. at 2).  But even assuming that it were proper for a 
District Court to instruct the Bureau of Prisons regarding the details of operating a 
jail, Maxwell fails to explain why it was unreasonable to conclude that an increase 
of nighttime checks from the 30-minute intervals applicable in the SHU to the 15-
minute intervals applied to Maxwell was warranted given the specific factors that 
heighten safety and security concerns for Maxwell.  Unlike most other inmates, 
Maxwell does not have a cellmate who could alert staff if she was in distress, and 
Maxwell faces very serious charges under the glare of a high-profile case, the stress 
of which increases the possibility that she may self-harm.  Moreover, as Judge 
Nathan noted, Maxwell offered no evidence to support the notion that those 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page18 of 24

nighttime checks involve shining a flashlight directly into her eyes (as opposed to 
the ceiling), that the checks in fact disturb her sleep, or that the checks prevent her 
from being able to prepare her defense.3 
36. 
It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a 
motion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant 
only insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial.  As this Court previously 
recognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability 
to prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court.  Maxwell availed 
herself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security 
protocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial.  Tellingly, 
Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during 
the course of this case.  It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that 
Maxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband 
items to cover her eyes.  The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language 
in an April 6, 2021 letter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and 
acknowledged the inaccuracy.  The remaining accusations, however, are 
unfounded.  For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral 
argument about nighttime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that 
it involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every 
minutes.  To the contrary, when asked whether the nighttime checks were 
conducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t 
speak to what is done as to all inmates.”  Only after conferring with the MDC did 
the Government convey to Judge Nathan, and now this Court, the MDC’s procedures 
for nighttime checks of all inmates.  The Government has and will continue to 
accurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to 
respond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court. 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page19 of 24

Maxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application 
for pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its 
operations or justify its procedures.  In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s 
protocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well 
within her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.  
Even in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s 
conditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation 
for trial.  This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused 
her substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or 
temporary release. 
37. 
To the extent Maxwell now raises new complaints about 
conditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the 
District Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan.  In any event, as was the case with 
her concerns about nighttime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to 
support her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from 
preparing for trial.  There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare 
assertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides 
inadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflows 
Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page20 of 24

into Maxwell’s unit. 4  Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as 
corroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding 
described in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the 
“MCC”), not the MDC.  (See United States v. Days, 19 Cr. 619 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. 
Apr. 29, 2021), Sentencing Tr. at 13-16 (describing incidents Tiffany Days 
experienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being 
transferred to the MDC)).  There is no evidence in the record from the Days case 
or this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC 
during Maxwell’s incarceration there.  To the extent Maxwell suggests that any 
such issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should 
seek relief before the District Court.  Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about 
her ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge 
Nathan.5 
Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at 
3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general 
population.  Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general 
population.  Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that 
she is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody.  Rather, Maxwell has 
access to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during 
which she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a 
telephone, a television, and a shower.  (See Dkt. 196 at 2). 
As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC 
have gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources

38. 
The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture 
is whether Judge Nathan committed clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight 
risk or abused her discretion when denying Maxwell temporary release.  Nothing 
in the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s conclusion that Maxwell poses a 
real risk of flight.  Nor does the renewed motion explain how Judge Nathan’s 
careful consideration of the MDC’s nighttime security protocols and continued 
monitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with 
counsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of discretion.  Simply 
put, the renewed motion fails to present any “compelling” reason for this Court to 
reverse its prior decision in this case.  Plugh, 648 F.3d at 123. 
to review her discovery.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 235 at 7 n.4; Dkt. 196 at 1-2).  Among 
other things, Maxwell has exclusive access to both a desktop and a laptop computer 
on which to review her discovery, thirteen hours per day, seven days per week.  She 
is also able to review discovery with her attorneys during the 25 hours of legal video-
teleconference calls she receives each week.  (See Dkt. 196 at 1-2).

CONCLUSION 
39. 
For the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s motion should be denied.

Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from orders of the District Court entered 
December 28, 2020 and March 22, 2021, which denied her renewed requests for bail pending trial.  
See Dkts. 1, 20.  Upon due consideration, it is hereby ORDERED that the District Court’s orders 
are AFFIRMED and that Appellant’s motion for bail, or in the alternative, temporary pretrial 
release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), Dkt. 39, is DENIED.  During oral argument, counsel for 
Appellant expressed concern that Appellant was improperly being deprived of sleep while 
incarcerated.  To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping conditions, such request 
should be addressed to the District Court.
