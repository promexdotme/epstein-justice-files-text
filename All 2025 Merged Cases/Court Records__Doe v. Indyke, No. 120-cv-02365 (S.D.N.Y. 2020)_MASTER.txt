UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------X 
JANE DOE, 
Plaintiff, 
-against- 
COMPLAINT 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, in their 
capacities as executors of the ESTATE OF JEFFREY E.  
EPSTEIN;  
 Defendants. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------X 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, by her attorneys, Kaiser Saurborn & Mair, P.C., as and for her 
complaint against the defendants, alleges as follows: 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
1. 
Jane Doe seeks justice for the sexual crimes perpetrated against her by Jeffrey 
Epstein over the course of many years and for the abuse, manipulation and exploitation she 
suffered at his hands. Epstein identified Jane Doe as an extremely emotionally vulnerable young 
woman who, at the time she met him, had been entirely abandoned by her community, friends, 
and family which enabled him to seduce her into his world of horrific abuse.  Every aspect of her 
life was controlled by Epstein. He dominated her psychologically. Jane Doe was constantly 
emotionally bullied and coerced by Epstein, including being required to submit to his constant 
sexual abuse. This lawsuit is about Jane Doe claiming her power, becoming a survivor, not a 
victim, and getting restitution for the sexual crimes perpetuated against her.  She has real 
damages that are lasting: 1) She has permanent emotional injuries; 2) Her capacity to pursue a 
professional career has been severely compromised; 3) Her name and reputation has been ruined; 
Case 1:20-cv-02365   Document 1   Filed 03/17/20   Page 1 of 8

and 4) she is virtually bankrupt, having been forced to spend most of her resources defending 
herself against false accusations, all of which stem from Epstein’s crimes. 
2. 
The Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, who perpetrated crimes of sexual abuse, sexual 
assault and rape against Jane Doe, must be held responsible for ruining her life.  It has been 
nearly 19 years since Jane Doe was recruited by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and 
plunged into a world in which she was psychologically, physically and sexually exploited and 
controlled for years. 
3. 
Jane Doe was a naïve and uniquely vulnerable 22-year old when Epstein and 
Maxwell first preyed upon her.   
II. 
JURISDICTION 
4. 
This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because 
the claims asserted herein arise under 18 U.S.C. § 1591-1595. 
5. 
Venue is properly laid in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because it is a 
District in which much of the alleged wrongdoing occurred. 
III. 
THE PARTIES 
6. 
Plaintiff is a sex trafficking victim of Epstein. 
7. 
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Edward Epstein (“Jeffrey Epstein” or 
“Epstein”) maintained a residence and businesses at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021 
(“Epstein’s NY Residence”) which was the location where Epstein committed repeated sexual 
assaults of young women, like Plaintiff, and engaged in sex trafficking.   
8. 
At all times relevant herein, Epstein was an adult male over the age of 48, born on 
Case 1:20-cv-02365   Document 1   Filed 03/17/20   Page 2 of 8

January 20, 1953, and who died on August 10, 2019.  He continued to maintain a residence and 
businesses at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021, and occupy it until his death. 
9. 
At all times relevant herein, Defendant, Darren K. Indyke, is named in his 
personal capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein”), which was opened and domiciled in the United States Virgin Islands, St. 
Thomas Division, and is the legal entity responsible for intentional, criminal, and tortious 
conduct committed by Jeffrey Epstein as described in this Complaint.  The Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein includes Epstein’s NY Residence, which was occupied by Jeffrey Epstein and his 
businesses until his death and was one of the locations where repeated acts of sexual abuse and 
sex trafficking against various women, including plaintiff, occurred. 
10. 
At all times relevant herein, Defendant, Richard D. Kahn, is named in his 
personal capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein”). 
11. 
At all times relevant herein, Defendant, Darren K. Indyke, is named in his 
personal capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein”). 
12. 
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Epstein (legally represented now through 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (and 
referred to herein as the “Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein”), owed a duty to Plaintiff to treat her in a 
non-negligent manner and not to commit, or conspire to commit, or cause to be committed, 
intentional, criminal, fraudulent, or tortious acts against Plaintiff, including any acts that would 
cause Plaintiff to be harmed through conduct committed against her in violation of the TVPRA. 
Case 1:20-cv-02365   Document 1   Filed 03/17/20   Page 3 of 8

IV. 
EPSTEIN’S SEX TRAFFICKING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE 
13. 
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Epstein [“Epstein”] was an extremely wealthy 
financier, who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal sexual 
crimes in violation of the TVPRA, and to employ and conspire with other corporate entities, 
private foundations and trusts, to assist him in committing those sexual crimes or torts or to 
facilitate or enable those acts to occur. 
14. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his employees; to 
the employees of the corporate entities, private foundations, and trusts, who worked at his 
direction; to the victims procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to advance and 
carry out and conceal his crimes and torts. 
15. 
At all times relevant herein, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, a fleet of 
airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and several helicopters. 
16. 
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Epstein travelled between and frequently 
inhabited and travelled between numerous properties and homes, including a Manhattan 
townhome located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021 valued conservatively by Jeffrey 
Epstein’s own admission at $55,931,000.00; a ranch located at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, 
New Mexico 87056 valued conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein’s own admission at 
$17,246,208.00; a home located at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida 33480 valued 
conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein’s own admission at $12,380,209.00; an apartment located at 22 
Avenue Foch, Paris, France 75116 valued conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein’s own admission at 
$8,672,820.00; and an Island Little St. James Island No. 6B USVI 00802 (A, B, C).  
17. 
As has been publicly reported, Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for 
Case 1:20-cv-02365   Document 1   Filed 03/17/20   Page 4 of 8

young females and took pleasure in corrupting vulnerable young females into engaging in sexual 
acts with him.  The allegations herein primarily concern Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct while at his 
NY, Virgin Islands, Florida, New Mexico, and Paris residences and other locations.  
18. 
Epstein fulfilled his compulsive need for sexual contact with and control over 
young females by preying on their personal, psychological, financial, and related vulnerabilities. 
Epstein’s tactics included promising the victims shelter, transportation, gifts, money and 
employment, admission into educational institutions, educational tuition, protection, illusion of 
family and other things of value in exchange for sex.  
19. 
Jeffrey Epstein specifically targeted underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable 
and/or economically disadvantaged young females exactly like Plaintiff to sexually molest and 
abuse. 
20. 
Epstein’s continuous psychological and physical control over Jane Doe facilitated 
his sexual abuse of her on a relatively consistent basis for many years.  
21. 
The sexual abuse took many forms including Epstein’s rape of Plaintiff.  
22. 
He would also enter plaintiff’s room and get into her bed while she was sleeping 
and then fondle or penetrate her with his fingers. This occurred often and repeatedly.  
23. 
He often directed her to undress and pose in certain ways and/or touch him and 
herself while he masturbated.  This occurred often and repeatedly.  
24. 
Epstein frequently directed Jane Doe to turn her head back during their sexual 
encounters, telling her that he did not want to see her face.   
25. 
Epstein also repeatedly required Jane Doe to bathe with him and perform oral sex 
on him.   
26. 
This occurred in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico, London, Paris, on 
Case 1:20-cv-02365   Document 1   Filed 03/17/20   Page 5 of 8

Epstein’s private island, on Epstein’s airplanes and other locations.  
27. 
Jane Doe was paid in part to be sexually available to Epstein.  
28. 
In or about January or February 2012, Epstein grabbed Plaintiff by the hand while 
at his New York City Residence and took her to a small room on the third floor. It was a room 
with two chairs in it. He sat her down, pulled her pants down, covered her eyes, and used a 
vibrator on her. Epstein laughed afterwards.   
CAUSE OF ACTION I AGAINST EPSTEIN 
29. 
Defendant, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United 
States, in interstate and foreign commerce, and/or affecting interstate and foreign commerce, 
knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, 
solicited, threatened, forced, or coerced Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts. 
30. 
Such actions were undertaken knowing that Defendant Epstein’s use of force, 
threats of force, fraud, coercion, and/or combinations of such means would be used, and were in 
fact used, in order to cause Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts. In doing so, Defendant 
violated 18 U.S.C. § 1591. 
31. 
Furthermore, Defendant attempted to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In doing so, 
violated U.S.C. § 1594(a). 
32. 
Defendant conspired with each member of the enterprise, and with other persons 
known and unknown, to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In so doing, Defendant violated U.S.C. § 
1594(a). 
33. 
By virtue of Defendant’s violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1593A, and 1594, 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Khan as Joint Personal Representatives of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein is subject to civil causes of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 by Plaintiff, who 
Case 1:20-cv-02365   Document 1   Filed 03/17/20   Page 6 of 8

is a victim of the violations. 
34. 
Certain property of Defendant was essential to the commission of the federal 
crimes and torts described herein, including the use of multiple private aircraft including a 
Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-31H with a tail number N908JE) and a Gulfstream 
aircraft (of make and model G-1159B with a tail number N909JE). Such aircraft, along with 
other of Defendants’ property, were used as means and instruments of Defendants’ tortious and 
criminal offenses and, as such, are subject to forfeiture. 
35. 
Additionally, Defendant’s mansion, located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New 
York, in the Southern District of New York, his Palm Beach residence and his private island 
located in the United States Virgin Islands, and his ranch in New Mexico were among those used 
as means and instruments of Defendants’ tortious and criminal offenses, and, as such, are subject 
to forfeiture. 
36. 
As direct and proximate result of Defendant’s commission of the aforementioned 
criminal offenses enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1591, 1593A, and 1594, and the associated civil 
remedies provide in § 1595, Plaintiff has in the past suffered and will continue to suffer injury 
and pain; emotional distress; psychological and psychiatric trauma; mental anguish; humiliation; 
confusion; embarrassment; loss of self-esteem; loss of dignity; loss of enjoyment of life; invasion 
of privacy; and other damages associated with actions. Plaintiff will incur further legal, medical 
and psychological expenses. These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff will continue to 
suffer from them in the future. In addition to these losses, Plaintiff has incurred attorneys’ fees 
and will be required do so in the future. 
37. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Defendants for compensatory 
and general damages, attorneys’ fees, punitive damages and such other and further relief as this 
Case 1:20-cv-02365   Document 1   Filed 03/17/20   Page 7 of 8

Court deems just proper. Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by 
a jury.   
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against defendants as follows: 
(i) 
Assessing compensatory damages and punitive damages in an amount to be 
determined at trial;    
(ii) 
Attorney’s fees and interest, and disbursements; and 
(iii) 
For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

JOINT STIPULATION AND [PROPOSED] ORDER STAYING ACTION

Dear Judge Freeman: 
I represent Jane Doe in the above referenced litigation.  I write to respectfully request a 
one week extension to submit Plaintiff’s motion to proceed anonymously in the above referenced 
action. Defendant consents to this request. 
For the past week I have been preparing and participating in an arbitration which has 
prevented me from focusing on other matters. 
Thank you for your time and attention.

Index No. 20-CV-02365 
AFFIDAVIT OF 
ABBIE TULLER 
Abbie Tuller, LMHC, being duly deposed, swears the following: 
1. 
Jane Doe has been a client of mine since April 20, 2020. Ms. Doe has suffered complex 
trauma because of the severe and prolonged victimization she experienced by Jeffery Epstein. 
This resulted in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder with dissociation, severe major 
depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. 
2. 
Prior to working with me and during our time together, Ms. Doe has experienced 
episodes of significant suicide ideation. These periods have been the result of stressors that have 

Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 30-2     Filed 07/30/21     Page 3 of 4
caused Ms. Doe to feel vulnerable and deeply exposed, thus activating her desire to end her 
life. This feeling of exposure and vulnerability is experienced by many sexual assault victims. 
3. 
Sadly, this often results in them not reporting the abuse they endured. For those who do, 
the compounding experience of shame, vulnerability and loss of control frequently result in 
revictimization and exacerbation of symptoms, particularly symptoms of post-traumatic stress 
disorder (Herman, 1992; 2003). 
4. 
Although Ms. Doe has made notable improvements, she remains at serious risk of a 
resurgence of these suicidal thoughts and rnminations, should her victimization be further 
publicly exposed. This could pose a significant risk to her well-being. 
5. 
As a result, I strongly recommend Ms. Doe proceed with any legal proceedings 
anonymously to persevere her current emotional stability and safety. 
6. 
These recommendations are based on my collective experience in the fields of mental 
health and victimization. I currently operate a private practice as a licensed mental health 
counselor working with individuals suffering from a range of psychological disorders, 
particularly responses to trauma. 
7. 
Previously, I worked in the field of domestic violence and sexual assault for 10 years, as 
an Executive Director of a non-residential domestic violence and sexual assault organization, and 
as the Senior Director of Domestic Violence Special Programs across multiple shelters. 
8. 
Additionally, I am completing my doctoral studies at the City University of New York's 
Graduate Center in Criminal Justice in which my dissertation is focused on coercive tactics 
among abusers. I am an adjunct assistant professor of psychology at John Jay College of 
Criminal Justice in which I teach graduate-level courses on victimization and counseling.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, was during the course of a decade repeatedly and violently sexually  
assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein while being trafficked globally. Despite this unspeakable abuse, 
there are some who have mercilessly disparaged Jane Doe and even threatened her with death. If 
Jane Doe’s name were to be made public, others would likely descend upon her with further 
death threats. 
Jane Doe’s Jeffrey Epstein story has never been told. Those who have followed the 
Epstein saga have no understanding of the constant and ritualistic abuse Jane Doe endured. As 
her therapist attests to in her affidavit, her psychological state is tenuous and severe.  If she were 
to be required to proceed publicly it would likely further exacerbate her dangerous psychiatric 
condition. 
The Second Circuit has articulated a multi factor test when deciding whether to permit a 
Jane Doe to proceed with a lawsuit anonymously.  As discussed below, nearly all of the factors 
weigh in favor of permitting Jane Doe to proceed with her lawsuit anonymously.   
Most of Epstein’s other victims have proceeded in court anonymously. Further, Jane Doe 
has rejected countless media requests for interviews and TV specials because of her desire and 
need to proceed anonymously.     
The granting of this motion provides Jane Doe the protection she needs while at the same 
time resulting in no disadvantage or prejudice to Defendants.  Jane Doe’s mental health and 
physical safety requires this protection. At the same time, Defendants retain their right and 
ability to fully and fairly defend against these claims. 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 31     Filed 07/30/21     Page 4 of 10

BACKGROUND FACTS 
    The filed pleading avoids too much detail in order to protect Jane Doe’s identity which  
otherwise could be inferred from a detailed publicly filed presentation.   
The basic narrative, however, is that Jane Doe was sex trafficked by Mr. Epstein for more 
than a decade during which time she was nearly always required to be sexually available to Mr. 
Epstein wherever he might be located. The sexual abuse included at times violence and very 
often occurred in the middle of the evening with Mr. Epstein crawling into Jane Doe’s bed and 
sexually abusing her.  
Abbie Tuller’s affidavit makes clear that Jane Doe’s current psychiatric condition is 
severely debilitating and further opines that requiring her to proceed publicly would likely do 
grievous psychological harm. [See Abbie Tuller’s Affidavit attached as Exhibit “B” to 
Declaration of Daniel J. Kaiser [“Kaiser Affirm.”]   
For reasons that if elaborated upon here may itself reveal her identity, there are some who 
would seek to disparage and perhaps threaten Jane Doe if she were to proceed publicly. These 
facts, if necessary, can be provided in confidence to the Court. 
The facts of abuse included in the currently filed complaint are as follows: 
Jeffrey Epstein specifically targeted underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or 
economically disadvantaged young females exactly like Plaintiff to sexually molest and 
abuse. [Complaint ¶ 19 attached as Exhibit “A” to Kaiser Affirm.] 
Epstein's continuous psychological and physical control over Jane Doe facilitated his 
sexual abuse of her on a relatively consistent basis for many years. [Id. ¶ 20] 
The sexual abuse took many forms including Epstein's violent rape of Plaintiff. [Id. ¶ 
21] 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 31     Filed 07/30/21     Page 5 of 10

He would also enter plaintiff's room and get into her bed while she was sleeping and 
then fondle or penetrate her with his fingers. This occurred often and repeatedly. [Id. ¶ 22] 
He often directed her to undress and pose in certain ways and/or touch him and herself 
while he masturbated. This occurred often and repeatedly. [Id. ¶ 23] 
Epstein frequently directed Jane Doe to turn her head back during their sexual 
encounters, telling her that he did not want to see her face. [Id. ¶ 24] 
Epstein also repeatedly required Jane Doe to bathe with him and perform oral sex on 
him. [Id. ¶ 25] 
This occurred in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico, London, Paris, on Epstein's 
private island, on Epstein's airplanes and other locations. [Id. ¶ 26] 
Jane Doe was paid in large part to be sexually available to Epstein. [Id. ¶ 27] 
In or about January or February 2012, Epstein grabbed Plaintiff by the hand while at his 
New York City Residence and took her to a small room on the third floor. It was a room with 
two chairs in it. He sat her down, pulled her pants down, covered her eyes, and used a vibrator 
on her. Epstein laughed afterwards. [Id. ¶ 28] 
ARGUMENT 
THE MULTI FACTOR SECOND CIRCUIT TEST FOR PROCEEDING 
ANONYMOUSLY SUPPORTS JANE DOE’S RIGHT TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY 
In articulating its test for proceeding anonymously, the Second Circuit in Sealed Plaintiff 
v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185 (2nd Cir. 2008) noted: 
Accordingly, we endorse the Ninth Circuit’s formulation and hold 
that when determining whether a plaintiff may be allowed to 
maintain an action under a pseudonym, the plaintiff’s interest in 
anonymity must be balanced against both the public interest in 
disclosure and any prejudice to the defendant. 
 *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 31     Filed 07/30/21     Page 6 of 10

This balancing of interests entails the consideration of several 
factors that have been identified by our sister Circuits and the 
district courts in the Circuit. We note with approval the following 
factors……  
Id. at 189; Jane Doe v. Kolko, 242 FRD 193 (EDNY 2006) (court held Second Circuit test 
supported Plaintiff’s right to proceed anonymously); John Doe v. Colgate University, 2016 WL 
1448829 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (court held that plaintiff would be permitted to proceed anonymously 
noting in particular that Defendant would suffer not prejudice)   
The Sealed Plaintiff factors are discussed below.  
A.  The litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and  
       personal in nature 
Here, the allegations could not be more sensitive or more of a personal nature. Jane Doe 
has been psychiatrically ravaged by Epstein’s abuse.  Very often, sexual assault victims do not 
come forward or in any manner or respect reveal themselves because sexual assault cases are so 
highly sensitive. Here, heap on top of that that the abuser was the notorious Jeffrey Epstein and 
revealing yourself as a victim becomes extraordinarily difficult.       
B.   Whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical  
         or mental harm to the party seeking to proceed anonymously 
               As noted, there are many others involved in the Epstein story in various roles, who 
knowing nearly nothing of Jane Doe’s story have disparaged and insulted her premised upon 
false facts and a lack of any understanding of Jane Doe’s own sexual abuse.  She has also 
received death threats in the past, which have stopped her from coming forward with details of 
her abuse publicly.      
A requirement that Jane Doe proceed publicly would unnecessarily expose her to not 
only potentially life threatening physical abuse from this group of persons, but the psychological 
consequences for Jane could be profound.   
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 31     Filed 07/30/21     Page 7 of 10

C. Whether the identification process poses other harms 
Jane Doe would likely be damaged psychologically even if not from the direct result of 
retaliation. Her therapist’s affidavit is clear on that point.  
D. Whether the Plaintiff is particularly vulnerable to the harms 
       resulting from disclosure 
She certainly is. Her current psychological state is precarious and any small additional 
stress could result in catastrophic consequences.  She also has no way to physically protect 
herself should anyone try to follow through with their death threats. 
E. Whether the suit is challenging the actions of the government 
       or private parties 
This is the only factor that weighs in slightly favor of proceeding publicly.  
F. Whether the defendant would be prejudiced by permitting 
      Plaintiff to proceed anonymously 
Defendants would suffer no prejudice. Defendants know Jane Doe’s identity and will 
have the ability to obtain any and all discovery to which they are entitled. Defendants’ ability to 
defend this action is not compromised in any respect.  In numerous other lawsuits against Epstein 
by sexual assault and trafficking victims, as well as other sex trafficking cases, they proceeded 
anonymously without any difficulty.  See, Doe v. Epstein, 2008 WL 11332056 (S.D.Fl. 2008) 
(court held Jane Doe could proceed anonymously); Doe v. Steele, 2020 WL 6712214 (S.D.Cal) 
(court held that sex trafficking victim would be permitted to proceed anonymously); A.B. v. 
Hilton Worldwide Holdings, 484 F.Supp.3d 921 (D.Oregon 2020) ( court held that sex 
trafficking victim would be permitted to procced anonymously); S.Y. v. Uomini & Kudai, LLC, 
2021 WL 3054871 (M.D.Fl. 2021) (court held that sex trafficking victim would be permitted to 
proceed anonymously). 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 31     Filed 07/30/21     Page 8 of 10

G. Whether plaintiff’s identity has thus far been kept confidential 
Jane Doe has remained confidential from the beginning of this litigation which  
underscores her desire and need for continued confidentiality. Also, Jane Doe has fielded 
through countless requests for interviews from media outlets and has turned all of them down 
consistent with her desire to remain anonymous.    
H. Whether the public’s interest is furthered by requiring disclosure of  
       Plaintiff’s identity 
There is no public interest that is advanced through public disclosure.  The Epstein story 
is well known and has been extensively covered in the media.   Generally, Epstein victims have 
been permitted to proceed anonymously undercutting any argument that the public’s interest is 
compromised.     
I. The public’s interest in knowing the plaintiff’s identity based purely  
       on the legal nature of the issues presented 
No legal issues present that elevate the public’s interest in disclosure. This matter is a 
straightforward sex trafficking case the facts of which do not present novel legal issues for 
resolution by this Court.    
The central factual dispute as to whether Mr. Epstein sexually abused Jane Doe,  
including raping her, and whether she was trafficked in connection with that abuse are resolved 
without and novel and/or first impression legal rulings.   
J. Whether there are any alternative mechanism for protecting the plaintiff’s  
Identity 
There are no alternatives to permitting Jane Doe to proceed anonymously that can  
protect Jane Doe. 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 31     Filed 07/30/21     Page 9 of 10

     CONCLUSION 
For all of the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that her motion to be 
permitted to proceed anonymously be granted.

Re: 
Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as 
the Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF 
Dear Judge Freeman: 
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors 
of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. 
We write pursuant to Your Honor’s Individual Practices § (III)(B) to request approval to 
file the Co-Executors’ Statement on Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed Anonymously 
(“Statement”) with redactions to ensure Plaintiff’s identity is not made public pending the 
Court’s determination of her Application (ECF No. 29) (the “Application”). The unredacted 
and redacted versions of the Statement and accompanying Declaration of Bennet J. 
Moskowitz1 are being filed under seal and publicly, respectively, contemporaneously 
herewith in accordance with Individual Practices § (III)(B).  
As a matter of context, on March 17, 2020, Plaintiff filed her complaint under the 
pseudonym “Jane Doe.” (ECF No. 1.) On July 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed the Application, 
requesting approval to prosecute this lawsuit pseudonymously. The Co-Executors have 
never sought to prevent any alleged victim of Mr. Epstein from proceeding under a 
pseudonym—and they do not do so here. However, in this unique situation, the Co-
Executors have determined that it is appropriate to bring to the Court’s attention material 
facts not contained in Plaintiff’s Application so that the Court may rule on it with the benefit 
of all relevant information and case law.  
The exhibits to the Declaration are filed entirely under seal.

Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”)1, respectfully submit this Statement On Plaintiff Jane Doe’s 
(“Plaintiff”) Application to Proceed Anonymously (ECF No. 31) (the “Application”). 
I.
The Co-Executors Have Never Opposed The Right Of Alleged Victims To Maintain 
Anonymity And Do Not Do So Here. 
The Co-Executors have never sought to prevent any alleged victim of Mr. Epstein from 
proceeding anonymously; they do not do so here. To the contrary, after Mr. Epstein’s death, the 
Co-Executors established and funded in its entirety the independently administered Epstein 
Victims’ Compensation Program, which gave Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims the opportunity to 
resolve their claims in complete confidence if they so desired.2 The Program ultimately awarded 
nearly $125 million to approximately 150 eligible claimants.3
Nevertheless, in this unique situation, the Co-Executors have determined that it is 
appropriate to bring to the Court’s attention material facts not contained in Plaintiff’s Application, 
so that the Court can rule on it with the benefit of all relevant information, as follows: (1) Plaintiff 
 (2) Plaintiff has, 
 and (3) Plaintiff has 
The captions in Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion to Proceed Anonymously (ECF No. 29), Memorandum of Law in 
Support of Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed Anonymously (ECF No. 31), and the Declaration of Daniel J. Kaiser 
(ECF No. 30) list more than two dozen defendants who are not parties to this action. Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF No. 
1), which has not been amended, was brought only against Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities 
as executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. Accordingly, this Statement is filed on behalf of the Co-Executors 
only. 
No claimant who participated in the Program is bound by any rules of confidentiality—to the contrary, they are free 
to tell their stories publicly.

herewith, provides true and correct copies of all

As Plaintiff explains in her Application, when determining whether to permit a party to 
proceed under a pseudonym, the Second Circuit considers at least ten non-exhaustive factors 
pursuant to Sealed Plaintiff. Doe v. Zinsou, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131520, at *7-8 (S.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 6, 2019) (Ramos, J.) (citing Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 188-89 (2d

questioned.’” (citing Island Software & Computer Serv., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 413 F.3d 257, 261 (2d Cir. 2005)

PROCEEDINGS 
HONORABLE DEBRA C. FREEMAN (THE COURT):   This is 
Judge Freeman.  This should be Jane Doe versus Indyke et 
al.  It is 20-civ-2365, a case before Judge Liman and 
myself. 
Could I have your appearances, please, for the 
record, starting on plaintiff's side? 
MR. DANIEL J. KAISER:  Daniel Kaiser of Kaiser 
Saurborn & Mair, your Honor, representing Jane Doe. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  And on defendants' side? 
MR. BENNET MOSKOWITZ:  Good morning, your Honor. 
Bennet Moskowitz, Troutman Pepper, representing the co-
executors.  And I just discovered there was a kind of a 
clerical error with the Proposed Scheduling Order filed last 
week.  So I just wanted to put a note down that, when your 
Honor pleases, I'd like to just note that for the record so we 
can correct it. 
 THE COURT:  That's fine.  Is there anyone else 
currently on this call?  Do I have my clerk on?  Donna, are 
you there? 
THE CLERK:  I'm here, Judge. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Is there anyone else on the 
line? 
THE DEPUTY CLERK:  It's Aisha.  I'm on, too. 
THE COURT:  Oh, my deputy's on, as well. 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 3 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
MR. JAMES HILL:  Good morning, your Honor.  This is 
James Hill; I'm the reporter with ABC News, in listen-only 
mode. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  Anyone else on the line? 
MALE:  A reporter from the New York Post. 
THE COURT:  I'm sorry, say it again, please?   
MALE:  A reporter from the New York Post on 
listen-only mode. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  I have a few things 
in front of me.  First of all, I have the need to set a 
Scheduling Order.  I also have a motion for plaintiff for 
leave to proceed anonymously.  I also have a pro hac vice 
application.  That pro hac application I have granted; it 
just probably has not hit the docket yet.  But that one is 
resolved.  I've also granted the motion to seal some papers 
that were submitted in connection with the motion to 
proceed anonymously.  So that's also newly hitting the 
docket, my granting of that application. 
With respect to a Scheduling Order, I'm wondering, 
rather than to have a Scheduling Order that has everything 
just based on a certain number of days after there is an 
answer, waiting to see if there is an answer or if there is 
a motion, if there is an answer, then I would propose to 
set a schedule that has actual firm dates in it for things 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 4 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
so that we don't have this wait with the date that is 100 
days after this or 120 days after that or whatever.  If 
there is as motion, I think we ought to have a discussion 
about whether discovery should proceed in light of the 
motion and if so, to what extent.  There is not automatic 
stay of discovery when a motion to dismiss is filed.  But 
there can at times -- it can at times make sense to stay 
discovery in whole or in part.  The default is that 
discovery would go forward, but I think it would be worth 
taking a look at any schedule in light of any motion that's 
pending, to see what the basis of the motion is and to see 
what sort of discovery would make sense. 
So I'm thinking of potentially -- well, actually, 
I think what I'd like to do is find out from defendants, do 
you intend to file a motion? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We do, your Honor.  Essentially, 
there are statute of limitations issues, number one; and, 
number two, there's a request for punitive damages, which 
your Honor likely recalls that that's an issue that's been 
ruled on in several cases already.  So those are at least 
the two grounds that I'm currently aware of that we plan to 
move on. 
THE COURT:  Have the rulings on the punitive 
damages point been consistent? 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 5 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  They have, your Honor.  And to put 
a finer point on it, it's somewhat different here due to 
the fact that the plaintiff, as far as I'm aware, is 
couching the claim solely as Trafficking Victim Protection 
Act claims.  However, there was a ruling in at least one 
prior case on that.  But punitive damages generally, yes, 
have been repeatedly dismissed on motions to dismiss 
insofar as they've been asserted against the Epstein 
estate. 
THE COURT:  And assuming you file this motion, 
would you be looking for any stay of discovery in whole or 
in part? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Well, your Honor, our position is 
not that we would necessarily file a formal motion to stay; 
but consistent with prior positions, what I would say is 
this, which is that it would be a shame for discovery to go 
forward at full speed and potentially spin out of control 
if -- and I don't know this yet and this is something that 
is up to plaintiff to tell us whenever they please -- or 
not -- but if there's any prospect of discussing 
exploration of a resolution outside of litigation -- and I 
guess what I'd say to that, your Honor, since we haven't 
spoken a bit of a while for -- based on our track record, 
is, you know, as a general matter, the estate is in favor 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 6 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
of alternative dispute resolutions and settlements.  And, 
of course, that's why we had the very successful Epstein 
Victims' Compensation Program.  And as the Court may be 
aware, the program's independent administrator recently 
actually announced that the program has essentially 
finished the front-end stage and is proceeding to wind 
down.  It's awarded nearly 125 million to approximately 150 
eligible claimants.  And that was roughly one year after it 
launched.  You may recall that was back in June of 2020.  
Ninety-two percent of eligible claimants accepted their 
offers, and at the time of the announcement the program had 
already paid out over 121 million to those claimants.   
I can't go into on the estate side who or why 
certain resolutions did not happen via the program; 
however, again we are open as a general principle to 
exploring with any claimants who wish to do so whether 
there's a potential for resolution outside of litigation.  
And that's true in this case as with any of the others that 
remain. 
MR. KAISER:  If I may, your Honor?  
THE COURT:  Sure.  Who's this, please? 
MR. KAISER:  Dan Kaiser.  Just on those points -- 
I don't want to get into a lot of detail -- but the 
victims' compensation fund was not successful, which 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 7 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
[indiscernible] like, you know, it's not necessarily 
relevant, although I had explicit discussions with the 
administrator, and she was very explicit with me on the 
phone how politics, you know, restrained her and entered 
into what she did or didn't do with my client.  So -- and I 
don't want to get into the details about that, but she was 
very, very openly acknowledged of that.  And we're very 
happy to have settlement discussions.  We've never 
disguised that.  We've been open to it.  If the other side 
wants to, for example, engage a mediator to see whether it 
can be resolved, then we're happy to explore that.  And if 
they're saying that the continuance at this point of 
discovery would interfere with that process, I'm happy to 
preliminarily have discussions about resolution to see if 
it could happen without the need for discovery.  I won't 
get into the statute of limitations issues -- I'm not sure 
what the merits of that are, but we'll deal with them at 
another time.  But, again, your Honor, I'm happy to have 
those discussions; and if they're going to be had, 
particularly in this case and the context and posture of 
it, it should happen sooner rather than later. 
THE COURT:  Sure.  Just a quick question about the 
statute of limitations issues, if that defense is 
successful, would it resolve the entire case or only part 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 8 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
of the case? 
MR. KAISER:  Well, I don't -- 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  I believe -- 
THE COURT:  Mr. Moskowitz? 
MR. KAISER:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  No apologies.  I didn't know if 
that question was more for me, your Honor -- 
THE COURT:  This is Mr. Moskowitz? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yeah.  I believe it's partial.  I 
don't believe it's a total dismissal. 
THE COURT:  All right.  So based on what I have 
heard, my view is that, assuming the motion is made -- and 
I accept that it likely will be -- that discovery should 
still go forward, but it should go forward in part because 
the case would not be fully resolved, anyway, even if the 
motion were granted.  And so there's no reason to let 
discovery be stalled.  But because of the parties' 
expressed interest on both sides in pursuing settlement and 
possibly because of the motion, discovery should be 
scheduled with an eye toward what is practical.  So perhaps 
there should be some time built in on the front end where 
you can talk settlement; or perhaps it should be structured 
so that certain things are done first that you know you 
would likely have to do anyway but are not the most 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 9 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
burdensome things and some other things that you might have 
to do down the road that perhaps are more burdensome, we 
have it on a schedule, you know when you're going to do it 
if you have to, but perhaps you kick it a little bit 
further down so that you don't spend unnecessary time, 
money and effort on discovery that may not be needed.   
With respect to settlement, you have a number of 
options.  One option is that you talk between you without 
the aid of a third-party mediator or other dispute-
resolution professional.  You just talk between counsel as 
counsel and you see what you can do to try to negotiate a 
resolution.  I have great confidence in lawyers' skills in 
advancing the ball in settlement.  Here there were some 
unusual circumstances where this program was set up and 
obviously a lot of claims were put there instead of put 
before counsel to try to work something out.  But at this 
stage of the game it seems to me the first thing you should 
do is have good-faith conversations between you and see 
where you are. 
If that is not successful, you have a number of 
options with respect to mediation.  You could go to the 
court's mediation program -- and I'm happy to send you 
there.  You can come before me, and I'm happy to host you.  
Or you could retain a private mediator of your choice 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 10 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
through whatever organizational or whatever individual 
you're both comfortable with.  And I'm happy to have you do 
that, as well, if that's something you should talk about.  
But I do think that, if you're going to talk, the time to 
talk is in fact sooner rather than later because I don't 
want to see discovery stalled longer than necessary if the 
case is not going to be resolved.  So if you build in some 
time at the front end of the discovery schedule to talk 
settlement, that means you should be talking settlement. 
So I'm going to send you back to talk between 
counsel about how you want to proceed with this.  I will 
tell you that, if I have a conference before me on 
settlement, I will require counsel to tell me that they've 
tried as hard as they can on their own and they really do 
need help, you know, that you're at impasse, you can't 
think of anything else to do, you know, all the skills that 
you have in settlement have been exhausted and you just 
have no other idea how to proceed other than to ask for 
outside help.  And then I am happy to try to help you break 
through whatever log jam you've got.  I think even if 
that's not a requirement for the mediation program or for 
an outside mediator, it doesn't hurt to try on your own 
first and get as far as you can and see whether you really 
need the help or if so, to figure out exactly what the gap 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 11 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
between the parties' positions is and just how much work 
has to be done to get there. 
So what I'm thinking is this.  Let me send you 
back to the well.  Propose a discovery plan that, A, has in 
mind that a motion is coming and that the parties are 
interested in talking settlement; and, B, has firm dates in 
it instead of 30 days after this and 20 days after that and 
so on.  I will tell you what I would generally put in a 
scheduling order, and you can modify it as you think would 
be appropriate.  And if I think it's reasonable, I'll 
approve it.  I would want a date for initial disclosures.  
Usually that comes pretty quickly.  Usually it's within a 
couple of weeks after I issue my Scheduling Order.   
Then once you get the information on the initial 
disclosures, assuming there's information that still hasn't 
already been informally exchanged, I'd want a date for 
service of initial document requests and interrogatories, 
just to make sure that ball is rolling.  I will let you go 
outside Local Rule 33.3A, go straight to B with respect to 
the kinds of interrogatories you serve, to save some time 
because A is a lot like the initial disclosures under 26A, 
and it seems to me that it doesn't make sense to object 
just because interrogatories go outside that rule when you 
can just serve a second set and be there anyway.  I'm not 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 12 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
talking about contention interrogatories.  Save those for 
further down the pike.  I'm not talking about 
interrogatories that are abusive or call for long, 
narrative responses.  Use your judgment, please. 
With respect to motions to amend or for joinder, 
as soon as you reasonably have the idea as to whether 
you've got the right claims and the right parties, let's 
get that closed down so that something doesn't happen late 
in the case that throws a monkey wrench into everything.  
I'm looking for a deadline, a proposed deadline for motions 
to amend or joinder.  If there's not going to be an 
objection by your adversary, I'm not going to require the 
motion.  So you've got to back up whatever deadline it is 
in your head, think about drafting a proposed amended 
pleading, sending it to your adversary saying would you 
oppose this if I were to move to amend.  It doesn't have to 
be consent; it just has to be I wouldn't object to it, I 
wouldn't oppose it.  If there's not going to be an 
opposition, let me know, and I'll just accept the amended 
pleading for filing.  If there is going to be an objection, 
I want a deadline in the Scheduling Order for motions to 
amend or for joinder.  If you miss that deadline that's in 
the Order, be aware it is an important deadline because if 
you miss it, you're going to be in Rule 16 land with having 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 13 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
to show good cause why you couldn't meet a date in a 
Scheduling Order, and that liberal amendment standard of 
Rule 15 can go out the window if you can't show good cause 
for missing the deadline.  So give me a deadline for 
motions to amend or joinder.  If you think there might 
really be an amendment and you're worried about the 
deadline, put your hand in the air and ask to have it 
extended before that date comes.  Don't find yourself with 
a problem under Rule 16.  Obviously, if something comes up 
late in the game that was honestly something that couldn't 
have been anticipated, you'll have good cause for a late 
motion to amend; but, you know, don't risk it if you can 
possibly avoid that. 
And then a deadline for the close of fact 
discovery, I'm going to try not to micromanage you other 
than getting that ball rolling on document requests and 
interrogatories.  I'm not going to require you to set firm 
dates for depositions or the like unless you start running 
into problems and there's no other way to do it than to 
have court-ordered dates.  I don't anticipate that. 
With respect to any experts, generally what I 
would do is I would say if you've got the affirmative 
burden of proof on an issue, get your expert reports out 
within 30 days of the close of fact discovery, rebuttal 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 14 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
reports 30 days after that, and then you'll have a small 
window for expert depositions.  If there's something 
unusual going on here, if you think that schedule does not 
work, talk about it.  But that's what I would ordinarily 
do. 
And that's all I've got on that.  Does that sound 
reasonable for you to go back and talk and see what you can 
come up with? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Bennet Moskowitz.  Yes, your 
Honor.  And if I could, before we close as far as 
discussion, I did want to address that clerical issue 
because, notwithstanding that we're not going to -- the 
Court's not going to enter the proposal that was already 
submitted, I do want to correct it for the docket. 
THE COURT:  Sure.  I have it in front of me.  What 
was it? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Yes.  It has the wrong signature 
page.  It looks like a signature page from another action 
against the estate. 
THE COURT:  Oh, dear. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Apologies if that was on our end.  
I'm not even certain yet.  We certainly filed the -- 
THE COURT:  That's what happens when there are too 
many cases.  All right, no problem.

PROCEEDINGS 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  We tried to reduce the number.  So 
I would like to -- I don't know if the Court can remove 
that from the docket or -- I just don't want to have it 
hanging there.  You know, obviously, the other attorney 
from the other case shouldn't be reflected on this docket. 
THE COURT:  We can figure out something.  If you 
want to just send a -- put a letter on the docket saying 
that it's withdrawn.  I mean, it won't disappear from the 
docket.  I mean, it's not something that would ordinarily 
get sealed.  But you can write a letter and just indicate 
that there's an error if you want to have the docket 
reflect that. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure.   
THE COURT:  Right?  I mean, for anyone on the call 
who's listening in on mute who's a member of the press, 
there's as document on the docket that has the wrong 
signature page.  So please ignore it.   
Anyway, just put some letter on the docket about 
it, and I'll deal with it when I get that letter from you. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Understood.  Thank you, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  That -- 
MR. KAISER:  Your Honor --  
THE COURT:  Yes. 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 16 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
MR. KAISER:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  It's Dan 
Kaiser.  Just one point of clarification.  To the motion to 
proceed anonymously still needs to be ruled upon, correct? 
THE COURT:  Yes.  Yes.  I was just going to turn 
to that. 
MR. KAISER:  Okay.  Yes.  Okay. 
THE COURT:  Anything else about scheduling? 
By the way, you have some other things in the 
Proposed Scheduling Order like a date to provide HIPAA 
releases.  That's fine.  If you want to add some things in 
there that you think are worth having in there that you 
want to have, you know, the power of the court behind to 
make sure things happen by a certain date, you can.  Those 
things that I outlined for you are the things that I 
require to be in a Scheduling Order, initial disclosures, 
date to serve initial document requests and 
interrogatories, deadline for amendment of pleadings and 
joinder, deadline for fact discovery, and then the schedule 
for expert discovery.  If there's something else in there 
that you think would be helpful, you know, you can add it 
in there by agreement.   
And also, you can stipulate to modify an interim 
dates in my Scheduling Order that you want if it all wraps 
up at the same point in time.  I want to see it end the 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 17 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
same way.  If you agree that fact discovery can slide into 
the period for expert discovery and you're in agreement it 
can get done, it's okay.  If you agree that you can move 
some other date in there because you're talking settlement 
but you're still looking at the same end date, you don't 
need leave of Court to do that; you can just stipulate to 
that.  If it's the amendment deadline, let me know that 
you're stipulating so that we don't have any confusion 
there about what rule you're under if there's a motion that 
comes in late.  Okay? 
All right -- 
MR. KAISER:  Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  -- with respect to the motion to 
proceed anonymously, I've looked at the motion, I've looked 
at what was put on the docket for the Court's view in 
unredacted form, I've looked at the reply.  My inclination 
at this point is to grant the motion to proceed 
anonymously.  It may be revisited at a later date, but I 
think at this juncture that is the better course, and so 
I'm going to allow this case, like the other cases in the 
court, to proceed with plaintiff as Jane Doe.  So I'm going 
to grant that. 
Is there anything else?   
You know what, let me give you one other thing to 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 18 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
do, which is after -- I'm sorry, which is to put in the 
Proposed Scheduling Order a date by which you'll send me a 
joint status report on how things are going, both with 
respect to the status of discovery and the status of your 
settlement talks.  Just figure out what would be a logical 
point in time to report back to me, and put in the date so 
that I don't lose track of the case. 
With respect to a status report on the settlement, 
this is going to be a publicly filed document, so I really 
don't want you to put your confidential settlement 
discussions in the letter -- that's not the purpose of it, 
and I don't really think that belongs on the public docket.  
So what I mean by a status letter on settlement is the 
following.  I've taken to saying this a lot in cases these 
days when I ask for status reports on settlement.  From 
best to worst, the best kind of status letter you can put 
on the docket to the worst kind of status letter you can 
put on the docket, the best is, "We have a resolution in 
principle, Judge."  That's obviously great.  Next best is, 
"We are talking seriously. Because of that -- and we think 
we're optimistic -- we'd like a little bit more time to get 
back to you.  We think maybe we need a little bit of 
discovery; but, you know, we think this is going well."  
And then propose how you want to proceed from there.  "We'd 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 19 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
like some further extensions on deadlines in light of 
this," or, "We'd like another status report letter date," 
or something.  Next is, "We've been talking seriously, and 
we're having difficulty.  We really would like to try the 
assistance of a mediator, you or the mediation program or 
outside mediator," or whatever it is you want to propose; 
you let me know.  Next is, "We've been talking seriously.  
We're not getting anywhere.  We don't think we're going to 
get anywhere.  We think this case has to be litigated.  We 
think there's absolutely no hope."  If I see a letter like 
that, I'll probably have another call with you and say, 
"Are you sure there's nothing that can help you, because I 
know both sides are interested."  And I'm usually more 
optimistic than the parties when I get a letter like that.  
The worst letter you can put on the docket is, "Even though 
I know you're interested in settlement, we've done nothing 
on this front.  We haven't been talking.  We haven't 
advanced the ball at all since the last time we had a 
conference two months ago.  It's been completely stagnant 
on that front."  If you're interested in settlement, pursue 
it; try to make progress and give me an actual progress 
report.  Okay? 
MR. KAISER:  Yes, your Honor. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Understood. 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF     Document 45     Filed 09/03/21     Page 20 of 22

PROCEEDINGS 
THE COURT:  Anything else for today? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Thank you, your Honor. 
MR. KAISER:  Nothing for plaintiffs.  Nothing from 
plaintiffs, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  So get me a modified proposed 
schedule.  I'll let you get the motion filed and take a 
look at that motion.  It's supposed to come in, what, 
September 7 -- was that the day?  What was the date I gave 
you for a motion?  I don't remember.  Sixth, I think it 
was -- 
MR. KAISER:  Correct, September 6. 
THE COURT:  September 6.  So how about you get me 
a Proposed Scheduling Order in light of that motion by 
September 10? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ:  Sure. 
MR. KAISER:  That works, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Okay.  All right, I'll look for 
something on the docket by then. 
Thank you, all.

Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey 
E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), respectfully submit this Memorandum of Law in support of their 
Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Jane Doe’s (“Plaintiff”) Complaint (ECF No. 1) pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Plaintiff brings a single count against the Co-Executors for Jeffrey Epstein’s (“Epstein”) 
alleged violations of Sections 1591, 1593A, 1594(a), and 1594(b) of the Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, et seq. (“TVPA”). (Compl. ¶¶ 33, 36.) The Court must dismiss 
that claim for two separate reasons. 
First, Plaintiff’s claim must be dismissed because she fails to plead its essential elements. 
Plaintiff does not sufficiently allege Epstein’s knowledge or how Doe was coerced under § 1591, 
a financial benefit under § 1593A, or an agreement or meeting of the minds under § 1594(b). And 
because she fails to adequately state a claim under § 1591, her claim for attempt under § 1594(a) 
necessarily fails as well. 
Second, as the Court (Hon. Edgardo Ramos) found in another lawsuit against the Co-
Executors, because the TVPA provides for a ten-year statute of limitations period for adult victims, 
any claim based on conduct occurring more than ten years before filing of the complaint must be 
dismissed with prejudice as untimely. Lisa Doe v. Indyke, 465 F. Supp. 3d 452, 462 (S.D.N.Y. 
2020). Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff’s claim is based on alleged conduct occurring before 
March 17, 2010, the Court must dismiss it as time-barred. 
Separately, and also consistent with Judge Ramos’s decision in Lisa Doe, the Court must 
dismiss Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages because “punitive damages under the TVPA are 
not available after a defendant has died.” Id. at 471 (dismissing with prejudice plaintiff’s claim for 
punitive damages under the TVPA).

119125600
STATEMENT OF ALLEGED FACTS 
Plaintiff’s allegations, which are assumed to be true solely for purposes of this Motion, are 
insufficient to put the Co-Executors on notice of what she alleges happened to her that constituted 
TVPA violations. Except for a single paragraph concerning one occurrence in 2012—which 
allegation has no alleged nexus to any coercion or commercial sex acts—Plaintiff does not 
articulate (beyond mere conclusions and vague allegations) what specifically happened to her, 
what Epstein knew and when, or when the abuse ended. Instead, Plaintiff merely asserts labels and 
conclusions in an apparent attempt to check off the elements of the asserted TVPA violations.   
Plaintiff vaguely alleges she was a 22-year-old adult when Epstein began abusing her 
“nearly 19 years [ago].” (Compl. ¶¶ 2-3.) She further alleges she was “paid in part to be sexually 
available to Epstein” (id. ¶ 27), and that he sexually abused and exerted “continuous psychological 
and physical control” over her “on a relatively consistent basis for many years” (id. ¶ 20). She 
alleges this abuse occurred in New York, Florida, New Mexico, the U.K., France, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, as well as on private jets. (Id. ¶ 26.)  
In sum, Plaintiff asserts a single, jumbled cause of action for alleged violations of Sections 
1591, 1594(a), 1594(b), and 1594A of the TVPA. She also requests general damages, attorneys’ 
fees, and punitive damages. (Id. ¶¶ 29-37.) 
LEGAL STANDARDS 
“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, 
accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 
662, 678 (2009). While the Court must normally accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations 
in a complaint and draw all inferences in a plaintiff’s favor, those principles are “inapplicable to 
legal conclusions.” Id. at 678 (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 556 (2007)).

119125600
Thus, a pleading that offers only “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements 
of a cause of action” will not do. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. 
ARGUMENT 
I.
Plaintiff’s TVPA Claim Is Insufficiently Pleaded And Must Be Dismissed 
a. Plaintiff’s Section 1591 claim fails to sufficiently allege knowledge, means of 
force, threats of force, fraud or coercion; and, accordingly, her Section 1594(a) 
claim for attempt to violate Section 1591 also fails.
Plaintiff fails to allege necessary elements of a TVPA § 1591 claim. To plead a TVPA § 
1591 cause of action, Plaintiff is required to allege beyond mere labels and conclusions that 
Epstein: 
knowingly— 
(1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and 
territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, 
obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or 
(2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture 
which has engaged in an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or, except 
where the act constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless 
disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in 
subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be used to cause the person to 
engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and 
will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as provided in 
subsection (b). 
U.S.C. §1591(a). However, Plaintiff has not asserted any allegations of knowledge, force, 
threats of force, fraud or coercion except in purely conclusory fashion. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 29 
(“Defendant, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, in 
interstate and foreign commerce, and/or affecting interstate and foreign commerce, knowingly 
recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, solicited, 
threatened, forced, or coerced Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts.”)). Under Twombly and 
Iqbal, this is insufficient to state a claim. 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF   Document 48   Filed 09/06/21   Page 4 of 11

- 4 - 
119125600
Plaintiff’s sole specific allegation is that, sometime in 2012, Epstein “grabbed [her] by the 
hand” and performed a sex act on her. (Id. ¶ 28.) This allegation does not by itself remedy 
Plaintiff’s otherwise deficient allegations. Plaintiff does not even attempt to articulate how the 
single alleged occurrence in 2012 is related to the asserted TVPA violations—it is just a transparent 
attempt to allege an occurrence within the statute of limitations. 
Accordingly, the Court must dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for violations of TVPA § 1591.  
Plaintiff’s claim under TVPA § 1594(a)—that Epstein attempted to violate § 1591—necessarily 
fails as a result and the Court must dismiss it as well. See, e.g., Stein v. World-Wide Plumbing 
Supply Inc., 71 F. Supp. 3d 320, 330 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (dismissing claim for attempted violation 
of the TVPA against certain defendants because plaintiff failed to adequately plead an underlying 
violation of the TVPA against those defendants). 
b. Plaintiff’s conspiracy claim under Section 1591(b) fails to sufficiently allege 
the necessary element of an agreement.
Plaintiff’s allegations that Epstein was involved in a conspiracy to violate the TVPA 
(Compl. ¶ 32) are insufficient to state a claim because (i) she fails to sufficiently allege the 
necessary element of an agreement, and (ii) her conspiracy allegations consist of nothing more 
than “labels and conclusions.” See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. 
The entirety of Plaintiff’s conspiracy allegations is found in two conclusory paragraphs:  
13.  
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Epstein [“Epstein”] was an extremely 
wealthy financier, who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to 
commit illegal sexual crimes in violation of the TVPRA [sic], and to employ and 
conspire with other corporate entities, private foundations and trusts, to assist him 
in committing those sexual crimes or torts or to facilitate or enable those acts to 
occur. 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF   Document 48   Filed 09/06/21   Page 5 of 11

119125600
32.  
Defendant1 conspired with each member of the enterprise, and with other 
persons known and unknown, to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In so doing, Defendant 
violated U.S.C. § 1594(a).2
Fatal to her claim, Plaintiff does not plead an agreement or meeting of the minds between or among 
Epstein and anyone else. See Chen Gang v. Zhao Zhizhen, 799 F. App’x 16, 19 (2d Cir. 2020) (“To 
maintain a civil conspiracy action, the plaintiff must provide some factual basis supporting a 
meeting of the minds, such that defendants entered into an agreement, express or tacit, to achieve 
the unlawful end.”) (affirming District Court’s dismissal of conspiracy claims for failing to meet 
Twombly standards); Webb v. Goord, 340 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir. 2003) (“The plaintiffs have not 
alleged, except in the most conclusory fashion, that any such meeting of the minds occurred among 
any or all of the defendants. Their conspiracy allegation must therefore fail.”). 
While Plaintiff’s allegation implies the existence of an “enterprise,” she does not describe 
or define the so-called “enterprise,” nor otherwise identify (beyond broad categories) any alleged 
co-conspirators, how they were involved in the conspiracy, how or when they had a meeting of the 
minds, how the conspiracy worked, or how the conspiracy was connected to or harmed Plaintiff. 
Vaguely alleging a conspiracy, without any allegation of an agreement or meeting of the minds, is 
insufficient to articulate the conspiracy on which the alleged Section 1594(b) violations are based. 
Accordingly, the Court must dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for violations of TVPA § 1594(b). 
c.
Plaintiff’s TVPA Section 1593A Claim Contains No Supporting Allegations 
And Must Be Dismissed  
Plaintiff’s claim for violations of TVPA § 1593A must be dismissed because she fails to 
assert any supporting facts. Section 1593A provides for liability for those who “knowingly 
Because Plaintiff names as defendants Messrs. Indyke and Kahn solely in their capacities as Co-Executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, and not in their personal capacities, and because all allegations of sexual abuse allege it 
was committed by Epstein, the Co-Executors presume that “Defendant” refers to Epstein. 
While this paragraph alleges a conspiracy, which, according to Plaintiff, amounted to a violation of “§ 1594(a),” it 
is § 1594(b) that proscribes conspiracies to violate the TVPA, not § 1594(a).

benefit[], financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has 
engaged in any act in violation of [the TVPA].” 18 U.S.C. § 1593A. Plaintiff references Section 
1593A only twice in her Complaint; both times, the section is merely included in a litany of TVPA 
sections allegedly violated by Epstein, as follows: 
33.  
By virtue of Defendant’s violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1593A, and 1594, 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Khan [sic] as Joint Personal 
Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein is subject to civil causes of action 
under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 by Plaintiff, who is a victim of the violations. 
36.  
As direct and proximate result of Defendant’s commission of the 
aforementioned criminal offenses enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1591, 1593A, and 
1594, and the associated civil remedies provide in § 1595, Plaintiff has in the past 
suffered and will continue to suffer injury and pain; emotional distress; 
psychological and psychiatric trauma; mental anguish; humiliation; confusion; 
embarrassment; loss of self-esteem; loss of dignity; loss of enjoyment of life; 
invasion of privacy; and other damages associated with actions. Plaintiff will incur 
further legal, medical and psychological expenses. These injuries are permanent in 
nature and Plaintiff will continue to suffer from them in the future. In addition to 
these losses, Plaintiff has incurred attorneys’ fees and will be required do so in the 
future. 
(Emphasis added.) Plaintiff does not allege that Epstein benefitted financially or received anything 
of value from his participation in a venture that violated the TVPA.3 Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to 
adequately plead a claim under TVPA § 1593A, and the Court must dismiss that claim. 
II.
Plaintiff’s TVPA Claim Is Largely, If Not Entirely, Time-Barred To The Extent It Is 
Based On Conduct Occurring Before March 17, 2010 
Plaintiff’s TVPA claim is at least partially time-barred. The TVPA expressly provides that 
a victim of a TVPA violation may not bring a civil action under the Act later than “10 years after 
This claim also fails because Plaintiff did not adequately plead an underlying violation of § 1591, as explained, 
supra, in Section I(a). See St. Louis v. Perlitz, No. 3:13-CV-1132 (RNC), 2016 WL 1408076, at *3 (D. Conn. Apr. 8, 
2016) (finding a violation against one who “knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from 
participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of [the 
TVPA]” “requires an underlying violation of § 1591 (or another section of the statute), and plaintiffs have failed to 
allege such a violation”).

the cause of action arose,” where the victim was an adult at the time of the violation. 18 U.S.C. § 
1595(c)(1).  
Here, Plaintiff alleges she was an adult when the alleged abuse began. (Compl. ¶ 3.) 
Therefore, and consistent with Lisa Doe, Plaintiff’s claim in her March 17, 2020 Complaint is 
untimely to the extent it is based on alleged conduct that occurred before March 17, 2010. See 18 
U.S.C. § 1595(c)(1); Lisa Doe v. Indyke, 465 F. Supp. 3d 452, 462 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (Ramos, J.) 
(“While the Court disagrees that the conspiracy claims are time-barred, Doe has not presented 
arguments as to why the non-conspiracy claims, such as attempt, referenced in Counts VI to IX 
are not time-barred and the Court dismisses those with prejudice.”) (dismissing with prejudice 
TVPA Section 1591, 1594(a), and 1593A claims as untimely). 
Lisa Doe is directly on point. In that case, another alleged victim of Epstein sued the Co-
Executors for, among other things, TVPA violations. 465 F. Supp. 3d 452. The Co-Executors 
moved to dismiss Lisa Doe’s TVPA claims as untimely to the extent they were based on conduct 
occurring outside the limitations period, i.e., more than ten years before Lisa Doe filed her 
complaint. Id. at 462. Judge Ramos granted the Co-Executors’ motion in part, dismissing all TVPA 
claims except the conspiracy claim,4 to the extent they were based on alleged conduct occurring 
more than ten years before Lisa Doe filed her complaint. Id.
Under Lisa Doe, the Court must dismiss Plaintiff’s non-conspiracy TVPA claim as 
untimely to the extent it is based on conduct that occurred more than ten years before Plaintiff filed 
her Complaint. Because Plaintiff’s only specific allegation of abuse (Compl. ¶ 28) does not 
Judge Ramos found that Lisa Doe’s TVPA conspiracy claims were not time-barred “provided ‘at least one overt act 
in furtherance of the conspiratorial agreement’ occurred within the limitations period.” 465 F. Supp. 3d at 462 (quoting 
United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 F.3d 89, 97 (2d. Cir. 2001)). Judge Ramos found that, as Lisa Doe pleaded an overt act 
within the limitations period, her TVPA conspiracy should not be dismissed on the pleadings. Id. In this action, the 
Co-Executors do not seek to dismiss Plaintiff’s TVPA conspiracy claim as time-barred. (They do move to dismiss 
such claim as inadequately pleaded, as explained above in Section I(b).)

demonstrate a commercial sex act—or any other nexus to the TVPA—Plaintiff has not pleaded 
any alleged conduct violating the TVPA within the limitations period. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s 
claim should be dismissed as untimely in its entirety. However, even if this Court finds that the 
allegation in Paragraph 28 sufficiently pleads a violation of the TVPA, the Court must still dismiss 
the claim to the extent it is based on conduct that occurred before March 17, 2010. 
III.
Plaintiff Is Not Entitled To Punitive Damages As A Matter Of Law  
Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages must be dismissed as a matter of law. As a 
threshold matter, “where punitive damages have been unavailable as a matter of law, courts have 
not hesitated to dismiss prayers for such damages at the threshold.” Mary Doe v. Indyke, 457 F. 
Supp. 3d 278, 283-84 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (Engelmayer, J.) (dismissing punitive damages demand at 
pleadings stage) (citing Murtha v. N.Y. State Gaming Comm’n, No. 17 Civ. 10040 (NSR), 2019 
WL 4450687, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2019) (dismissing plaintiff’s demand for punitive 
damages because statute “does not provide for punitive damages”); Rosen v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., 
No. 18 Civ. 6670 (AT), 2019 WL 4039958, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2019) (granting motion to 
dismiss demand for punitive damages where statute did not permit a plaintiff to recover punitive 
damages); Talarico v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 367 F. Supp. 3d 161, 172 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) 
(dismissing demand for punitive damages against Port Authority where “the Third Circuit and the 
overwhelming majority of district courts within this Circuit have held that punitive damages are 
not available against” that defendant (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Canete v. 
Metro. Transp. Auth., No. 17 Civ. 3961 (PAE), 2018 WL 4538897, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2018) 
(dismissing demand for punitive damages where such relief was “precluded as a matter of law”);  
SJB ex rel. Berkhout v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 03 Civ. 6653 (NRB), 2004 WL 1586500, at *8 
(S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2004) (dismissing punitive damages claim because such damages are 
unavailable in § 1983 actions against municipalities)). 
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL-DCF   Document 48   Filed 09/06/21   Page 9 of 11

119125600
As Judge Ramos held in Lisa Doe, “punitive damages under the TVPA are not available 
after a defendant has died.” 465 F. Supp. 3d at 471 (dismissing with prejudice plaintiff’s claim for 
punitive damages under the TVPA against the Co-Executors). “As a general matter with regards 
to claims brought under federal law, ‘[u]nless a statute directly addresses the issue, courts are 
generally guided by principles of federal common law, which prescribe that claims characterized 
as “penal” abate upon a party’s death, while claims characterized as “remedial” survive.’” Id.
(citing U.S. ex rel. Colucci v. Beth Israel Med. Ctr., 603 F. Supp. 2d 677, 680 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)); 
see also Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Exeter Holdings, Ltd. v. Haltman, 13-cv-5475 
(JS) (AKT), 2017 WL 9485707, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 3, 2017). “Even where a statute is 
characterized as remedial, however, courts have found punitive damages unavailable.” Lisa Doe, 
465 F. Supp. 3d at 471 (citing Estwick v. U.S. Air Shuttle, 950 F. Supp. 493, 498 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) 
(“The punitive damages are plainly penal….”); EEOC v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, No. 97 Civ. 
6484 (LMM), 2000 WL 1024700, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2000)). In fact, even where a federal 
cause of action survives death, punitive damages remain unavailable. See, e.g., Medrano v. MCDR, 
Inc., 366 F. Supp. 2d 625, 635 (W.D. Tenn. 2005) (dismissing deceased plaintiff’s claim for 
punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1981). 
Accordingly, under this Court’s directly applicable precedent analyzing similar same 
claims and issues against the same defendants, punitive damages are unavailable to Plaintiff and 
her demand for those damages must be dismissed. See Lisa Doe, 465 F. Supp. 3d at 471. 
IV.
Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, the Co-Executors respectfully request that the Court grant their 
Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint, together with such other and further relief as the Court 
deems just and proper.

thereafter promptly discontinue this action with prejudice.
