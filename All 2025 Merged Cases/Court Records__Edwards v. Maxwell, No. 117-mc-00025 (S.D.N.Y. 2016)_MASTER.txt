company, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc. (VRS). 
8. 
I maintain my law office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  
9. 
I am a counsel of record for plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre in the case Giuffre v. 
Maxwell, No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y.).  Other counsel of record include: Sigrid S. 
McCawley and Meredith Schulz of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, LLP (Ft. Lauderdale, Florida), 
and Paul G. Cassell (who maintains his law office at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, 
Utah).     
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 2 of 7

10. 
I have received a subpoena to produce numerous documents in the Giuffre v. 
Maxwell case.  I am not a party to that case, but the attorney for the plaintiff, Ms. Giuffre. 
11. 
I was a party to a case styled Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz, 15-000072 
(17th Judicial District, Broward County, Florida).  The production at issue in that case 
spanned several thousand pages of documents.  Production from defendant Dershowitz came 
in several different stages, and various productions involved assertions of privilege.   
Production to defendant Dershowitz of documents and receipt of documents in that case was 
handled by my attorney.  While I have many of the documents that were produced or 
received, I did not maintain a separate file as I was merely a party in the litigation and did not 
keep records of the exact documents produced or received during that litigation.  Id.    
12. 
I am party in the case Epstein v. Edwards et al., Case No. 50-2009 CA 
040800XXXNMBAG (15th Judicial Circuit, West Palm Beach, Florida).  The case has been 
litigated for seven years.  A substantial number of documents are involved in the case.  Many 
of the subjects in the case overlap with subjects in the on-going Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 
v. United States case, as well as the now-closed Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz case.  
Because of this overlap, and because I was merely a party and not the primary attorney 
handling the Epstein v. Edwards case, I have not maintained a separate file for this matter nor 
have I segregated any materials for the Epstein v. Edwards case.  It would be an enormous 
burden and would be impossible to try and identify which discovery materials relate only to 
the Epstein v. Edwards case.   
13. 
Ghislaine Mawell is in a joint defense agreement with Jeffrey Epstein.  See 
Exhibit 5, answers to RFPs 6 and 7.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 3 of 7

14. 
I am a counsel of record in the case of Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 v. United 
States, No. 9:08-cv-80736-MARRA (S.D. Fla.), along with co-counsel Paul G. Cassell.  We 
filed the case in July of 2008 and have been handling the matter ever since on a pro bono 
basis.   
15. 
Over the course of the nearly eight years of litigation in the case, the 
Government has produced correspondence between attorneys for Jeffrey Epstein and itself 
(i.e., the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and other components of 
the Justice Department).  That correspondence has been produced in multiple steps and 
amounts to hundreds of pages (if not thousands of pages) of material.   
16. 
Defendant Maxwell has sought any engagement letters between me and Ms. 
Giuffre in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case, and production has been made.    
17. 
Defendant Maxwell has sought production of Ms. Giuffre’s joint defense 
agreement that pertains to the Giuffre v. Maxwell case.  On May 31, 2016, a copy of the joint 
defense agreement was provided to Ms. Maxwell as Exhibit 5 in support of Ms. Giuffre’s 
Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Non-Privileged Documents. 
18. 
With regard to any work that I have done on behalf of a Florida not-for-profit 
corporation, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc. (VRS), that would have been work as an attorney 
for my client Ms. Giuffre and would, accordingly, be protected by the attorney-client 
privilege, a privilege which is my client’s, not mine.   
19. 
My client, Ms. Giuffre, is a “person associated with Victims Refuse Silence, 
Inc.”   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 4 of 7

20. 
With waiving any privilege, any documents that might exist concerning 
disclosures made to me by Ms. Giuffre or consents provided to me by Ms. Giuffre would 
involve confidential attorney-client communications.   
21. 
I have been working on the CVRA case since July 2008.  That case clearly 
“relates” to Jeffrey Epstein, since the main issue in the case is challenging the legality of a 
non-prosecution agreement entered into by him and the Government without prior notice to 
Epstein’s victims. 
22. 
Between July 2008 and today, I estimate that I have received, at a minimum, 
more than 150,000 emails, and have sent, at a minimum, 60,000 emails.    
23. 
It would be significantly burdensome for me to have to review all of my 
emails to try and identify if I have had any “communications” with (for example) 
“journalists” that “related to” Virginia Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell, or Jeffrey Epstein.  It is 
not possible, on quick examination, to determine who is a journalist and who is not a 
journalist.  Moreover, because the CVRA case has continued for nearly eight years, more 
than 200,000 emails would have to be reviewed in multiple files for the relevant time period.   
I would then have to determine which of the emails were covered by, for example, work-
product protection.  A substantial burden would be involved in attempting to respond to the 
broad request for the subpoena, which would require numerous attorneys and staff to work 
countless hours to attempt to respond, and this too would likely prove to be impossible.  
24. 
Because I am attorney in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case, I have had occasion to 
come into contact with both witnesses and potential witnesses in the case.  For example, I 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 5 of 7

have obviously had contact with my client in the case, Ms. Giuffre.  I have also had contact 
with other “potential witnesses” – since there are many potential witnesses in the case.   
DATED this 13th day of June, 2016.

United States District Court  
Southern District of New York  
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 
Plaintiff,  
CASE NO:_____________________ 
v. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant.  
________________________________/ 
COMPLAINT  
Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP 
575 Lexington Avenue 
New York, NY 10022 
(212) 446-2300 
Case 1:15-cv-07433   Document 1   Filed 09/21/15   Page 1 of 12
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-2     Filed 06/13/16     Page 1 of 12

Plaintiff, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, formerly known as Virginia Roberts 
(“Giuffre”), for her Complaint against Defendant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL (“Maxwell”), avers 
upon personal knowledge as to her own acts and status and otherwise upon information and 
belief: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1. 
This suit arises out of Defendant Maxwell’s defamatory statements against 
Plaintiff Giuffre.  As described below, Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking and abuse while 
she was a minor child. Defendant Maxwell not only facilitated that sexual abuse but, most 
recently, wrongfully subjected Giuffre to public ridicule, contempt and disgrace by, among other 
things, calling Giuffre a liar in published statements with the malicious intent of discrediting and 
further damaging Giuffre worldwide. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
2. 
This is an action for damages in an amount in excess of the minimum 
jurisdictional limits of this Court.  
3. 
This Court has jurisdiction over this dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332 
(diversity jurisdiction) as Giuffre and Maxwell are citizens of different states and the amount in 
controversy exceeds seventy-five thousand ($75,000), exclusive of interest and costs.  
4. 
This Court has personal jurisdiction over Maxwell.  Maxwell resides in New York 
City, and this action arose, and defamatory statements were made, within the Southern District of 
New York.  
5. 
Venue is proper in this Court as the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of 
this Court.

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-2     Filed 06/13/16     Page 2 of 12

PARTIES 
6. 
Plaintiff Giuffre is an individual who is a citizen of the State of Colorado. 
7. 
Defendant Maxwell, who is domiciled in the Southern District of New York, is 
not a citizen of the state of Colorado.  
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
8. 
Virginia Giuffre became a victim of sex trafficking and repeated sexual abuse 
after being recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when Giuffre was under the age 
of eighteen.  
9. 
Between 1999 and 2002, with the assistance and participation of Maxwell, 
Epstein sexually abused Giuffre at numerous locations including his mansions in West Palm 
Beach, Florida, and in this District.  Between 2001 and 2007, with the assistance of numerous 
co-conspirators, Epstein abused more than thirty (30) minor underage girls, a fact confirmed by 
state and federal law enforcement.  
10. 
As part of their sex trafficking efforts, Epstein and Maxwell intimidated Giuffre 
into remaining silent about what had happened to her.   
11. 
In September 2007, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) 
that barred his prosecution for numerous federal sex crimes in the Southern District of Florida. 
12. 
In the NPA, the United States additionally agreed that it would not institute any 
federal criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.   
13. 
As a co-conspirator of Epstein, Maxwell was consequently granted immunity in 
the Southern District of Florida through the NPA.  
14. 
Epstein ultimately pled guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution, and is now a 
registered sex offender.  
Case 1:15-cv-07433   Document 1   Filed 09/21/15   Page 3 of 12
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-2     Filed 06/13/16     Page 3 of 12

15. 
Rather than confer with the victims about the NPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
and Epstein agreed to a “confidentiality” provision in the Agreement barring its disclosure to 
anyone—including Epstein’s victims.  As a consequence, the victims were not told about the 
NPA.  
16. 
On July 7, 2008, a young woman identified as Jane Doe No. 1, one of Jeffrey 
Epstein’s victims (other than Giuffre), filed a petition to enforce her rights under the Crime 
Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. ¶ 3771, alleging that the Government failed to 
provide her the rights promised in the CVRA with regard to the plea arrangement with Epstein. 
The litigation remains ongoing.  
17. 
On or about May 4, 2009, Virginia Giuffre—identified then as Jane Doe No. 
102—filed a complaint against Jeffrey Epstein in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida.  The complaint included allegations made by Giuffre that pertained 
to Maxwell.   
18. 
In pertinent part, the Jane Doe No. 102 complaint described in detail how 
Maxwell recruited Giuffre (who was then a minor girl) to become a victim of sex trafficking by 
introducing Giuffre to Jeffrey Epstein.  With the assistance of Maxwell, Epstein was able to 
sexually abuse Giuffre for years until Giuffre eventually escaped.  
19. 
The Jane Doe No. 102 complaint contained the first public allegations made on 
behalf of Giuffre regarding Maxwell.  
20. 
As civil litigation against Epstein moved forward on behalf of Giuffre and many 
other similarly-situated victims, Maxwell was served with a subpoena for deposition.  Her 
testimony was sought concerning her personal knowledge and role in Epstein’s abuse of Giuffre 
and others.     
Case 1:15-cv-07433   Document 1   Filed 09/21/15   Page 4 of 12
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-2     Filed 06/13/16     Page 4 of 12

21. 
To avoid her deposition, Maxwell claimed that her mother fell deathly ill and that 
consequently she was leaving the United States for London with no plans of ever returning.  In 
fact, however, within weeks of using that excuse to avoid testifying, Maxwell had returned to 
New York.   
22. 
In 2011, two FBI agents located Giuffre in Australia—where she had been hiding 
from Epstein and Maxwell for several years—and arranged to meet with her at the U.S. 
Consulate in Sidney.  Giuffre provided truthful and accurate information to the FBI about 
Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse. 
23. 
Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believed that 
she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had also 
suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse.  
24. 
On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims 
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation. 
25. 
Giuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against 
sexual abuse and human trafficking.  The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to 
help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of 
sexual abuse.  Giuffre has now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex 
trafficking. 
26. 
 On December 30, 2014, Giuffre moved to join the on-going litigation previously 
filed by Jane Doe 1 in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein’s non-prosecution 
agreement by filing her own joinder motion.   
Case 1:15-cv-07433   Document 1   Filed 09/21/15   Page 5 of 12
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-2     Filed 06/13/16     Page 5 of 12

27. 
Giuffre’s motion described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who 
Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and 
participant in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.   
28. 
In January, 2015, Maxwell undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to 
discredit Giuffre and to so damage her reputation that Giuffre’s factual reporting of what had 
happened to her would not be credited.   
29. 
As part of Maxwell’s campaign she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to attack 
Giuffre’s honesty and truthfulness and to accuse Giuffre of lying.   
30. 
On or about January 3, 2015, speaking through her authorized agent, Maxwell 
issued an additional false statement to the media and public designed to maliciously discredit 
Giuffre.  That statement contained the following deliberate falsehoods: 
(a) 
That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.” 
(b) 
That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.” 
(c) 
That Giuffre’s “claims are obvious lies.” 
31. 
Maxwell’s January 3, 2015, statement incorporated by reference “Ghislaine 
Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same,” an earlier 
statement that had falsely described Giuffre’s factual assertions as “entirely false” and “entirely 
untrue.”   
32. 
Maxwell made the same false and defamatory statements as set forth above, in the 
Southern District of New York and elsewhere in a deliberate effort to maliciously discredit 
Giuffre and silence her efforts to expose sex crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, 
Epstein, and other powerful persons.  Maxwell did so with the purpose and effect of having 
Case 1:15-cv-07433   Document 1   Filed 09/21/15   Page 6 of 12
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-2     Filed 06/13/16     Page 6 of 12

others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further damaged Giuffre’s 
reputation. 
33. 
Maxwell made her statements to discredit Giuffre in close consultation with 
Epstein.  Maxwell made her statements knowing full well they were false.  
34. 
Maxwell made her statements maliciously as part of an effort to conceal sex 
trafficking crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, Epstein and other powerful persons. 
35. 
Maxwell intended her false and defamatory statements set out above to be 
broadcast around the world and to intimidate and silence Giuffre from making further efforts to 
expose sex crimes committed by Maxwell, Epstein, and other powerful persons.   
36. 
Maxwell intended her false statements to be specific statements of fact, including 
a statement that she had not recruited an underage Giuffre for Epstein’s abuse.  Maxwell’s false 
statements were broadcast around the world and were reasonably understood by those who heard 
them to be specific factual claims by Maxwell that she had not helped Epstein recruit or sexually 
abuse Giuffre and that Giuffre was a liar. 
37. 
On or about January 4, 2015, Maxwell continued her campaign to falsely and 
maliciously discredit Giuffre.  When a reporter on a Manhattan street asked Maxwell about 
Giuffre’s allegations against Maxwell, she responded by saying: “I am referring to the statement 
that we made.”  The New York Daily News published a video of this response by Maxwell 
indicating that she made her false statements on East 65th Street in Manhattan, New York, within 
the Southern District of New York.

COUNT I 
DEFAMATION 
1. 
Plaintiff Giuffre re-alleges paragraphs 1 - 37 as if the same were fully set forth 
herein.  Maxwell made her false and defamatory statements deliberately and maliciously with the 
intent to intimidate, discredit and defame Giuffre.    
2. 
In January 2015, and thereafter, Maxwell intentionally and maliciously released to 
the press her false statements about Giuffre in an attempt to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and 
cause her to lose all credibility in her efforts to help victims of sex trafficking.  
3. 
Maxwell additionally released to the press her false statements with knowledge 
that her words would dilute, discredit and neutralize Giuffre’s public and private messages to 
sexual abuse victims and ultimately prevent Giuffre from effectively providing assistance and 
advocacy on behalf of other victims of sex trafficking, or to expose her abusers.  
4. 
Using her role as a powerful figure with powerful friends, Maxwell’s statements 
were published internationally for the malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual abuse and 
sexual trafficking victim; to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and credibility; to cause the world to 
disbelieve Giuffre; and to destroy Giuffre’s efforts to use her experience to help others suffering 
as sex trafficking victims.  
5. 
Maxwell, personally and through her authorized agent, Ross Gow, intentionally 
and maliciously made false and damaging statements of fact concerning Giuffre, as detailed 
above, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere.  
6. 
The false statements made by Gow were all made by him as Maxwell’s 
authorized agent and were made with direct and actual authority from Maxwell as the principal.  
Case 1:15-cv-07433   Document 1   Filed 09/21/15   Page 8 of 12
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-2     Filed 06/13/16     Page 8 of 12

7. 
The false statements that Maxwell made personally, and through her authorized 
agent Gow, not only called Giuffre’s truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed 
Giuffre to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace. 
8. 
Maxwell made her false statements knowing full well that they were completely 
false.  Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate malice, the highest 
degree of awareness of falsity.  
9. 
Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel, as she knew that they were going to 
be transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the internet and in print.  Maxwell intended her 
false statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets internationally, and they 
were, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District of New York. 
10. 
Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel per se inasmuch as they exposed 
Giuffre to public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in 
the minds of right-thinking persons.  
11. 
Maxwell’s false statements also constitute libel per se inasmuch as they tended to 
injure Giuffre in her professional capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed 
to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation 
among members of the community that seeks her help and that she seeks to serve.  
12. 
Maxwell’s false statements directly stated and also implied that in speaking out 
against sex trafficking Giuffre acted with fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task.  
Maxwell’s false statements directly and indirectly indicate that Giuffre lied about being recruited 
by Maxwell and sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell’s false statements were 
reasonably understood by many persons who read her statements as conveying that specific 
intention and meaning. 
Case 1:15-cv-07433   Document 1   Filed 09/21/15   Page 9 of 12
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-2     Filed 06/13/16     Page 9 of 12

13. 
Maxwell’s false statements were reasonably understood by many persons who 
read those statements as making specific factual claims that Giuffre was lying about specific 
facts.  
14. 
Maxwell specifically directed her false statements at Giuffre’s true public 
description of factual events, and many persons who read Maxwell’s statements reasonably 
understood that those statements referred directly to Giuffre’s account of her life as a young 
teenager with Maxwell and Epstein.  
15. 
Maxwell intended her false statements to be widely published and disseminated 
on television, through newspapers, by word of mouth and on the internet.  As intended by 
Maxwell, her statements were published and disseminated around the world.   
16. 
 Maxwell coordinated her false statements with other media efforts made by 
Epstein and other powerful persons acting as Epstein’s representatives and surrogates.  Maxwell 
made and coordinated her statements in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere with 
the specific intent to amplify the defamatory effect those statements would have on Giuffre’s 
reputation and credibility. 
17. 
Maxwell made her false statements both directly and through agents who, with 
her general and specific authorization, adopted, distributed, and published the false statements on 
Maxwell’s behalf.  In addition, Maxwell and her authorized agents made false statements in 
reckless disregard of their truth or falsity and with malicious intent to destroy Giuffre’s 
reputation and credibility; to prevent her from further disseminating her life story; and to cause 
persons hearing or reading Giuffre’s descriptions of truthful facts to disbelieve her entirely.  
Maxwell made her false statements wantonly and with the specific intent to maliciously damage 
Giuffre’s good name and reputation in a way that would destroy her efforts to administer her

non-profit foundation, or share her life story, and thereby help others who have suffered from 
sexual abuse.   
18. 
As a result of Maxwell’s campaign to spread false, discrediting and defamatory 
statements about Giuffre, Giuffre suffered substantial damages in an amount to be proven at trial.   
19. 
Maxwell’s false statements have caused, and continue to cause, Giuffre economic 
damage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress, and other 
direct and consequential damages and losses.  
20. 
Maxwell’s campaign to spread her false statements internationally was unusual 
and particularly egregious conduct.  Maxwell sexually abused Giuffre and helped Epstein to 
sexually abuse Giuffre, and then, in order to avoid having these crimes discovered, Maxwell 
wantonly and maliciously set out to falsely accuse, defame, and discredit Giuffre.  In so doing, 
Maxwell’s efforts constituted a public wrong by deterring, damaging, and setting back Giuffre’s 
efforts to help victims of sex trafficking. Accordingly, this is a case in which exemplary and 
punitive damages are appropriate.   
21. 
Punitive and exemplary damages are necessary in this case to deter Maxwell and 
others from wantonly and maliciously using a campaign of lies to discredit Giuffre and other 
victims of sex trafficking.  
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Giuffre respectfully requests judgment against Defendant 
Maxwell, awarding compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an 
amount to be determined at trial, but in excess of the $75,000 jurisdictional requirement; costs of 
suit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Virginia Roberts and things that she has said, was 
she lying when she said that she has flown on 
Jeffrey Epstein's airplane? 
471 
MR. INDYKE: 
Objection. 
Work product and 
common interest. 
A. 
I think I can answer that question. 
Based 
on material that was produced in discovery, which 
would not be subject to privilege, there seems to be 
evidence that she did fly on the airplane with 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Was she lying when she says that she was 
flown on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane across state 
lines at a time when she was under the age of 18? 
A. 
I have no idea. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Objection. 
Same objection. 
Work product and attorney-client and common 
interest. 
A. 
I have no idea. 
But, again --
I just have 
no idea. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Is there any nonprivileged information 
that you could review that would give you an idea to 
answer that question or that would give you the 
answer to that question?

MR. 
Q. 
507 
EDWARDS: 
What we have here --
MR. INDYKE: 
Attorney-client, work product 
common interests. 
EDWARDS: 
What we have here is only the fraction of 
flights where Dave Rogers was one of the pilots. 
Can you help us get the flight logs from Larry 
Visosky, Larry Morrison, any of the flight logs from 
the helicopters, et cetera? 
A. 
I would love to. 
It would all show that I 
wasn't on the plane. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
A. 
I will do everything in my power --
MR. SCOTT: 
You can make any request you 
want to through counsel, and we'll take them 
up. 
A. 
But I will do everything in my power to 
get you every flight manifest. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Move forward. 
MR. INDYKE: 
We do not waive any 
objection. 
MR. SCAROLA: 
And that request has been 
made.

A. 
Is that a question? 
MR. SCOTT: 
No. 
Just Mr. Scarola 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Just that we made a request 
for production. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Was Virginia lying when she says that she 
was taken to Jeffrey Epstein's home in New York 
while underage? 
A. 
I have no idea. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Was Virginia lying when she says she was 
taken to Jeffrey Epstein's ranch in New Mexico while 
underage? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
A. 
I can tell you this. 
She's lying when she 
said she met me at the ranch. 
So I cannot believe 
anything she says about the ranch. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Was she lying when she says Ghislaine 
Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein used sex toys on her 
when she was underage? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same

instruction. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Was she lying when she says Jeffrey 
Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell made her dress up in 
outfits for them? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
A. 
Well, I can 
but I do have some material 
outside of the record on that. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
A. 
Okay. 
I know that Sigrid Mccawley said that she 
said that Leslie Wexner made her dress up --
MS. McCAWLEY: 
I am going to object to the 
extent that you are trying to reveal 
conversations that were part of a settlement 
discussion which the judge has already sealed 
the record on and there is a pending motion for 
sanctions. 
And if you're going to start 
revealing that information, we're going 
directly to the Judge Lynch. 
A. 
I am going to start revealing 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
No, I'm going to 
stop you 
THE WITNESS: 
Let me tell you why. 
www.phippsreporting.com 
(888)811-3408 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 6 of 27
Because I didn't get that from Sigrid or from 
David Boise. 
I got it from Leslie Wexner's 
lawyer in a totally nonprivileged 
communication. 
510 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Let me stop you. 
I don't believe it's responsive to the question 
that's pending, so let's move forward. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
My question was, was she lying -- was 
Virginia Roberts lying when she says Jeffrey Epstein 
and Ghislaine Maxwell made her dress up in outfits 
for them? 
A. 
I can only say that that allegation has 
been made regarding Leslie Wexner as well. 
Q. 
A. 
It has nothing to do with my question. 
MR. SCAROLA: 
Move to strike. 
Leslie Wexner's lawyer regards that as a 
full statement and, therefore, I can only assume 
that it's a false statement when made about someone 
else. 
I think that's relevant. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
So with respect 
to the --
MR. EDWARDS: 
I'm moving to strike the 
nonresponsive portion of that answer. 
THE WITNESS: 
He opened the door.

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 7 of 27
511 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
I do believe it 
was nonresponsive in its entirety. 
Move 
forward. 
Go ahead. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
Do you know Jean-Luc Brunel? 
No. 
Have you ever met him? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
A. 
I have no memory of ever meeting a man by 
that name. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Do you know what his role was in Jeffrey 
Epstein's life? 
A. 
No. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
Mr. Dershowitz, if you would let 
me make my objections before you respond. 
THE WITNESS: 
Right. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Was Virginia Roberts lying when she said 
Jeffrey Epstein socialized with Bill Clinton during 
the relevant time period? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instructions. 
www.phippsreporting.com 
(888)811-3408 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 8 of 27
512 
A. 
My information is that Virginia Roberts 
was lying when she said that she saw Bill Clinton on 
Jeffrey Epstein's island. 
That's all I can comment 
about with that. 
And she's lying about that. 
And 
she's lying about how Bill Clinton got to the 
island. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
I move to strike the 
Nonresponsive portion of the answer. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
No, it's 
relevant to what you asked. 
Move forward. 
I'm 
not going to strike it. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I'm going to go back to the question until 
I get an answer, though. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Go ahead. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
That is, when Virginia Roberts said that 
during the relevant time period, which we defined as 
1999 through 2002 --
A. 
Let's be clear. 
Around August of both of 
those years, right? 
2002. 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
I think August of 
99 through October of 
September, I think it is. 
Okay. 
Was she lying -- was Virginia

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 9 of 27
Roberts lying when she said Jeffrey Epstein 
socialized with Bill Clinton during that time 
period? 
A. 
I don't know. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
513 
Q. 
And you have no nonprivileged information 
that would provide you the answer to that? 
A. 
I have nonprivileged information that 
provides me that they socialized together at some 
point. 
I don't know whether it was within that 
timeframe at all. 
I know they went to Africa 
together on a mission of goodwill, but I don't know 
the date of that. 
So I can't tell you whether it 
was in the period or outside the period. 
You may 
know that; I don't. 
Q. 
Well, if Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton 
associated, but only at some time period either 
before or after the relevant time period, it would 
immediately disprove her statement that Bill Clinton 
and Jeffrey Epstein socialized during that time 
period? 
A. 
Q. 
I don't understand that question. 
No?

(888)811-3408 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 10 of 27
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
I don't 
understand the question either. 
If you can 
rephrase the question, that would be helpful. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Sure. 
514 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
If you -- do you know from nonprivileged 
information whether Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton 
ever socialized? 
A. 
Q. 
Yes. 
Do you know the beginning -- when their 
relationship began? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Objection. 
Same objection, 
same instruction. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Again, under 
nonprivileged. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Under nonprivileged 
information. 
MR. SCOTT: 
Do you have any nonprivileged 
information about that? 
A. 
I remember having dinner at the home of 
Caroline Kennedy and Ed Schlossberg with President 
Clinton, and he basically asked me how Jeffrey was 
doing, and led me to believe that he had some 
relationship with Jeffrey. 
I don't remember whether 
that dinner -- when that dinner was. 
I can probably

515 
find out. 
But that would be nonprivileged. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Was he still President at the time that 
conversation was taking place? 
A. 
Q. 
I don't remember. 
Have you ever been, yourself, together 
with Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton? 
A. 
Q. 
No. 
Have you ever talked to Jeffrey Epstein 
about Bill Clinton? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Objection. 
Same objection, 
same instruction. 
A. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Nonprivileged. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Yeah, nonprivileged. 
It's hard to sort out the privileged and 
the nonprivileged. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
So based upon 
the objection, I would ask that you -- unless 
it's obvious, then no, until we sort that out. 
A. 
I shouldn't answer that probably. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
I'm going to 
grant his objection at this point, again, as a 
continuum because I want to make sure that we 
preserve this issue for later on.

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 12 of 27
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
In a previous -- previously in this 
deposition, you indicated your representation of 
Jeffrey Epstein on this subject matter began in 
2005, right? 
A. 
It began, I think I said, when the first 
allegations were. 
I don't have an exact date in 
mind. 
Q. 
The relevant time period for Virginia 
Roberts, as we've defined, is 1999 through 2002. 
A. 
That's correct, yes. 
Q. 
So I'm asking if you know from Jeffrey 
Epstein, in a time period prior to your 
516 
representation, whether he was socializing with Bill 
Clinton. 
BY 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
A. 
Yes, yes. 
MR. SCOTT: 
As long as it's a 
nonprivileged situation. 
A. 
He was. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
He was? 
A. 
He was.

So prior

517 
A. 
During the whole period of time up through 
2005, you're saying? 
Yes. 
Q. 
A. 
Right. 
Yes, I think this dinner occurred before 
2005, so I would -- yes. 
Q. 
So what did Jeffrey Epstein tell you about 
his relationship with Bill Clinton? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
A. 
Prior to 2005, obviously. 
That they knew each other and that they 
were doing some charitable work together. 
Q. 
Had Bill Clinton ever been to Jeffrey 
Epstein's home? 
A. 
I'm not aware. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
What kind of charitable work was Jeffrey 
Epstein 
A. 
I can tell you Donald Trump has been to 
Jeffrey Epstein's home, and I've seen him there. 
Q. 
Okay. 
What question do you think that 
you're answering?

A. 
people --
Well, you're asking about general things 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Let's move 
forward. 
518 
A. 
so I mean, I gave you an example of one 
who has been there. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
when 
Q. 
Okay. 
I'm specifically talking about 
we started with was Virginia lying when she 
said that Jeffrey Epstein socialized with Bill 
Clinton during the relevant time period. 
And now 
I'm drilling it. 
A. 
Q. 
I don't know the answer to that. 
Okay. 
Did you understand -- did Bill 
Clinton travel with Jeffrey Epstein? 
A. 
My understanding from newspaper 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
A. 
My understanding from newspaper accounts 
is that they went to Africa together with some other 
famous people, and I think maybe went to Asia 
together as well. 
So the answer is yes, I am aware 
through nonprivileged sources that they traveled 
together, yes. 
MR. SCOTT: 
Can we take a break in a few

minutes? 
I would like -- in the afternoon, he 
gets a little tired, so I would like to, every 
hour or so, take -- an hour and ten minutes, 
take a couple-minute break. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
You tell me when 
is a good --
MR. EDWARDS: 
Maybe 15 minutes and we'll 
switch topics, and we can take a break. 
Good, 
Tom? 
MR. SCOTT: 
Yes. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Okay. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Was Virginia Roberts lying when she says 
she was introduced to Prince Andrew through Jeffrey 
Epstein? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Under 
non-privileged information. 
A. 
I have seen a photograph of Prince Andrew 
and Virginia Roberts and Ghislaine Maxwell. 
I have 
myself met Prince Andrew. 
He came to my class at 
Harvard Law School and there was a dinner for him, 
and he asked about Jeffrey Epstein. 
We discussed 
Jeffrey Epstein.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I don't know if this was --
I believe it 
was attached to the deposition last time. 
A. 
That's the photograph. 
MR. SCOTT: 
I think it was. 
MR. SCAROLA: 
It was. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
I think it was, too. 
MR. SCOTT: 
It was. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
A. 
So you're familiar with this photograph? 
Yes, and I'm also familiar there's no 
comparable photograph with me in it. 
Q. 
Okay. 
MR. SCAROLA: 
That's not responsive. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Move forward. 
MR. SCAROLA: 
Move to strike. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
And in this photograph, this is Prince 
Andrew over here on the left? 
A. 
Q. 
middle? 
A. 
That's true, yeah. 
And this is Virginia Roberts in the 
I've never seen -- I've never met 
Ms. Roberts, never seen her. 
520 
Q. 
So are you saying that she is lying when 
www.phippsreporting.com 
(888)811-3408 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 17 of 27
she says that's her? 
A. 
A. 
No, I just don't -- I've never seen her. 
MR. SCOTT: 
Objection, argumentative. 
Those are photographs -- I've seen 
photographs --
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Hang on one 
second. 
Reask -- rephrase the question. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
And who is this over here on the --
521 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
No, rephrase the 
question, the previous question about who the 
young lady is next to Prince Andrew. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Sure. 
Do you know who this lady is in the 
middle of this photograph? 
A. 
On the basis of newspaper accounts, it is 
reported that she is Virginia Roberts. 
I wouldn't 
be able -- if you had shown me that picture a year 
and 16 days ago, I would not have been able to tell 
you that that's Virginia Roberts because I didn't 
know who she was. 
Q. 
And who is the other person that's in this 
photograph? 
A. 
Q. 
Ghislaine Maxwell. 
And that's somebody else that you know, 
www.phippsreporting.com 
(888)811-3408 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 18 of 27
522 
correct? 
A. 
Q. 
right? 
I do. 
And you know her through Jeffrey Epstein, 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
A. 
I wrote an article about her father's 
death years ago, and I don't remember if I met her 
independently. 
I do remember meeting her through 
her --
I remember that the Lady Rothschild asked me 
to meet Jeffrey Epstein, and when Jeffrey Epstein 
came to meet me, he was with Ghislaine Maxwell. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
A. 
And when was that? 
The first time I Jeffrey Epstein, which 
would have been in the summer of Leslie Wexner's 
59th birthday. 
That's all I can tell you is the 
summer of his 59th birthday because I then flew with 
Jeffrey Epstein to Leslie Wexner's 59th birthday. 
I 
was presented to Leslie Wexner. 
Leslie would like 
to get as birthday gifts interesting people that his 
friends had met during the year, and so I was 
Jeffrey Epstein's intellectual gift to Leslie 
Wexner. 
And it was that year that I met Jeffrey 
Epstein. 
That's the best I can date it.

Q. 
Okay. 
And Ghislaine Maxwell, you are 
aware, is involved in litigation with Virginia 
Roberts right now, correct? 
523 
A. 
She is being sued by Virginia Roberts for 
defamation, not for the underlying offenses, which 
are beyond the statute of limitations, as I 
understand it, correct. 
Q. 
And have you spoken with Ghislaine Maxwell 
about the allegations against her and her denials?

Same objection, same 
instruction. 
MR. SCOTT: 
Don't answer it. It's 
privileged. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I'm asking about your conversations with 
Ghislaine Maxwell, who's in a separate litigation, 
civil litigation for defamation. 
Have you 
personally spoken with Ghislaine Maxwell since these 
allegations? 
A. 
If there's no objection, I will answer. 
MR. INDYKE: 
There was an objection. 
Same 
objection, same instruction. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Is there a joint defense agreement related 
to the civil allegation -- actions regarding the

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 20 of 27
defamation actions that involve Ghislaine Maxwell 
and yourself? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
What's the 
basis -- can you explain to me what the basis 
of the objection is -- and what was the 
question? 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Has Mr. Dershowitz spoken 
with Ghislaine Maxwell since the allegations 
since this defamation suit came about as well 
524 
as the defamation suit with Ghislaine Maxwell. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Let me ask it cleaner. 
Have you spoken 
with Ghislaine Maxwell since January 2015? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
So that I'm clear, there is a joint 
defense of the allegations regarding Ghislaine 
Maxwell that's New York litigation and this 
defamation case? 
MR. INDYKE: 
There's a common interest 
agreement in effect with respect to the 
New York case and a common interest agreement 
with respect to this case.

EDWARDS: 
Okay. 
Was Virginia Roberts lying when she 
she was taken by Ghislaine Maxwell and 
MR. SCAROLA: 
Who negotiated the agreement 
when? 
EDWARDS: 
Is there a common interest agreement in 
existence with respect to the allegations that have 
arisen since January of 2015 or that you contend 
covers that? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
If there is, who negotiated this 
agreement? 
MR. SCAROLA: 
Can we have a ruling on 
propriety? 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
You haven't 
pushed me, so I let you go. 
MR. SCAROLA: 
Can we have a ruling as to 
whether we get to know whether Mr. Dershowitz 
is a party to a common interest agreement with 
Ghislaine Maxwell?

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 22 of 27
Mccawley, if any of the individuals on the 
phone are representing Ghislaine Maxwell, my 
understanding is the person on the phone is 
representing Jeffrey Epstein, not Ghislaine 
Maxwell. 
That needs to be clarified. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Correct. 
Correct. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
The answer is 
correct? 
526 
MR. INDYKE: 
With respect to Mr. Epstein, 
I can tell you there's a common interest 
agreement with respect to this matter and a 
common interest agreement with respect to the 
Ghislaine Maxwell suit in New York. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Is 
Mr. Dershowitz party to that? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Mr. Dershowitz is party to a 
common interest agreement with Jeffrey in this 
case. 
And I believe -- I'd have to check, but 
I believe that that would extend 
MR. SCAROLA: 
We want an answer from the 
witness as to whether the witness is a party to 
a common interest agreement with Ghislaine 
Maxwell. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Then ask the 
question, because I haven't seen the question

asked yet. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Are you a party to a common interest 
agreement with Ghislaine Maxwell? 
A. 
If there's no objection, I'll answer it. 
MR. INDYKE: 
I apologize. 
I thought we 
527 
were still operating under the original set of 
objections. 
So I will repeat it. 
Same 
objection, same instruction. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
With respect to 
that question, you can answer. 
A. 
My understanding is that I am still 
Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer. 
Jeffrey Epstein, I 
understand, has a common interest or joint defense 
agreement with Ghislaine Maxwell, so I have -- my 
understanding is that I am bound by a common 
agreement. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Is this the same common interest agreement 
that we were talking about from 2005, or is this a 
separate common interest agreement that has been 
signed as a consequence of the lawsuits that have 
been filed since January 2015? 
MR. INDYKE: 
If this is a new question, 
I'll assert the same objection and the same

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-4     Filed 06/13/16     Page 24 of 27
528 
instruction. 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
And I'm going to 
overrule the objection. 
And you can answer 
that. 
A. 
My understanding is that it's a 
combination; that is, it reflects the previous 
agreement and that there is a new agreement that 
supplemented the previous agreement. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
When you say it's your understanding, is 
this understanding in writing; meaning, is there a 
written common interest agreement that has been put 
in place since January of 2015? 
A. 
I don't know. 
MR. INDYKE: 
Same objection, same 
instruction. 
MR. SCOTT: 
Can we take a recess when we 
get a chance? 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: 
Yes, but I'm 
going to instruct you 
A. 
I don't know. 
I don't know the answer to 
that, whether there's additional writing or not.

Q.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
The photograph is printed in March of 
2001, which is when she's 17, which just means that 
the photograph was taken sometime before that date. 
So she was at least as young as 17 is the best that 
I can tell you. 
A. 
Under the age of consent, that would be an 
act of prostitution. 
If she was paid $15,000 to 
have sex with Prince Andrew at the age of 17 in 
England, she would be guilty of prostitution. 
Q. 
My question is, was she lying when she 
says that she was paid to have sex with Prince 
Andrew?

Q. 
A. 
Q. 
I have no idea. 
You have met Prince Andrew, right? 
I have. 
He sat in the back of your classrooms?

Objection, asked and answered 
twice. 
A. 
Once, yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
I think we went to Jeffrey Epstein sitting 
in your classrooms, but now I'm talking about Prince 
Andrew sat in your classroom as well, right?

Yes, once.

Andrew before; maybe I'm wrong. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
Have you, since the -- since January of 
2015, have you contacted Prince Andrew? 
A. 
Q. 
No. 
I got a Christmas card from him. 
Have you spoke with him about the 
531 
allegations that were alleged against Prince Andrew? 
A. 
Q. 
Not to him, but to -- not to him. 
Have you spoke to some representative of 
his, of Prince Andrew? 
A. 
I need to know whether --

Guy, sorry, I was just cut

Hold on a 
second. 
Go ahead and restate your question 
so -- Darren, can you hear now? 
MR. INDYKE: 
Yes, I can. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. 
My question is, have you spoken with 
Prince Andrew or any representative of or for Prince 
Andrew since January of 2015? 
MR. SCOTT: 
If any of that involved work 
product on our part, I am instructing you not 
to answer.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
------------------------------------------------------X 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
15-cv-07433-RWS 
------------------------------------------------------X 
DEFENDANT GHISLAINE MAXWELL’S RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS TO 
PLAINTIFF’S SECOND REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby responds 
to Plaintiff’s Second Request for Production of Documents (the “Requests”). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT AND GENERAL OBJECTIONS 
1. 
This response is made to the best of Ms. Maxwell’s present knowledge, 
information and belief. Ms. Maxwell, through her attorneys of record, have not completed the 
investigation of the facts relating to this case, have not completed discovery in this action, and 
have not completed preparation for trial. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to Plaintiff’s requests are 
based on information currently known to her and are given without waiving Ms. Maxwell’s right 
to use evidence of any subsequently discovered or identified facts, documents or 
communications.  Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to supplement this Response in accordance 
with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e).  
2. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they attempt to impose any 
requirement or discovery obligation greater than or different from those under the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, the local rules of this Court or any Orders of the Court.   
3. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek documents or 
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, Rule 408 of the 
Federal Rules of Evidence, any common interest privilege, joint defense agreement or any other 
applicable privilege.   
4. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek documents or 
information outside of Ms. Maxwell’s possession, custody or control.   
.........................................
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-5     Filed 06/13/16     Page 1 of 24

5. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek information which is 
not relevant to the subject matter of the litigation and/or is not reasonably calculated to lead to 
the discovery of admissible evidence.   
6. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they are overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying, embarrassing, or 
harassing Ms. Maxwell. 
7. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they are vague and ambiguous, 
or imprecise.  
8. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek information that is 
confidential and implicates Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interests. 
9. 
Ms. Maxwell incorporates by reference every general objection set forth above 
into each specific response set forth below.  A specific response may repeat a general objection 
for emphasis or for some other reason.  The failure to include any general objection in any 
specific response does not waive any general objection to that request. 
10. 
The Requests seek information that is confidential and implicates Ms. Maxwell’s 
privacy interests.  To the extent such information is relevant and discoverable in this action, Ms. 
Maxwell will produce such materials subject to an appropriate protective order pursuant to Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 26(c) limiting their dissemination to the attorneys and their employees. 
OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS 
11. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 1 regarding “Agent” to the extent that it 
purports to extend the meaning beyond those permissible by law. 
12. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 3 regarding “Defendant.”  The Definition 
is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of the 
Requests to documents in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than Ms. 
Maxwell or her counsel. 
13. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 5 regarding “Employee.”  Ms. Maxwell is 
an individual, sued in an individual capacity, and therefore there is no “past or present officer, 
director, agent or servant” of hers.  Additionally, “attorneys” and “paralegals” are not 
“employees” of Ms. Maxwell given that she herself is not an attorney and therefore cannot 
“employ” attorneys. 
14. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 10 regarding “You” or “Your.”  The 
Definition is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of 
the Requests to documents in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than Ms. 
Maxwell or her counsel. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-5     Filed 06/13/16     Page 2 of 24

OBJECTIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS 
15. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 1, in particular the definition of the 
“Relevant Period” to include July 1999 to the present, on the grounds that it is overly broad and 
unduly burdensome and calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action 
and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  The Complaint at 
paragraph 9 purports to describe events pertaining to Plaintiff and Defendant occurring in the 
years 1999 – 2002.  The Complaint also references statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell 
occurring in January 2015.  Defining the “Relevant Period” as “July 1999 to the present” is 
vastly overbroad, irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible 
evidence, and as to certain of the Requests, is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or 
harassing Ms. Maxwell and it implicates her privacy rights.  Thus, Ms. Maxwell interprets the 
Relevant Period to be limited to 1999-2002 and December 30, 2014 - January 31, 2015, except to 
the extent that any the answers “relate to any activity of defendant with respect to the practice 
which has been alleged and the duties alleged to be performed by Defendant, ‘activities’ being 
defined as sexual abuse or trafficking of any female,” in which case her answers reflect the 
period 2000-today.   Ms. Maxwell specifically objects to production of any documents outside 
that period, except as specifically noted.  
16. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 3 on the grounds that it is unduly 
burdensome and is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell.  
Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly recall the specific disposition of documents, particularly electronic 
documents, dating back over 16 years.  However, Ms. Maxwell, prior to this litigation has long 
had a practice of deleting emails after they have been read.  
17. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction Nos. 5, 8, 9, 12, 17 to the extent they seek to 
impose obligations to supply explanations for the presence or absence of such documents, to 
specifically identify persons or documents, to provide information concerning who prepared 
documents, the location of any copies of such documents, the identities and contact information 
for persons who have custody or control of such documents, the reasons for inability to produce 
portions of documents, and the “natural person in whose possession they were found,” beyond 
the requirements of Rule 34.  This Instruction improperly seeks to propound Interrogatories 
pursuant to Rule 33. 
18. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Instructions No. 13 on the grounds that it is unduly 
burdensome and is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell.  
Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly recall the specific circumstances upon which a document dating 
back 16 years has ceased to exist.  
19. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 15 to the extent that it calls for documents 
or information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or any other 
applicable privilege. 
20. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction Nos. 18 & 19 to the extent they require 
information on any privilege log above and beyond the requirements of Local Civil Rule 26.2.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S SECOND REQUESTS 
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS 
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 1  
Produce all documents that Your attorneys reviewed and/or relied upon in the March 21, 
2016, meet and confer discussion when Mr. Pagliuca stated that (1) Plaintiff made false 
allegations concerning her sexual assault; (2) she made them in roughly the same time frame that 
Plaintiff was abused by Jeffrey Epstein; (3) that the allegations were made against a number of 
individuals in the area; and (4) that the allegations were found to be unfounded by local police. 
RESPONSE: Ms. Maxwell has no knowledge of any statements made by Mr. Pagliuca 
during the March 21, 2016 meet and confer and hence has no documents responsive to this 
Request.  Further, this Request inaccurately characterizes the statements of Ms. Maxwell’s 
counsel during the March 16, 2016 meet and confer.   
Ms. Maxwell further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents or 
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, the common 
interest privilege or any other applicable privilege. 
Ms. Maxwell also objects to this Request to the extent it calls for information relating to 
Virginia Roberts Giuffre that exists within the public domain, the internet or in public court 
records and which are equally available to both parties and can be obtained from some other 
source that is more convenient, less burdensome, and less expensive.  Subject to and without 
waiver of the foregoing, Defendant refers to the public documents and news reports regarding 
Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse and investigation of the same, which have been previously 
produced, are available in the public domain, or referenced in court papers.  Defendant also 
refers Plaintiff to documents within the possession, custody and control of Plaintiff and her 
counsel, including without limitation Mr. Bradley Edwards, which were requested in 
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests, but were not produced despite certification of 
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel that such Responses were truthful and complete. 
Without waiver of any such objections, Ms. Maxwell has made available documents 
related to some of Ms. Giuffre’s false allegations of sexual assaults in her Second Supplemental 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) disclosures.   
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 2  
Produce all documents concerning how any such police report, or how any such 
recounting, retelling, summary, or description of any such police report (as referenced in 
Interrogatory No. 1), came into Your possession. This request includes, but is not limited to, all 
documents concerning how, when, and by whom such reports (or descriptions of reports) were 
obtained from a minor child’s sealed juvenile records and files. 
RESPONSE: Ms. Maxwell objects to this Request in that there is no “Interrogatory No. 
1” to which the Request corresponds.  She further objects to the Request in that it improperly 
seeks to propound an Interrogatory in the form of a Request for Production of Documents and is 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-5     Filed 06/13/16     Page 4 of 24

a contention Interrogatory barred according to Plaintiff’s interpretation of the Local Rules.  The 
Request embeds a number of assumptions that are not true and for which Plaintiff supplies no 
basis for assertion of their veracity. 
Ms. Maxwell likewise objects to this Request because it seeks documents or information 
protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, the common interest 
privilege or any other applicable privilege.   
Finally, Ms. Maxwell also objects to this Request to the extent it calls for information 
relating to Virginia Roberts Giuffre that exists within the public domain, the internet or in public 
court records and which are equally available to both parties and can be obtained from some 
other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, and less expensive.  Defendant refers to 
the public documents and news reports regarding Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse and 
investigation of the same, which have been previously produced, are available in the public 
domain, or referenced in court papers. Defendant also refers Plaintiff to documents within the 
possession, custody and control of Plaintiff and her counsel, including without limitation Mr. 
Bradley Edwards, which were requested in Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests, but 
were not produced despite certification of Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel that such Responses 
were truthful and complete. 
Without waiver of any such objections, Ms. Maxwell has made available documents 
related to some of Ms. Giuffre’s false allegations of sexual assaults in her Second Supplemental 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) disclosures.  Ms. Maxwell is withholding documents responsive to 
this request on the basis of the attorney-client and work product privileges. 
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 3  
Produce all documents concerning how information or knowledge of the local police’s 
findings or opinions concerning Ms. Giuffre’s allegations of sexual assault as a minor child came 
into Your possession, including but not limited to documents concerning any statements made by 
law enforcement or any state attorney, written or oral, concerning such allegations. 
RESPONSE: Ms. Maxwell objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents or 
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, the common 
interest privilege or any other applicable privilege. 
Ms. Maxwell also objects to this Request to the extent it calls for information relating to 
Virginia Roberts Giuffre that exists within the public domain, the internet or in public court 
records and which are equally available to both parties and can be obtained from some other 
source that is more convenient, less burdensome, and less expensive.  Subject to and without 
waiver of the foregoing, Defendant refers to the public documents and news reports regarding 
Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse and investigation of the same, which have been previously 
produced, are available in the public domain, or referenced in court papers.  Defendant also 
refers Plaintiff to documents within the possession, custody and control of Plaintiff and her 
counsel, including without limitation Mr. Bradley Edwards, which were requested in 
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests, but were not produced despite certification of 
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel that such Responses were truthful and complete. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-5     Filed 06/13/16     Page 5 of 24

Without waiver of any such objections, Ms. Maxwell has made available documents 
related to some of Ms. Giuffre’s false allegations of sexual assaults in her Second Supplemental 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) disclosures.  Ms. Maxwell is withholding documents responsive to 
this request on the basis of the attorney-client and work product privileges. 
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 4  
Produce all documents concerning any investigations, internal or otherwise, by any law 
enforcement or governmental agency, regarding the illegal disclosure, illegal purchase, and/or 
theft of sealed juvenile police records concerning Plaintiff.  
RESPONSE: Ms. Maxwell objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents or 
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, the common 
interest privilege or any other applicable privilege.  Ms. Maxwell also objects to this Request to 
the extent it calls information relating to Virginia Roberts Giuffre that exists within the public 
domain, the internet or in public court records and which are equally available to both parties and 
can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, and less 
expensive.  Defendant objects to this request to the extent that it characterizes the gathering of 
public information as “illegal.”   
Subject to and without waiver of the foregoing, Defendant has been unable to locate any 
documents responsive to this Request. 
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 5  
Produce all documents concerning any rape, sexual assault, sexual intercourse, or other 
sexual encounter involving Plaintiff. This Request includes, but is not limited to, (1) any 
documents concerning any sexual assault of Plaintiff while a minor; (2) any police reports, or 
documents concerning any police reports, that were created concerning such claims of sexual 
assault; and (3) documents concerning any communications received by You (or Your agents 
or attorneys) by other individuals that reference any sexual assault of Plaintiff while a minor. 
RESPONSE: Ms. Maxwell objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents or 
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, the common 
interest privilege or any other applicable privilege. 
Ms. Maxwell also objects to this Request to the extent it calls for information relating to 
Virginia Roberts Giuffre that exists within the public domain, the internet or in public court 
records and which are equally available to both parties and can be obtained from some other 
source that is more convenient, less burdensome, and less expensive.  Subject to and without 
waiver of the foregoing, Defendant refers to the public documents and news reports regarding 
Plaintiff’s false allegations of sexual abuse and investigation of the same, which have been 
previously produced, are available in the public domain, or referenced in court papers.  
Defendant also refers Plaintiff to documents within the possession, custody and control of 
Plaintiff and her counsel, including without limitation Mr. Bradley Edwards, which were

Petitioner. 
IEM~r.:3 enc. y 
VICTIM'S PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF 
CRIME VICTIM'S RIGHTS ACT, 18 U.S.C . SECTION 3771 
COMES NOW the Petitioner, JANE DOE (hereinafter "Petitioner"), by and through her 
undersigned attorneys, pursuant to the Crime Victim's Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3771 
('"CVRA."), and files this Petition for Enforcement in the above styled action as follows: 
1. 
Petitioner, an adult, as a minor child was a victim of federal crimes committed by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN (hereinafter "Defendant"). 
These crimes included sex trafficking of 
children by fraud, in violation of 18 U .S .C. § 1591, use of a means of interstate commerce to 
entice a minor to commit prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, as well as wire fraud, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. The Defendant committed these crimes within the jurisdiction of 
th,;! Southern District of Florida in Palm Beach County, Florida. 
2. 
Upon information and belief, the Defendant is the subject of a federal criminal 
investigation conducted by the United States of America in the Southern District of Florida. The 
Defendant has recently been prosecuted and pleaded guilty, on June 30, 2008, in the Circuit 
Court for Palm Beach County to various similar state offenses including solicitation of minors 
for prostitution. 
3. 
Upon information and belief, the Defendant is engaged in plea negotiations with 
thf: Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida concerning federal

crimes which he is alleged to have committed against minor children, including the Petitioner. 
Such negotiations may likely result in a disposition of the charges in the next several days. 
4. 
Under the CVRA, before any charges are filed against the Defendant, the 
Petitioner has the rights (among others) to notice of her rights under the CVRA, to confer with 
the prosecutors, and to be treated with fairness. As soon as charges are filed, the Petitioner has 
the rights (among others) to timely notice of court proceedings, the right not to be excluded from 
such proceedings, the right to be heard at such public proceedings regarding conditions of 
release, any plea, and any sentence, the right to confer with the attorney for the government the 
:right to restitution, and the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for her dignity and 
privacy. 
5. 
The Petitioner has been denied her rights in that she has received no consultation 
with the attorney for the government regarding the possible disposition of the charges, no notice 
of any public court proceedings, no information regarding her right to restitution, and no notice 
of rights under the CVRA, as required under law. 
6. 
The Petitioner is in jeopardy of losing her rights, as described above, if the 
government is able to negotiate a plea or agreement with the Defendant without her participation 
and knowledge. 
WHEREFORE, for the reasons outlined above, the Petitioner respectfully requests this 
Court to grant her Petition, and to order the United States Attorney to comply with the provisions 
of the CVRA prior to and including any plea or other agreement with the Defendant and any 
attendant proceedings.

MEMORANDUM 
I. 
THE CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT MAKES CRIME VICTIMS 
INDEPENDENT 
PARTICIPANTS 
THROUGHOUT 
THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS. 
In October 2004, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act, Pub. L. No. 108-405, 118 Stat. 2251 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771). Because this 
appears to be the first case involving the Act to come before this Court, a bit of background may 
be in order. 
A. 
The CVRA Gives Crime Victims Rights to Participate in the Criminal Justice 
Process. 
Congress passed the CVRA "to give crime victims enforceable rights to participate in 
federal criminal proceedings." Opinion at 14. Congress was concerned that in the federal system 
crime victims were "treated as non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept 
in the dark by prosecutors too busy to care enough ... and by a court system that simply did not 
have a place for them." 150 CONG. REc. S4262 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). 
To remedy this problem, Congress gave victims "the simple right to know what is going on, to 
participate in the process where the information that victims and their families can provide may 
be material and relevant ... ." Id. 
The CVRA gives victims of federal crimes a series of rights, including the right to notice 
of court proceedings, to be heard at plea and sentencing hearings, and to reasonably "confer with 
the attorney for the Government in the case." 18 U.S.C. § 377l(a). Victims also have a "right 
of access to the terms of a plea agreement ... ." In re Interested Party 1, 530 F .Supp. 2d 136, 
2008 WL 134233 at *7 (D.D.C. 2008). The CVRA also assures victims broadly that they will 
"be treated with fairness." 18 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(8). 

of 10
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 1    Entered on FLSD Docket 07/07/2008   Page 4 of 10
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-6     Filed 06/13/16     Page 4 of 10
Of course, these rights would be of little use to most crime victims unless they were told 
about them. To ensure that victims are notified of their rights, the CVRA directs employees of 
the Justice Department "and other departments and agencies of the United States engaged in the 
detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime" to use their "best efforts to see that crime 
victims are notified of ... the rights described [in the CVRA]." 18 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l) (emphasis 
added).l 
B. 
The CVRA Gives Victims Rights During the Investigation of a Crime. 
The CVRI\ gives victims rights during the investigation of a crime. The Fifth Circuit 
recently reached this conclusion, holding: 
The district court acknowledged that "[t]here are clearly rights 
under the CVRA that apply before any prosecution is underway." 
BP Prods., 2008 WL 501321 at *11, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12893, 
at *36. Logically, this includes the CVRA's establishment of 
victims' "reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government." 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(S). At least in the posture of 
this case (and we do not speculate on the applicability to other 
situations), the government should have fashioned a reasonable 
way to inform the victims of the likelihood of criminal charges and 
to ascertain the victims' views on the possible details of a plea 
bargain. 
In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391,394 (5th Cir. 2008). 
The position that CVRA rights apply before charges have been filed is consistent with the 
Justice Department regulations under the CVRA, which explain that government officials "must 
advise a victim [ about their rights under the CVRA] ... at the earliest opportunity at which it may 
be done without interfering with an investigation." A.G. GUIDELINES FOR VICTIM AND WllNESS 
Further supporting this requirement is another statute, 42 U .S.C. § 10607( c )(3 ), which directs government officials 
to provide victims with "the earliest possible notice of," among other things, "the filing of charges against a 
suspected offender."

Ass1STANCE 23 (May 2005). And the plain language of the CVRA undergirds this conclusion, as 
it applies not simply to prosecutors but to government agencies "engaged in the detection [ and] 
investigation ... of crime .... " 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(l). Indeed, if there were any doubt, the plain 
language of the CVRA extends victims' right to situations "in which no prosecution is 
underway." 18 U.S.C. § 377l(d)(3). 
II. 
PETITIONER IS A "VICTIM PROTECTED BY THE CVRA. 
Under the CVRA the crime victim is defined as "a person directly and proximately 
harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense .... " 18 U.S.C. Section 3771(e). 
In 
particular, Defendant called Petitioner when she was a minor over a telephone ( a means of 
interstate communication) requesting that she perform a massage in exchange for payment. As 
Defendant well knew, that request was fraudulent, as he not only intended to receive a massage, 
but also intended to have her perform sexual acts in exchange for a cash payment to Petitioner. 
Only when Petitioner arrived at a Defendant's mansion as directed by Defendant, did Defendant 
reveal his true purpose of obtaining sexual favors in exchange for payment. This conduct 
violated 18 U.S.C. § 2422, which forbids using a means of interstate commerce to knowingly 
"induce" or "entice" a minor "to engage in prostitution." In addition, this conduct was both a use 
of "fraud" to obtain a commercial sex act, in violation of 18 U.S.C § 1591, and use of wire 
communications to perpetrate a "scheme and artifice to defraud," in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 
1343. 
It appears obvious that Petitioner was "directly and proximately" harmed by these crimes, 
thereby making her a victim under the CVRA. It should be emphasized that the CVR.A "was 
d1:!signed to be a 'broad and encompassing' statutory victims' bill of rights." United States v.

Degenhardt, 405 F.Supp.2d 1341, 1342 (D. Utah 2005) (quoting 150 Cong. Rec. S4261 (daily 
ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein)). Congress intended the CVRA to dramatically 
rework the federal criminal justice system. In the course of construing the CVRA generously., the 
-~inth Circuit observed: "The criminal justice system has long functioned on the assumption that 
crime victims should behave like good Victorian children -- seen but not heard. The Crime 
Victims' Rights Act sought to change this by making victims independent participants in the 
criminal justice process." Kenna v. US. Dist. Court for CD. Cal., 435 F.3d 1011, 1013 (9th Cir. 
2006). 
Accordingly, because the CVRA is remedial legislation, courts should interpret it 
"liberally to facilitate and accomplish its purposes and intent." 
Elliott Industries Ltd. 
Partnership v. BP America Production Co., 407 F.3d 1091, 1118 (10th Cir. 2005) (noting 
remedial legislation should be "interpreted liberally to facilitate and accomplish its purposes and 
intent"). The CVRA itself suggests this conclusion by requiring that courts must treat crime 
victims with "fairness." United States v. Patkar, 2008 WL 233062 at *3 (D. Haw. 2008) (citing 
United States v. Turner, 367 F.Supp.2d 319,335 (E.D.N.Y. 2005)). 
Not only must the CVRA as a whole be interpreted liberally, but its definition of "crime 
vk:tim" requires a generous construction. After reciting the direct-and-proximate-harm language 
at issue here, one of the Act's two co-sponsors -- Senator Kyl -- explained that "[t]his is an 
intentionally broad definition because all victims of crime deserve to have their rights protected 
.... " 150 Cong. Rec. S10912 (Oct. 9, 2004) (emphasis added). The description of the victim 
definition as "intentionally broad" was in the course of floor colloquy with the other primary 
sponsor of the CVRA and therefore deserves significant weight. See Kenna, 435 F.3d at 1015-16 
(discussing significance of CVRA sponsors= floor statements).

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1-6     Filed 06/13/16     Page 7 of 10
The definition of "crime victims" must thus be construed broadly in favor of Petitioner. 
She obviously qualifies as a "victim" under the CVRA. 
Ill. 
PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO NOTICE OF HER RIGHTS, AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO CONFER WITH THE PROSECUTORS AND 
TO BE TREATED WITH FAIRNESS. 
Because Petitioner is a "victim" under the CVRA, she has certain protected rights under 
the Act. Most important, the Act promises that she will have an opportunity to "confer with the 
attorney for the Government in the case." To date, Petitioner has not been given that right. This 
raises that very real possibility that the Government may negotiate and conclude a plea agreement 
with the Defendant without giving Petitioner her protected rights.2 
Petitioner is entitled to have this conference with prosecutors before any final plea 
agreement is reached. The Fifth Circuit reached exactly this conclusion in a very recent case. In 
In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008), the Government negotiated a plea agreement with the 
well-heeled corporate defendant without conferring with the victims. When the Government's 
failure was challenged in the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the Government had 
indeed violated the CVRA. The Fifth Circuit observed: "In passing the [CVRA], Congress 
made the policy decision-which we are bound to enforce-that the victims have a right to infonn 
the plea negotiation process by conferring with prosecutors before a plea agreement is reached." 
Id. at 394. 
This Court is obligated to protect the rights of Petitioner. The CVRA directs that "[i]n 
any court proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the 
On information and belief, roughly the same crimes were committed against several other young femalc~s. These 
victims, too, are in danger of losing their right to confer under the CVRA.

....,. 
crime victim is afforded the rights described in [the CVRA]." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(l). The 
CVRA also confers on crime victims the right to "assert the rights described in [the CVRA]." 18 
U.S.C. § 3771(d)(l). Therefore, this Court has its own independent obligation to intercede and 
ensure that the Government respects the rights of Petitioner under the CVRA. 
CONCLUSION 
The Petitioner requests the intervention of this Court to ensure that her rights are 
respected and accorded, as promised in the Crime Victims' Rights Act.

Attorney for Bradley J. Edwards 
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
In re:  SUBPOENA TO BRADLEY J. 
EDWARDS 
Underlying case: 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, Plaintiff 
v.  
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, Defendant 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y.) 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS’ MOTION TO 
QUASH SUBPOENA OR, IN THE 
ALTERNATIVE, FOR A PROTECTIVE 
ORDER AND INCORPORATED 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Case No.  
Subpoena respondent Bradley J. Edwards, a non-party and attorney for the Plaintiff in the 
Giuffre v. Maxwell action, hereby moves to quash the subpoena served on him by Ghislaine 
Maxwell, the Defendant in the Giuffre v. Maxwell action.   
BASIS FOR RELIEF REQUESTED 
Edwards requests that this Court quash the subpoena issued by Defendant Maxwell to 
Edwards or, in the alternative, enter a protective order barring Maxwell from enforcing the 
subpoena.  The bases for Edwards’ motion, which are set forth more fully in the Memorandum of 
Legal Authority below, are as follows: 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 1 of 21

1) 
The subpoena subjects Edwards to undue burden. 
2) 
The information sought in the subpoena is not reasonably calculated to lead to the  
discovery of admissible evidence. 
3) 
Maxwell has the ability to obtain the information sought in the subpoena directly  
from other persons, including (for example) a person with whom she has a joint 
defense agreement.   
4) 
Maxwell has failed her duty, imposed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  
45(c)(1), to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on Edwards. 
5) 
Maxwell seeks privileged information about Edwards’ confidential attorney-client  
and work-product protected communications. 
6) 
Maxwell has not provided the required notice of subpoena for a nonparty under  
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(a)(4). 
STATEMENT OF FACTS SUPPORTING REQUEST FOR RELIEF 
1. 
Edwards is a Florida attorney who maintains his office in Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida.     
2. 
Edwards is a counsel of record for Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre in the case Giuffre 
v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y.).  Other counsel of record include: Sigrid S. 
McCawley and Meredith Schulz of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, LLP (Ft. Lauderdale, Florida), and 
Paul G. Cassell who maintains his law office at the University of Utah (Salt Lake City, Utah).     
3. 
In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Ms. Giuffre alleges that she was defamed by Defendant 
Maxwell when Maxwell called her a “liar” and otherwise challenged the accuracy of Ms. 
Giuffre’s statements that Maxwell was involved in her sexual abuse.  See Declaration of Bradley 
J. Edwards in Support of Edwards’ Motion to Quash (“Edwards Decl.”), Exhibit 1 (Giuffre v. 
Maxwell Complaint). 
4. 
Edwards has received a subpoena to produce numerous documents in the Giuffre 
v. Maxwell case.  Edwards Decl., Ex. 2. Edwards is not a party to that case.   
5. 
The subpoena requests the production of fourteen different categories of 
documents (referred to in this motion as RFPs 1 through 20).  Under the subpoena, RFPs #1 and 
#2 are all documents produced by Edwards or received by Edwards in a case styled Edwards and 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 2 of 21

Cassell v. Dershowitz, 15-000072 (17th Judicial District, Broward County, Florida).  The 
production at issue in that case spanned several thousand pages of documents.  Edwards Decl., 
Ex. 3 at ¶ 5.  Production from Dershowitz came in several different stages, and various 
productions involved assertions of privilege.  Production to Dershowitz of documents and receipt 
of documents in that case was handled by Edwards’ attorney.  Id.  While Edwards has many of 
the documents that were produced or received, he did not comprehensively maintain records of 
the exact documents produced or received, because he was the Plaintiff, and not the attorney in 
that case.  Id.   
6. 
While Defendant Maxwell has subpoenaed Edwards to produce various 
documents associated with the Dershowitz case, she is in a common interest agreement with 
Dershowitz.  See Edwards Decl., Ex. 4 at 471, 507-31, particularly at 524-28 (excerpts from 
deposition of Alan Dershowitz during which, on instructions from Mr. Epstein’s attorney Mr. 
Indyke, Dershowitz refuses to answer deposition questions about Maxwell based on a common 
interest agreement with her).  When Maxwell was asked to produce documents related to any 
joint defense agreement entered into between her and Dershowitz, she responded: “Ms. Maxwell 
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents or information protected by the 
attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, the common interest privilege or any other 
applicable privilege.  Subject to and without waiver of the foregoing, Defendant has been unable 
to locate any documents responsive to this Request.”  Edwards Decl., Ex. 5 at 8. 
7. 
RFP’s #3, #4, and #5 seek to force Edwards to produce voluminous documents in 
the case known as Epstein v. Edwards et al., Case No. 50-20009 CA 04080XXXXMBAG (15th 
Jud. Cir., West Palm Beach, Florida).   Edwards Decl. at ¶ 12.  Production of those documents 
would be very burdensome, because Edwards’ files are not organized to differentiate the 
production in that case from materials associated with other cases.  Id.  Additionally, Edwards 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 3 of 21

was a party Plaintiff and not the attorney of record in that case as well.  Incidentally, Defendant 
Maxwell is also in a joint defense agreement with the other party in the case, Jeffrey Epstein.  Id. 
at ¶ 13.   
8. 
RFP #6 in the subpoena seeks discovery from the case Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 
v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736-MARRA (S.D. Fla.).  Edwards is an attorney in that case, 
along with co-counsel Paul G. Cassell.  Edwards and Cassell filed the case in July of 2008 and 
have been handling the matter ever since on a pro bono basis.  Edwards Decl. Ex. ¶ 14.  The case 
currently has 393 docket entries.   
9. 
Edwards and Cassell represent Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 in the action, brought 
under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771.  This CVRA action alleges that 
the Government negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein, and 
then concealed the agreement from Epstein’s victims, including Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and 
other similarly situated victims.  See Edwards Decl., Ex. 5 (complaint in Jane Doe 1 v. United 
States).  Edwards and Cassell filed motion to join on behalf of Jane Doe 3 (Ms. Giuffre) and Jane 
Doe 4, which was denied.   
10. 
Over the course of the nearly eight years of litigation in the case, the Government 
has produced in discovery correspondence between attorneys for Jeffrey Epstein and itself (i.e., 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and other components of the 
Justice Department).  That correspondence has been produced in multiple steps and amounts to 
hundreds of pages (if not thousands of pages) of material.  See Edwards Decl. at ¶ 15.   
11. 
On February 10, 2016, Edwards and Cassell filed a sixty-page motion for 
summary judgment that included 140 exhibits.  DE 361 & 362, No. 9:08-cv-80736-MARRA.  
Those exhibits are not under seal.

Apart from correspondence in the public case file, the Discovery produced by the 
Government in the Jane Doe 1 v. United States case is currently subject to a protective order.  
Does v. United States, DE 326 at 4. 
13. 
RFP #7 seeks engagement letters between Edwards and Ms. Giuffre.  Such 
materials can be, and have been, sought and produced in the Giuffre v. Maxwell action.  Edwards 
Decl. at ¶ 16.   
14. 
RPFs #8 and #9 seek joint defense agreements to which Ms. Giuffre is a party.  
These documents can be, and have been, sought and produced in the Giuffre v. Maxwell action.  
Edwards Decl. at ¶ 17.   
15. 
RFPs #10 and #11 seek documents relating to Edwards’ work on behalf of a 
Florida corporation, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc. (“VRS”).   Maxwell has already filed a 
subpoena to VRS for materials that might be relevant to this case.  Edwards Decl., Ex. 3 (VRS 
subpoena).  Moreover, any work Edwards would have done for the corporation would have been 
as an attorney and would have been protected by the attorney-client privilege.  Edwards Decl. at 
¶ 18. 
16. 
RFP #11 seeks any disclosures made to Edwards by Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., 
and “any person associated with Victims Refuse Silence, Inc.”  It appears to be undisputed that 
Ms. Giuffre is a person associated with VRS, and she is also a client of Edwards.  Edwards Decl. 
at ¶ 19. 
17. 
RFP #12 seeks documents relating “to any disclosures made by You by Virginia 
Roberts Giuffre, or consents provided to You by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, pursuant to any of the 
Florida Rules of Professional Conduct.”  Any such materials would involve confidential 
attorney-client communications.  Edwards Decl. at ¶ 20. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 5 of 21

18. 
RFP #13 seeks to have Edwards produce documents “concerning any 
investigation by any law enforcement agency that refer to Ghislaine Maxwell.”  Such documents 
can be, and have been, sought in the Giuffre v. Maxwell action.  Counsel for Ms. Giuffre have 
asserted privilege over the documents and submitted those documents for in camera review by 
Judge Sweet. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, DE 128 at 1 (“Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre hereby notifies the 
Defendant of her submission of law enforcement materials to the Honorable Judge Robert W. 
Sweet for in camera review . . . .”).  That review is on-going at this time. 
19. 
RFP #15 seeks all documents with any “journalist, reporter, producer, author, 
director, or any employee or agent of the same” which “relate or refer to Virginia Giuffre, 
Ghislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.” Edwards has been working on the CVRA case, which 
“relates” to Epstein since July 2008.  Edwards Decl. at ¶ 21.  During that nearly eight year period 
of time, he has received approximately 200,000 emails and sent approximately 80,000 emails.  
Id. at ¶ 22.  It would be significantly burdensome for Edwards to have to search through those 
emails to try to identify communications with “journalists.” 
MEMORANDUM OF LEGAL AUTHORITY 
THE SUBPOENA SUBJECTS EDWADS TO AN UNDUE BURDEN AND SHOULD BE 
QUASHED OR A PROTECTIVE ORDER SHOULD BE ENTERED 
Defendant Maxwell has served a subpoena on Edwards as an attorney for the party 
against whom she is litigating.  The subpoena appears to be designed not to secure important 
information in the case but rather to unduly burden the Edwards with the obligation to respond.  
Much, if not all, of the information can be secured from other sources and in other ways.  And 
most, if not all of the remaining material, is protected by attorney-client or work-product 
protection.  Accordingly, the subpoena should be quashed or, in the alternative, a protective 
order should be entered.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 6 of 21

I.  The Legal Standards  
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 sets out the procedures for serving and responding to 
subpoenas.  For a subpoena requiring the production of documents, Rule 45 requires that “notice 
and a copy of the subpoena must be served on each party” before service on the person to whom 
it is directed.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(4).1  Rule 45 also requires that a party issuing a subpoena 
“must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to 
the subpoena.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(1).  The Rule further states that “[t]he issuing court must 
enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction — which may include lost earnings and 
reasonable attorney's fees — on a party or attorney who fails to comply.”  Id.  The Rule also 
states that, upon a timely motion, “the issuing court must quash or modify a subpoena that . . . 
subjects a person to undue burden.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3)(A)(iv). 
“Courts are required to balance the need for discovery against the burden imposed on the 
person ordered to produce documents, and the status of a person as a non-party is a factor that 
weighs against disclosure.”  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Kirk’s Tire & Auto Servicenter, 211 
F.R.D. 658, 662-663 (D. Kan. 2003).  Accord Amini Innovation Corp. v. McFerran Home 
Furnishings, Inc., 300 F.R.D. 406, 409 (C.D. Cal. 2014).  See also Dart Industries Co., Inc. v. 
Westwood Chemical Co., 649 F.2d 646 (9th Cir.1980) (“While discovery is a valuable right and 
should not be unnecessarily restricted, the ‘necessary’ restriction may be broader when a non-
party is the target of discovery.”); Katz v. Batavia Marine & Sporting Supplies, Inc., 984 F.2d 
422, 424 (Fed.Cir.1993) (“Although Rule 26(b) applies equally to discovery of nonparties, the 
fact of nonparty status may be considered by the court in weighing the burdens imposed in the 
circumstances.”);  Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 228 F.R.D. 111, 113 
Defendant Maxwell has failed to provide any such notice of service to Giuffre.  Under the local rules, this makes 
the service of the subpoena on Cassell technically defective.  See FRCP 45-1 (forbidding service of a subpoena on a 
non-party requiring production of documents until four days after the service of the notice f the subpoena).   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 7 of 21

(D. Conn. 2005) (“An evaluation of undue burden requires the court to weigh the burden to the 
subpoenaed party against the value of the information to the serving party.”)  Indeed, “concern 
for the unwanted burden thrust upon non-parties is a factor entitled to special weight in 
evaluating the balance of competing needs” in a Rule 45 inquiry.  Amini Innovation Corp. v. 
McFerran Home Furnishings, Inc., 300 F.R.D. 406, 409 (C.D. Cal. 2014).  “Whether a subpoena 
imposes an ‘undue burden’ depends on such factors as relevance, the need of the party for the 
documents, the breadth of the document request, the time period covered by it, the particularity 
with which the documents are described and the burden imposed.”  Travelers, 228 F.R.D. at 113 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  “The determination of issues of burden and reasonableness is 
committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.”  Id. 
In addition, of particular importance here, numerous federal district courts have 
determined that a subpoena to a non-party seeking the production of documents constitutes an 
“undue burden” on the subpoena respondent when the issuer of the subpoena can obtain (or 
already has obtained) the documents or testimony from a party to the action.  See Moon v. SCP 
Pool Corp., 232 F.R.D. 633 (C.D. Cal. 2005); Travelers, 228 F.R.D. at 113-114; Jones v. 
Hirschfeld, 219 F.R.D. 71, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); Amini Innovation Corp. v. McFerran Home 
Furnishings, Inc., 300 F.R.D. 406, 410 (C.D. Cal. 2014); Precourt v. Fairbank Reconstruction 
Corp., 280 F.R.D. 462, 467 (D.S.D.2011) (“If the party seeking information can easily obtain the 
same information without burdening the non-party, the court will quash the subpoena.”); Brown 
v. City of Syracuse, 648 F.Supp.2d 461, 466 (N.D.N.Y.2009) (when balancing hardships between 
requesting party and non-party, court should consider whether there are other sources for 
obtaining the material); Arthrex, Inc. v. Parcus Medical, LLC, 2011 WL 6415540, at *6 
(S.D.Ind. Dec. 21, 2011) (“A party’s ability to obtain documents from a source with which it is 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 8 of 21
-

litigating is a good reason to forbid it from burdening a non-party with production of those same 
requests.”). 
Moreover, district courts have also ruled that a subpoena to a non-party represents an 
“undue burden” if the information sought is not relevant pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 26(b)(1).  See Moon v. SCP Pool Corp., 232 F.R.D. 633 (C.D. Cal. 2005); Jones v. 
Hirshfeld, 219 F.R.D. 71 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).  “Although irrelevance is not among the litany of 
enumerated reasons for quashing a subpoena found in Rule 45, courts have incorporated 
relevance as a factor when determining motions to quash a subpoena.”  Moon, 232 F.R.D. at 637.  
“[A] court has discretion to circumscribe discovery even of relevant evidence by making ‘any 
order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, 
oppression, or undue burden or expense.’”  Jones, 219 F.R.D. at 74 (citing Herbert v. Lando, 441 
U.S. 153, 177 (1979)). 
II. 
The Court Should Quash the Subpoena to Edwards. 
RFPs #1 and #2 Should be Quashed.  
RFPs #1 and #2 ask Edwards to produce documents that were produced by Dershowitz 
(or to Dershowitz) in the Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz litigation.  The Court will notice 
immediately that, in seeking Dershowitz documents, Defendant Maxwell has not asked 
Dershowitz to provide them.  Her failure to seek these documents directly from Dershowitz is all 
the more puzzling because she has been working closely with Dershowitz for some time.  In 
particular, during the Dershowitz litigation, an attorney for Dershowitz blocked discovery into 
matters known by Dershowitz under a “common interest agreement” that was in place and 
extended between Dershowitz, Epstein, and Maxwell.  See Edwards Decl., Ex. 4 esp. pp. 523-27 
(excerpts from deposition of Alan Dershowitz).  In light of the fact that Maxwell and Dershowitz 
have a close working relationship, it is unduly burdensome that Maxwell seeks these items not 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 9 of 21

from her ally but from attorneys for her legal adversary.  As in the Jones case cited above, it 
appears that Maxwell’s motivation for issuing the subpoena and seeking discovery from Edwards 
is “merely for the sake” of conducting further discovery that will burden Edwards, most if not all 
of which is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in the 
Maxwell case.  Jones, 219 F.R.D. at 78. 
In addition, Edwards was a party to the Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz litigation, and 
was represented by outside lead counsel.  Consistent with the behavior of nearly every litigant, 
Edwards did not make it a point to precisely catalogue each and every document that was being 
received or produced.  See Edwards Decl. at ¶ 11. Similarly, Edwards provided materials to his 
attorney who, in turn, selected which materials were responsive to Dershowitz’s discovery 
request.  Id.  In such circumstances, it would be an undue burden to force Edwards to confer with 
his attorney to reconstruct precisely what materials were produced and received in the litigation.  
Dershowitz is in a common interest agreement relationship with Maxwell, therefore, it will be 
much easier for him to sort out any concerns about what was or was not produced than it would 
be for Edwards. 
RFPs #3, #4, and #5 Should Be Quashed. 
RFPs #3, #4, and #5 seek to force Edwards to produce various discovery materials 
associated with the case Epstein v. Edwards, Case No. 50-2009 CA 040800XXXXMBAG (15th 
Judicial Cir., West Palm Beach, Florida).  That case has been in litigation for seven years, 
Edwards Decl. at ¶ 12, and a substantial number of documents are involved.  Many of the 
subjects in the case overlap with subjects over other litigation, including the on-going Jane Doe 
and Jane Doe 2 v. United States case and the now-closed Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz 
case.  Id.  Because of this overlap, and because Edwards was a party to that litigation and not the 
lawyer, Edwards has not maintained a separate file for the Epstein v. Edwards case.  Id.  It would 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 10 of 21

not only be unduly burdensome, but it would be impossible to try and identify which discovery 
materials relate only to the Epstein v. Edwards case.  Id.  
Moreover, rather than burden Edwards with the need to sort through his various files on 
Epstein-related cases, Defendant Maxwell has a straightforward way to obtain materials 
concerning the Epstein v. Edwards case.  She is currently in a joint defense agreement with her 
former boyfriend and close associate, Jeffrey Epstein.  Edwards Decl. at ¶ 13.  It would 
obviously be much easier for Defendant Maxwell to obtain the materials in question from 
Epstein or one of his dozen attorneys, since any production of materials to her will be under the 
joint defense agreement and thus not run any risk of waiver of privilege or protections.  
Moreover, Epstein is a billionaire who has vast wealth, represented by many lawyers,2 and 
presumably is well-situated to help provide materials to defendant Maxwell.  In light of these 
facts, the clear inference is that Maxwell has chosen to subpoena Edwards to produce these 
materials, because it will burden him and make it more difficult for him to represent his client, 
Ms. Giuffre, in her lawsuit against Maxwell.  The Court should not approve such tactical 
targeting of opposing counsel for burdensome subpoenas. 
RFP #6 Should be Quashed. 
The subpoena also asks Edwards produce documents provided in discovery from the case 
of Jane Does #1 et al. v. United States (S.D. Fla.) – i.e., correspondence between Epstein’s 
defense attorneys and the Government concerning the plea arrangement to be struck between the 
two.  This request involves a substantial number of documents (Edwards Decl., Ex. 3 at ¶ 6-7) 
and should be quashed as well. 
For confirmation of this point, the Court need only look at the counsel of record listings for Epstein in the CVRA 
case and the Epstein v. Edwards case.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 11 of 21

The discovery materials Defendant Maxwell seeks are currently under a protective order 
barring further dissemination of the materials.  The order was entered by this Court (Judge 
Marra) in the underlying case.   Does v. United States, DE 326 at 4.  The order allowed Edwards 
and Cassell to identify relevant document and then file them in public pleadings.  But other 
documents provided by the Government in discovery remain under a protective order. 
On February 10, 2016, Edwards and Cassell filed a sixty-page motion for summary 
judgment in the case that included 140 exhibits.  DE 361 & 362, No. 9:08-cv-80736-MARRA.  
That filing is not sealed and makes the most significant parts of the correspondence between 
Epstein and the Government available to the public, including Maxwell.  But any other materials 
remain under Judge Marra’s protective order.  Accordingly, before Edwards could even have the 
option to release the materials that the Government has provided to him as an attorney in the 
case, Defendant Maxwell would have to approach the Court in that case (Judge Marra) and seek 
a modification of the protective order.   
The fact that Defendant Maxwell is trying to obtain documents from Edwards that are 
under protective order orchestrated by her former boyfriend (and current “common interest” 
partner) Epstein only serves to demonstrate why the subpoena to Edwards is harassing.  
Defendant Maxwell could have simply asked Epstein to provide the materials (or, alternatively, 
subpoenaed the materials directly from Epstein).  Epstein’s own materials are not under a 
protective order.  It is only the materials provided to Edwards (and his co-counsel Edwards) 
during discovery that are under the protective order.  Epstein and his attorneys have, of course, 
all the correspondence involving their plea discussions.   
In addition, of course, the Government has all of the correspondence.  The materials at 
issue originated with the Government – which, after Epstein, is the most natural place from 
which to seek production.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 12 of 21

The only apparent reason for seeking these materials from Edwards rather than Epstein 
(or the Government) is to burden Edwards.  Seeking discovery of Edwards “merely for the sake” 
of creating a burden clearly constitutes a grounds for quashing the subpoena.  See Jones, 219 
F.R.D. at 78.  And in considering the burden involved, the Court should consider the fact that 
Edwards has been working on this matter, as one of only two principal attorneys, on a pro bono 
basis for nearly eight years.  Edwards Decl. at ¶¶ 14-15.  Recently, Supreme Court Justice Sonia 
Sotomayer decried the lack of pro bono legal counsel available to provide legal services to those 
unable to afford them.  See, e.g., Tony Mauro, Sotomayor Urges Mandatory Pro Bono for All 
Lawyers, The National L.J., May 17, 2016.3  A pro bono attorney should not be forced to spend 
additional time and resources responding to a burdensome discovery requests for the materials 
that can be more easily collected elsewhere. 
RPFs #8, #9, and #10 Should be Quashed. 
The eighth, ninth, and tenth RFPs seek engagement letters between the Plaintiff in the 
case (Virginia Giuffre) and Edwards as her attorney, as well as joint defense or common interest 
agreements relating to Ms. Giuffre.   Defendant Maxwell can seek – and has sought – production 
of any such documents in the case directly from Ms. Giuffre.  See Edwards Decl., Ex. 3 at ¶¶ 16-
17.  There is no basis for a duplicative request to Ms. Giuffre’s attorney, a non-party to the 
action.   
Moreover, it is somewhat remarkable that Defendant Maxwell believes she is entitled to 
receive any joint defense agreement involving Edwards.  When asked to produce her joint 
defense agreement with Epstein, she objected that she did not have to produce such agreement

because she claimed it was privileged.  See Edwards Decl., Ex. 5 at 7 (responses to requests 6 
and 7).   
Numerous district courts have granted motions to quash subpoenas that seek documents 
or information from a non-party when the information is available from a party.  In Moon, the 
court found that the document requests in the plaintiffs’ subpoena to a non-party “all pertain to 
defendant, who is a party, and, thus, plaintiffs can more easily and inexpensively obtain the 
documents from defendant, rather than from [the nonparty].”  Moon, 232 F.R.D. at 638.  The 
same can be said here, on these RFPs should be quashed. 
RFPs #10 and #11 Should be Quashed. 
The tenth and eleventh document requests seek documents concerning Edwards’ work 
forming or on behalf of Victims Refuse Silence, Inc. (VRS).  This is an organization on which 
Ms. Giuffre serves as a board member.   Here again, Defendant Maxwell has served a subpoena 
on the VRS itself for various records.  See Edwards Decl., Ex. 6.  It is hard to understand what 
relevance any additional documents relating to Edwards could have to the case. 
In addition, the requests seek such things as document relating to “[y]our formation of” 
VRS.  This request would obviously seek work relating to Edwards’ actions as a lawyer for his 
client and thus would be attorney-client protected. See Edwards Decl. at ¶ 18.   
Similarly, the request seeks such things as “disclosures made by You to . . . any person 
associated with VRS.”  Edwards’ client, Ms. Giuffre, is plainly a person “associated with VRS,” 
id. at ¶ 19, so this request seems to ask for all communications between Edwards and his client, 
unrestricted as to time and subject.  Clearly, these requests are overbroad and unduly 
burdensome.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 14 of 21

RFP #12 Should be Quashed.  
The twelfth document request seeks “documents relating to any disclosures made by You 
[to] Virginia Roberts Giuffre, or consents provided to You by Virginia Giuffre, pursuant to any 
of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct.”  Any such materials would involve confidential 
attorney-client communications.  Edwards Decl. at ¶ 15.  But more important, these materials 
would appear to have nothing to do with the lawsuit at hand.  Instead, it appears that counsel for 
Maxwell seek to embark on a fishing expedition regarding opposing counsel’s compliance with 
his ethical obligations to his clients.  Those concerns belong to the client, not to opposing 
counsel.  And they are certainly not relevant to the defamation actions between Ms. Giuffre and 
Ms. Maxwell.  The request should be quashed.4   
RFP #13 Should be Quashed. 
RFP #13 seeks all documents “concerning any investigation by any law enforcement 
agency that refer to Ghislaine Maxwell.”  This issue, too, has been heavily explored in the 
underlying case in the Southern District of New York.  Part of this request appears to be an effort 
by Defendant Maxwell to ferret out the scope of any current, on-going law enforcement 
investigation into Maxwell’s crimes – presumably with an eye to preventing that investigation 
from being successful.  With regard to these documents about a current investigation, Ms. 
Giuffre has asserted a public interest privilege from being forced to disclose that information.   
Documents related to that request have been submitted to Judge Sweet in camera, and he is 
currently evaluating whether to order their production.  See Giuffre v. Maxwell, DE 128 at 1. If 
Judge Sweet refuses to order their production, it is hard to see why Defendant Maxwell should 
be able to do an “end run” around that ruling by seeking the same documents from Edwards.  On 
Aspects of the eleventh request for production also seem to relate to irrelevant legal ethics questions.  For this 
reason as well, RFP #11 should also be quashed. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 15 of 21

the other hand, if Judge Sweet turns over documents the documents about Ms. Giuffre’s 
cooperation with the law enforcement investigation to Defendant Maxwell, it is hard to 
understand why she would need additional documents of the same character from Edwards. 
Other parts of this request are clearly overbroad as they seek information about past law 
enforcement investigations.  For example, the request seeks materials regarding a law 
enforcement agency that “refer” to Ghislaine Maxwell.  The CVRA action involves not only 
Jeffrey Epstein, but also his potential “co-conspirators,” who all apparently received immunity 
under the non-prosecution agreement that was challenged in his case.  All of the documents in 
the CVRA case thus, in some sense, refer to defendant Maxwell.  And, as explained above, apart 
from materials that have been publicly filed, the remaining correspondence is under a protective 
order from Judge Marra.  Here again, defendant Maxwell can far more easily obtain these 
materials from her common interest partner Epstein, since his own personal copies of these 
materials are not under a protective order.  
RFP #15 Should be Quashed.   
RFP #15 seeks documents relating to “any journalist, reporter, producer, author, director, 
or any employee or agent of the same” connected to Virginia Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell, or 
Jeffrey Epstein.  This request is hopelessly overbroad, since the categories of people included 
(e.g., any “author” or “journalist” or “agent of the same”) do not lend themselves to immediate 
and narrow identification.  The request is also unbounded as to time, and thus sweeps in 
materials remote from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case.  For example, Edwards began working on a 
separate pro bono case – Jane Doe 1 and 2 v. United States – nearly eight years ago, in July 
2008.  Edwards Decl. at ¶¶ 14-15.  Defendant Maxwell appears to be seeking media contacts 
related to that case, since anything in that case clearly “relates” to Jeffrey Epstein and the non-
prosecution agreement Epstein was trying to obtain.  Edwards Decl. at ¶ 21.  Since 2008, the 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 16 of 21

CVRA case filed by Cassell and Edwards has attracted broad attention from Congress,5 legal 
scholars,6 as well as the media.7   To answer RFP #15, Edwards would have to review more than 
200,000 emails he sent and received during that time.  See Edwards Decl. at ¶ 22-23.  He would 
then need to determine which of these emails were subject to (for example) work-product 
protection.  The burden imposed on him would clearly be substantial. Id. at ¶ 23.   
The burden imposed on Edwards is an undue burden because Defendant Maxwell has far 
more direct ways to proceed.  Ms. Giuffre, the plaintiff in the underlying action, has been (or 
could have been) questioned extensively about her interactions with the media, both during her 
deposition and through discovery propounded to her.   In light that fact, it is not clear how 
Edwards’ communications have any additional relevance to the Giuffre v. Maxwell lawsuit.  Ms. 
Giuffre has sued Defendant Maxwell because she (Maxwell) made defamatory statements – not 
vice versa.  So it is hard to see even how communications Ms. Giuffre may or may not have had 
with the media would be important to the case, much less how communications her attorney, 
Edwards, would be relevant.   Under the rules, “[u]nless otherwise limited by court order, the 
scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged 
matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense.”  Fed. R. Civ. P.  26(b)(1) (emphasis 
added).  Ms. Maxwell has made no claim against Ms. Giuffre.  And with regard to her defenses, 
the Court can examine her answer to the complaint to see that none of them relate to any 
Responding to the lack of notice given to the victims of the Epstein agreement, Congress recently amended the 
CVRA to insure that in the future crime victims receive notice of any non-prosecution agreement entered into by the 
Government.  See Pub. L. 114-22, Title I, § 113(a), (c)(1), May 29, 2015, 129 Stat. 240, 241 (adding 18 U.S.C. § 
3771(a)(9) to give crime victims “[t]he right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred 
prosecution agreement).    
See generally Paul G. Cassell, Nathanael J. Mitchell & Bradley J. Edwards, Crime Victims’ Rights During 
Criminal Investigations? Applying the Crime Victims’ Rights Act before Criminal Charges are Filed, 104 J. Crim. 
L. & Criminology 59 (2014).

interactions that Edwards may have had with the media.  Giuffre v. Maxwell, DE 54 at 8-10 
(listing Maxwell’s affirmative defenses).   
As noted above, federal district courts have quashed subpoenas that seek irrelevant 
information.  “[C]ourts have incorporated relevance as a [Rule 45] factor when determining 
motions to quash a subpoena,” Moon, 232 F.R.D. at 637, and have “discretion to circumscribe 
discovery even of relevant evidence by making ‘any order which justice requires to protect a 
party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.’” 
Jones, 219 F.R.D. at 74.  District courts, such as in Moon and Jones, have quashed subpoenas 
that seek to obtain information outside the bounds of relevance to claims or defenses in the case.  
The Moon court quashed a subpoena that sought irrelevant information through overbroad 
requests for documents and information.  Moon, 232 F.R.D. at 637-638.  In Moon, the plaintiff’s 
claims related to an import agreement that covered a three-year period.  Id. at 637.  Plaintiff’s 
document requests to the non-party in the subpoena at issue, however, sought documents 
reaching back over a 10-year period and sought information relating to the non-party’s 
commercial business with other non-parties.  The court weighed “the burden to [the non-party 
subpoena recipient] against the value of the information to [the issuer of the subpoena]” and 
found that “the subpoena imposes an ‘undue burden’ on the nonparty.”  Moon, 232 F.R.D. at 
637.   
The Jones court made a similar calculation, quashing a subpoena to take the deposition of 
a non-party upon a finding that the defendant’s subpoena to the non-party sought information 
that “is not relevant to any issue in this case.”  Jones, 219 F.R.D. at 77.  In Jones, the plaintiff 
sought enforcement of an agreement with the defendant and the defendant argued that the 
plaintiff repudiated the agreement, id. at 72-74, and issued the subpoena to Mr. Clinton who, the 
defendant argued, had insisted that the plaintiff repudiate the agreement or had an understanding 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 18 of 21

that she had done so, id. at 77.  The court quashed the subpoena, finding that there was no 
allegation that Mr. Clinton had any non-privileged information regarding whether or not the 
plaintiff in fact did repudiate the agreement, which was the relevant issue in the matter.  Id. 
As in the Moon and Jones cases, defendant Maxwell has propounded an extraordinarily 
broad subpoena that imposes a significant burden on Edwards that ultimately seeks information 
that is not relevant to any claims or defenses in this matter.  The Subpoena should be quashed.  
RFPs #19 and #20 
Requests number 19 and number 20 seek “[a]ny letter or communication to [or from] you 
to any witness or prospective witness in Giuffre v. Maxwell.”  Both sides have identified 
numerous “prospective witnesses” in the case, probably totaling more than one hundred persons.  
Moreover, persons who have been identified as potential witnesses in the case include not only 
Mr. Edwards’ client, Ms. Giuffre, but also other persons with whom he has interacted, such as 
his co-counsel.  Edwards Decl. at ¶ 24.  Most important, however, like the other requests that the 
subpoena makes, this request appears to be exclusively designed to burden Mr. Edwards.  
Defendant Maxwell is certainly free to depose any witness about anything that may or may not 
have been said to the witness by any person – including Mr. Edwards.  There is no good reason 
to force Mr. Edwards to have to produce such materials.   
III. 
Edwards Reserves the Right to Raise Other Objections. 
For all the reasons just explained, the Court should quash the subpoena issued to Edwards 
in its entirety under Fed. R. Civ. P 45(c)(3)(A)(iv).8  If for any reason the Court finds that some 
or all of the subpoena survives this motion to quash, Edwards would then respectfully request 
any opportunity to raise such other general and specific objections to the subpoena as may be 
Without waiving any protections that might otherwise exist (including attorney-client privilege or work-product 
protection), Cassell does not believe that he possesses any documents responsive to RFP #10, #12, and #13.  Cassell 
does not believe that he possesses any documents responsive to RFP #14, if it is understood to be seeking “original” 
photographs rather than those that have previously been reprinted.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 1     Filed 06/13/16     Page 19 of 21

appropriate, including attorney-client privilege, work-product protections, public interest 
privilege and common-interest privilege.  For the aforementioned reasons, it is wholly 
inappropriate for counsel to utilize this subpoena to virtually request the entirety of Edwards’ 
volume of case files relating to Jeffrey Epstein, Alan Dershowitz, or the investigation into co-
conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein.  Additionally, it is entirely unreasonable to provide a mere ten 
days to respond to a subpoena of such magnitude.  In the event that the Court does not quash the 
subpoena in its entirety, non-party Edwards requests a reasonable amount of time to respond to 
any request that survives this motion.   
CONCLUSION 
For the forgoing reasons, Edwards respectfully requests that this Court grant the motion 
to quash the Subpoena commanding the production of documents by Edwards.  In the alternative, 
Edwards requests that this Court enter a protective order barring enforcement of Maxwell’s 
Subpoena.

NOTICE OF RELATED ACTION 
Pursuant to S.D. Fla. L.R. 3.8, the undersigned files this Notice of Related Action.   
Ghislaine Maxwell, the Defendant in the underlying action, issued two subpoenas on 
non-parties in the Southern District of Florida: Victims Refused Silence, Inc. and Bradley J. 
Edwards.  These subpoenas were both issued for document production related to Giuffre v. 
Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-07433-RWS, in the District Court for the Southern District of New 
York. 
Non-party Victims Refuse Silence, Inc. has filed a Motion to Quash which is currently 
pending in the Southern District of Florida before Judge Gayles, Case No. 0:16-mc-61261- DPG. 
Non-Party Bradley J. Edwards has filed a Motion to Quash, which is currently pending in 
the Southern District of Florida before Judge Martinez, Case No. 0:16-mc-61262-JEM. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 4     Filed 06/27/16     Page 1 of 3

These cases are related in that they seek documents related the same underlying litigation.  
The information sought in each subpoena differs, but many of the background facts in the 
underlying litigation relevant to the resolution of the motions to quash overlap.

In re: SUBPOENA TO BRADLEY J. 
EDWARDS  
Underlying case: 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, Plaintiff 
v. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, Defendant 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y.) 
RESPONSE OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL 
TO BRADLEY J. EDWARDS’ MOTION 
TO QUASH SUBPOENA, OR IN THE 
ALTERINATIVE, FOR A PROTECTIVE 
ORDER 
Case Number 0:16-mc-61262-JEM 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s files this response to non-party Bradley J. Edwards 
Motion to Quash Subpoena or, in the alternative, for a protective Order, and states as follows: 
BACKGROUND FACTS RELEVANT TO THE SUBPOENA 
The Southern District of New York case in which the Subpoena was issued arises directly 
from a pleading filed in a case by non-party Bradley Edwards (“Edwards”) and his co-counsel 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 1 of 19

Paul Cassell (“Cassell”) on behalf of the Plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre (“Plaintiff” or Ms. Giuffre”).  
As explained by Edwards, he and Cassell represented the Plaintiff in this action in a separate 
case pending in the Southern District of Florida, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 v. United States, 
No9:08-cv-80736-MARRA (S.D. Fl.) (the “CVRA” Case).  It is a pleading filed in the CVRA 
case that spurred the instant litigation, as well as a contention litigation between Edwards and 
Cassell and Alan Dershowitz. 
The CVRA Case 
In the CVRA Case, Edwards (starting in 2011) and Cassell (starting in May 2014) 
represented Plaintiff in attempting to obtain joinder in the pending action.  On December 30, 
2014, Edwards and Cassell filed a pleading titled "Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's Motion 
Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action" in the CVRA Case. Pagliuca Decl., Ex. A (the 
"Joinder Motion").  The Joinder Motion contained a number of allegations on behalf of “Jane 
Doe # 3,” the Plaintiff in this case.  The allegations include that “Epstein also sexually trafficked 
the then-minor Jane Doe [#3], making her available for sex to politically-connected and 
financially-powerful people."  The "politically-connected and financially powerful people" 
identified by Edwards and Cassell by name in the Joinder Motion as having had sexual relations 
with Jane Doe #3 were Prince Andrew, Duke of York ("Prince Andrew"),  Ms. Maxwell, Jean 
Luc Brunel ("Brunel") and Alan Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”). Id. at 3-6.1 
The judge in the CVRA case subsequently struck these allegations, stating “[a]t this juncture in the 
proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary to the determination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 
should be permitted to join Petitioners’ claim that the Government violated their rights under the 
CVRA. The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are 
immaterial and impertinent to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein and the 
Government owed them CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve non-parties who 
are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.”  See Pagliuca 
Decl., Ex. C. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 2 of 19

Following the Joinder Motion, Dershowitz made numerous public appearances in which 
he vigorously denied the allegations, stating that Edwards and Cassell “are lying deliberately,” 
and that if Edwards and Cassell “had just done an hours’ worth of work, they would have seen 
she [Giuffre] is lying through her teeth.”  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. B at 9-10. 
Ms. Maxwell’s denial and Giuffre v. Maxwell 
Ms. Maxwell responded to the contents of Joinder Motion filed by Edwards and Cassell 
in a statement written by her press agent stating: 
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public 
figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms. Roberts [the Plaintiff] that 
Alan Dershowitz is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he denies. 
Ms. Roberts’s claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not 
publicized as news, as they are defamatory. 
See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. D. 
Almost ten months later, Ms. Giuffre sued Ms. Maxwell based on this simple denial, 
claiming that denial of the claims made concerning her and other prominent figures such as Alan 
Dershowitz constituted defamation because she had been called a “liar” by Ms. Maxwell. 
Epstein v. Edwards, et. al, 2009 CAD408-MB 
In 2009 Mr. Epstein sued Mr. Edwards and his former law partner, Scott Rothstein. 
Epstein accused Edwards in participating in a Ponzi scheme in which Edwards and Rothstein 
manufactured sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and solicited investors to purchase a 
position of the project recovery for the false claims.  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. Q.  This litigation is 
apparently ongoing. 
The Dershowitz Case 
In the interim, on January 6, 2015, Edwards and Cassell initiated litigation against 
Dershowitz - the Dershowitz Case.  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. E. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 3 of 19

In the Dershowitz Case, Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation claiming 
that Dershowitz’s public statements – that they and their client were lying and that they failed to 
investigate their client’s claims – were false. The Complaint by Edwards and Cassell alleged that 
“[i]mmediately following the filing of what Dershowitz knew to be an entirely proper and well-
founded pleading, Dershowitz initiated a massive public media assault on the reputation and 
character of Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell accusing them of intentionally lying in their 
filing, of having leveled knowingly false accusations against Dershowitz without ever 
conducting any investigation of the credibility of the accusations, and of having acted unethically 
to the extent that their willful misconduct warranted and required disbarment.”  Pagliuca Decl., 
Ex. E, ¶ 17. 
Edwards and Cassell claimed Dershowitz’s statements that “Edwards and Cassell failed 
to minimally investigate the allegations advanced on behalf of their client [Virginia Giuffre] and 
even that they sat down with her to contrive the allegations” were false. Pagliuca Decl., Ex. B at 
9.  Notably, Ms. Giuffre has never sued Dershowitz for defamation despite the fact that 
Dershowitz went on multiple national television programs and conducted interviews with 
national publications calling Ms. Giuffre a “serial liar.” 
Beginning in the middle of 2014, prior to the Joinder Motion and the Dershowitz Case, 
Edwards, Cassell and David Boies represented Plaintiff “investigation into potential legal 
actions.”  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. F, ¶ 3f. 
Throughout the course of the Dershowitz litigation, and despite claiming to be counsel to 
Plaintiff in the CVRA case and in this case, Plaintiff, Edwards and Cassell (among others) were 
parties to a joint defense agreement relating to the Dershowitz Case.  Pagliuca Decl., Ex. G. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 4 of 19

On or about April 8, 2016, Edwards and Cassell settled their case with Dershowitz.  In a 
joint press release, Edwards and Cassell stated “Edwards and Cassell maintain that they filed 
their client's allegations in good faith and performed the necessary due diligence to do so, and 
have produced documents detailing those efforts.”  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. O, p.1.  The press 
release continues in stating that it was a “mistake” to have filed sexual misconduct allegations 
against Dershowitz citing, among other things, “the records and other documents produced by 
the parties.”  Id. at 2. 
After the settlement agreement was finalized and the press release issued, Edwards and 
Cassell moved the Court in this case to permit them to appear as counsel on behalf of Ms. 
Giuffre.  The Court permitted their appearance as counsel of record, but only on the condition 
that they certify that the Dershowitz litigation had been fully resolved and that they were not 
parties to any action related to the allegations in the Joinder Motion. 
ARGUMENT AND MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
“[T]he burden of persuasion in a motion to quash a subpoena issued in the course of civil 
litigation is borne by the movant.” United States v. Int'l Bus. Machines Corp., 83 F.R.D. 97, 104 
(S.D.N.Y. 1979).  “A party contending that a subpoena should be quashed pursuant to Rule 45(c) 
(3)(A)(iv) must demonstrate that compliance with the subpoena would be unduly burdensome.”  
Bridgeport Music Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc., No. 05CIV.6430(VM)(JCF), 2007 WL 
4410405, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 2007). Edwards has failed to meet this burden.2 
Edwards lists six “reasons” he believes the subpoena should be quashed.  Items 2) and 3) are not recognized 
objections to a F.R.Civ.P 45 subpoena. Item 4 is factually wrong: the subpoena is returnable within 100 miles of 
where Mr. Edwards works and lives, indeed, it is the same building in which Mr. Edwards has taken numerous 
depositions in connection with this case.  Item 6 is also false. Ms. Maxwell emailed copies of the subpoenas to all 
counsel of record on May 20, 2016. See, Pagliuca Decl. Ex. R. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 5 of 19

I. 
There is no Undue Burden 
Edwards’ primary argument is that he should be protected from production of key 
relevant information in this case because he would somehow be “unduly burdened” by having to 
produce relevant information.  This is simply an incredible claim.  First, Edwards’ and his co-
counsel Edwards have directly inserted themselves into this and the surrounding matters.  They 
drafted and filed the improper pleading containing the salacious and unnecessary allegations that 
prompted Ms. Maxwell’s simple denial.  The pleading also prompted Dershowitz’ wide spread 
media campaign calling Ms. Giuffre a liar and Edwards and Cassell unethical and deserving of 
disbarment.  The Court in the CVRA case struck the allegations because they were both 
unnecessary and improper.  Edwards and Cassell could have simply chosen to draft a proper 
pleading, leaving out the sensational allegations, and none of this subsequent litigation would 
have occurred.  In light of certain actions (like the formation of Victim Refuse Silence) and dates 
of representation regarding “potential legal action” disclosed in this case, it appears that 
engendering litigation was the goal of the improper filing.  If Plaintiff was called a liar by those 
accused, a new case for defamation might arise.  Since any civil claims Ms. Giuffre might have 
had were time barred or had been settled, creation of a new claims was the only way for Plaintiff 
and her attorneys to attempt to reopen prosecution and discovery regarding events allegedly 
occurring over fifteen years ago.  Edwards and Cassell did not just insert themselves into this 
case, they created it on purpose.   
Edwards and Cassell then took the affirmative action of suing Dershowitz, again inserting 
themselves into the middle of these related actions.  Edwards and Cassell now admit it was a 
“mistake” to make the allegations against Dershowitz based on documents produced by both 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 6 of 19

sides in discovery.  Having taken the voluntary action of initiating litigation, any burden imposed 
was brought on by Edwards’  own affirmative actions. 
Edwards also claims that as a non-party, he should not be required to provide information 
that is available from a party to the litigation because such production is burdensome.  Edwards 
is one of many of Plaintiff’s named counsel in this matter.  The information sought, however, is 
not information that is available to Ms. Giuffre (except via her joint defense agreement with 
Edwards and Cassell) and it is also not available to Ms. Maxwell.  Moreover, Edwards’ status as 
a “non-party” carries little weight here.  As Plaintiff’s current attorney and her attorney in 
multiple related proceedings and potential litigations, “it was foreseeable that he would be asked 
for records related to services he performed for his former client that is now the subject of 
litigation.” Bridgeport Music Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc., No. 05CIV.6430(VM)(JCF), 2007 
WL 4410405, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 2007); see also Schwartz v. New York City Off-Track 
Betting Corp., Nos. 92 Civ. 1166, 92 Civ. 2768, 1993 WL 42760(S.D.N.Y.1993), (“even if a 
nonparty is [ ] entitled to some enhanced protection against disclosure of confidential 
information and from burdensome discovery requests, [the subject of the subpoena] is so closely 
allied with the [plaintiff] and the information that she possesses is so pertinent that it must be 
disclosed”.) 
Edwards argues that Ms. Maxwell should be required to obtain records from non-party 
Alan Dershowitz, burdening a different non-party rather than Plaintiff’s own counsel.  This 
proposition is not supported by any citation or legal authority.  It is also based on the false 
premise of a joint defense agreement between Dershowitz and Ms. Maxwell.  No such agreement 
exists.  This fact has been stated numerous times by Ms. Maxwell in her discovery responses and 
in multiple pleadings.  The deposition citation from Dershowitz’ deposition only confirms this 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 7 of 19

fact, contrary to Edwards’ extremely misleading statements in the Motion to Quash.  As 
Dershowitz explained, his counsel’s instruction not to answer certain questions relating to Ms. 
Maxwell based on joint defense privilege was based solely on Dershowitz’ status as Jeffrey 
Epstein’s attorney.  As Epstein’s attorney, Dershowitz was required to preserve the joint-defense 
privilege between his client and Ms. Maxwell, who are parties to a common interest agreement.  
Specifically, Dershowitz testified “Q. Are you a party to a common interest agreement with 
Ghislaine Maxwell? . . . . A: My understanding is that I am still Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer. Jeffrey 
Epstein, I understand, has a common interest or joint defense agreement with Ghislaine Maxwell, 
so I have – my understanding is that I am bound by a common agreement.”  Edwards Decl., Ex. 
3, 527:3-17.  The claim that there is a joint defense agreement between Ms. Maxwell and 
Dershowitz in simply false. 
The cases cited by Cassell stand for the proposition that in weighing the burden on a non-
party, the court should consider if the information is available from a party, not from a different non-
party.  There is simply no requirement that a person who may have a common interest agreement 
must seek documents from that alternative non-party source.  Moreover, obtaining the requested 
information from Plaintiff’s own counsel, Edwards, substantially lessens any challenges to 
authenticity.  The subpoena to Edwards is the best, least burdensome, and most cost effective means 
source for obtaining the information. 
Edwards’ claim as “pro-bono” counsel to Plaintiff should not be burdened because of the 
desperate need for bro-bono services in this country is neither relevant nor accurate.  See 
Pagliuca Decl. Ex. H.  Plaintiff is seeking over $30,000,000 in compensatory damages and 
$50,000,000 in punitive damaged in this matter.  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. I.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 8 of 19

II. 
The Information Sought is Highly Relevant 
Edwards’ secondary argument is that the Court should consider the relevance of the 
information sought in reviewing the Rule 45 Motion.  Of course, this is not one of the four listed 
reasons for quashing or modifying a subpoena under Rule 45(3).  But, the information sought is 
highly relevant to this single count defamation claim.  First, the subpoena seeks the documents 
produced in discovery in the Dershowitz Case.  These are the very documents that Edwards and 
Cassell reviewed that led them to conclude it was a “mistake” to have accused Dershowitz of 
sexual misconduct.  One of the most shocking pieces of evidence is a recently discovered voice 
mail from that Sharron Churcher, the tabloid reporter who first published stories about Plaintiff, 
to Paul Cassell in February of 2015.  In that voice recording she states that based on information 
in her files “I think the FBI affidavit is pretty close to perjury.”3  Ms. Maxwell’s statement that 
the accusation against Dershowitz (and other unidentified public figures and world leaders) were 
“obvious lies” is the entire basis of this litigation.  The information leading Edwards and Cassell 
to the same conclusion go beyond mere relevance; they may be dispositive.   
To the extent the relevance argument is raised with respect to specific requests, it will be 
discussed in turn below. 
III. 
Application to Specific Request for Production 
RFP 1& 2 – Requests for documents Produced to or by Edwards in the Dershowitz 
litigation 
Notably, there is no question that these documents are highly relevant.  Edwards’ 
argument that the document can or should be sought from Dershowitz based on an alleged joint 
defense agreement is simply wrong.  As fully addressed above, no such agreement exists. And, 
Since this is a wave file, it cannot be attached an exhibit.  This voicemail recording can be sent to the court via 
email. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 9 of 19

there is no basis for claiming documents must be sought through a different non-party who may 
have the same information.  The subpoena to Edwards, Plaintiff’s own attorney who is actively 
involved in this litigation, is the least burdensome and least expensive source for obtaining the 
information. 
The claims that it would somehow be unduly burdensome to produce records from the 
Dershowitz litigation is spurious.  The requested records are those actually produced in the 
Dershowitz litigation.  Edwards need not cull his records and determine what he produced to his 
counsel that was subsequently produced in the litigation.  He simply needs to pick up the phone 
and ask his attorney in the Dershowitz case (and counsel in this matter), Jack Scarola, to provide 
him a production set of the documents produced in the Dershowitz case, as well as those 
produced to Edwards in the Dershowitz case.  Romano v. SLS Residential Inc., 298 F.R.D. 103, 
111 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (“Since those documents are in the custody of defendants' attorney, they are 
within the control of the client, and hence can be reached by a court order under Rule 37(a).”)  It 
strains logic to claim that this is burdensome in light of modern litigation and technology, where 
the production files in litigation are routinely produced electronically and stored in electronic 
document management systems, requiring a few clicks of a mouse to copy production files.  
There is no basis to quash or modify Requests 1 and 2, and production should be compelled. 
RFP 3, 4, and 5– Documents Produced in the Epstein v. Edwards Litigation 
Again, Edwards claims that locating the responsive documents in an ongoing litigation 
would be “unduly burdensome.”  Edwards offers no factual support for this claim.  Like the other 
litigations in which Edwards is or has been involved, Mr. Edwards can simply request the 
information from his lawyer.  Presumably, this information is in a database that can be easily 
searched and duplicated. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 10 of 19

RFP 6 – Documents Produced in the CRVA Litigation 
First, the existence of a protective order in the CVRA case is irrelevant.  As counsel for 
Ms. Giuffre, Edwards is well aware that there is a blanket protective order in place in this case.  
As the judge in this case has already ruled, production from other cases subject to similar 
protective orders are fully protected by the protective order in place in this case.  The existence 
of a protective order in the CVRA action cannot be the basis for non-production.  See Pagliuca 
Decl., Ex. P. 
Second, Edwards’ argument that the documents produced in the CVRA litigation cannot 
be produced because of a protective order appears to be incorrect.  Edwards cites to a Court order 
denying a motion for protective order, and noting that no party had ever filed a blanket protective 
order that would be consistent with its prior ruling.  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. J.  Going to the 
referenced ruling, the Court entered an Order that would permit for a blanket protective order, 
and asked the parties to modify the previously proposed protective order for consistency with its 
ruling.  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. K.  Reviewing the Proposed Protective Order, there is a 
mechanism for permitting production of confidential materials pursuant to a subpoena, which 
simply required notifying the other parties of the subpoena.  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. L.  Indeed, 
the CVRA docket is replete with motions for and denials of protective orders, and appeals of the 
same.  It seems there is no blanket protective order, and even if there were it contemplates that 
documents can be turned over pursuant to a subpoena. 
Next, Edwards’ claim that Ms. Maxwell can or should seek the documents from a 
different non-party, Jeffery Epstein or the federal government, is also without merit.  First, as 
discussed above, there is no such requirement.  Second, Epstein is not a party to the CVRA case, 
and presumably not in possession of all of the documents produced.  Third, it is not a “natural” 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 11 of 19

place to seek production.  Epstein remains the center of numerous litigation, not the least of 
which is the CVRA litigation.  When subpoenaed, Epstein has, without exception, moved to 
quash and invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. Requesting documents from Epstein would 
likely result in a motion to quash, as well as an inability to authenticate any production.  The 
most natural place to seek these documents is from the Plaintiff’s counsel, who has full access to 
the documents and would presumably be able to agree to authentication in any proceeding. 
RFP 7, 8 and 9 – Engagement Letters and Joint Defense Agreements 
These documents had been requested from Plaintiff prior to the service of the subpoena to 
Edwards, but had not yet been produced.  They were the subject of a motion to compel.  They 
have since been compelled and produced.  As such, Request 7, 8 and 9 are withdrawn to the 
extent the documents have been produced.  To the extent there are any joint defense agreements 
to which Cassell is a party to that have not been produced in this matter, the request stands, and 
the documents should be produced or logged as privileged. 
RFP 10 & 11 – Document Regarding Victims Refuse Silence 
Victims Refuse Silence (“VRS”) is an organization formed by Ms. Giuffre’s counsel on 
December 23, 2014, a mere seven days prior to the Joinder Motion.  It was created in an effort to 
claim that Ms. Giuffre was in the “profession” of advocating for victim’s rights for sexual abuse 
victims.  The point of this organization was the set-up for a defamation case – denial of the sex 
abuse claims in the soon-to-be-filed Joinder Motion might equate to defamation in Ms. Giuffre’s 
newly created profession, thus allowing the pleading (but not proof) of defamation per se.  In 
truth, Ms. Giuffre has not held a job outside the home since 2006. 
The requests seek information held by Edwards that may reveal this chronology.  To the 
extent any communications are privileged, they can be logged as such.  To the extent they are 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 12 of 19

documents that will be produced by Victims Refuse Silence (who Edwards also allegedly 
represents) under the VRS subpoena, Edwards simply needs to state that they are being provided 
from that source.  If, however, there are documents relating to this VRS that are not in VRS’s 
control, such as emails Edwards may have sent to third parties relating to VRS including the idea 
for, or formation, operation or publicity of the organization, the documents are relevant and must 
be produced. 
RFP 12 – Disclosures 
The attorney-client privilege primarily protects “those attorney to client communications 
which would have a tendency to reveal the confidences of the client.” Kenneth S. Broun, 
McCormick on Evidence § 89 (6th ed.2006); see also Restatement (Third) of Law Governing 
Lawyers § 69(d) (2000) (“The attorney-client privilege protects only the content of the 
communication between privileged persons”). “Courts have consistently held that the general 
subject matters of clients' representations are not privileged.” United States v. Legal Servs. for 
N.Y.C., 249 F.3d 1077, 1081 (D.C.Cir.2001); see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 1345 204 F.3d 
516, 520 (4th Cir.2000) (“[T]he identity of the client, the amount of the fee, the identification of 
payment by case file name, and the general purpose of the work performed are usually not 
protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege.”). Courts have also frequently required 
disclosures of the general subject matter of communications without any indication that they 
would implicate the attorney-client privilege or that they raise any conflict with the privilege. 
Clarke v. Am. Commerce Nat'l Bank, 974 F.2d 127, 129–30 (9th Cir.1992). 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 13 of 19

Ms. Maxwell is not seeking any communications that are subject to an attorney client 
privilege.  To the extent Mr. Edwards claims privilege with regard to any responsive document it 
can be logged as such. 
RFP 13 – Investigations by Law Enforcement Agencies 
The issue concerning communications regarding purported currently pending, 
unidentified law enforcement investigations was determined by the Court in the Southern District 
of New York on June 21, 2016, after the Edwards subpoena was issued.  As such, the request as 
it pertains to any presently active, unknown and undisclosed alleged law enforcement 
investigation is withdrawn. 
Edwards correctly notes that information about past investigations that refer to Ms. 
Maxwell have not been produced in this litigation.  The objection to the request for this 
information is highly ironic.  In Ms. Giuffre’s most recent Rules 26 disclosures, she specifically 
identifies these as relevant documents that she plans on using in support of her claim or defense.  
Specifically, the Rule 26 disclosures identify “All files held by the Palm Beach Police Department 
or the Palm Beach State Attorney’s office which are publically available, ” “All evidence obtained by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigations which relate in any way to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine 
Maxwell,” “All 302 statements that relate in any way to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell” and 
“All evidence obtained by the FBI or United States Attorney’s office by or through the criminal 
investigation of Alfredo Rodriguez.”  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. I, p. 16. 
Despite the obligation to produce these documents under Rule 26, Plaintiff has not 
produced the documents.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2) (requiring identification and a copy of all 
documents a party may use to support its claims or defenses).  Ms. Maxwell’s counsel has issued 
repeated and numerous requests for production.  Edwards, one of Ms. Giuffre’s multiple counsel, 
has ready access to these documents, and could easily produce the same.  Plaintiff, Edwards and 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 14 of 19

all of his co-counsel have refused to produce the documents.  Yet, Edwards seeks to quash this 
subpoena, refusing to produce the very document his client claims she plans on relying on to 
support her claims or defenses.4 
This is one of the more absurd examples of how Plaintiff and her attorneys have tied a 
Gordian knot of overlapping litigations, client representations and joint defense agreements 
attempting to strategically leverage one case though another, but refusing to disclose damning 
information based on attorney-client communications or attorney work product in an effort to 
obstruct discovery.  Simply because Edwards may possess this information because of his 
participation in another matter, Plaintiff and her counsel cannot fail to produce the documents or 
attempt to gain a tactical advantage by selectively withholding information, then disclosing it 
when it suits their need. 
There is no claim that this information is privileged. The Protective Order in this case 
covers any concern regarding the protective order in the CVRA case, which does not appear to 
actually exist, or permits production when under subpoena. Plaintiff – Edwards’ client – intends 
to rely on the very information requested.  There is simply no reason to quash this request. 
RFP 155 – Edwards’ Commination with the Press 
Edwards’ objects to the production of communications with the press regarding Ms. 
Giuffre, Ms. Maxwell or Epstein.  The only arguments raised are relevance and alleged undue 
burden. 
There is an argument to be made that these documents are in Plaintiff custody or control because she could demand 
them from her attorney. 
Based on the failure to address requests number 14, 16, 17, and 18 it is presumed that Edwards has no objection to, 
and intends to comply with, the subpoena on these requests. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 15 of 19

The information requested is clearly relevant to this matter.  The core of this case is that 
Ms. Giuffre has, over time, added to and sensationalized her claims, fabricating people, names, 
details and event that never occurred.  These allegations were incorporated into the Joinder 
Motion by Edwards and Cassell.  Ms. Maxwell called some of these claims obvious lie. 
Ms. Giuffre’s motivation was profit.  Her intent was to write a fictional book, selling the 
sensational lies by dropping names of famous, well know, politically powerful, and influential 
individuals at the appropriate times to generate interest in what she hoped to be a bestselling 
novel.  Discovery to date has shown that as part of the ploy to generate interest in Ms. Giuffre’s 
book, Ms. Giuffre and her counsel have strategically employed communications to the press, 
leaking information when they thought it would help generate interest in her book.  See Pagliuca 
Decl., Ex. N.  As discussed above, Cassell himself received a call from a member of the press 
stating she has information in her files showing the FBI affidavit is close to perjury.  Obviously, 
this is a critically relevant communication.  Discovery produced in the underlying litigation 
reflects that Mr. Edwards has had similar conversations with the media. 
As Giuffre’s counsel, any communication he had with the media attempting to 
sensationalize a case about events that allegedly happened over 15 years ago are directly relevant 
to: a) Plaintiff’s fabrication of events over time; b) the motive for the fabrication of the events; 
and c) any involvement in changing the various allegations over time.  Edwards’ 
communications with the press provide direct evidence regarding the initial claims and how 
those claims changed over time.  They also provide substantial evidence on Ms. Giuffre’s status 
as a limited public figure, inserting herself into coverage on the Epstein matter.  As a limited 
public figure, Ms. Giuffre will be required to prove actual malice by Ms. Maxwell.  All of Ms. 
Giuffre’s counsel’s communication with media are, thus, directly relevant to this case. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 8     Filed 06/30/16     Page 16 of 19

Edwards’ undue burden claims fails for many of the same reasons previously discussed.  
Edwards voluntarily chose to insert himself in this matter, as a litigant and a fact witness.  He 
actively chose to file a case against Dershowitz, leading to substantial media interest.  These 
active decisions lead to him having his own personal and discoverable information that is 
directly at issue in this case.  The fact that these decisions may cause him to have to review his 
own documents, no matter how many documents there may be, is simply irrelevant.6 
RFP 19 & 20 – Requests for letters or communication to or by any witness or prospective 
witness 
Mr. Edwards, as part of his litigation practice, has sent “witness solicitation letters” to 
prospective witnesses in this matter.  These letters contain a skewed version of the allegations in 
this case and are potential impeachment evidence in this case.  Mr. Edwards has immediate 
access to this information and the production of these letters would not be burdensome. 
WHEREFORE, for the forgoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Motion to Quash 
be Denied, and that Bradley J. Edwards be compelled to comply with the subpoena as modified 
herein. 
There are obviously numerous mechanisms by which these emails can be narrowed, culled and then reviewed, 
including the employment of agreed to search terms.  Ms. Maxwell’s counsel is more than willing to discuss these 
options and come to an agreeable resolution.

PLAINTIFFS, BRADLEY J. EDWARDS AND PAUL CASSELL'S 
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON LIABILITY 
Plaintiffs, Bradley J. Edwards, Esq. and Paul G. Cassell, Esq., by and through their 
lUldersigned counsel and pursuant to Rule 1. 510, Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby move 
for (1) partial summary judgment on the issue of the false and defamatory nature of the 
statements at issue in this defamation case, as well to the presumed damages from those 
statements, with respect to both of claims against the Defendant, Alan Dershowitz, and (2) final 
summary judgment as to Dershowitz's First Amended Counterclaim against them, and in support 
thereof state as follows: 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
As the Court is well aware, this case involves a defamation action filed by two attorneys: 
Edwards and Cassell. They contend that the defendant, Alan Dershowitz, defamed them by 
repeatedly claiming in worldwide media broadcasts and other widely-disseminated statements 
that they had engaged in conspiring ·with their client to make up sexual abuse allegations against 
Dershowitz. The pleadings and discovery ta.ken to date show that there is no genuine issue as to

any material fact that these statements were false and defamatory. Moreover, Edwards and 
Cassell are entitled to litigation privilege for the statements they filed in court on behalf of their 
client. Accordingly, Edwards and Cassell are entitled to partial summary judgment on their 
complaint and final summary judgment on Dershowitz's First Amended Counterclaim. 
With regard to their complaint, Edwards and Cassell are entitled to partial summary 
judgment on the specific issue of the false and defamatory nature of the statements made against 
them. They have provided ample evidence that they had a powerful basis for believing their 
client's sexual abuse allegations - and were accordingly justified in filing a legal document on 
their client's behalf which contained those allegations. As a result, the undisputed record 
evidence establishes that Dershowitz waged a baseless international media assault on the 
honesty, integrity, and professionalism of Edwards and Cassell. In particular, Dershowitz went 
so far as to repeatedly accuse Edwards and Cassell of criminal misconduct in actively suborning 
perjury and fabricating the allegations of misconduct against him - acts that would wru.nnt their 
disbarment from the legal profession. The undisputed record evidence supports the conclusion 
that Edwards and Cassell reasonably believed the sexual assault allegations against Dershowitz 
to be true, which is all that is required for the court to enter partial summary judgment here. Put 
simply, Dershowitz has made highly defamatory allegations that have no basis in fact. Indeed, 
his lawsuit was merely a desperate measure by a child abuser to avoid the stigma of the 
disclosure of his misconduct. Dershowitz's charges against Edwards and Cassell were and are 
nothing short of a far-fetched fictional fairy-tale - a preposterous claim lacking any factual

support. And the statements that he made attack the chosen profession of Edwards and Cassell -
the practice of law - and therefore carry with them a presumption of damages suffered. 
Accordingly, the court should grant plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the 
issues of the false and defamatory nature ofDershowitz's statements, as well as the issue of the 
presumed damages that flowed from those statements. 
With regard to the First Amended Counterclaim, the undisputed material facts establish 
that Dershowitz's counterclaims against the Plaintiffs are barred by the absolute litigation 
privilege. 
The conduct of the attorneys Edwards and Cassell that forms the basis for 
Dershowitz's counterclaim for defamation is nothing more than filing a well-founded motion in 
pending federal court proceedings on behalf of pro bono clients. In his recent deposition, 
Dershowitz has conceded that the allegations were relevant to the federal court proceedings. As 
a result, that filing is indisputably protected by Florida's broad and absolute litigation privilege. 
Conseque-ntly, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as it relates to the pending cowterclaim 
against them should also be granted. 
ARGUMENT 
U. 
EDWARDS AND CASSELL ARE ENTITLED TO PARTIAL SUMMARY 
JUDGMENT ON THE PENDING PRIMARY CLAIM BECAUSE THERE 
ARE NO MATERIAL DISPUTED FACTS AND THE UNDISPUTED FACTS 
ESTABLISH THAT DERSHOWITZ REPEATEDLY BROADCAST FALS;E 
AND DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS ABOUT THEM. 
A. 
The Summary Judgment Standard. 
Rule l.510(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that a court may enter summary

judgment when the pleadings, depositions and factual showings reveal that there is no genuine 
issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See 
Snyder v. Cheezem Development Corp., 373 So. 2d 719, 720 (Fla. 2d DCA 1979); Rule 1.510(c), 
Fla. R. Civ. P. Once the moving party conclusively establishes that the nonmoving party cannot 
prevail, it is incumbent on the nonmoving party to submit evidence to rebut the motion for 
summary judgment. See Holl v. Talcott; 191 So. 2d 40, 43 (Fla. 1966). It is not enough for the 
opposing party merely to assert that an issue of fact does exist. Fisel v. Wynns, 667 So.2d 761, 764 
(Fla.1996); Landers v. Milton, 370 So.2d 368, 370 (Fla.1979) (same). 
Moreover, it is well-recognized that the non-moving party faced with a summary judgment 
motion supported by appropriate proof may not rely on bare, conclusory assertions found in the 
pleadings to create an issue and thus avoid summary judgment. Instead, the party must produce 
counter-evidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact. See Bryant v. Shands Teaching 
Hospital and Clinics, Inc., 479 So.2d 165, 168 (Fla. 1st Dist, Ct. App. 1985); see also Lanzner v. 
City of North Miami Beach, 141 So.2d 626 (Fla. 3d Dist Ct. App. 1962) (recognizing that mere 
c;ontrary allegations of complaint were not sufficient to preclude summary judgment on basis of 
facts established without dispute). Where the nonmoving party fails to present evidence rebutting 
the motion for sununary judgment and there is no genuine issue of material fact, then entry of 
judgment is proper as a matter oflaw. See Davis v. Hathaway, 408 So. 2d 688, 689 (Fla. 2d Dist. 
Ct. App. 1982); see also Holli 191 So. 2d at 43.

Edwards and Cassells Motion for Summ&ry Judgment on Liability 
Page5 of20 
B. Dershow:itz's Statements Concerning Edwards and Cassell Were False and 
Defamatory and Have Absolutely No Factual Basis. 
In support of this motion, Edwards and Cassell incorporate. each of the attached Exhibits 
~- notably including attached Exhibit 1, which is a summary of some of the most important 
evidence; Exhibit 2, which is a sworn affidavit from their client, Ms. Giuffre; and Exhibit 3, 
which is deposition testimony from Cassell. These extensive materials establish the considerable 
support upon which Edwards and Cassell relied to file allegations on behalf of their client, Ms. 
Virginia Roberts Giuf:fi_-e. 
Nevertheless~ this is not a complicated case for granting partial 
summary judgment. To the contrary, this is a simple case for partial summary judgment because 
each and every one of Dershowitz's verbal attacks against Edwards and Casse11 lacks any merit 
whatsoever and is defamatory per se. 
Of course, one element that a defamation plaintiff must establish under Florida law is an 
"unp1i.vileged publication (to a third party) of a false and defamatory statement concerning 
another." Mile Marker, Inc. v. Petersen Publishing, L.L.C., 811 So.2d 841, 845 (Fla. Dist. Ct. 
App. 4th 2002). Another element that a defan1ation plaintiff must establish is damage to the 
person that ensued from the publication of the false or defan1atory statement. Id 
While Edwards and Cassell are entitled to summary judgment on other aspects of their 
claims, in this pleading it is only these two elements on which Edwards and Cassell are seeking 
summary judgment. 
As the undisputed facts establish, Cassell and Edwards received a well-founded 
allegation that Dershowitz had sexually abused Ms. Roberts. They then filed thos.e allegations -

Edwards, Br,adley vs. bershowitz 
Case No.: CACE 15-000072 
Edwards and Cassells Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability 
Page 6 of20 
on her behalf - in a pending case where those allegations were pertinent. Dershowitz then went 
on a worldwide media rampage, claiming that the allegations were so unsupported that, by 
merely filing them in court for their client, Edwards and Cassell's demonstrated that they lacked 
fitness to engage in their chosen profession: the practice of law. Dershowitz's allegations are 
clearly and indisputably false, as established below. 
And it takes no real effort to understand that Dershowitz's statements (recounted in 
Exhibit #1 and elsewhere) are obviously and indisputably defamatory. 
Dershowitz had 
repeatedly said, for example, the Edwards and Cassell have conspired to create false charges 
against him and should be disbarred. B.ecause these defamatory statements involve the conduct 
of two attorneys in their chosen profession, Dershowitz had committed defamation per se and 
damage is presumed. It is well settled in Florida that defamation "is actionable per se is, without 
a showing of special damage-if it imputes to another ... conduct, characteristics, or a condition 
incompatible with the proper exercise of his lawful business, trade, ptofession, or office .... " 
Campbell v. Jacksonville Kennel Club, 66 So. 2ed 495, 497 (Fla. 1953) (citing Restatement, 
Torts, Section 570). 
Because this case involves defamation per se, "liability itself creates a conclusive legal 
presumption of loss or damage. Therefore a finding of liability for [defamation] per se, coupled 
with an express finding that the [ defamation] was intended to injure plaintiff and did in fact 
cause injury, authorizes the jury to consider and assess punitive damages without any finding of 
a specific amount of compensatory damages." Lawnwood Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Sadow, 43 So. 3d

Eclwards and Cassells Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability 
Page 7 of20 
710, 729 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010}. Accordingly, for purposes of summary judgment, there need be 
no record evidence of any specific loss attributable to Dershowitz's tortious conduct. Edwards 
and Cassell are automatically entitled to summary judgment on that aspect of their claim. 
THE RECORD EVIDENCE 
In light of the foregoing principles, three kinds of evidence are relevant to Edwards and 
Cassell's motion for partial summary judgment. First, Edwards and Cassell must establish the 
absence of any dispute that their profession is the legal profession. Second, Edwards and Cassell 
must establish the absence of any dispute that Dershowitz has imputed conduct inconsistent with 
the proper exercise of their legal duties. And third, Edwards and Cassell must establish the 
absence of any dispute that Dershowitz's statements were false and defamatory. Ample and 
unrebutted evidence supports each of these three points, which is summarized in the 
accompanying video presentation (Exhibit #I), the contents of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. 
Edwards and Cassell 's Chosen Profession is the Law 
Edwards and Cassell are both attorneys. In answering the complaint, Dershowitz appears 
to concede this fact. See Defendant Dershowitz's Answer to Complaint at ,r,r 2-6 (conceding 
Cassell is counsel in a Florida victims' rights case and has held other legal positions); id. at ,r,r 6-
(conceding the same as to Edwards). 
Mr. Edwards has established by affidavit (see Exhibit #-14) that he is a named partner in 
the law firm of Fanner, Jaffe, Weissing, Edwards, Fistos & Lehnnan and a Board Certified Civil

Dershowitz Has Made Defamatory Statements Alleging Conduct Incompatible with Proper 
Exercise of Edwards and Cassell 's Profession. 
As established beyond dispute from reviewing the first few video clips in the attached 
presentation, Dershowitz has defamed Edwards and Cassell by repeatedly alleging "conduct, 
char,acteristics, or a condition incompatible with the proper exercise of [Edwards and Cassell's] 
lawful business, trade, and profession." Among other things, Dershowitz alleged that Edwards 
and Cassell failed to minimally investigate the allegations they advanced on behalf of their client 
and even that they sat down with her to contrive the allegations. The attached video clips 
provide some illustrations of the assault on the Plaintiff.;;' professional fitness, but other 
statements Dershowitz has made in prominent national and international media including equally 
disparaging false statements: 
"[Edwards and Cassell] are lying deliberately, and I will not stop until they're 
disbarred .... " 
New York Times-January 3, 2015 
"[Edwards and Cassell] manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was

"If they [Cassell and Edwards] had just done an hours' wo1th of work, they would 
have seen she is lying through her teeth .... They're prepared to lie, eheat, and 
steal. These are unethical lawyers. This is Professor Cassell who shouldn't be 
allowed near a student. . . . He is essentially a crook. He is essentially somebody 
who's distorted the legal system, . . . Why would he charge a person with a 
sterling reputation for 50 years on the basis of the word alone of a woman who is 
serial liar. . . If they just checked the records, they could have known from 
themselves that she was lying about me . ... So we can prove it without any 
doubt. That's what's so absurd. That's what's so strange why two experienced 
lawyers would file this kind of statement knowing it was untrue. These [Cassell 
and Edwards] are virtually the equivalent of perjurers and they have to be taken 
out ofthe le.gal profession. They can't be allowed to have a bar card to victimize 
more innocent people." 
Hala Gorani-CNN Live (Jan. 5, 2015) 
"There was no contact, no contact whatsoever. And I will prove it conclusively, 
and then I will bring disciplinary charges and prove that these lawyers knew that 
this was false, could easily have checked, and didn't. And the end result will be 
that these lawyers will be disbarred." 
Vice News -January 5, 2015 
So they [Edwards and Cassell] and the woman got together and contrived and 
made this up. They have been talking to the woman for years. She never alleged 
me before. She never made any mention. Many of the others were mentioned 
before. 
First time my name was mentioned was a week ago. . . . I've never 
seen two lawyers like Paul Cassell and. Brad Edwards engage in such unethical, 
disbarrable 
conduct. And I am accusing them on your show of unethical 
conduct." 
CNN Tonight- Jan. 5, 2015. 
"Dershowitz told Reuters Monday that he would file a defamation lawsuit based 
on the lawyers' public statements about the case. He also plans to file complaints 
with their respective states

"Now, your own rules of the profession, which I read coming in this morning,

Brad Edwards, from, whose partner 
Rothstein is now in jail for 50 years for a Ponzi scheme involving the same case, 
and a guy named Cassell - filed this ... allegation again me in passing without 
doing even the most minimal of investigation, which would have proven 
conclusively that I not only didn't, but coulditt have, possibly done it." 
Speech to Dade County Bar Association, Feb. 20, 2015. 
Clearly Dershowitz has attacked Edwards and Cassell's conduct as attorneys and even their 
fitness to continue to be members of their respective bars. 
Dershowitz 's Statements Were False 
The record evidence eliminates all doubt that Dershowitz' s statements were false. The 
sworn affidavit of Virginia Robe1ts Giuffre (identified previously as Jane Doe #3), attached and 
incorporated herein as Exhibit #2, unequivocally contradicts Alan Dershowitz's protestations of 
innocence and his malicious statements made against Edwards and CasselL 
However, 
Dershowitz has denied the accuracy of Ivls. Giuffre's charges against him. While at trial, 
Dernhowitz w.ill he proven to be a liar, at this stage summary judgment could not be granted if 
the truthfulness of Ms. Giuffre's charges were a material element of the claims on which 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-2     Filed 06/30/16     Page 13 of 29
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz 
Case No.: CACE 15-000072 
Edwards and Cassells Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability 
Page 12 of20 
Edwards and Cassell are seeking summary judgment. But while Edwards and Ca,ssell will 
establish the truthfulness of Ms. Giuffre"s charges at trial, this is not an issue that the .court need 
reach to before granting the summary judgments that Edwards and Cassell seek in this pleading. 
The central issue upon which Edwards and Cassell' s complaint rests is not whether Ms. 
Giuffte's claims were true, but instead whether Dershowitz lacked any basis whatsoever to 
support his claims that Edwards and Cassell not only knew that her statements were false but 
indeed actively participated in fabricating false statements. The record is completely devoid of 
evidence to support the existence of any such basis. 
As to the counterclaim the central issue upon which summary judgment turns is whether 
the Plaintiffs'/counter-defendants' filing of Virginia Roberts Giuffre's affidavit in the Crime 
Victim's Rights Act cases had any reasonable relationship to the issues in that federal 
proc;eeding. That issue has been expressly conceded by Dershowitz. 
MS. GIUFFRE'S SWORN CLAIMS 
Ms. Giuffre has submitted a sworn affidavit, not only attesting to the truthfulness of her 
allegations against Dershowitz but also about the fact that she told her lawyers about these 
claims. With regard to her allegations, Ms. Giuffre explains that: 
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz was around Epstein frequently. 
Dershowitz was so comfortable v..~th the sex that was going on and that he 
observed me in sexual activity with Epstein. 
I had sexual intercourse with 
Dershowitz at least six times. The 'fjrst time was when I was about 16, early on in 
my servitude to Epstein, and it .continued until f was 19. 
The first time we had sex took plaee in New York in Epstein's home. It 
was in Epstein's room (not the massage room). I was approximately 16 years old 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-2     Filed 06/30/16     Page 14 of 29

Page 13 of20 
at the time. I called Dershowitz "Alan." I knew he was a famous professor. The 
second time that I had sex with Dershowitz was at Epstein's house in Palm Beach. 
I also had sex with Dershowitz at Epstein's Zorro Ranch in New Mexico 
in the massage room off of the indoor pool area, which was stiH being painted. 
We also had sex at Little Saint James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Another sexual encounter between me and Dershowitz happened on 
Epstein's airplane. Another girl was present on the plane with us. 
I have recently seen a former Harvard law professor identified as Alan 
Dershowitz on television calling me a "liar." He• is lying by denying that he had 
sex with me·. That man is the same man that I had sex with at least six times. 
Since I filed my motion in the Jane Doe 1 and Jane 2 case, my credibility 
has been attacked, including attacks from Alan Dershowitz on me and on my 
attorneys who believed in me. I am telling the truth and will not Iet these attacks 
prevent me from exposing the truth of how I was trafficked for sex to maoy 
powerful people. These powerful people seem to think that they don't have to 
follow the same rules as everyone else. That is wrong. 
Sworn affidavit of Virginia Giuffre (Exhibit #2), at ,i,i 24-31, ,i 71. 
The assertions of sexual abuse are more than adequately corroborated by compelling 
circumstantial evidence which is detailed at length by Cassell in his deposition. However, the 
Court (like the jury who will ultimately hear this case) need not ever decide -whether Dershowitz 
sexually abused Ms. Giuffre to rule in Edwards and Cassell's favor in this motion. Regardless of 
whether Dershowitz sexually abused Ms. Giuffre, Edwards and Cassell clearly had a good faith 
basis for relying on the swom representations of their client - and Dershowitz had absolutely no 
basis for repeatedly asserting on numerous worldwide media platfonns that Edwards and Cassell 
got together with their client "and contrived and made this up." ln addition, Edwards and Cassell 
had clearly conducted extensive investigation into the basis for Ms. Giuffre's allegations - and 
Dershowitz absolutely had no basis for repeatedly asserting that if they "had just done an hours' 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-2     Filed 06/30/16     Page 15 of 29

Case No.: CACE 15-000072

worth of work, they would have seen she is lying through her teeth." Accordingly, regardless of 
what happened between Dershowitz and Ms. Giuffre inside of Jeffrey Epstein's mansions, on his 
jets, and on Epstein's exclusive private island, the undisputed record evidence establishes that 
Edwards and Cassell had every right following their detailed investigation to rely on Ms. 
Giuffre's credibility. -Even more significantly, there is no record evidence contradicting the 
Plaintiffs' assertions that they did not fabricate Ms. Giuffre's sworn account of her interactions 
with the defendant Dershowitz. 
The good faith basis for Edwards and Cassell's reliance on Ms. Giuffre's allegations is 
laid out in detail by Professor Cassell in more than 50 pages of sworn testimony during his 
deposition. See Depo. of Paul Cassell (Oct. 16 & 17, 2015), at 61 • 117 (Exhibit #3). Some of 
Professor Cassell's significant testimony is included in the PowerPoint presentation included as 
part of the record in support of this Motion. 
Cassell's testimony includes the following 
information that he and Edwards relied upon in believing the truth of Giuffre' s allegations: 
• 
The Palm Beach Police Department put together an 87-page report based on 
witness interviews and other evidence documenting sexual abuse of dozens of 
minor girls occurring in Epstein's Florida mansion - a location where Ms. Giuffre 
said Dershowitz had abused her (see Exhibit #4); 
• 
The Palm Beach police report showed the sexual abuse was occuning on a daily 
basis and, indeed, in some cases as much as two or three times in one day in 
circumstances that would have made it obvious to a visiting guest that young girls 
were coming to the home for sexual purposes; 
• 
Flight logs for Epstein's private jet showed that Epstein (accompanied by Ms. 
Maxwell) flew Ms. Giuffre to the New York City area, a location where Ms. 
Giuffre said Dershowitz had abused her (see Exhibit #5); 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-2     Filed 06/30/16     Page 16 of 29
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz 
Case No.: CACE 15-000072 
Edwards and Cassells Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability 
Page 15 of20 
• 
Epstein's flight logs appeared to be disguising the identity of all of the passengers 
on Epstein's plane by using such notations as "one female." 
• 
A very well-regarded Florida lawyer (Bob Josefsberg), who was selected by the 
U.S. Government to represent the victims of Epstein's sexual abuse, had found 
Ms. Giuffre to be credible and in 2009 filed a civil complaint for her alleging not 
only sex abuse by Epstein but also by "academicians" (see Exhibit #6) -- a group 
into which Dershowitz fell; 
• 
Shortly after Josefsberg filed the complaint for Ms. Giuffre alleging 
"academicians" had abuse her, one of Josefsberg's partners, Ms. Ezell, began 
conducting depositions in Epstein-related cases asking about Dershowitz's 
awareness of sexual abuse; 
• Dershowitz showed up on flight logs for Epstein's private jet, including a flight 
with an (apparently young) woman named "Tatiana'' who did not appear to serve 
any business purpose for Epstein; 
• 
When asked about Dershowitz, Epstein took the Fifth rather than indicate that 
Dershowitz was not involved in any criminal activities (see Exhibit #7) - a fact 
from which an obvious adverse infei;ence could be drawn that Dershowitz was, 
indeed, involved in Epstein's crimes; 
• 
In moving down from the top of Epstein's criminal conspiracy to the next 
echelon, three women -
Sarah Kellen, Adrianna Mucinska, and Nadia 
Marcinkova - all took the Fifth when asked about Dershowitz's awareness of 
Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls or whether Dershowitz was involved in 
massages with young girls (see Exhibit #16); 
• 
Kellen, Mucinska, and Marcinkova were all covered by a highly unusual non-
prosecution agreement (negotiated by, among others, Epstein defense attorney 
Alan Derhsowitz) that provided immunity from prosecution for sex trafficking not 
only to Epstein but also to his "potential co.._conspirators"; 
• 
One of Epstein's household employees, Juan Alessi, said that Dershowitz visited 
Epstein's Palm Beach mansion four or five times a year1 staying two or three days 
when he went there- and Alessi was .able to identify a photograph of Ms. Giuffre 
as someone who was at the mansion as the same time as Dershowitz (see Exhibit 
#8);

Case No.: CACE 15-000072 
Edwards and Cassells Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability 
Page 16 of20 
• 
Another Epstein household employee, Alfredo Rodriguez, said that during the 
time 0f his employment (2005), Dershowitz visited Epstein's mansion at the same 
time as ''massages'' by underage girls were occurring in the mansion (see Exhibit 
#9); 
• 
When Rodriguez was arrested by the FBI trying to sell Epstein's "little black 
book" of contacts and phone numbers, he appeared to have circled the name of 
Alan Dershowitz as someone who had information about Epstein criminal 
activities (see Exhibit #17); 
• 
Dershowitz had indicated in 2003 that he was an extremely close friend of Epstein 
- indeed, that the only person outside his immediately family with whom he 
shared drafts of his books was Epstein; 
• 
Attempts had been made to depose Dershowitz or otherwise obtain information 
from him ab.out his knowledge of Epstein's sexual abuse in 2009, 201 I, 2013, and 
January 2015, and he had avoided all those efforts (see Exhibit #10); 
• 
Dershowitz had told the Palm Beach Police Department that he. was going to 
make Epstein available to answer questions about sex abuse of underage girls, but 
then repeatedly rescheduled those meetings, ultimately never producing Epstein -
a pattem of deception that appeared to be designed to deliberately delay the 
investigation; 
• 
Dershowitz's pattern of avoiding depositions (and helping Epstein avoid 
questioning) was consistent with a pattern of other persons who were involved in 
Epstein's international sex trafficking organization evading efforts to obtain 
information from them; 
• 
Ms. Giuffre had alleged abuse by other powerful friends of Epstein, including 
Prince Andrew, and there was a photograph showing Prince Andrew with his arm 
around Ms. Giuffre apparently taken in London ( where she said the sex abuse had 
taken place) ( see Exhibit # 11 ). 
Depo. of Paul Cassell (Oct. I 6 & 17, 2015), at 61-117 (Exhibit #3). 
Edwards and Cassell clearly had a powerful basis for believing their client's allegation 
that she had been sexually abused by Dershowitz, particularly where she had made this 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-2     Filed 06/30/16     Page 18 of 29

Case No.; CACE 15-000072

Page 17 of20 
allegation to them as far back as 2011 before they were representing her. But equally clear is the 
fact that Dershowitz engaged in intentional misconduct, because of his lack of any basis for 
attacking their professionalism. Dershowitz served as Epstein's defense counsel during the 
negotiations that lead to his guilty plea and associated non-prosecution agreement. Dershowitz 
uniquely would have been aware of the compelling evidence against Epstein - and no doubt 
would have taken a keen interest in the evidence that would have connected him with Epstein's 
crimes. Most notably, since then, Dershowitz has yet to provide any evidence that he relied upon 
in January 2015 for his claims that Edwards and Cassell had conspired with their client to make 
up allegations against him. And the idea that if Edwards and Cassell "had just done an hours' 
worth of work, they would have seen she is lying through her teeth" is laughable in light of the 
mountain of evidence supporting her allegations - as well as Dershowitz's refusal to be deposed 
regarding his knowledge of the sexual abuse of Epstein's victims and his personal inability to 
obtain exonerating evidence. 
And what does Dershowitz now claim was the support for his media tirade against these 
two cap&ble lawyers? As the Court can readily confirm by reading even a small snippet of 
Dershowitz's deposition, it was very difficult to get him to answer questions directly and 
specifically. 
(As a result, Dershowitz's deposition will continue on December 9 and 10.) 
However, Dershowitz never provided any basis for his attacks on Edwards and Cassell. See 
generally Depo. of Alan Dershowitz; (Oct. 15, 2015) (Exhibit #12); Depo. of Alan Dershowitz 
(Oct. 16, 2015) (Exhibit#13).

Page 18 of20 
Moreover, some answers were successfully extracted whjch leaves no doubt that 
Dershowitz;s defamatory statements about Edwards and Cassell were made without any basis. 
Some of these have been collected in the attached PowerPoint presentation, which shows 
intentional misconduct - specifically, a series of deliberate lies -- by Dershowitz, apparently 
designed to conceal his culpability. For example, Dershowitz claimed that the flight logs would 
"exonerate" him. But he had never even looked at them before attacking Edwards and Cassell. 
See Depo. of Alan Dershowitz at 239-42 (Oct. 16, 2015) (Exhibit #13). Dershowitz also stated 
in his media appearances that "[a]s far as the planes are concerned, there are flight manifests. 
They will prove I was never on any private airplane with any young women." Hana Gorani -
CNN Live (Jan. 5, 2015). And yet a flight log shows Dershowitz on a flight with a young woman 
named "T atianna." Dershowitz also was forced to admit in his deposition that whenever he met 
with Epstein, part of the Epstein "entourage" were woman whom he described as being between 
the age of25 and 30. 
Dershowitz also stated: "I've been manied to the same woman for 28 years. She goes 
with me everywhere. People know that I won't argue a case or give a speech unless my wife 
travels with me." American Lawyer, Jan. 15, 2015. And yet the available flight logs for 
Epstein's planes do not show Dershowitz's wife on a single flight while showing Dershowitz 
traveling without his wife on numerous flights -including a flight with "Tatianna" on it.

Dershowitz also stated "I have never been alone ... with Jeffrey Epstein." UMAR 
News, Jan. 5, 2015. 
And yet (among other occasions), a flight log shows Epstein and 
Dershowitz traveling together - alone. 
Dershowitz said "I never got a massage from anybody. It's made up out of whole cloth." 
But on Local 10 News (Jan. 22, 2015), Dershowitz said he got a massage but "kept my 
underwear on." 
Based on evidence such at this, there is no doubt as the false defamatory nature of 
Dershowitz's statements against Edwards and Cassell. 
CONCLUSION AS TO PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS 
Partial summary judgment is appropriate in this case, particularly because Florida law 
provides strong protection for a person's reputation. As the Fourth DCA has explaine.d m 
upholding a punitive damages award in a defamation case: 
Florida's unusually high protection of personal reputation derives from the 
common consent of humankind and has ancient roots. It is highly valued by 
civilized people. Our state constitution and common law powerfully support it 
This is a value as old as the Pentateuch and the Book of Exodus, and its command 
as clear as the Decalogue: ''Thou shall not bear false witness ~gainst thy 
neighbor." The personal interest in one's own good name and reputation 
surpasses economics, business practices or money. It is a fundamental part of 
personhood, of individual standing and one's sense of worth. In short, the 
wrongdoing underlying the punitive damages in this case has Florida law's most 
severe condemnation, its highest blameworthiness, its most deserving culpability. 
For [defamation] per se, reprehensibility is at its highest.

The record evidence and law described here provide clear support for the conclusion not 
only that Dershowitz sexually abused Ms. Giuffre, but also indisputably that Dershowitz made 
false and defamatory statements by alleging that two experienced and capable attorneys who 
thoroughly investigated and believed Ms. Giuffre's allegations in good faith should be disbarred. 
Equally obvious from the surrounding circumstances is the improper motive behind Alan 
Dershowitz's high profile media assault. In his own words: 
"There's an old saying: 
'If you have the law on your side, bang on the law. 
If you have the facts on your side, bang on the facts. 
If you have neither, bang on the table.' 
I have never believed that, but I do believe in a variation on that theme: 
If you don't have the law or legal facts on your side, argue your case in the court 
of public opinion." 
Alan M. Dershowitz, Taking the Stand My Life in the Law 
With neither law nor facts available to defend himself against charges of gross 
wrongdoing, Dershowitz followed his own prescription and took his defense to the court of 
public opinion where he had an audience willing to ignore both law and facts. The lawyer 
victims ofDershowitz's attacks remained temporarily silenced by their personal unwillingness to 
abandon their faith in the legal system or the interests of their pro bono client. They filed this 
action to protect their interests, and the record evidence now supports their entitlement to partial 
summary judgment on the issues that Dershowitz made false and defamatory statements about 
them and, in addition, that the Edwards and Cassell suffered presumed damage because these 
statements are defamatory per se.

III. 
EDWARDS AND CASSELL ARE ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
ON THE COUNTERCLAIM ON THE BASIS OF THEIR AFFIRMATIVE 
DEFENSE OF LITIGATION PRIVILEGE. 
As the Court is aware, Edwards and Cassell have pending a motion to dismiss both 
counts of the First Amended Counterclaim on the basis of litigation privilege and other 
arguments. In this motion for summary, Edwards and Cassell-specifically incorporated herein by 
reference the arguments advanced there. If for any reason the Court were to find that the motion 
to dismiss could not be granted based on the litigation privilege, Edwards and Cassell are clearly 
entitled to summary judgment on both counts of the First Amended Counterclaim for many of 
the same reasons articulated there - as well as based on new evidence outside the pleadings, such 
as the fact that Dershowitz has admitted that the allegations Edwards and Cassell filed were 
relevant to the federal case 
Under Florida's litigation privilege, "absolute immunity," a party and her attorneys are 
"exempted from liability to an action for defamatory words published in the course of judicial 
proceedings, regardless of how false or malicious the statements may be, as long as the 
statements bear some relation to or connection with the subject of inquiry." Zuccarelli v. 
Barfield, 165 So. 3d 830, 831 (4th DCA 2015); see also Levin, Middlebrooks, Mabie, Thomas, 
Mqyes & Mitchell, P.A. v. US. Fire Ins. Co., 639 So. 2d 606 (Fla. 1994). Tue immunity 
afforded to statements made during the course of a judicial proceeding extends not only to the 
parties in a proceeding but to judges, witnesses, and counsel as well. Id. The litigation privilege 
applies in all causes of action, whether for common-law torts or statutory violations. See 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-2     Filed 06/30/16     Page 23 of 29

Page 22 of20 
Echevarria, MeCalla, Raymer, Barrell & Frappier v. Cole, 950 So. 2d 380 (Fla. 2007). 
Defamatory statements made by lawyer while interviewing a witnes·s in preparation for and 
connected to pending litigation are covered by the absolute immunity conferred by the litigation 
privilege. See De/Monico v. Traynor, 50 So. 3d 4 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 4th Dist. 2010), review 
granted, 47 So. 3d 1287 (Fla. 2010). And because it appears to be undisputed that Dershowitz is 
a "public figure," he must carry the extra burden of proving his defamation counterclaim by 
"clear and convincing evidence." Zorc v. Jordan, 765 So. 2d 768, 771 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000). 
These authorities effectively narrow the issue on the pending counterclaim to the 
resolution of a single question: did the filing of Ms. Virginia Roberts Giuffre's affidavit in the 
Crime Victim's Rights Act cases currently pending the Federal District Court for the Southern 
District of Florida have "some relationship" to that proceeding. 
Dershowitz has himself 
answered that question in the affirmative on multiple occasions during his recent deposition: 
Q: 
You were asked on the occasion of that same Don Lemon CNN interview 
what possible motive the attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, could 
have had to have identified you in the pleading that was filed in the Crime 
Victim's Rights Act Case. Do you remember that? 
A: 
That's right, yes. 
Q: 
And your response was quote - "They want to be able to challenge the 
plea agreement. I got the very good deal for Jeffrey Epstein." 
Did you make a response? 
A: 
Yes. 
Q: 
So, you recognized as of January 5, 2015, that the reason why the 
statements were filed in the Crime Victim's Rights Act case was because 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-2     Filed 06/30/16     Page 24 of 29
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz 
Case No.: CACE 15-000072 
Edwards and Cassells Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability 
Page 23 of20 
the Crime Victim's Act case had, as an objective, setting aside the plea 
agreement that you had negotiated for Jeffrey Epstein, correct? 
A. 
There were multiple motives. One of the motives was crassly financial. 
They were trying to line their pockets with money. But as I also said, and 
I said this over and over again, they profiled me. They sat down with their 
client, knowing that she has a history of lying, knowing that she is easily 
suggestible, and they basically pressured her, according to my sources, 
into including me when she didn't want to include me, because by 
including me, they could make a claim, false as it was, could make a false 
claim that a person who negotiated the NPA was also criminally involved 
with her. 
* * * 
Q. 
You stated, quote: "If they," referring to Bradley Edwards and Paul 
Cassell, "could find a lawyer who helped draft the agreement" -
A. 
Right. 
Q. 
-- "who also was a criminal having sex, wow, that could help them blow 
up the agreement." 
Did you make that statement on -
A. 
Yes. I just repeated it now, yes, under oath, yes. 
Depo. of Alan M. Dershowitz (Oct. 16, 2015), at 217-220 (Exhibit #13). 
For all the reasons previously advanced, Edwards and Cassell are entitled to have both 
counts of the First Amended Counterclaim against them dismissed - as they argue in their 
pending motion to dismiss. But in addition, a motion for summary judgment is the proper way to 
introduce Dershowitz's concession and other evidence to the Court. And given the obviously 
undisputed concession that Dershowitz made in his deposition, summary judgment is also 
appropriate on Count I of the counterclaim because oflitigation privilege. 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-2     Filed 06/30/16     Page 25 of 29
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz 
Case No.: CACE 15-000072 
Edwards and Cassells Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability 
Page 24 of20 
And then, with summary judgment appropriate on Count I of the pending counterclaim, it 
also follows that summary judgment is also appropriate as to Count II as well. As explained at 
greater length in the motion to dismiss, nothing in the record established any disputed fact 
showing anything other than that Edwards and Cassell did not make out-of-court statements 
containing actionable defamatory allegations against Dershowitz. Moreover, in ruling on this 
summary judgment motion, the "allegedly defamatory words must be read in the context of the 
entire publication, and if the documents could not possibly have a defamatory effect, the 
complaint may be dismissed .... " Zorc v. Jordan, 765 So. 2d 768, 771 (Fla.4th DCA 2000). 
Dershowitz has simply collected snippets of emails to try and cobble together a viable 
defamation claim. But when these snippets are each read in context - as this Court must do in 
ruling on this summary judgment motion - it is clear that Edwards and Cassell were not 
engaging in a media dialog with Dershowitz, but instead simply representing their client and 
trying to avoid an out-of-court $tatements about Dershowitz. 
For example, Dershowitz 
remarkably tries to allege that Edwards and Cassell defamed with the statement that "out of 
respect for the court's desire to keep this case from being litigated in the press, we are not going 
to respond at this time to specific claims of indignation by anyone." 
First Amended 
Counterclaim at ,r 32. Moreover, Dershowitz tries to claim a defamation occurred when Cassell 
sent an email to a journalist stating "I represent . .. the young woman who was sexually abused 
byn Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. This statement, read in context, was nothing more than an 
identification of CasselPs client in a way that permits a media representation to understand who

Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz 
Case No.: CACE 15-000072 
Edwards and Cassells Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability 
Page25 of20 
is being discussed. See Cassell Depo. at 310-12 (Oct. 17, 2015) (Exhibit #3). And in addition, 
Edwards and Cassell were simply making a "fair report" about properly-filed legal pleadings 
that, as Dershowitz's concession in his deposition demonstrates, were relevant to the case at 
hand. For all these reasons, summary judgment in favor of Edwards and Cassell is appropriate 
on the First Amended Counterclaim. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, defendant, the Court should grant defendant Bradley J. 
Edwards, Esq., and Paul Cassell, Esq. paitial summary judgment in their favor on the issues of 
the false and defamatory nature of the statements alleged in their complaint, as well as the 
presumed damages that flow from them, The Court should also grant summary judgment in their 
favor on the First Amended Counterclaim filed against them by Dershowitz.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.:08-CV-80736-KAM
JANE DOE 1 and JANE DOE 2, 
Petitioners, 
vs. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Respondent. 
______________________________/
ORDER DENYING PETITIONERS’ MOTION TO JOIN UNDER RULE 21 AND
MOTION TO AMEND UNDER RULE 15
This cause is before the Court on Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s Corrected Motion
Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action (“Rule 21 Motion”) (DE 280), and Jane Doe 1 and Jane
Doe 2’s Protective Motion Pursuant to Rule 15 to Amend Their Pleadings to Conform to
Existing Evidence and to Add Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 as Petitioners (“Rule 15 Motion”) (DE
311).  Both motions are ripe for review.  For the following reasons, the Court concludes that they
should be denied.  
I.  Background 
This is an action by two unnamed petitioners, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, seeking to
prosecute a claim under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771.  (DE 1). 
Generally, they allege that the respondent Government violated their rights under the CVRA by
failing to consult with them before negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein,
who subjected them to various sexual crimes while they were minors.  (Id.).  Petitioners initiated
this action in July 2008.  (Id.). 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 324   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015   Page 1 of 10
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-3     Filed 06/30/16     Page 2 of 11

On December 30, 2014, two other unnamed victims, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4, moved
to join as petitioners in this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21.  (DE 280). 
Petitioners (Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2) support the Rule 21 Motion.  (Id. at 11).  Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 argue that they “have suffered the same violations of their rights under the [CVRA]
as the” Petitioners, and they “desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well.”  (Id. at
1).  The Government vehemently opposes joinder under Rule 21.  (DE 290).  The Government
argues that Rule 15 is the proper procedural device for adding parties to an action, not Rule 21. 
(Id. at 1). 
“[O]ut of an abundance of caution,” Petitioners filed a motion to amend their petition
under Rule 15, conforming the petition to the evidence and adding Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 as
petitioners.  (DE 311 at 2).  The Government opposes the Rule 15 Motion as well.  (DE 314). 
Among other things, the Government argues that amending the petition to include Jane Doe 3
and Jane Doe 4 should be denied because of their undue delay in seeking to join the proceedings,
and the undue prejudice that amendment will cause.  (Id.).  
After considering the parties’ submissions and the proposed amended petition, the Court
finds that justice does not require amendment in this instance and exercises its discretion to deny
the amendment.  
II.  Discussion 
“The decision whether to grant leave to amend a complaint is within the sole discretion of
the district court.”  Laurie v. Ala. Ct. Crim. Apps., 256 F.3d 1266, 1274 (11th Cir. 2001).  “The
court should freely give leave when justice so requires.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  Justice does
not require amendment in several instances, “includ[ing] undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 324   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015   Page 2 of 10
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-3     Filed 06/30/16     Page 3 of 11

on the part of the movant, . . . undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the
amendment, [and] futility of amendment.’”  Laurie, 256 F.3d at 1274 (quoting Foman v. Davis,
371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).  In addition to considering the effect of amendment on the parties, the
court must consider “the importance of the amendment on the proper determination of the merits
of a dispute.”  6 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P. § 1488, p. 814 (3d ed. 2010).  Justice does
not require amendment where the addition of parties with duplicative claims will not materially
advance the resolution of the litigation on the merits.  See Herring v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 894
F.2d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. 1989).  
A.
Rule 21 Motion
Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s first attempt to join in this proceeding was brought under
Rule 21.  (DE 280).  “If parties seek to add a party under Rule 21, courts generally use the
standard of Rule 15, governing amendments to pleadings, to determine whether to allow the
addition.”  12 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P., p. 432 (3d ed. 2013); see also Galustian v.
Peter, 591 F.3d 724, 729-30 (4th Cir. 2010) (collecting cases and noting that Rule 15(a) applies
to amendments seeking to add parties); Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1365 (10th Cir.
1993) (“A motion to add a party is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) . . . .”).  
Rule 21, “Misjoinder and Non-joinder of Parties,” provides the court with a tool for
correcting the “misjoinder” of parties that would otherwise result in dismissal.  Fed. R. Civ. P.
21.  Insofar as Rule 21 “relates to the addition of parties, it is intended to permit the bringing in
of a person, who through inadvertence, mistake or for some other reason, had not been made a
party and whose presence as a party is later found necessary or desirable.”  United States v. Com.
Bank of N. Am., 31 F.R.D. 133, 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1962) (internal quotation marks omitted).  
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 324   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015   Page 3 of 10
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-3     Filed 06/30/16     Page 4 of 11

In their Rule 21 Motion, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 do not claim that they were omitted
from this proceeding due to any “inadvertence” or “mistake” by Petitioners; rather, they seek to
join this proceeding as parties that could have been permissively joined in the original petition
under Rule 20 (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”).  As courts generally use the standards of Rule
to evaluate such circumstances, the Court will consider the joinder issue as presented in the
Rule 15 Motion.   The Court will consider the arguments presented in the Rule 21 Motion as if
they are set forth in the Rule 15 Motion as well.  Because the arguments are presented in the Rule
Motion (and because the Court is denying the Rule 15 Motion on its merits, as discussed
below), the Rule 21 Motion will be denied.
The Court also concludes that portions of the Rule 21 Motion—and related
filings—should be stricken from the record.  Pending for this Court’s consideration is a Motion
for Limited Intervention filed by Alan M. Dershowitz, who seeks to intervene to “strike the
outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and [to] request[] a show cause order to
the attorneys that have made them.”  (DE 282 at 1).  The Court has considered Mr. Dershowitz’s
arguments, but it finds that his intervention is unnecessary as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(f) empowers the Court “on its own” to “strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any
redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  
Petitioners’ Rule 21 Motion consists of relatively little argumentation regarding why the
Court should permit them to join in this action: they argue that (1) they were sexually abused by
  The Court notes that, regardless of which motion it considers, the same standard
governs the addition of parties under Rule 21 and Rule 15.  See Goston v. Potter, No. 08-cv-478
FJS ATB, 2010 WL 4774238, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Universal
Music Grp., Inc., 248 F.R.D. 408, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)).

Jeffrey Epstein, and (2) the Government violated their CVRA rights by concealing the non-
prosecution agreement with them.  (DE 280 at 3; see id. at 7-8).  However, the bulk of the Rule
Motion consists of copious factual details that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “would prove” “[i]f
allowed to join this action.”  (Id. at 3, 7).  Specifically, Jane Doe 3 proffers that she could prove
the circumstances under which a non-party introduced her to Mr. Epstein, and how Mr. Epstein
sexually trafficked her to several high-profile non-party individuals, “including numerous
prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known
Prime Minister, and other world leaders.”  (Id. at 3-6).  She names several individuals, and she
offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took place.  (See id. at 5).   
At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary to the
determination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 should be permitted to join Petitioners’
claim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA.  The factual details regarding
with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent
to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed
them CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not
related to the respondent Government.  These unnecessary details shall be stricken. 
The original Rule 21 Motion (DE 279) shall be stricken in its entirety, as it is wholly
superseded by the “corrected” version of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 280).  From the corrected Rule
Motion, the Court shall strike all factual details regarding Jane Doe 3 between the following
sentences: “The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from
  Jane Doe 4’s proffer is limited to sexual acts between Mr. Epstein and herself.  (See DE
280 at 7-8).

Jane Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA” (id. at 3); and “The Government was
well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it listed her as a victim in the
attachment to the NPA” (id. at 6).  As none of Jane Doe 4’s factual details relate to non-parties,
the Court finds it unnecessary to strike the portion of the Rule 21 Motion related to her
circumstances.  Regarding the Declaration in support of Petitioners’ response to Mr.
Dershowitz’s motion to intervene (DE 291-1), the Court shall strike paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 11, 13,
15, 19 through 53, and 59, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-parties.  Regarding
the Declaration of Jane Doe 3 in support of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 310-1), the Court shall strike
paragraphs 7 through 12, 16, 39, and 49, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-
parties.  Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof,
should Petitioners demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a
matter presented for the Court’s consideration.  
As mentioned, Mr. Dershowitz moves to intervene “for the limited purposes of moving to
strike the outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and requesting a show cause
order to the attorneys that have made them.”  (DE 282 at 1).  As the Court has taken it upon itself
to strike the impertinent factual details from the Rule 21 Motion and related filings, the Court
concludes that Mr. Derschowitz’s intervention in this case is unnecessary.  Accordingly, his
motion to intervene will be denied as moot.   Regarding whether a show cause order should
  This also moots Mr. Dershowitz’s Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply in
Support of Motion for Limited Intervention.  (DE 317).  Denying Mr. Dershowitz’s motion to
intervene also renders moot Petitioners’ motion (DE 292) to file a sealed document supporting its
response to Mr. Dershowitz’s motion.  It will accordingly be denied as moot, and DE 293 (the
sealed response) will be stricken from the record.

issue, the Court finds that its action of striking the lurid details from Petitioners’ submissions is
sanction enough.  However, the Court cautions that all counsel are subject to Rule 11’s mandate
that all submissions be presented for a proper purpose and factual contentions have evidentiary
support, Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1) and (3), and that the Court may, on its own, strike from any
pleading “any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).   
B.
Rule 15 Motion 
Between their two motions (the Rule 21 Motion and Rule 15 Motion), Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 assert that “they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights [under the
CVRA] as well.”  (DE 280 at 1).  Although Petitioners already seek the invalidation of Mr.
Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement on behalf of all “other similarly-situated victims” (DE 189
at 1; DE 311 at 2, 12, 15, 18-19), Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 argue that they should be fellow
travelers in this pursuit, lest they “be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims” resulting
in “duplicative litigation” (DE 280 at 11).  The Court finds that justice does not require adding
new parties this late in the proceedings who will raise claims that are admittedly “duplicative” of
the claims already presented by Petitioners.    
The Does’ submissions demonstrate that it is entirely unnecessary for Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 to proceed as parties in this action, rather than as fact witnesses available to offer
relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative testimony.  (See, e.g., DE 280 at 2 (Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 “are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims”), 9 (“The new victims
will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in the same way as it
violated the rights of the other victims.”), 10 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “will simply join in
motions that the current victims were going to file in any event.”), 11 (litigating Jane Doe 3 and
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 324   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015   Page 7 of 10
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-3     Filed 06/30/16     Page 8 of 11

Jane Doe 4’s claims would be “duplicative”); DE 298 at 1 n.1 (“As promised . . . Jane Doe No. 3
and Jane Doe No. 4 do not seek to expand the number of pleadings filed in this case.  If allowed
to join this action, they would simply support the pleadings already being filed by Jane Doe No. 1
and Jane Doe No. 2.”); DE 311 at 5 n.3 (“[A]ll four victims (represented by the same legal
counsel) intend to coordinate efforts and avoid duplicative pleadings.”), 15 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane
Doe 4 “challenge the same secret agreement—i.e., the NPA that the Government executed with
Epstein and then concealed from the victims.  This is made clear by the proposed amendment
itself, in which all four victims simply allege the same general facts.”)).  As the Does argue at
length in their Rule 15 Motion, Jane Doe 1’s original petition “specifically allege[s] that the
Government was violating not only her rights but the rights of other similarly-situated victims.” 
(DE 311 at 2).  The Court fails to see why the addition of “other similarly-situated victims” is
now necessary to “vindicate their rights as well.”  (DE 280 at 1).
Of course, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 can participate in this litigated effort to vindicate
the rights of similarly situated victims—there is no requirement that the evidentiary proof
submitted in this case come only from the named parties.  Petitioners point out as much, noting
that, regardless of whether this Court grants the Rule 15 Motion, “they will call Jane Doe No. 3
as a witness at any trial.”  (DE 311 at 17 n.7).  The necessary “participation” of Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 in this case can be satisfied by offering their properly supported—and relevant,
admissible, and non-cumulative—testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial
(see DE 280 at 9) or affidavits submitted to support the relevancy of discovery requests  (see
  The non-party Jane Does clearly understand how to submit affidavits.  (See DEs 291-1,
310-1). 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 324   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015   Page 8 of 10
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-3     Filed 06/30/16     Page 9 of 11

id. at 10).  Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s “participation in this
case” can only be achieved by listing them as parties.    
As it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a
determination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all
“other similarly situated victims” under the CVRA.  Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer
relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence that advances that determination, but their
participation as listed parties is not necessary in that regard.  See Herring, 894 F.2d at 1024
(District court did not abuse its discretion by denying amendment where “addition of more
plaintiffs . . . would not have affected the issues underlying the grant of summary judgment.”); cf.
Arthur v. Stern, 2008 WL 2620116, at *7 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (Under Rule 15, “courts have held
that leave to amend to assert a claim already at issue in [another lawsuit] should not be granted if
the same parties are involved, the same substantive claim is raised, and the same relief is
sought.”).   And, as to Jane Doe 4 at least, adding her as a party raises unnecessary questions
about whether she is a proper party to this action.   
Petitioners also admit that amending the petition to conform to the evidence—by
including references to the non-prosecution agreement itself—is “unnecessary” as the “existing
petition is broad enough to cover the developing evidence in this case.”  (DE 311).  The Court
  The Court expresses no opinion at this time whether any of the attestations made by
Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 in support of their motion will be relevant, admissible, and non-
cumulative.  
  The Government contends that Jane Doe 4 is not a true “victim” in this case because
she was not known at the time the Government negotiated the non-prosecution agreement, and
accordingly she was not entitled to notification rights under the CVRA.  (See DE 290 at 10). 
Any “duplicative” litigation filed by Jane Doe 4 would necessarily raise the issue of whether she
has standing under the CVRA under these circumstances.  
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 324   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015   Page 9 of 10
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-3     Filed 06/30/16     Page 10 of 11

agrees, and it concludes that justice does not require amending the petition this late in the
proceedings.

(DE 280) is DENIED; the Rule 15 Motion (DE 311) is DENIED;  Intervenor Dershowitz’s

ACUITY Reputation 
Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria 
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have 
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue. 
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and 
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having 
sexual relations with her, which he denies. 
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as 
they are defamatory. 
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same. 
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British 
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old 
defamatory claims.

Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz 
Complaint 
14. 
In fulfillment of their obligations to two Epstein-victim clients, BRADLEY J. 
EDWARDS and PAUL G. CASSELL filed and have been aggressively prosecuting a legal 
action in the Federal District Court as previously described in Paragraph 6. 
15. 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G. CASSELL on behalf of two additional 
Epstein-victim clients sought the agreement of the federal government to permit those clients to 
intervene in the already pending CVRA action. 
The government declined to agree to the 
intervention, thus requiring EDWARDS and CASSELL to file legal pleadings seeking a Court 
Order permitting intervention on the basis of specifically alleged factual allegations. 
16. 
Among the factual allegations made by EDWARDS and CASSELL were 
allegations that Defendant, DERSHOWITZ, had knowledge of and participation in Epstein's 
criminal conduct. 
17. 
Immediately following the filing ofv./hat the Defendant, DERSHOWITZ, knew to 
be an entirely proper and ,vell-founded pleading, DERSHOWITZ initiated a massive public 
media assault on the reputation and character of BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G. 
CASSELL accusing them of intentionally lying in their filing, of having leveled knowingly false 
accusations against the Defendant, DERSHOWITZ, without ever conducting any investigation of 
the credibility of the accusations, and of having acted unethically to the extent that their willful 
misconduct warranted and required disbannent. 
18. 
The details of Defendant, DERSHOWITZ'S character assassination 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G. CASSELL are typified by the contents of the CNN 
interview available to be accessed on the internet at: 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-5     Filed 06/30/16     Page 6 of 7
Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz 
Complaint 
http://www.cnn.com/2 015/ 01/ o 5/ europe /prince-andrew-sex-a buse-all egatio ns /index.html# 
That interview is incorporated herein by reference. 
19. 
The same or substantially identical accusations of deliberate misconduct and 
unethical behavior warranting disbannent of the Plaintiffs were repeated by the Defendant, 
DERSHOWITZ, in multiple nationally televised interviews, in statements to and repeated by 
national and international print news sources, and various other forms nationally and 
internationally. 
20. 
The Defendant, DERSHOWITZ'S statements were false and known by him to be 
false at the time they were made. DERSHOWITZ was speaking from his Miami residence at the 
time he made the false and defamatory statements. 
21. 
Alternatively, DERSHOWITZ made the statements in reckless disregard of their 
truth or falsity, intending that the statements would provide support for DERSHOWITZ'S false 
protestations of his own innocence and direct attention away from DERSHOWITZ'S personal 
knowledge of and involvement in Epstein's criminal conduct and the subsequent cover up of that 
misconduct. 
22. 
DERSHOWITZ'S statements were and are defamatory per se directly attacking 
the fitness of the Plaintiffs to engage in the honored profession of the practice of law. 
23. 
DERSHOWITZ acted in willful, wanton, reckless, and intentional disregard of the 
rights of the Plaintiffs and under such circumstances as to warrant the imposition of punitive 
damages.

Complaint 
24. 
As the statements made by DERSHOWITZ are defamatory per se, injury to the 
Plaintiffs is presumed as a matter oflaw. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand judgment against the Defendant, ALAN M. 
DERSHOWITZ, for compensatory damages, costs, pre and post-judgment interest, and such 
other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate under the circumstances. Plaintiffs 
reserve the right to assert claims for punitive damages upon satisfying the applicable statutory 
prerequisites. 
Plaintiffs further demand trial by jury.

Plaintiff, 
Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
v.
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant. 
________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S SECOND AMENDED SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE AND  
OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT’S FIRST SET OF 
DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO PLAINTIFF
Plaintiff hereby serves her second amended supplemental responses and objections to 
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests violates Local Civil Rule 33.3. Defendant 
has served interrogatories that are in direct violation of that Rule because the interrogatories are 
not “restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of information relevant to 
the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category of damage alleged, and the 
existence, custodian, location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent 
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar nature.” Local 
Civil Rule 33.3(a). Instead, they seek information under subsections (b) and (c) of Local Civil 
Rule 33.3, and therefore, they should not be served because they are not “a more practical 
method of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition,” and 
because they were served in advance of the period “30 days prior to the discovery cut-off date.”

commenced on September 21, 2015. Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as overly burdensome to 
the extent that they would require logging voluminous privileged documents between Ms. 
Giuffre and her counsel related to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, Case no. 08-
80736-CIV-Marra, pending in the Southern District of Florida; Bradley Edwards and Paul 
Cassell v. Alan Dershowitz, Case no. CACE 15-000072, pending in the Seventeenth Judicial 
Circuit, Broward County, Florida; and Jane Doe No. 102 v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 09-80656-
CIV-Marra/Johnson (Southern District of Florida).  Accordingly, due the undue burden of 
individually logging responsive privileged documents related to Defendant’s overly broad 
requests, Plaintiff has employed categorical logging of such privileged responsive documents 
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c).
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests in that they seek to invade her privacy for the sole 
purpose of harassing and intimidating Ms. Giuffre who was a victim of sexual trafficking.  Ms. 
Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent they are overly broad and unduly burdensome.
Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s definition of “your attorneys” because it includes 
names of attorneys that do not represent her, including Spencer Kuvin and Jack Scarola.
Ms. Giuffre’s responses to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests are being made 
after reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts, and are based only upon the information and 
documentation that is presently known to her.  Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or 
supplement her responses.  Ms. Giuffre is producing documents and information herewith, and 
she will continue to review and produce relevant documents until completion.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.:08-CV-80736-KAM
JANE DOE 1 and JANE DOE 2, 
Petitioners, 
vs. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Respondent. 
______________________________/
ORDER DENYING INTERVENOR’S MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER
This cause is before the Court on Intervenor Jeffrey Epstein’s Unopposed Motion for a
Supplemental Protective Order.  (DE 261).  The once-unopposed motion is now opposed by
Petitioners (DE 298) and prospective intervenors the Palm Beach Post and Palm Beach Daily
News (the Media) (DE 305).   Considering the positions of the parties and intervenors, the Court
concludes that the proposed supplemental protective order should not issue.  
I.  Background 
This is a case against the United States for allegedly violating the Crime Victims’ Rights
Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, by failing to involve Petitioners (and other similarly situated
victims of Intervenor Epstein) in the process that ultimately led to a federal non-prosecution
agreement between the Government and Epstein.  (DE 1).  The parties and intervenors have
debated, and continue to debate, the discoverability and discloseability of correspondence
documents that evidence just exactly what transpired between the Government, Epstein, and their
  The Court is granting the Media’s motion to intervene and will consider its arguments
against the protective order accordingly.  
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 1 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 2 of 17

respective attorneys. 
In March 2011, Petitioners moved “to allow use of correspondence between the U.S.
Attorney’s Office and counsel for Jeffrey Epstein” to prove their CVRA case.  (DE 51 at 1). 
Petitioners argued that the correspondence was relevant as it “shows that the U.S. Attorney’s
Office was aware of its statutory obligation to inform the victims of the non-prosecution
agreement,” and that they should be allowed to use it “as it sheds important light on the events
surrounding the non-prosecution agreement, which are central to the victims’ arguments that the
U.S. Attorney’s Office violated their rights.”  (Id. at 5, 6).  Intervenor Epstein and his attorneys
opposed the motion and sought a protective order, arguing that “case law as well as sound and
substantial policy considerations prohibit disclosure of the letters and emails prepared by Mr.
Espstein’s lawyers during plea negotiations with the government, and require that the letters and
emails that Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 already have remain confidential.”  (DE 162 at 1; see also
DEs 160, 161).    
On June 18, 2013, this Court rejected the intervenors’ concerns and granted Petitioners’
motion:
Accordingly, the court rejects the privileges asserted by intervenors
as bases for maintaining the correspondence and related pleadings
incorporating the correspondence under seal in this proceeding. 
Finding the asserted privileges inapplicable, the court finds no
legitimate compelling interest which warrants the continued
suppression of this evidentiary material under seal in this
proceeding, and shall therefore grant petitioners’ motion to unseal
the correspondence.  While the court shall also grant the
petitioners’ motion to use the evidence as proof of alleged CVRA
violations to the extent it shall allow petitioners to proffer the
evidence in support of their CVRA claims, this order is not
intended to operate as a ruling on the relevance or admissibility of
any particular piece of correspondence, a matter expressly reserved
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 2 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 3 of 17

for determination at the time of final disposition.
(DE 188 at 9-10) (internal citation omitted).  The Court then ordered that discovery recommence
(DE 189 at 14) and ordered the Government to “[p]roduce responsive documents . . .
encompassing any documentary material exchanged by or between the federal government and
persons or entities outside the federal government (including without limitation all
correspondence generated by or between the federal government and Epstein’s attorneys)” (DE
190 at 2).    
Intervenor Epstein and his attorneys challenged these orders in an interlocutory appeal to
the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  (DEs 194, 195, 196).  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed this
Court’s orders and lifted its stay on the order compelling the disclosure of the correspondence. 
Jane Doe No. 1 v. United States of America, 749 F.3d 999, 1010 (11th Cir. 2014).  The court
held that “[n]o privilege prevents the disclosure of the plea negotiations.”  Id. at 1008. 
Specifically, the court held that “Federal Rule of Evidence 410 does not protect against the
discoverability of plea negotiations,” and, even if it did, Petitioners “intend to admit the
correspondence to prove violations of the Act allegedly committed by the United States, not
‘against’ Epstein,” whom Rule 410 protects.  Id. at 1008.  The court also rejected arguments that
the correspondence was protected under the work-product privilege or a common-law privilege
for plea negotiations.  Id. at 1008-10.  “Although plea negotiations are vital to the functioning of
the criminal justice system, a prosecutor and target of a criminal investigation do not enjoy a
relationship of confidence and trust when they negotiate.  Their adversarial relationship, unlike
the confidential relationship of a doctor and patient or attorney and client, warrants no privilege
beyond the terms of Rule 410.”  Id. at 1009. 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 3 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 4 of 17

Thereafter, Intervenor Epstein moved for a Protective Confidentiality Order, arguing that,
although the Court (and Eleventh Circuit) ruled that Petitioners could discover the
correspondence at issue, the Court should “bar the Plaintiffs from disseminating and/or publically
disclosing the substance of the [correspondence] absent further order of the Court.”  (DE 247 at
4).  Epstein sought a protective order which “(1) limits the dissemination of [the correspondence
at issue in the Court’s June 18, 2013 Order (DE 188)] to a designated list of the Plaintiffs’
counsel and support staff, and (2) prohibits any party from filing pleadings, briefs, memorandums
or exhibits purporting to reproduce, quote, paraphrase or summarize any [of this correspondence]
or portions thereof, absent leave of the Court to file the document or portion thereof under seal.” 
(Id. at 1; see also DE 247-1).  
On September 22, 2014, this Court granted Epstein’s request for a protective order in part
and denied it in part.  (DE 255).  The Court held as follows:     
Epstein argues that good cause exists for protecting the
correspondence because this is a “high profile” case, and
petitioners’ counsel has made numerous comments to the press
about this case in the past.  The Court finds that Epstein has shown
good cause to prevent potential dissemination of the
correspondence between the government and the intervenors to the
press for the purposes of generating publicity.  Accordingly, the
provisions [of the proposed protective order] that would limit
disclosure of the correspondence in question to the proposed list of
people are acceptable.  However, the Court finds the proposed
requirement to seek leave of Court to seal the filing every time a
party files a motion is overly restrictive and that it will inhibit the
administration of this case.  Any party may file any document
subject to the limited protective order in connection with any
motion when such document is relevant to the prosecution or
defense of any motion.
(DE 255 at 4-5).  The Court declined to enter the proposed protective order; however, it invited
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 4 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 5 of 17

“the parties or Epstein [to] propose another protective order consistent with this opinion.”  (Id. at
5).  
Neither the parties nor Epstein submitted a proposed protective order consistent with the
Court’s September 22, 2014 opinion (DE 255).  Rather, on October 8, 2014, Epstein filed the
instant motion for a “supplemental protective order.”  (DE 261).  The motion proposed the entry
of a protective order “that would expand the limited Protective Order allowed in [the Court’s]
decision Granting in Part and Denying in Part the Intervenors’ Motion for a Protective
Confidentiality Order. [D.E. 255 at 4].”  (Id. at 1).  In particular, this expanded protective order
would “require that any party would be required to file under seal any portion of the plea
negotiation correspondence between the Government and Epstein’s counsel, whether offered as
an exhibit or quoted from in the content of a pleading or motion.”  (Id.).  As this proviso seemed
to conflict with the Court’s earlier ruling that “[a]ny party may file any document . . . in
connection with any motion” without first seeking leave to seal (DE 255 at 4-5), and the general
policy that judicial filings be open to the public, the Court requested justification as to why a
preemptive seal on filed documents was necessary in this case.  (DE 286).  
Intervenor Epstein responded with his justifications for a temporary seal on filings that
utilize the correspondence.  (DE 295).  Petitioners, who once did not oppose such a seal,
responded with their position that the correspondence should be filed in the public record.  (DE
298).  The Media also responded with their reasons for why a temporary seal on public filings
should not issue.  (DE 305). 
II.  Discussion 
A district court has “broad discretion . . . to decide when a protective order is appropriate
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 5 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 6 of 17

and what degree of protection is required.”  Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 35
(1984) (discussing Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)); see also F.T.C. v. AbbVie Prods. LLC, 713 F.3d 54, 58
(11th Cir. 2013) (noting that district court has “considerable discretion to modify its own
protective order”).  Although broad, the court’s discretion is not unbounded: the court must take
care to apply the correct legal standard and follow the proper procedures in determining whether
a protective order should issue.  See Chicago Tribune Co. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 263
F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001).  
A.
Legal Standard 
Intervenor Epstein argues that the proper legal standard is the “good cause” standard
found in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c).  (DE 295 at 4-5).  He argues that the Court aimed
too high when it requested that he demonstrate “extraordinary circumstances or particularized
needs” in its order requesting justification for a protective order.  (Id. at 4).  The Court agrees
that, under the principles espoused in Chicago Tribune Co. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 263
F.3d 1304 (11th Cir. 2001), the “good cause” standard governs the request for a protective order
under these circumstances.   
In Chicago Tribune, the Eleventh Circuit held that, once discovery materials have become
subject to a protective order under Rule 26, “the fact that [the] sealed material is subsequently
submitted in connection with a substantive motion does not mean that the confidentiality
imposed by Rule 26 is automatically foregone.”  Id. at 1313.  The issue of whether previously
sealed discovery materials should be disclosed when attached to public filings “requires the court
to balance the respective interests of the parties . . . [which] may be resolved by the Rule 26 good
cause balancing test.”  Id.  “This standard requires the district court to balance the party’s interest
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 6 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 7 of 17

in obtaining access against the other party’s interest in keeping the information confidential.”  Id. 
Whether good cause exists for a protective order “is a factual matter to be decided by the nature
and character of the information in question,” and due regard may be given to media entities’
“contention that disclosure serves” a legitimate public interest.  Id. at 1315.    
These standards guide the Court’s determination whether a protective order should issue
concerning disclosure of the correspondence in the court file.  The parties and intervenors operate
under the assumption that a “Protective Confidentiality Order [is] presently in place” regarding
the disclosure of the correspondence at issue.  (DE 295 at 3 (citing DE 255 at 4); see DE 298 at
3).  Therefore, whether materials subject to that order should now become part of the public
record is governed by the good cause standard of Rule 26.  Chicago Tribune, 263 F.3d at 1313. 
For the following reasons, the Court concludes that the balance of interests does not favor
imposing the proposed supplemental protective order. 
B.
Interest in Obtaining Access 
Intervenor Epstein’s supplemental protective order seeks to “provide . . . protection when
[correspondence] documents are converted into exhibits and filed as a public record with the
Court.”  (DE 295 at 3).  That is, he seeks a preemptive seal on exhibits that are attached to a
motion for the ostensible purpose of aiding the Court in resolution of that motion.  When
“discovery material [is] filed in connection with pretrial motions that require judicial resolution
of the merits,” the common-law right of access attaches.  Chicago Tribune, 263 F.3d at 1312. 
Such materials—placed in the record to materially advance the judicial resolution of the
merits—play a key role in informing the public of the grounds upon which the district court bases
its adjudicative decision.  See Travelers Indem. Co. v. Excalibur Reinsurance Corp., No. 11-cv-
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 7 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 8 of 17

1209, 2013 WL 4012772, at *10 (D. Conn. Aug. 5, 2013) (Discovery documents are not judicial
documents subject to a presumptive right of access because, “prior to admission into the record
in support of a motion or as evidence at trial, [they] play no role in the performance of Article III
functions of a federal judge.”) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).  Importantly,
the common-law right of access imposes a “general presumption that,” once materials are
presented to the court for “judicial resolution of the merits” of a case, the public should be
afforded the right to inspect and copy those documents.  AbbVie Prods. LLC, 713 F.3d at 62-63.  
These principles weigh against the Intervenor’s request for a temporary blanket seal on
public filings.  The Media argues that the correspondence in question touches a “question of
profound public concern,” i.e., whether the justice system failed to afford Epstein’s victims the
rights to which they were entitled.  (DE 305 at 2).  The Court agrees that questions concerning
the federal justice system are of significant public concern.  See, e.g., Hyland v. Wonder, 972
F.2d 1129, 1137 (9th Cir. 1992) (“[A]buses, inefficiency, threats to public safety, potential civil
rights violations, and incompetence of public law enforcement officials . . . . are of vital interest
to citizens in evaluating the performance of their government.”); Floyd v. City of New York, 283
F.R.D. 153, 159 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (case involving the unfair treatment of participants “in the
criminal justice system” “presents an issue of great public concern”); Comm. On The Judiciary
U.S. House of Representatives v. Miers, 575 F. Supp. 2d 201, 209 (D.D.C. 2008) (stay pending
appeal denied because stay “may leave important public concerns regarding the nation’s federal
criminal justice system unaddressed.”).  The Media’s interest in disclosure regarding the
appropriate resolution of this question is therefore entitled to significant weight. 
Epstein argues that much of the correspondence is irrelevant to answering this question. 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 8 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 9 of 17

(DE 295 at 14).  According to him, “[w]hether the plaintiff’s CVRA rights were violated is an
issue that is extrinsic from the detailed exchanges of emails and letters that constitute the plea
and non-prosecution negotiations between Mr. Epstein’s counsel and the government.”  (Id. at 9). 
The Court disagrees: it is likely that much of the evidence concerning whether the Government
violated the Petitioners’ CVRA rights by allegedly concealing from them the plea negotiations
will come from the plea negotiations themselves.   As Petitioners point out, “the victims have
previously alleged that (for example) the defense attorneys pushed prosecutors to agree to a
confidentiality provision that illegally kept the non-prosecution agreement secret from the
victims—and the public.  Allowing the issue to be litigated in public pleadings . . . promotes
public confidence that these important issues are being handled appropriately by the Court.”  (DE
298 at 6).  The Media agrees that the “plea negotiation correspondence will be relevant to the
central issue in this case—whether the Plaintiffs were afforded their rights under the Crime
Victims’ Rights Act.”  (DE 305 at 2).  The correspondence at issue cannot be said to be
altogether “extrinsic” to Petitioners’ claim; it is likely that some of what was said touches matters
of central importance in this case.   
Moreover, the Court finds that the procedure that Epstein proposes—temporarily sealing
all correspondence filed until a party or the public moves to unseal it (DE 295 at 15)—is overly
restrictive and threatens to inhibit the administration of this case, especially in light of the
Petitioners’ indication that they now oppose sealing the correspondence in public filings.  The
procedure—filing under seal, with the inevitable accompaniment of a motion to
  The Court does not decide the relevance or admissibility of any particular piece of
evidence that this time, and no statement from this Order should be construed a ruling or
indication in that regard.   
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 9 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 10 of 17

unseal—resembles the procedure that the Court rejected in Epstein’s initial proposed protective
order—seeking leave to seal each time a party wishes to file a piece of the correspondence. 
In sum, the Court finds that the public has a legitimate interest in the issues presented in
this case and in having access to the materials presented before the Court for resolution of those
issues.  This interest is entitled to significant weight. 
B.
Interest in Keeping Correspondence Confidential  
Intervenor Epstein argues that the correspondence, which has been held non-privileged,
should nonetheless be “afforded protection against public dissemination in [this] high-profile
case [because] there are valid heightened concerns that voluminous settlement negotiations will
be dumped in the court record simply to make them available to the gossip media.”  (DE 295 at
10).  He offers two primary reasons for a seal: (1) the “longstanding tradition” that plea and
settlement negotiations are confidential, and his expectation that they would remain so (id. at 10,
12); and (2) the harm that would befall him and his counsel if Petitioners are allowed to engage
in a wholesale “dump” of sensitive documents into the public record (id. at 13-15).  The first set
of reasons has been rejected as they relate to Epstein’s argument that the correspondence was
privileged, and they remain unavailing as far as confidentiality is concerned.  The Court finds
that the threat of abusive filings is better addressed by means other than a preemptive seal on
public filings.   
1.
Plea Negotiation Confidentiality 
Intervenor Epstein argues that “[p]lea negotiations and settlement communications have
no tradition of being publically accessible,” and that “serious Sixth Amendment implications,”
the spirit of Federal Rule of Evidence 410, and the “environment of confidentiality” fostered by
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 10 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 11 of 17

Rule 410 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 indicate that the plea negotiation
correspondence should “be protected from future use by an adversary.”  (DE 295 at 10-12). 
These alleged justifications—together or separately—do not support a prevailing interest
in keeping the plea negotiation correspondence confidential.  As the Eleventh Circuit has already
held, Rule 410 does not bar disclosure of the correspondence (at trial or otherwise) because
“Epstein cannot invoke Rule 410 because he pleaded guilty to state charges . . . and has not
withdrawn those pleas.”  Doe No. 1, 749 F.3d at 1008.  Rule 11 says nothing about whether plea
negotiation materials that lead to a guilty plea should be kept confidential.  And, although
Epstein argues that the correspondence should be “protected from future use by an adversary”
(DE 295), this Court has already held that Petitioners may make such “use” of that
correspondence as necessary (DE 188 at 10) against their adversary in this case, the Government. 
Cf. Doe No. 1, 749 F.3d at 1008 (“The victims intend to admit the correspondence to prove
violations of the Act allegedly committed by the United States, not ‘against’ Epstein.  And even
if rescission of the non-prosecution agreement abuts Epstein’s interests, the purpose of the
admission does not change.  Rule 410 does not bar disclosure of the correspondence written by
the attorney-intervenors.”).  The Court rejects these grounds for imposing a confidentiality
protective order in this case.  (DE 295 at 10-12).   
Epstein argues that the Court should shield the correspondence from public disclosure
because he and his counsel had “and continue to have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality
in their settlement negotiations with the government.”  (DE 295 at 12).  The Eleventh Circuit
rejected similar reasoning as it related to Epstein’s claim that the correspondence was privileged:
“Although plea negotiations are vital to the functioning of the criminal justice system, a
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 11 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 12 of 17

prosecutor and target of a criminal investigation do not enjoy a relationship of confidence and
trust when they negotiate.  Their adversarial relationship, unlike the confidential relationship of a
doctor and patient or attorney and client, warrants no privilege beyond the terms of Rule 410.” 
Doe No. 1, 749 F.3d at 1009.  The Court finds no support (and Epstein cites none) for the
proposition that a court must respect a suspect’s unilateral expectation that he shared a
“relationship of confidence and trust” with the prosecutor, where no such relationship existed by
operation of law.  In fact, Rule 410 serves to inform suspects (and their attorneys) that plea
discussions are subject to admissibility in court (and thus open to the light of day) if they
ultimately lead to a guilty plea that is not later withdrawn.  Because this potential is present in
every plea negotiation, the Court finds no support in Epstein’s purported reasons for keeping
such discussions confidential after a guilty plea is reached.  (DE 295 at 13).  
The Court finds no principled reason—in longstanding tradition or otherwise—for
holding that plea negotiations that lead to a guilty plea, not withdrawn, are confidential,
especially where things said in those negotiations are potentially relevant to whether the federally
protected rights of others were violated.  Intervenor Epstein’s interest in keeping the
correspondence confidential is thus entitled to little weight.    
2.
Protection Against Abusive Filings 
Intervenor Epstein argues that a preemptive seal is necessary to prevent a wholesale
“dump” of irrelevant documents into the file, which are offered for no purpose but to further
sensationalize this case.   (DE 295 at 1-4; 14-15).  The Court is cognizant of this concern.  Even
  The document that Epstein argues exemplifies this concern was previously stricken
from the record.  (DE 324 at 10 (striking DE 293)).  
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 12 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 13 of 17

so, the Court does not find that it is necessary to place a preemptive seal on the filing of every
piece of correspondence that may be pertinent to a matter fairly presented for judicial resolution
by this Court.    
The Court finds that the parties are in the best position to police their conduct—as
officers of the Court with sworn professional responsibilities—when it comes to placing material
in the public record.  Every written submission and filing must be submitted for a proper
purpose, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1), such as materially advancing judicial resolution of an issue
that is pertinent to this litigation.  Relevancy is a broad term; however, it is not without its clearly
acceptable limitations.  Relevant evidence must, for instance, advance the determination of a
“fact of consequence” in the action.  Fed. R. Evid. 401(b).  As the Court views it—and
Petitioners  and the Media  seem to agree—the facts of consequence that most clearly relate to
this action—and which therefore have the most support for being made a part of the public
record—are those statements in the plea negotiations that relate to the rights of the victims, i.e.,
the Government’s knowledge, and alleged disregard, of the rights which it owed the victims
under the CVRA.  Parts of the correspondence that relate to the victims’ rights in this regard, or
that raise inferences that the Government had known obligations and disregarded them, are most
appropriate for public filing as they lead to judicial resolution of this central issue.  
  Petitioners contend that the correspondence may show “that (for example) the defense
attorneys pushed prosecutors to agree to a confidentiality provision that illegally kept the non-
prosecution agreement secret from the victims . . . .”  (DE 298 at 6) (emphasis added).  
  The Media contends that the correspondence “will be relevant to the central issue in the
case—whether the Plaintiffs were afforded their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act        
. . . .”  (DE 305 at 2) (emphasis added).  
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 13 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 14 of 17

Undoubtedly, the amount of correspondence now made available to Petitioners  contains
reams of documents that—while interesting on some level—bear no arguable pertinence to any
issue necessary for judicial resolution of this case.  No judicial purpose will be served by placing
such documents into the court record; therefore, doing so should be avoided.  Also, documents
that may be pertinent by the line, paragraph, or page, may not be pertinent by the entire multi-
page document, file-folder, or box-full.  The pertinent portions—and portions that are in good
faith necessary for context—should be submitted, and the rest omitted from public filings. 
Wholesale dumps of multi-page documents for the purpose of supporting brief quotations should
be avoided.
Counsel—as officers of the Court with sworn professional responsibilities—are
circumscribed by several principles (including those espoused by the Court above) regarding
what documents should appropriately be made part of the public record.  Counsel must not
present any document, or fail to remove unnecessary portions of a document, “for any improper
purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.” 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1).  Prior to filing certain motions, counsel is required to confer “with all
parties or non-parties who may be affected by the relief sought in the motion in a good faith
effort to resolve by agreement the issues to be raised in the motion.”  S.D. Fla. Local R. 7.1(a)(3)
(emphasis added).  At this required conferral, counsel should discuss what documents—or what
  The victims report that they “have now obtained the full text of correspondence
between the defense attorneys and prosecutors.”  (DE 298 at 6).  Nothing within this Order
should be construed as a ruling regarding the disclosure of documents that are subject to a claim
of privilege that has yet to be decided by this Court.    
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 14 of 16
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-10     Filed 06/30/16     Page 15 of 17

portions or documents—are necessary to support the proposed motion.   Dispositive motions are
not subject to this required conferral; however, counsel should be aware that filings either in
support or defense of motions for summary judgment should relate to the “material facts” of the
case.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).      
The Court stands ready to police the filings in this case as well.  The parties and
intervenor may move to sanction or to strike, should they have a good faith basis for believing
that another party has engaged in abusive filing.  And, as the parties are aware, the Court may
strike on its own “any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter” from the record. 
(DE 324 at 4) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f)).  The Court finds that these remedies are sufficient to
address the potential for abuse that Intervenor Epstein envisions.  See F.T.C. v. AbbVie Prods.
LLC, 713 F.3d 54, 64 (11th Cir. 2013) (noting that Rules 11 and 12(f) may be sufficient
protections from abusive filings in appropriate cases).  The parties should conduct themselves
accordingly.   
III.  Conclusion 
In sum, the Court finds that Intervenor Epstein has not demonstrated that good cause
exists for imposing a supplemental, expanded protective order preemptively sealing the public
filing of any and all correspondence in this case.  The interest in public disclosure outweighs
Epstein’s interest in shielding the non-privileged correspondence from public view.  Other
remedies may prove effective in preventing abusive filings in this case.  The Court denies
Epstein’s request for a stay of this order pending appeal.  (DE 295 at 16).  However, the Court
  This should not be read as a requirement that counsel must certify whether there is
agreement regarding what documents may be submitted, or as a grounds for a party or intervenor
to object to the submission before the motion is filed.  
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 326   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2015   Page 15 of 16

will temporarily stay its ruling giving Epstein time to seek a stay from the Court of Appeals,
should an interlocutory appeal issue. 
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: 
1.
Intervenor Epstein’s Unopposed Motion for a Supplement Protective Order (DE
261) is DENIED; his request for a stay pending appeal (DE 295 at 16) is also
DENIED.  
2.
The effect of this Order is temporarily STAYED up to and including Monday,
April 27, 2015, in order to permit Intervenor Epstein an opportunity to renew his
request for a stay before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  If Epstein applies
for a stay in the Court of Appeals on or before April 27, 2015, the temporary stay
imposed by this Order shall remain in effect pending the Eleventh Circuit’s
disposition of the application for a stay.  
3.    
The Media’s Motion to Intervene to Oppose Intervenor Epstein’s Motion for
Entry of a Supplemental Protective Order (DE 305) is GRANTED.  
DONE AND ORDERED in chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County,
Florida, this 15  day of April, 2015.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
NO. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA
JANE DOE #1 and JANE DOE #2,
Plaintiffs,
vs.
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Defendant.
______________________________________/
ORDER ON THE INTERVENORS’ MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE
CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon the Intervenors’ Motion for a Protective
Confidentiality Order (DE 247).  This matter is fully briefed and is now ripe for review.  The Court
has carefully considered the briefs and is fully advised in the premises.  For the reasons stated below,
the Motion (DE 247) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  
I. Background
This action is brought by the alleged victims (“victims” or “petitioners’) of sexual crimes
committed by Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).  The victims allege that the United States Attorney
violated their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), and are seeking relief
stemming from the alleged violations.  This Court denied the government’s motion to dismiss, and
granted petitioners’ motion to use correspondence between the Untied States Attorney’s Office and
Epstein’ counsel to prove their case.   The government and the victims are currently engaged in
litigating whether the materials in question are protected from disclosure based upon various
The parties appealed these Orders.  (DE 194, 195, 196).  On April 18, 2014, the Eleventh
Circuit affirmed the disclosure order, and the mandate was issued on June 11, 2014.  (DE 254).
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 255   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/22/2014   Page 1 of 5
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-11     Filed 06/30/16     Page 2 of 6

grounds, including the prohibition of the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) concerning grand
jury materials, and the work product, investigative, attorney-client, and deliberative process
privileges.  Also, by a contemporaneous order, the Court is permitting Epstein to intervene for the
limited purpose of asserting his interests in the secrecy of matters occurring before the federal grand
jury of which he was a target. 
The intervenors, Epstein and his attorneys  ask the Court to enter a Protective Confidentiality
Order which (1) limits dissemination of the confidential materials only to certain recipients, and (2)
prohibits any party from making any filings with the Court containing the confidential materials
absent leave of Court to file the documents under seal.  
II. Legal standard and discussion
“In order to preserve the confidentiality of sensitive materials, a district court may regulate
access to the information by issuing a protective order pursuant to Rule 26(c),” including by issuing
an “umbrella” order when document-by-document review is not practical.  In re Alexander Grant &
Co. Litig., 820 F.2d 352, 355 (11th Cir. 1987).  “Under the provisions of umbrella orders, the burden
of proof justifying the need for the protective order remains on the movant; only the burden of
raising the issue of confidentiality with respect to individual documents shifts to the other party.” 
Id.  
The Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) gives the courts the power to issue an order to
Epstein and his counsel have been previously allowed to intervene for the limited
purpose of asserting that the plea negotiation correspondence was privileged.  (DE 158, 159). 
After the instant Motion had been filed, the Eleventh Circuit disposed of the intervenors’
interlocutory appeal ruling that no privilege would prevent the disclosure of the plea negotiations. 
Doe No. 1 v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir. 2014).  Accordingly, Epstein’s
attorneys are no longer intervenors in this case.  
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 255   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/22/2014   Page 2 of 5

protect a party or a person from annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression if good cause is shown. 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).   To determine whether good cause has been shown, the courts consider the
following factors: “[1] the severity and the likelihood of the perceived harm; [2] the precision with
which the order is drawn; [3] the availability of a less onerous alternative; and [4] the duration of the
order.”  In re Alexander Grant & Co. Litig., 820 F.2d at 356.  Additionally, the courts balance the
competing interests of the parties and of the public to inspect the documents upon which the courts
make their case dispositive decisions.  Id.; Chicago Tribune Co. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 263
F.3d 1304, 1311 (11th Cir. 2001).  
It is necessary to point out that there is no common law public right of access to discovery
This Rule states in pertinent part:
(1) In General. A party or any person from whom discovery is sought may move for
a protective order in the court where the action is pending--or as an alternative on
matters relating to a deposition, in the court for the district where the deposition will
be taken. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith
conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the
dispute without court action. The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect
a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or
expense, including one or more of the following:
(A) forbidding the disclosure or discovery;
(B) specifying terms, including time and place, for the disclosure or discovery;
(C) prescribing a discovery method other than the one selected by the party seeking
discovery;
(D) forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting the scope of disclosure or
discovery to certain matters;
(E) designating the persons who may be present while the discovery is conducted;
(F) requiring that a deposition be sealed and opened only on court order;
(G) requiring that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or
commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way; and
(H) requiring that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information
in sealed envelopes, to be opened as the court directs.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1).  
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 255   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/22/2014   Page 3 of 5
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-11     Filed 06/30/16     Page 4 of 6

documents.  Chicago Tribune Co., 263 F.3d at 1311.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit has said that
“material filed with discovery motions is not subject to the common-law right of access, whereas
discovery material filed in connection with pretrial motions that require judicial resolution of the
merits is subject to the common-law right.”  Id. at 1312.  
Here, Epstein  proposed a very detailed Protective Confidentiality Order (“proposed order”). 
The proposed order would apply to all correspondence between the United States Attorney’s Office
and the intervenors.  It would limit dissemination of this correspondence only to the Court personnel,
court reporters, petitioners’ attorneys who are counsel of record in this case and their paralegal and
clerical staff, retained consulting or testifying experts and consultants, and additional persons upon
the agreement of the parties and the Intervenors.  The proposed order would also require any party
intending to file the correspondence in support or opposition of a non-discovery motion to ensure
that the materials receive proper protection from public disclosure and seek leave of Court to file the
documents under seal in accordance with the Local Rules.  
Epstein argues that good cause exists for protecting the correspondence because this is a
“high profile” case, and petitioners’ counsel has made numerous comments to the press about this
case in the past.  See Motion, Ex. 2-4 (DE 247-2 – 4).  The Court finds that Epstein has shown good
cause to prevent potential dissemination of the correspondence between the government and the
intervenors to the press for the purposes of generating publicity.  Accordingly, the provisions that
would limit disclosure of the correspondence in question to the proposed list of people are
acceptable.  However, the Court finds the proposed requirement to seek leave of Court to seal the
filing every time a party files a motion is overly restrictive and that it will inhibit the administration
of this case.  Any party may file any document subject to the limited protective order in connection

with any motion when such document is relevant to the prosecution or defense of any motion.  
III. Conclusion
It is therefore ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Intervenors’ Motion for a Protective
Confidentiality Order (DE 247) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  The Court
declines to enter the proposed order.  However, the parties or Epstein may propose another protective
order consistent with this opinion.  The parties and Epstein shall make every effort to agree on the
terms of any such proposed order.  Lastly, the proposed order should not make any legal
predeterminations, such as who will be have the burden of proof on any issues.  
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida,
this 21  day of September, 2014.

CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO STIPULATION AND ORDER OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY. 
The marking shall be affixed in such a manner as not to obliterate or obscure any written 
matter. With respect to discovery materials produced electronically, the designation of 
Confidential may be made on the outside of the disk or ed. 
3. 
In the event that the Producing Party inadvertently fails to designate any CDM 
as confidential in this Action, it may make such designation subsequently by notifying all 
parties to whom such discovery material was produced, in writing as soon as practicable. 
After receipt of such notification, the parties to whom production has been made will treat 
the discovery material and all copies as having been designated as CDM. 
4. 
The parties agree that the CDM, or any summary thereof, shall be used solely 
for the purpose of this Action and for no other purpose without prior written approval from 
the Court or the prior written consent of the Producing Party and the Intervenors. All persons 
receiving or given access to CDM in accordance with the terms of this Protective Order 
consent to the continuing jurisdiction of this Court for the purposes of enforcing this 
Protective Order and remedying any violations thereof. 
5. a. CDM shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the following categories of 
persons: 
(i) The Court (and any appellate court), including court personnel.

such transcripts, with the consent of counsel. 
(iii) Plaintiffs' attorneys who appear as counsel of record in this case, including the 
attached list of paralegals, clerical, secretarial and other staff employed or retained by such 
counsel, provided that such staff and employees also comply with the provisions of 
Paragraph 6 hereof. 
(iv) Retained consulting or testifying experts, advisors and consultants, including 
persons directly employed by such experts, advisors and consultants ( collectively "experts") 
but only to the extent necessary to perform their work in connection with this Action. 
(v) Any additional persons as counsel for the parties and Intervenors shall consent to 
in writing before the proposed disclosures. 
b. 
All parties and their respective counsel, paralegals and employees and 
assistants of all counsel receiving the COM shall take all steps reasonably necessary to 
prevent disclosure of the COM other than in accordance with the terms of this Protective 
Order. 
c. 
Disclosure of the COM other than in accordance with the terms of this 
Protective Order may subject the disclosing person to such sanctions and remedies as this 
Court may deem appropriate, including without limitation, contempt, injunctive relief and 
damages.

6. 
No copies of any COM shall be made or delivered to any person other than 
those categories of persons referred to in paragraph S above, and even then only in 
accordance with paragraphs 7 and 8 herein. 
7. 
COM may only be disclosed to persons who are not included in those 
categories referred to in paragraph S.a. above, upon prior written consent of the Producing 
Party's and Intervenors' counsel. If either the Producing Party's counsel or the Intervenors' 
counsel refuses to give consent, the COM shall not be disclosed. The Receiving Parties may 
apply to the Court for an order of relief, on notice to the Producing Party and Intervenors. 
8. 
Any person referred to in paragraphs S.a.iii through 5.a.v above who is 
furnished a copy of any COM shall first be given a copy of this Protective Order and required 
to read it and be bound by its terms. 
9. 
At any time during this Action, the Receiving Parties may challenge the 
designation of COM as confidential by written notice to the Producing Party's counsel and 
counsel for the Intervenors specifying by exact bates number the materials in dispute and the 
precise nature of the dispute with regard to each document or portion thereof. The parties 
and Intervenors shall have twenty (20) days from receipt of the written notice to determine 
if the dispute can be resolved without judicial intervention and, if not, the Receiving Parties 
amy move for an Order removing the confidential designation. The Receiving Parties shall 
have the burden of proof on such a motion to establish good cause for removing the 
confidential designation and treatment.

10. 
No party shall be obligated to challenge the propriety of any designation, and 
a failure to do so shall not preclude a subsequent challenge on the propriety of such 
designation and shall not constitute an admission that any information is, in fact, confidential. 
11. 
In the event a party seeks to file any pleading, brief or memorandum or other 
document purporting to reproduce, paraphrase or summarize any CDM or portions thereof, 
that party shall take appropriate action to insure that the documents receive proper protection 
from public disclosure and shall seek leave of Court to file the document under seal in 
accordance with Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida. 
12. 
a. 
In the event that a party intends to file COM with the Court in support 
of, or in opposition to, a non-discovery motion (e.g. motion for summary judgment or any 
other dispositive or substantive motion), the filing party shall take appropriate action to 
insure that the documents receive proper protection from public disclosure and shall seek 
leave of Court to file the document under seal in accordance with the local rules. 
b. 
The non-discovery motion filing and briefing schedule shall be adjusted 
and tolled to provide sufficient time for the Court to consider and rule on the motion seeking 
permission to file the document(s) under seal. 
c. 
Once the matter has been resolved, the filing party may file the 
document(s) in accordance with the parties' and Intervenors' agreement and/or the Court's 
instructions, as applicable.

13. 
The CDM and/or other papers which are filed under seal shall be kept under 
seal until further order of the Court; however, said CDM and other papers filed under seal 
shall be available to the Court and counsel of record, and to all other persons entitled to 
receive the confidential information contained therein under the terms of this Protective 
Order. 
14. 
This Protective Order is intended to provide a mechanism for the handling of 
the CDM and is not intended to imply that any CDM is relevant or admissible in this Action 
or any other litigation. Any party may move for relief from, or general or particular 
modification of, the mechanism for maintaining confidentiality herein set forth, or the 
application of this Protective Order in any particular circumstance, and each party 
specifically reserves all rights to object to the relevance or admissibility of any information 
produced in accordance with this Protective Order on any grounds it may deem appropriate. 
15. 
If a party receiving CDM in accordance with the terms of this Protective Order 
is served with a subpoena or other process by any court, administrative or legislative body, 
or any other person or organization which calls for the production of any CDM, the party to 
whom the subpoena or other process is directed shall, within two business days of its service, 
notify the opposing party or parties and the Intervenors of the pendency of such subpoena or 
order and provide them with a copy of the subpoena or process and the date by which 
compliance is requested. Any party or the Intervenors opposing the production of the

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-12     Filed 06/30/16     Page 9 of 10
information demanded in the subpoena or process shall notify the party served of its 
objections as early as possible prior to the requested compliance date. 
16. 
This Protective Order may be amended with leave of Court, by the agreement 
of counsel for the parties and Intervenors in the form of a stipulation submitted to the Court 
for approval, or by the Court sua sponte after affording the parties and Intervenors the 
opportunity to be heard. If the parties and Intervenors cannot agree to an amendment, then 
a formal motion to amend must be filed with the Court. This Protective Order is intended 
to regulate the handling of CDM and documents during this litigation, but shall remain in full 
force and effect until modified, superseded or terminated on the record by agreement of the 
parties thereto or by order of the Court. 
17. 
All counsel of record in this Action shall make a good faith effort to comply 
with the provisions of this Protective Order and to ensure that their agents, employees and 
clients do so as well. In the event of a change of counsel, retiring counsel shall notify new 
counsel of their responsibilities under this Order. 
18. 
This Protective Order does not restrict or limit the use ofCDM at any hearing 
or trial, which may be the subject of a further protective order and/or appropriate court 
orders. Prior to any hearing or trial at which the use of CDM is anticipated, the parties and 
Intervenors shall meet and confer regarding the use of the CDM. If the parties and 
Intervenors cannot agree, the parties and Intervenors shall request the Court to rule on such 
procedures. Notwithstanding, this Protective Order shall remain in full force and effect until 

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM   Document 247-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/02/2014   Page 9 of 9

modified, superseded, terminated on the record by agreement of the parties and Intervenors 
or by order of the Court. 
19. 
Within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of this Action, whether by 
judgment, settlement or otherwise, including conclusion of any appeal, all CDM including 
but not limited to materials furnished to consultants and/or experts shall be returned to the 
Producing Party unless the parties stipulate to destruction in lieu of return; provided, 
however, that counsel of record in this case may retain for their files, copies of any of their 
work product, pleadings, court filings, brief, and exhibits, which incorporate or contain

Lawyers Acknowledge Mistake In Filing Sexual Misconduct Charges Against Professor Dershowitz 
Professor Alan M. Dershowitz released the following statement regarding resolution of the case styled 
Bradley Edwards, et al. v. Alan M. Dershowitz, Case No. CACE 15-000072 (Cir. Ct., Broward Cnty., Fla.). 
STATEMENT OF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ 
I am pleased that the litigation has concluded and I am gratified by the  
Joint Statement issued today by Jeffrey E. Streitfeld on behalf of the parties, in which 
“Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a mistake to have filed sexual misconduct 
accusations against Dershowitz and the sexual misconduct accusations made in all public 
filings (including all exhibits) are hereby withdrawn.”  Mr. Streitfeld’s announcement and 
the Joint Statement are copied below. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY JEFFREY E. STREITFELD, FLORIDA SUPREME COURT CERTIFIED CIRCUIT CIVIL 
MEDIATOR (Streitfeldlaw.com) 
It is my pleasure to report that Bradley J. Edwards, Paul G. Cassell, and Alan M. 
Dershowitz have resolved their disputes and have agreed to settle the claims raised in an 
action pending in the Broward County, Florida Circuit Court. Since being appointed by 
Circuit Court Judge Thomas Lynch IV last fall, it has been a privilege to act as the mediator 
and assist the parties and their counsel toward this agreed resolution. I want to extend my 
appreciation for the professionalism exhibited by the parties and their counsel with whom 
I worked directly: Jack Scarola, Rick Simpson, Tom Scott, and Ken Sweder. As part of their 
agreement, the parties have issued the attached Joint Statement. 
JOINT STATEMENT OF BRAD EDWARDS, PAUL CASSELL AND ALAN DERSHOWITZ REGARDING 
SETTLEMENT 
Brad Edwards, Paul Cassell and Alan Dershowitz have today settled their pending 
defamation claims in which Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz and Dershowitz 
counterclaimed against Edwards and Cassell. The case was about Dershowitz’s public 
claims that Edwards and Cassell, as the attorneys for Virginia Roberts, had failed to perform 
the necessary due diligence before filing the allegations of their client, not whether the acts 
of alleged misconduct in fact occurred. Edwards and Cassell vigorously denied the 
contention that they had acted improperly and asserted that it defamed them. Dershowitz 
countersued Edwards and Cassell, alleging they had falsely accused him of sexual contact 
with Roberts—a claim he vigorously denied and that Dershowitz asserted defamed him. 
Edwards and Cassell maintain that they filed their client’s allegations in good faith and 
performed the necessary due diligence to do so, and have produced documents detailing 
those efforts. Dershowitz completely denies any such misconduct, while not disputing 
Roberts’s statements that the underlying alleged misconduct may have occurred with 
someone else. Dershowitz has produced travel and other records for the relevant times 
which he relies on to establish that he could not have been present when the alleged 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-15     Filed 06/30/16     Page 2 of 3

misconduct occurred. He has also produced other evidence that he relies upon to refute 
the credibility of the allegations against him. 
The parties believe it is time to take advantage of the new information that has come to 
light on both sides during the litigation and put these matters behind them. 
Given the events that have transpired since the filing of the documents in the federal 
court and in this action in which Dershowitz was accused of sexual misconduct, including 
the court order striking the allegations in the federal court filings, and the records and 
other documents produced by the parties, Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a 
mistake to have filed sexual misconduct accusations against Dershowitz; and the sexual 
misconduct accusations made in all public filings (including all exhibits) are hereby 
withdrawn. Dershowitz also withdraws his accusations that Edwards and Cassell acted 
unethically. 
Neither Edwards, Cassell, nor Dershowitz have any intention of repeating the allegations 
against one another.

(Case called) 
THE COURT:  Welcome back.  I have read the papers. 
Who knows.  I might have missed something, but I think I've got 
it fairly well under control.  I would be pleased to hear 
anything anybody wants to tell me in addition to what you've 
already given me. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley.  I 
would like to start, if it's convenient with the Court, with 
the pro hac vice motions that are pending because we would like 
counsel to be able to anticipate in these proceedings.  Would 
that be all right if I started with that? 
THE COURT:  I don't care. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you.  Your Honor, you have before 
you two pro hac vice motions.  My client, Virginia Giuffre, 
would like to have counsel of record in the case be added as 
Professor Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards.  We have presented 
those pro hacs to your Honor.  This is the first time in my 
years of practice that I've had a contested one, so I've looked 
at the case law surrounding that and I think it is very clear 
that a client is entitled to counsel of choice in a case. 
In this matter she has selected these lawyers.  They 
have been working with her.  They had been working on this 
matter for many months now.  We need them as counsel of record 
in the case now because we are going to have depositions 
throughout the country where, for example, Professor Cassell is

in Utah.  He will be able to handle the Colorado depositions 
and things of that nature.  We are here because those pro hac 
vice motions are being contested.  The core piece of that is 
the argument that they should not be allowed to seek 
confidential information in this case. 
Your Honor will remember that I was before you a 
couple of weeks ago again trying to get the deposition of the 
defendant, which is set for tomorrow, but still hasn't occurred 
yet.  And in order to expedite that process I agreed to the 
protective order that was put in front of the Court and I 
waived all of my objections to that in order to be able to 
facilitate and move that deposition forward.  That protective 
order provides that attorneys who are actively working on the 
case can receive confidential material. 
My opposing counsel has interpreted that to mean that 
that must be a counsel of record in the case.  We disagree with 
that interpretation.  I wouldn't have agreed to a protective 
order knowing that they were already working on the case.  If 
that were the situation, as your Honor can understand in this 
case, the majority of the material has been marked 
confidential, so it would prohibit my cocounsel from working on 
behalf of their client. 
Your Honor, I'm here to request on behalf of my 
client, Virginia Giuffre, that she be entitled to have her 
counsel of record of choice in this matter.  If your Honor will

MR. CASSELL:  Good morning, your Honor, Paul Cassell. 
I'm a law professor. 
THE COURT:  I don't want to hear it.  Sorry.  No. 
Thanks very much. 
MR. CASSELL:  Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Anything from the defense. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Yes, your Honor.  Jeff Pagliuca on 
behalf of Ms. Maxwell. 
Your Honor, I have never opposed a pro hac motion in 
my 34 years of practice, so this is a first for me.  But it is 
clear, your Honor, that these lawyers will be witnesses in this 
case. 
THE COURT:  This we don't know.  I can't make that 
determination now.  Anything else? 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Yes. 
THE COURT:  You may be totally right, but I don't 
know. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, here is the problem.  This 
case is about the plaintiff's false allegations. 
THE COURT:  Yes.  I think I picked up on that. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  These are the lawyers that wrote the 
false allegations. 
THE COURT:  I think I picked up on that, too.

MR. PAGLIUCA:  These are the lawyers that admitted 
that these were false allegations. 
THE COURT:  I know.  I don't have to tell you, you 
know, there is going to be all kinds of privilege issues, all 
kinds of issues about whether or not they have to testify.  We 
are not at that stage.  I cannot and I will not decide that 
now. 
What else? 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  There is a problem with the sharing of 
confidential information with these lawyers.  These lawyers 
have both personal and professional interests. 
THE COURT:  I understand that.  I get that point. 
Anything else? 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  No, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  This is what we will do on the pro hac. 
Everybody agrees, nobody, maybe in the world, but nobody in 
this courtroom, including me, has dealt with this kind of 
problem before.  That's perhaps only one of a number of issues 
that are unique about this case.  That's neither here nor 
there.  Clearly, the plaintiff has the right to consult with 
any lawyer she chooses.  However, the materials here are 
sensitive.  I don't know the extent to which they have been 
designated confidential, but I'm quite sure that a substantial 
number of them have been, by the very nature of the case, I 
guess.  Let me put it this way.  I want to be sure that we 
                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
                             (212) 805-0300

enforce the confidentiality appropriately. 
Now, with those preliminary thoughts in mind I am 
going to deny the motion at this time because I know that there 
is a statement, some kind of a statement from the mediator in 
the Florida action.  When I get a piece of paper that says the 
Florida action is dismissed, a court order or whatever, then 
this motion can be renewed. 
Also, I want an affidavit from the two lawyers that 
there is no matter in which they are personally involved, that 
they are making no claim, there is no claims, there is no 
litigation in which they are involved.  The reason I say that 
is that I would not grant the application for a pro hac status 
to a party in this or a related litigation.  If I get those 
affidavits and the statement about the closure of the Florida 
case in which they are a party, then the application can be 
renewed and at that point I would be probably inclined, unless 
something else comes up or unless the defense tells me 
something that I don't now know, I would grant the application 
that brings us to the order itself and the meaning of the 
order.  I think active in the litigation is the key phrase. 
The plaintiff has listed the people that she considers would be 
appropriate and it's these two gentleman and I think one other 
person, and that's fine.  That is the definition. 
However, I'm also going to ask the parties to agree 
upon an order that would expand the confidentiality agreement

to this extent, to require the plaintiff to indicate to me and 
to the defense if there is anyone else who is going to be 
active in the litigation.  I'll tell you why I feel this way. 
I want to be sure that we can enforce the confidential aspect 
of that agreement, and I think that could be critical down the 
line.  That's the reason for those requests. 
Now, we also have a motion to compel. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, can I just get 
clarification very quickly because I don't want to have to come 
back to the court so I want to make sure I'm following 
correctly.  Your ruling, because we have a deposition tomorrow 
that counsel was going to be assisting me with, particularly on 
the Fifth Amendment -- 
THE COURT:  Can't have access unless I get these 
materials by then.  If I do, that's something else.  If I do, 
fine.  Otherwise, they can't have access to the confidential 
data.  They can assist. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Can I just point something out to the 
Court as well. 
THE COURT:  The plaintiff can have any lawyer she 
wants.  The question is the confidential materials. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Can I just point the Court to one more 
issue, because this is their protective order.  They now said 
to the Court that these two individuals are witnesses or 
potential witnesses.  The protective order allows in Section G

confidential material to go to deponents, witnesses or 
potential witnesses. 
THE COURT:  That's a different issue.  I have not 
dealt with that.  Obviously anybody who is a witness may have 
access to the confidential material, because they have to buy 
into the confidentiality order in order to do that.  But they 
are outside of it at the moment. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your ruling is, they cannot attend the 
deposition tomorrow? 
THE COURT:  They can.  Anybody can attend the 
deposition that anybody wants to have, but they can't 
participate in it.  They can't have access to the confidential 
material until we get this matter straightened out.  Ok. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  I understand, your Honor. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, we will be designating the 
testimony as confidential. 
THE COURT:  You see.  There you go.  That's life.  I 
can't believe that this entire testimony is going to be 
confidential.  Honestly, you all are too much.  Ok.  If that's 
what you do, you know that's not going to work because not all 
of this stuff at issue is going be to confidential.  No, no 
way.  What is your name?  Ok.  We will deal with tomorrow's 
problem tomorrow.

on that? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, your Honor.  Laura Menninger on 
behalf of Ms. Maxwell.  I have taken the liberty, your Honor, 
of just making a very short little cheat sheet of the 
outstanding issues, if I may approach. 
THE COURT:  Yes.  It will be interesting to see if 
yours is the same as the one we have prepared.  Yours is much 
longer than ours. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I'm happy to address all 
of the ones on mine.  I certainly am also happy to take 
direction from the Court regarding issues that you believe to 
still be of more interest. 
THE COURT:  As I say, I've read your papers.  I would 
be pleased to hear anything you want to add that you think is 
not covered or you want to respond or anything like that. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, one of the largest and 
most significant pieces to us are the assertions by plaintiff 
that her own communications with law enforcement are somehow 
protected by -- 
THE COURT:  I'm prepared to deal with that. 
MS. MENNINGER:  The second one, your Honor, and it 
relates somewhat to the issues already presented on the pro hac 
motions, are our requests for the fee agreements with all of 
plaintiff's various 15 or so lawyers who purport to be 
representing her.  Your Honor, I can find no case law that

suggests that the agreements are privileged, as plaintiff 
argues.  She has refused to identify when these individuals 
began their representations, the nature of the representations. 
THE COURT:  There is a little confusion here, at least 
in my mind, as to what we are talking about.  I certainly 
understand the two gentlemen whose applications I have just 
dealt with and the third person, who I take it is affiliated 
with the Boies firm. 
Obviously, over time the plaintiff has probably 
conferred with other lawyers.  But who cares?  Let's assume she 
has talked to 20 more lawyers.  You want all those retainers? 
That doesn't make any sense.  What is the universe we are 
talking about? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I certainly understand all 
of the members of the Boies firm that currently represent her. 
The third individual, if I understand correctly, is a gentleman 
by the name of Stan Pottinger.  He is a lawyer of some renown. 
He is also an author of best-selling books.  He is listed quite 
frequently on plaintiff's privilege log as being part and 
parcel of advice being given to her on, quote/unquote, media 
issues. 
THE COURT:  That is one. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, there are other persons 
listed on their privilege log.  Many are listed as counsel for 
plaintiff, but others are listed.  Attorney giving advice to

THE COURT:  Is what you want the retainer agreements, 
if there are any, whatever the arrangements are, with anybody 
on the privilege log that is listed as rendering advice? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Yes, your Honor.  That, I think, would 
be appropriate because some of our biggest issues concern the 
privilege log. 
THE COURT:  I understand. 
What else? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, we have asked for, but 
been denied by plaintiff, her own deposition testimony in the 
Florida action.  In that case the Court entered a confidential 
order -- 
THE COURT:  I'm prepared to deal with it. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, the next topic are 
plaintiff's medical records. 
THE COURT:  I think I understand that.  There is one 
thing, though.  Are there any pre-'99 medical records? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, the case law is quite 
clear that injuries that were preexisting -- 
THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  Go ahead. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Plaintiff has alleged that the 
defamation of this action triggered or caused her to reflect 
back upon her alleged sexual abuse.  She has also alleged, for 
example, that many, several, three, I think, at last count, or

four individuals had sexually abused her prior to ever meeting 
Mr. Epstein. 
If she has evidence that she already was suffering 
from depression or some type of mental health disorder before 
meeting our client, Ms. Maxwell, or Mr. Epstein, then her 
flashbacks, if you will, could be related to other incidents 
that she has put out in the press.  And she, I believe, has 
also told the press that she was in a drug rehabilitation 
facility at the time that she met Mr. Epstein. 
Obviously, to the extent she was under the influence 
of drugs, which is what she has told the press, at the time she 
met him, she persisted in being addicted to drugs during the 
time that she knew Mr. Epstein, and it certainly relates to all 
of her requests for, I believe she has requested $30 million in 
damages, your Honor, not just from the defamation, but also 
harkening back to what she claims were her years as a sex abuse 
victim. 
THE COURT:  What's the basis of your statement that we 
will call it the flashback? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I believe -- 
THE COURT:  Because, quite frankly, I was unaware of 
that.  Is that my error?  Are you telling me something that's 
not quite right? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I believe that is what 
plaintiff has alleged in her complaint.  If you can give me a

moment.  To the extent she is now alleging she suffers from 
emotional distress from any preexisting -- 
THE COURT:  That's from the defamation. 
MS. MENNINGER:  She claims it's from the defamation. 
However, your Honor, if she has preexisting conditions that 
were truly the cause of whatever emotional injury she claims 
that she now possesses -- 
THE COURT:  Correct me if I'm wrong, and perhaps 
plaintiff will make it clear, my understanding is that the 
injuries alleged result from the claim of the alleged 
defamation, period. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, she has claimed emotional 
distress from the defamation, yes.  We are requesting evidence 
that would show that she has preexisting emotional conditions. 
THE COURT:  Not from the defamation. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Not from the defamation.  From the 
many, many other things that have occurred in her life 
predating even her meeting Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, as she 
has told the press, not because we told the press that. 
Your Honor, it is difficult, if not impossible, to 
address her claimed $30 million emotional distress from a 
defamation statement that was a denial of her allegations 
versus any emotional distress or emotional conditions she 
already had before any such statement was made. 
Similarly, your Honor, we have asked for discovery of

her claimed prior sexual abuse.  She has, again, put in the 
press a number of statements regarding that, and I can't 
imagine that it is to the extent she claims privacy now, those 
might be relevant in our case both on credibility and also 
damage issues. 
Your Honor, we have asked for a lot of other 
interrogatories and documents that go to her damage claims, her 
education records, her work history.  She has refused to answer 
any questions before where she has worked.  She has refused to 
answer any questions about where she went to school.  All of 
these are appropriate under the local rule for interrogatories. 
Finally, your Honor, we have asked for her contracts 
with media.  She has refused to disclose those.  She has 
refused to disclose her tax returns that show all of the 
payments that she has received from various media sources. 
THE COURT:  I take it your view of any funds from the 
media would operate to reduce her damages. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, it also shows her motive 
and bias in bringing this case.  To the extent she has been 
paid for her stories to the media, which she has, she has 
admitted that she has been paid hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for giving these stories to the media. 
But to the extent that she is now bringing this 
defamation claim, if she is still either planning to receive 
more money from the media, she has a motive and bias to make

her story consistent with her previous stories.  She has 
claimed $5 million in lost wages, your Honor.  This is a person 
who has worked primarily as a waitress in the last 15 years, 
until her media sensational story was purchased from her by 
some British press. 
THE COURT:  Anything else? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, the other issues are 
addressed in our papers.  We have highlighted her incomplete 
production on several fronts and her refusal to answer any 
interrogatories.  So I would rest on my papers with respect to 
the other arguments.  Thank you. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.  I'd like to be 
very clear here, your Honor.  Discovery production, I've tried 
to do that in our papers.  But listening to opposing counsel 
I'm concerned maybe she hasn't reviewed the documents we have 
produced.  We have clearly produced all of the media 
communications she has, including records -- 
THE COURT:  All the media. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  All of the media communications.  She 
has issued wildly broad requests in this case which we have 
complied with.  We ran over 200 search terms.  Her request No. 
5 alone seeks communications with over 100 individuals.  And we 
have complied, your Honor.  This is coming from the defendant 
who until Monday night, when you directed her to produce 
privileged information, has only produced two e-mails in this

case. 
Your Honor, we have complied with our production.  We 
have produced the materials that she is saying we have not 
produced.  It's incorrect.  We have produced her school records 
that we have.  We have produced her tax records that we have. 
We have produced all of those items that we have. 
With respect to her medical records I am going to 
direct you to the case that is cited in our brief as the Evanko 
case and it was a similar circumstance to here.  It was a Title 
VII case where there were emotional distress damages being 
alleged and the Court found that the other side could not have 
carte blanche ruling over all of her medical records from the 
time she was born to the present.  We met and conferred on two 
hours on their discovery requests, your Honor.  We agreed to 
produce all of her medical records that we had from 1999 to 
2002 and anything else we had that was related to the sexual 
abuse she endured at the hands of the defendant and 
Mr. Epstein.  We have agreed to produce those. 
We have already started producing those records from 
the various doctors, from the treating physicians.  Those are 
in their production.  Should they be entitled to things that 
happened prior to that?  Absolutely not, your Honor.  They are 
not entitled to a full-scale production of everything that's 
happened in this young lady's life.  She was abused by these 
individuals.  She shouldn't be reabused by having to disclose

things that happened prior to her time with them.  Your Honor, 
we do object to the production of that material. 
THE COURT:  The flashback allegation. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  I think what she may be referring to, I 
have not heard that term used, I think what she may be 
referring to was the fact that this is a defamation claim and 
the person who defamed my client was also an abuser, we allege. 
So when she is defamed by the person who abused her and that 
abuser is calling her a liar, that caused her significant 
emotional distress.  It's different than if some other 
individual that she had not had contact with called her a liar. 
When she is talking about a flashback, maybe that's what she is 
referring to, but we don't have the word flashback anywhere in 
our complaint. 
THE COURT:  No.  I made that up. 
There will be no claim by the plaintiff that the 
defamation caused her distress by making her aware or as a 
result of the prior sexual abuse. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  The sexual abuse by the defendants? 
THE COURT:  No. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sexual abuse by others. 
THE COURT:  Yes. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  No.  Sexual abuse that relates to the 
Epstein period, yes.

MS. McCAWLEY:  Prior to Epstein, no, no, she doesn't 
have a claim with respect to that. 
THE COURT:  Anything else? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, I just want to point out 
again that our production -- you asked us to complete that.  We 
have gone through and run over 200 search terms.  We have 
produced all of those communications she has had with all of 
those individuals.  The things that we have not produced are 
the criminal investigation records.  I know your Honor is going 
to address that.  I would like to be very clear there. 
The point there is that she has said in the motion to 
stay papers that she filed Tuesday that she needs to have that 
information so she can decide whether she is going to be 
asserting her Fifth Amendment privilege.  Truthful testimony 
shouldn't have to be crafted, your Honor.  She shouldn't need 
to know what agency is investigating her in order to decide 
whether or not she is going to be asserting her Fifth Amendment 
privilege. 
We do have with us, your Honor, for an in camera 
submission, if you would like it.  That is the way that courts 
have dealt with this issue in the past.  When there is a claim 
from an agency that the disclosure of that investigation could 
harm the investigation, we can submit that to you for in camera

review so you are aware of the ongoing investigation.  But it 
is my view that that needs to be protected. 
As you probably know, the history of these cases with 
Mr. Epstein, there were a variety of things that went on in 
that investigation, so there is reason to keep an investigation 
in this situation protected so that they can properly 
investigate and move forward with that without being inhibited 
by other individuals.  Your Honor, I would ask that that remain 
protected.  It's covered by her very, very broad requests, 
which is why we had to lodge those objections.  I would 
appreciate your Honor considering our arguments with respect to 
that issue. 
The other things, your Honor, that she has raised is, 
for example, she had asked for the Epstein settlement agreement 
and that was one of the things that she asked for.  We agreed 
to produce that if we got the waiver from Mr. Epstein because 
we can't produce it without that waiver. 
I believe that covers it, your Honor.  If you have any 
questions, I would be happy to answer them. 
THE COURT:  Thanks very much. 
Thank you all for all the clarification that you've 
given me.  I much appreciate it.

The plaintiff has told me that they have now supplied 
all the education and employment records that they have.  I 
think if there is any question about that, if the defense is 
skeptical, I would ask the counsel for the plaintiffs to make 
that statement on the record, not necessarily here, but by way 
of a statement to the Court and principally to the defendant. 
On the question of residences, that's, in my view, not 
a contention interrogatory because of the nature of this case. 
I think it's more like listing witnesses.  So I would say that 
the plaintiff should supply all residences. 
The Dershowitz deposition will be produced under the 
confidentiality provision.  As I read what I've been given, 
it's to be held in confidence and it will remain in confidence, 
but it will be produced. 
Yes, the tax returns should be produced.  15 years 
seems like -- I see.  Ok.  15 years. 
The medical records of the period '99 to 2002 will be 
produced and the plaintiff will indicate whether that 
production is complete or, if it isn't complete, when it will 
be complete. 
As for the pre-'99 medical records, based on where we 
are at the moment, I do not believe that those are relevant. 
Because the damage issue relates, in my view, solely to the 
defamation.  If that changes in any way, I will revisit that 
issue.

The criminal investigation.  Any materials that the 
plaintiff has with respect to any criminal investigations will 
be turned over except for any statements made by the plaintiff 
to law enforcement authority and those statements, if there are 
such, will be submitted in camera, and I will review them. 
I hope that clears up our problems.  Tell me if I have 
failed in my effort to do so.  Yes, ma'am. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, two quick things, I think. 
With respect to medical records, we also certainly believe that 
the period from the time the statement was made in January 2015 
until the present, because she has claimed emotional distress 
from that defamation -- 
THE COURT:  Sure, yes. 
MS. MENNINGER:  The problem is, we have asked through 
interrogatory what were the names of the medical providers 
because they have not disclosed who her medical providers were. 
So there is no way for us to tell whether the records in fact 
have been sought from and produced with respect to each of 
those medical providers.  I will say that other records in the 
possession of plaintiff lists other doctors who they have not 
asked for records from or releases. 
THE COURT:  Let's see if we can clear that up. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  We have disclosed the names.  She has 
those names.  We have also disclosed records, the more recent 
records.  We have not contested that.

With respect to the interrogatories, your Honor ruled 
on this previously, but there is a local Rule 33.3, which is 
why we didn't serve interrogatories in this case at this point. 
She is deposing the plaintiff in two weeks, next week, whenever 
it is, and can certainly ask those questions as well.  But we 
have disclosed the names of the providers. 
MS. MENNINGER:  They have not, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Look.  Wait just a moment.  You two are 
lawyers.  Now, that is not an issue about which you should 
differ.  Go over in the corner right now, both of you, and 
let's make it clear who is telling me the right story.  Now. 
I take it that I misunderstood the colloquy and that 
this matter has been resolved. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, I think there was a 
misunderstanding with respect -- 
THE COURT:  I was sure. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Dr. Olsen has been noticed for 
deposition in Colorado already.  In my view, we have disclosed 
the doctors.  Ms. Menninger says that there is other doctors 
that have been disclosed in documents that we have not yet 
listed to her.  I think in discovery we are finding 
additional -- 
THE COURT:  You think you may not have discovered that 
your client has had some doctors -- 
MS. McCAWLEY:  In the past.  We are talking about

years and years ago.  The recent doctors we have disclosed they 
have noticed for deposition. 
THE COURT:  What else? 
MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, with respect to the 
employment and education records, as you heard plaintiff say, 
she has disclosed, quote/unquote, what she has.  Under local 
rule 33.3, we are allowed to ask for the names of witnesses 
with knowledge at the outset of the case, and they might be 
custodians of records.  We asked her who have been your 
employers.  She won't tell us who her employers have been.  She 
has just gone through her computer and say if I have an 
employment record I'll give it to you, but I am not going to 
tell you who her employers were. 
THE COURT:  She will. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Same thing with the education records. 
We asked her to list where she had gone to school and tell us 
where it is.  She won't do it.  Those are the things where my 
skepticism arises from. 
Largely, to the extent your Honor has ordered the 
production of whatever materials, criminal investigation 
materials that were not to be submitted in camera, those were 
the ones that involved plaintiff's statements, we would like 
the other materials that they have brought with them today to 
give to your Honor that do not encompass their client's 
statements to law enforcement.

THE COURT:  I don't know whether there are such.  Is 
it possible that nothing in this lawsuit is clear?  Well, I 
tried to make it clear what should be produced and what 
shouldn't.  Anything that has been submitted to any law 
enforcement officer by the plaintiff I will take in camera. 
Anything other than that with respect to any law enforcement 
should be produced. 
MS. MENNINGER:  Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Thank you, all.  I think we have the 
pleasure of your company -- do we need you next week?  We are 
up to date, aren't we? 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, we have a motion with 
respect to our discovery that's set for next Thursday. 
THE COURT:  That's fine. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Just before we adjourn, because 
Mr. Cassell had a question, and I just want to make sure that I 
understand, with respect to tomorrow's deposition, they are 
entitled to attend but have to leave the room if confidential 
information is disclosed? 
THE COURT:  That's where we are at the moment, unless 
it changes. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, with regard to next 
Thursday, both Ms. Menninger and I have other matters that are 
previously scheduled and it would be impossible for us to take 
care of those matters and be here at the same time.  I'm

wondering what the Court would like to do about that. 
THE COURT:  First of all, you know how we play this 
game.  You don't ask me first.  You ask your opponent first. 
Have you done that? 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  I have not, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Will you? 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  I certainly will, your Honor. 
THE COURT:  Now. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Absolutely. 
THE COURT:  You can go over to the corner, too. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  I think we need a corner bar on this, 
your Honor. 
Ms. McCawley, I'm wondering if we can get a mutually 
convenient date to hear that matter as opposed to next 
Thursday. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Of course. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  That was simple enough, your Honor. 
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, one more thing.  I didn't 
realize that my counsel can submit that stipulation to you 
because that case has been settled -- 
THE COURT:  If I get something that closes that case 
and I get the affidavit that there are no other matters in 
which they have any claims or defenses relating to any of these 
statements, that will do it.

that by fax this afternoon, will they be able to attend the 
deposition tomorrow? 
THE COURT:  I would think so, if I think those are 
adequate representations and so on.  The statement from a 
mediator doesn't mean anything to me.  Something that has a 
court sign to it.  That I understand.  But the mediator saying 
that it's settled doesn't work for me. 
MR. CASSELL:  Your Honor, maybe Mr. Edwards could 
briefly explain Florida procedure.  The case has been 
dismissed, but it does not require a Court's signature. 
Mr. Edwards can elaborate more fully on that. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Sure.  If I may.  There are two ways in 
which a case can be dismissed in Florida.  One is by way of a 
court order.  The other is by way of a stipulation.  That is 
what was done.  There was a stipulation of dismissal signed by 
both parties, that being the plaintiff and the defendants and 
counsel, that has been done and that was dismissed. 
THE COURT:  That's filed in the case. 
MR. EDWARDS:  That's filed in the case and filed in 
the court. 
THE COURT:  Do you have a copy of that? 
MR. EDWARDS:  I can get a copy of it immediately. 
THE COURT:  Give it to the defense.  If they have any 
problems, they will let me know.  That sounds all right to me.

Your representation sounds right. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Additionally, just with respect to the 
affidavit, there needs to be an affirmation that we have no 
other claims that relate to the statements in this case.  Is 
that what we are saying? 
THE COURT:  I think it should be broader than that.  I 
think it should be -- look.  I don't think it would be 
appropriate if there is any possibility for either of you to 
being a party.  That's what I'm after.  And having any 
proceedings against you arising out of the situation with the 
plaintiff.  I think it would be inappropriate for you to be 
counsel if you have the potentiality of being a party, either 
plaintiff or defendant, in any proceedings.  If I get an 
affidavit saying that you're unaware of any claims against you 
or any intention to make a claim arising out of the 
circumstances surrounding this lawsuit, that should be broad. 
I think that would satisfy me. 
MR. EDWARDS:  Ok. 
MR. CASSELL:  I'll be filing those materials this 
afternoon, your Honor.  My plan is to attend -- 
THE COURT:  The defense has a thought on this. 
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, I am looking at documents 
from Florida.  One is a docket sheet captioned:  Epstein v.

MR. PAGLIUCA:  There is still snow on the ground, your

COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter "EPSTEIN"), by and through his 
undersigned attorneys, files this action against Defendants, SCOTT ROTHSTEIN, 
individually, BRADLEY J. EDWARDS, individually, and L.M., individually. Accordingly, 
EPSTEIN states: 
SUMMARY OF ACTION 
Attorney Scott Rothstein aided by other lawyers and employees at the firm 
of Rothstein, Rosenfeldt, and Adler, P.A. for personal greed and enrichment, in betrayal 
of the ethical, legal and fiduciary duties to their own clients and professional obligations 
to the administration of justice, deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that 
involved a staggering series of gravely serious obstructions of justice, actionable frauds, 
and the orchestration and conducting of egregious civil litigation abuses that resulted in 
profoundly serious injury to Jeffrey Epstein one of several targets of their misconduct 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 3 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page2 
and others. 
Rothstein and RRA's fraud had no boundary; Rothstein and his co-
conspirators forged Federal court orders and opinions. Amongst the violations of law 
that are the subject of this lawsuit are the marketing of non-existent Epstein settlements 
and the sanctioning of a series of depositions that were unrelated to any principled 
litigation purpose but instead designed to discover extraneous private information about 
Epstein or his personal and business associates (including well-known public figures) in 
order to defraud investors and support extortionate demands for payment from Epstein. 
The misconduct featured the filing of legal motions and the pursuit of a civil litigation 
strategy that was unrelated to the merits or value of their clients' cases and, instead, 
had as its improper purpose the furthering of Rothstein's misrepresentations and deceit 
to third party investors. As a result, Epstein was subject to abusive investigatory tactics, 
unprincipled media attacks, and unsupportable legal filings. This lawsuit is filed and will 
be vigorously pursued against all these defendants. The Rothstein racketeering 
enterprise endeavored to compromise the core values of both state and federal justice 
systems in South Florida and to vindicate the hardworking and honest lawyers and their 
clients who were adversely affected by the misconduct that is the subject of this 
Complaint. 
Plaintiff reserves the right to add additional defendants - co-conspirators as the 
facts and evidence is developed. 
GENERAL ALLEGATONS 
1. This is an action for damages in excess of $15,000.00, exclusive costs, interest, 
and attorneys' fees.

Page 3 
2. 
Plaintiff, EPSTEIN, is an adult and currently is residing and works in Palm Beach 
County, Florida. 
3. 
Defendant, SCOTT ROTHSTEIN ("ROTHSTEIN"), is an individual residing in 
Broward County, Florida, and was licensed to practice law in the State of Florida. In 
November 2009, ROTHSTEIN voluntarily relinquished his law license in the midst of the 
implosion of Rothstein, Rosenfeldt and Adler, P.A. ("RRA"). He was disbarred by the 
Florida Supreme Court on November 20, 2009. On December 1, 2009, ROTHSTEIN 
was arrested and arraigned in Federal Court in Broward County, Florida. 
4. At all times relevant hereto, ROTHSTEIN was the managing partner and CEO of 
RRA. 
5. Defendant, ROTHSTEIN and Stuart Rosenfeldt, are and were the principal 
owners of equity in RRA and each co-founded RRA. 
6. 
Defendant, BRADLEY J. EDWARDS ("EDWARDS"), is an individual residing in 
Broward County, Florida and is licensed to practice law in the State of Florida. At all 
times relevant hereto, EDWARDS was an employee, agent, associate, partner, 
shareholder, and/or other representative of RRA. 
7. 
Defendant, L.M. ("L.M."), is an individual residing in Palm Beach County, Florida. 
At all times relevant hereto, L.M. was represented by RRA, ROTHSTEIN and 
EDWARDS in a civil lawsuit against Epstein and was an essential participant in the 
scheme referenced infra by, among other things, substantially changing prior sworn 
testimony, so as to assist the Defendants in promoting their fraudulent scheme for the 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 5 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page4 
promise of a multi-million dollar recovery relative to the Civil Actions (defined below) 
involving Epstein, which was completely out of proportion to her alleged damages. 
8. 
Non-party, RRA is a Florida Professional Service Corporation, with a principal 
address of 401 East Las Olas Blvd., Suite 1650, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33401. In addition 
to its principal office, RRA also maintained seven offices in Florida, New York, and 
Venezuela, and employed over 70 attorneys and 200 support staff. RRA also maintains 
an office at 1109 NE 2d Street, Hallendale Beach, Florida 33009-8515. RRA, through 
its attorneys, including those named as Defendants herein, conducted business 
throughout Florida, and relevant to this action, conducted business and filed lawsuits on 
behalf of clients in Palm Beach County, Florida. 
(RRA is currently a debtor in 
bankruptcy. RRA is not named as a Defendant). 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
9. The United States in United States of America v. Scott W. Rothstein, Case No. 
09-60331CR-Cohn, United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, has 
brought an action for Racketeering Conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) against Scott W. 
Rothstein who was the chief executive officer and chairman of RRA. 
Within the 
information which was filed, the United States of America has identified the enterprise 
as being the law firm, RRA, through which Rothstein in conjunction with "his co-
conspirators" (not yet identified by the USA) engaged in the pattern of racketeering 
through its base of operation at the offices of RRA from sometime in 2005 up through 
and continuing into November of 2009. Through various criminal activities, including 
mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering, the United States of America asserts that 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 6 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page5 
Rothstein and his co-conspirators unlawfully obtained approximately $1.2 billion from 
investors by fraud in connection with a Ponzi scheme. The USA further alleges that 
"Rothstein and co-conspirators initiated the criminal conduct alleged in the instant 
Information in order to personally enrich themselves and to supplement the income and 
sustain the daily operation of RRA." In essence, in the absence of Rothstein and his co-
conspirators conducting the Ponzi scheme, the daily operation of RRA, which included 
payroll (compensation to lawyers, staff, investigators, etc.), accounts payable including 
unlimited improper, harassing and potential illegal investigation on cases, including 
Epstein-related matters, would in all likelihood would not have been sustainable. A copy 
of the information is attached as Exhibit 1 to this action. 
10. As more fully set forth herein, RRA held itself out as legitimately and properly 
engaging in the practice of law. In reality, ROTHSTEIN and others in RRA were using 
RRA to market investments, as described below, so as to bilk investors out of hundreds 
of millions of dollars. 
ROTHSTEIN and others in RRA devised an elaborate plan 
through which were sold purported confidential assignments of a structured pay-out 
settlements, supposedly reached on behalf of RRA for clients, in exchange for 
immediate payments to these clients of a discounted lump sum amount. Investors were 
being promised in excess of a 30% return on their investment which was to be paid out 
to the investors over time. While some of the cases relied upon to induce investor 
funding were existing filed cases, it is believed that the confidential, structured pay-out 
settlements were all fabricated.

Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page6 
11. Based on media reports, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) press 
conferences and releases and the Information the massive Ponzi scheme and pattern of 
criminal activity meant to lure investors began sometime in 2005 and continued through 
the fall of 2009, when the scheme was uncovered by some of the investors and the FBI. 
As of November of 2009, civil lawsuits were and continue to be filed against various 
Defendants as result of their massive fraudulent and criminal scheme. 
12. This fraudulent and illegal investment scheme is also evidenced by the filing of 
Amended Complaint For Dissolution And For Emergency Transfer of Corporate Powers 
to Stuart A. Rosenfeldt, Or, In The Alternative, For the Appointment of A Custodian or 
Receiver by ROSENFELDT, and RRA, against ROTHSTEIN, individually. (Case No. 09 
059301, In the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, 
Florida, Complex Business Div.), (hereinafter "RRA dissolution action, and attached 
hereto as Exhibit 2). 
13. Plaintiff references the RRA dissolution action for the sole purpose that it 
acknowledges that RRA and ROTHSTEIN were in fact conducting an illegal and 
improper investment or Ponzi scheme based on promises of financial returns from 
settlements or outcomes of supposed legal actions, including the actions brought 
against Plaintiff EPSTEIN. 
The RRA dissolution action alleges in part that -
"ROTHSTEIN, the managing partner and CEO of the firm (RRA), has, according to 
assertions of certain investors, allegedly orchestrated a substantial misappropriation of 
funds from investor trust accounts that made use of the law firm's name (RRA). The 
investment business created and operated by ROTHSTEIN centered around the sale of 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 8 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page7 
interests in structured settlements." See Preliminary Statement of RRA dissolution 
action, Exhibit 2 hereto. 
14. In furtherance of the scheme, RRA's letterhead was used in communications 
regarding investment opportunities in purported structured settlements. 
RRA's trust 
account was used to deposit hundreds of millions of dollars or wire transfer of monies 
from duped investors and other victims. RRA personally guaranteed payments. 
15. Rothstein's scheme went so far as to manufacture false and fraudulent Court 
opinions/orders including forging the signatures of U.S. District Judge, Kenneth A. 
Marra and U.S. Circuit Court Judge, Susan H. Black, 11 th Circuit in other cases. It is not 
yet known if he forged similar documents in Esptein related matters. See Composite 
Exhibit 3 hereto. 
16. The details of this fraudulent scheme are being revealed on a daily basis through 
various media reports and court documents. The most recent estimate of the financial 
scope of the scheme is that it exceeds $1.2 billion dollars. 
17. Relevant to this action, EPSTEIN is currently named as a defendant in three civil 
actions alleging, inter alia, sexual assault and battery that were handled by RRA and its 
attorneys including EDWARDS prior to its implosion - one of which is filed in federal 
court (Jane Doe v. Epstein, Case No. 08-CIV-80893, U.S.D.C. S.D. Fla.)(Jane Doe is a 
named Defendant herein), and two of which have been filed in state court in the 15th 
Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach County, State of Florida, (L.M. v. Epstein, Case No. 
502008CA028051XXXXMB AB; E.W. v. Epstein, Case No. 502008CA028058XXXXMB 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 9 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page8 
AB), (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Civil Actions," and L.M is a named 
Defendant herein). The Civil Actions were all filed in August and September of 2008. 
18. What is clear is that a fraudulent and improper investment or Ponzi scheme was 
in fact conducted and operated by RRA and certain of the named Defendants, which 
scheme directly impacted EPSTEIN as a named defendant in the Civil Actions. 
19. Miami attorney and developer, Alan Sakowitz, was quoted in a November 2009 
article as saying that he had met with ROTHSTEIN as a potential investor in August of 
2009, but became suspicious. He stated "I was convinced it was all a Ponzi scheme 
and I notified the FBI in detail how Scotty ROTHSTEIN was hiding behind a legitimate 
law firm to peddle fake investments." Attorney Sakowitz was also quoted as saying 
ROTHSTEIN had sophisticated eavesdropping equipment and former law enforcement 
officers who would sift through a potential defendants' garbage looking for damaging 
evidence to use with investors to show how potential defendants could be in essence 
blackmailed into paying settlement that far exceeded the value of any legitimate 
damage claim. 
20. Ft. Lauderdale attorney William Scherer represents multiple Rothstein related 
investors. He indicated in an article that RRNRothstein had used the "Epstein Ploy ... 
as a showpiece as bait. That's the way he raised all the money. He would use ... cases 
as bait for luring investors into fictional cases. All the cases he allegedly structured 
were fictional. I don't believe there was a real one in there." In fact, on November 20, 
2009, William Scherer, on behalf of certain clients, filed a 147 page Complaint against 
ROTHSTEIN, David Boden, Debra Villegas, Andrew Barnett, TD Bank, N.A., Frank 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 10 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page9 
Spinosa, Jennifer Kerstetter, Rosanne Caretsky and Frank Preve asserting various 
allegations that further prove the massive Ponzi scheme behind the RRA fa9ade; and 
as of November 25, 2009, a 249 page Amended Complaint naming additional 
Defendants was filed. 
21. In addition, and upon information and belief, ROTHSTEIN, David Boden, Debbie 
Villegas, Andrew Barnett, Michael Fisten and Kenneth Jenne (all employees of RRA) 
through brokers or middlemen would stage regular meetings during which false 
statements were made about the number of cases/clients that existed or RRA had 
against EPSTEIN and the value thereof. They would show and share actual case files 
from the EPSTEIN actions with hedge fund managers. Thus, the attorneys and clients 
have waived any attorney-client or work- product privileges that otherwise may have 
existed. 
22. Because potential investors were given access to some of the actual Civil Action 
files, investor-third parties may have became aware of a name of an existing Plaintiff 
who had filed anonymously against Epstein and had opposed disclosure of her legal 
name. 
23. In all other instances, by RRA, ROTHSTEIN and EDWARDS claiming the need 
for anonymity with regard to existing or fabricated clients, they were able to effectively 
use initials, Jane Doe or other anonymous designations which was a key element in the 
fraudulent scheme. Fictitious names could be created to make the investors believe 
many other cases existed against Epstein. 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 11 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 10 
24. In each of RRA's Civil Actions, the Plaintiffs are or were represented by RRA and 
its attorneys, including ROTHSTEIN and EDWARDS. 
25. In addition, investors were told that in addition to the Civil Actions another fifty 
(50) plus anonymous females were represented by RRA, with the potential for hundreds 
of millions of dollars in settlements, and that RRA and its attorneys would sue Epstein 
unless he paid exorbitant-settlement amounts to protect his high-profile friends. 
26. Upon information and belief, 
EDWARDS knew or should have known that 
ROTHSTEIN was utilizing RRA as a front for the massive Ponzi scheme and/or were 
selling an alleged interest or investment in the Civil Actions (and other claims) involving 
Epstein. 
27. Further evidencing that EDWARDS (and possibly other attorneys of RRA) knew 
or should have known and participated in the continuation of the massive Ponzi 
scheme, a front-page Palm Beach Post article, dated November 24, 2009, reported on 
the recent filing of an amended forfeiture complaint by prosecutors against "dozens of 
ROTHSTEIN's real estate properties, foreign cars, restaurants and other assets -
including $12 million in the lawyer's bank account in Morocco, along with millions more 
donated to political campaigns and charitable funds." The article further reported that -
Attorney Scott ROTHSTEIN tapped into millions of dollars from his massive 
investment scam to cover payroll costs at his expanding Fort Lauderdale 
law firm, federal authorities said in court records released Monday. 
ROTHSTEIN's law firm (RRA) generated revenue of $8 million in one 
recent year, yet his 70-lawyer law firm had a payroll of $18 million, 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 12 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 11 
prosecutors said. ROTHSTEIN, who owned half of RRA used investors' 
money from his Ponzi scheme to make up the shortfall, they said. 
Subsequent articles and court filings have reflected ROTHSTEIN received 
compensation in excess of $35.7 million in 2008 and $10.5 million in 2009, while 
his partner Rosenfeldt received greater than $6 million in 2008. 
28. ROTHSTEIN attempted to lure the entity known as D3 Capital Club, LLC, ("D3"), 
by offering D3 "the opportunity" to invest in a pre-suit $30,000,000.00 court settlement 
against EPSTEIN; yet this supposed settlement never existed and was entirely 
fabricated. To augment his concocted story, ROTHSTEIN, upon information and belief, 
invited D3 to his office to view thirteen (13) banker's boxes of case files in Jane Doe 
(one of the Civil Actions)1 in an attempt to substantiate that the claims against EPSTEIN 
were legitimate and that the evidence obtained against him by RRA, ROTHSTEIN, and 
EDWARDS (the "Litigation Team") was real. 
29. Upon information and belief, ROTHSTEIN and others offered other investors like 
the entity D3 fabricated investment opportunities in the Civil Actions involving EPSTEIN. 
Fisten (a former Dade County police officer with a questionable police record and RRA 
investigator) and Jenne (a former attorney, Broward County Sheriff and felon) assisted 
ROTHSTEIN in making these offers by providing confidential, privileged and work-
product information to prospective third-party investors. 
It appears that 13 out of the 40 boxes seized by the FBI as part of its investigation at RRA 
consisted of files relating to the Civil Actions involving EPSTEIN, as reported by counsel for the 
Bankruptcy Trustee. Until those boxes can be reviewed, as well as other discovery, Epstein will 
not know the depth of the fraud and those involved. 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 13 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 12 
30. By using the Civil Actions against EPSTEIN as "bait" and fabricating settlements 
regarding same, 
ROTHSTEIN and others were able to lure investors into 
ROTHSTEIN'S lair and bilked them of millions of dollars which, in turn, was used to fund 
the litigation against EPSTEIN for the sole purpose of continuing the massive Ponzi 
scheme. 
31. As part of this scheme, ROTHSTEIN and the Litigation Team, individually and in 
a concerted effort, may have unethically and illegally: 
a. Sold, allowed to be sold and/or assisted with the sale of an interest in non-
settled personal injury lawsuits (which are non-assignable and non-
transferable) or sold non-existent structured settlements (including those 
cases involving Epstein); 
b. Reached agreements to share attorneys fees with non-lawyers; 
c. Used investor money to pay plaintiffs (i.e., L.M., E.W. and Jane Doe) "up 
front" money such that plaintiffs would refuse to settle the Civil Actions; 
d. Conducted searches, wiretaps or intercepted conversations in violation of 
state or federal laws and Bar rules; and 
e. Utilized the judicial process including, but not limited to, unreasonable and 
unnecessary discovery, for the sole purpose of furthering the Ponzi 
scheme. 
32. Any such actions by ROTHSTEIN, and other attorneys, including the Litigation 
Team, directly or indirectly, would potentially be a violation of various Florida Bar Rules, 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 14 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 13 
including prohibiting the improper sharing of fees or costs and various conflicts of issues 
rules. 
33. Evidencing that the Litigation Team knew or should have known of the improper 
purpose that ROTHSTEIN was pursuing in the continuation of the scheme, 
ROTHSTEIN used RRA's Litigation Team in the EPSTEIN cases to pursue issues and 
evidence unrelated to and unnecessary to the claims pied in the Civil Actions, but 
significantly beneficial to lure investors into the Ponzi scheme orchestrated by 
ROTHSTEIN and other co-conspirators. 
34. Upon information and belief, ROTHSTEIN and others claimed their investigators 
discovered that there were high-profile individuals onboard Epstein's private jet where 
sexual assaults took place and showed D3 (and possibly others) copies of a flight log 
purportedly containing names of celebrities, dignitaries, and international figures. 
35. For instance, the Litigation Team relentlessly and knowingly pursued flight data 
and passenger manifests regarding flights EPSTEIN took with these famous individuals 
knowing full well that no underage women were onboard and no illicit activities took 
place. ROTHSTEIN and the Litigation Team also inappropriately attempted to take the 
depositions of these celebrities in a calculated effort to bolster the marketing scam that 
was taking place. 
36. One of Plaintiffs' counsel, EDWARDS, deposed three of EPSTEIN'S pilots, and 
sought the deposition of a fourth pilot (currently serving in Iraq). The pilots were 
deposed by EDWARDS for over twelve (12) hours, and EDWARDS never asked one 
question relating to or about E.W., L.M., and Jane Doe (RRA clients) as it related to 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 15 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 14 
transportation on flights of RRA clients on any of EPSTEIN'S planes. But EDWARDS 
asked many inflammatory and leading irrelevant questions about the pilots' thoughts 
and beliefs (which will never be admissible at trial) which could only have been asked 
for the purposes of "pumping" the cases and thus by using the depositions to sell the 
cases (or a part of them) to third parties. 
37. Because of these facts, ROTHSTEIN claimed that Epstein wanted to make 
certain none of these individuals would be deposed and therefore he had offered 
$200,000,000.00 to settle the claims of RRA female clients various potential plaintiffs in 
actions against EPSTEIN. The offer of a $200 million dollar settlement by EPSTEIN 
was completely fabricated; no such offer had ever been made. 
38. EDWARDS' office also notified Defendant that he intended to take the 
depositions of and was subpoenaing: 
(i) Donald Trump (real-estate magnate and business mogul); 
(ii) Alan Dershowitz (noted Harvard Law professor, constitutional attorney 
and one of EPSTEIN'S criminal defense attorneys); 
(iii)Bill Clinton (Former President of the United States); 
(iv)Tommy Mottola (former President of Sony Record); and 
(v) David Copperfield (illusionist). 
39. The above-named individuals were friends and acquaintances of EPSTEIN with 
whom he knew through business or philanthropic work over the years. None of the 
above-named individuals had any connection whatsoever with any of the Litigation 
Team's clients, E.W., L.M. or Jane Doe. 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 16 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 15 
40. EDWARDS filed amended answers to interrogatories in the state court matters, 
E.W. and L.M., and listed additional high profile witnesses that would allegedly be called 
at trial, including, but not limited to: 
(i) Bill 
Richardson 
(Governor of New Mexico, 
formerly 
U.S. 
Representative and Ambassador to the United Nations); and 
(ii) Any and all persons having knowledge of EPSTEIN'S charitable, 
political or other donations;2 
41. The sole purpose of the scheduling of these depositions or listing high profile 
friends/acquaintances as potential witnesses was, again, to "pump" the cases to 
investors. There is no evidence to date that any of these individuals had or have any 
knowledge regarding RRA's Civil Actions. 
42. In furtherance of their illegal and fraudulent scheme against EPSTEIN, 
ROTHSTEIN, EDWARDS (who either know or should have known) and, at times, L.M. 
in her Civil Action against EPSTEIN: 
a) Included claims for damages in Jane Doe's federal action in 
excess of $50,000,000.00 rather than simply alleging the 
jurisdictional limits. 
b) Organized a Jane Doe TV media interview without any legitimate 
legal purpose other than to "pump" the federal case for potential 
These high-profile celebrity "purported" witnesses have no personal knowledge regarding the facts on 
these "Three Cases", but were being contacted, subpoenaed or listed to harass and intimidate them and 
Epstein, and to add "star'' appeal to the marketing effort of the Ponzi scheme. 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 17 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 16 
investors or to prejudice Epstein's right to a fair trial in Palm 
Beach County. 
c) EDWARDS, Berger and Russell Adler (another named partner in 
RRA) all attended EPSTEIN's deposition. 
At that time, 
outrageous questions were asked of EPSTEIN which had no 
bearing on the case, but so that the video and questions could be 
shown to investors. 
d) Conducted and attempted to conduct completely irrelevant 
discovery unrelated to the claims in or subject matter of the Civil 
Actions for the purpose of harassing and embarrassing witnesses 
and EPSTEIN and causing EPSTEIN to spend tens of thousands 
of dollars in unnecessary attorneys' fees and costs defending 
what appeared to be discovery related to the Civil Actions but was 
entirely related to the furtherance of the Ponzi scheme. 
e) After EDWARDS was recruited and joined RRA in the spring of 
2009, the tone and tenor of rhetoric directed to cases against 
EPSTEIN used by Attorney EDWARDS and Berger changed 
dramatically in addressing the court on various motions from 
being substantive on the facts pied to ridiculously inflammatory 
and sound-bite rich such as the July 31, 2009, transcript when 
EDWARDS stated to the Court in E.W./L.M.: "What the evidence 
is really going to show is that Mr. Epstein - at least dating back as 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 18 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 17 
far as our investigation and resources have permitted, back to 
1997 or '98 - has every single day of his life, made an attempt to 
sexually abuse children. We're not talking about five, we're not 
talking about 20, we're not talking about 100, we're not talking 
about 400, which, I believe, is the number known to law 
enforcement, we are talking about thousands of children ... and it 
is through a very intricate and complicated system that he devised 
where he has as many as 20 people working underneath him that 
he is paying well to schedule these appointments, to locate these 
girls." 
f) As an example, EDWARDS filed an unsupportable and legally 
deficient Motion for Injunction Restraining Fraudulent Transfer of 
Assets, Appointment of a Receiver to Take Charge of Property of 
Epstein, and to Post a $15 million Bond to Secure Potential 
Judgment, in Jane Doe v. Epstein, Case No. 08-CV-80893-
Marra/Johnson. The motion was reported in the press as was the 
ultimate goal (i.e., to "pump" the cases for investor following). 
However, the Court found "Plaintiff's motion entirely devoid of 
evidence ... ", and denied the motion in toto. 
g) ROTHSTEIN told investors he had another 52 females that he 
represented, and that Epstein had offered $200 million to resolve, 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 19 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 18 
but that he could settle, confidently, these cases for $500 million, 
separate and apart from his legal fees. 
h) ROTHSTEIN and the Litigation Team knew or should have known 
that their three (3) filed cases were weak and had minimal value 
for the following reasons: 
(i) 
L.M. - testified she never had any type of sex with 
Epstein; worked at numerous strip clubs; is an 
admitted prostitute and call girl; has a history of 
illegal drug use (pot, painkillers, Xanax, Ecstasy); 
and continually asserted the 5th Amendment 
during her depositions in order to avoid answering 
relevant but problem questions for her; 
(ii) 
E.W. -
testified she worked at eleven (11) 
separate strip clubs, including Cheetah 
which 
RRA represented and in which ROTHSTEIN may 
have owned an interest; and E.W. also worked at 
Platinum Showgirls in Boynton Beach, which was 
the subject of a recent police raid where dancers 
were allegedly selling prescription painkillers and 
drugs to customers and prostituting themselves. 
(iii) 
Jane Doe (federal case) seeks $50 million from 
Epstein. 
She and her attorneys claim severe 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 20 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 19 
emotional distress as a result of her having 
voluntarily gone to Epstein's home. She testified 
that there was never oral, 
and or sexual 
intercourse; nor did she ever touch his genitalia. 
Yet, Jane Doe suffered extreme emotional distress 
well prior to meeting Epstein as a result of having 
witnessed her father murder his girlfriend's son. 
She was required to give sworn testimony in that 
matter and has admitted that she has lied in sworn 
testimony. Jane Doe worked at two different strip 
clubs, including Platinum Showgirls in Boynton 
Beach. 
i) Conducted 
ridiculous 
and 
irrelevant 
discovery 
such 
as 
subpoenaing records from an alleged sex therapist, Dr. Leonard 
Bard in Massachusetts, when the alleged police report reflected 
that EPSTEIN had only seen a chiropractor in Palm Beach named 
Dr. Bard. No records relating to EPSTEIN existed for this alleged 
sex therapist, Dr. Bard, and the alleged subpoena for records was 
just another mechanism to "pump" the cases for investor appeal; 
j) Allowed a Second Amended Complaint to be filed on behalf of 
L.M. alleging that EPSTEIN forced the minor into "oral sex," yet 
L.M. testified that she never engaged in oral, anal, or vaginal 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 21 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 20 
intercourse with EPSTEIN and she had never touched his 
genitalia. 
k) Told investors, as reported in an Associated Press article, that 
celebrities and other famous people had flown on EPSTEIN'S 
plane when assaults took place. Therefore, even though none 
(zero) of RRA's clients claim they flew of EPSTEIN'S planes, the 
Litigation Team sought pilot and plane logs. Why? Again, to 
prime the investment "pump" with new money without any 
relevance to the existing claims made by the RRA clients. 
I) After EDWARDS joined RRA, EDWARDS and former Circuit 
Judge William Berger filed and argued motion to make the Non-
Prosecution Agreement (NPA) between Epstein and USAO 
public. But, RRA, EDWARDS and Berger, and their three clients, 
already had a copy of the NPA. They knew what it said and they 
knew the civil provisions in the agreement had no impact 
whatsoever on the three pending Civil Actions. 
The concept behind certain civil provisions in the NPA was 
to allow an alleged victim to resolve a civil claim with Epstein, 
maintain her complete privacy and anonymity and move on with 
her life. 
As an assistant United States Attorney stated at a 
hearing in federal court, the NPA was not designed "to hand them 
a jackpot or a key to a bank." 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 22 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 21 
43. ROTHSTEIN, with the intent and improper motive to magnify his financial gain 
so continue to fund the fraudulent and illegal investment and/or Ponzi scheme, had 
EDWARDS demand excessive money from EPSTEIN in the Civil Actions. 
44. The actions described in paragraph 42 above herein had no legitimate purpose in 
pursuing the Civil Actions against EPSTEIN, but rather were meant to further the 
fraudulent scheme and criminal activity of ROTHSTEIN so that he and others could 
fraudulently overvalue the settlement value of the existing and non-existent claims 
against EPSTEIN to potential investors. 
45. As a result of the fraudulent investment or (Ponzi) scheme, RRA and its 
attorneys in the Civil Actions against EPSTEIN may have compromised their clients' 
interests. ROTHSTEIN and the Litigation Team would have been unable to give 
unbiased legal counsel because outside investor(s) had been promised a financial 
interest in the outcome of the actions. Additionally, if a plaintiff received payments from 
investment monies while her action is pending, this clearly could impact the plaintiffs 
decision of whether or not to settle the current litigation or shade their testimony (i.e. 
commit perjury) to gain the greatest return on the investment and to further promote the 
Ponzi Scheme. 
46. 
The truthfulness of L.M.'s allegations and testimony in L.M.'s state civil 
action have been severely compromised by the need to seek a multi-million dollar 
payout to help maintain RRA's massive fraud. Because fictitious settlements of tens of 
millions of dollars in cases relating to EPSTEIN were represented to "investors" in this 
Ponzi scheme, RRA and the attorneys in the Civil Actions needed to create a fiction that 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 23 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 22 
included extraordinary damages. However, the actual facts behind her action would 
never support such extraordinary damages. Therefore, extraordinary measures were 
undertaken to create an entirely inflated value of her claims against EPSTEIN. 
a. Though she held herself out as a "victim" of Epstein, she admitted to having 
returned over and over again to him despite her current claim of abuse. She 
has now admitted, under oath, to being a call girl/escort since the age of 15. 
(in her deposition September 24, 2009 Transcript "OT" 280:16-19). 
She 
testified "Well, I lived life as a prostitute," (see OT 156:7) and "I am a 
prostitute when I make money" (see OT 156:12-13). 
L.M. admitted her 
activity with men other than Epstein to making $1,000 a day from prostitution 
on maybe more than 20 occasions in one year alone (OT 157:11-158:21). 
L.M. admitted under oath to keeping a list of amounts she collected from 
"Johns" in "two or three" lined books including a book of "Psalms" that she 
obtained from a religious store (OT 152:1-14). Under the circumstances, her 
claim for damages against EPSTEIN, one of L.M.'s many "Johns" during that 
same period, would be so incredible and certainly not likely to produce the 
extraordinary settlements promised to "RRA's investors." 
47. 
In April 2007, before she was represented by EDWARDS, and RRA, L.M. 
gave sworn taped recorded testimony to the agents of the FBI. She was represented 
by a lawyer other than EDWARDS at that statement. She spoke of EPSTEIN in a very 
positive and friendly terms and directly contradicted the central allegations on which 
L.M.'s civil action against Epstein is now based. 
However, once in the hands of 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 24 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 23 
EDWARDS and RRA, L.M.'s story changed dramatically. All of a sudden she wanted to 
sue EPSTEIN and like other RRA clients, sought tens of millions of dollars. 
a. For example, in her sworn statement to the FBI, L.M. was insistent that 
"Jeffrey is an awesome man." (p. 21 - FBI); At the conclusion of she 
stated: "I hope Jeffrey, nothing happens to Jeffrey because he's an 
awesome man and it really would be a shame. It's a shame that he has to 
go through this because he's an awesome guy and he didn't do nothing 
wrong, nothing." (pp. 57-58 - FBI). 
In fact, L.M. spoke so highly of 
EPSTEIN and her interactions with him that the US Attorney's office 
informed a federal court in July 2008 that the US Attorney could not 
consider L.M. a victim. 
Yet, by September 24, 2009, the date on which L.M. began her 
deposition in her civil action and now represented by RRA and 
EDWARDS, L.M.'s new and very different tale about purported sexual 
misconduct under the supposed influence of EPSTEIN had been 
thoroughly rehearsed and her role into the ROTHSTEIN scam was 
complete. In her deposition in her civil action, L.M. declared that: 
"I, I don't really care about money.'' (DT 206:8) 
"He needs time in jail. He doesn't want to be - this is not right for 
him to be on the streets living daily ... " (DT 219:21-23) 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 25 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 24 
"You don't think my whole life I have lived that shitty life because of 
Jeffrey Epstein?" (DT 222:7-8) 
b. 
In her sworn FBI testimony (pre-EDWARDS and RRA), L.M. was 
emphatic that her interactions with Epstein involved no inappropriate 
sexual touching in any way. In fact, it was exactly the opposite: 
Q: Did he at any point kiss you, touch you, show any kind of 
affection towards you? 
A: Never, never. (p. 21 - FBI) ... 
Q: So he never pulled you closer to him in a sexual way? 
A: I wish. 
No, no, never, ever, ever, no, never. 
Jeffrey is an 
awesome man, no. (p. 21 - FBI) 
Yet, L.M. filed her second amended complaint in April 2009, 
after EDWARDS joined RRA, the allegations against EPSTEIN in 
L.M.'s complaint became even more salacious. In paragraph 12 of 
L.M.'s Second Amended Complaint, L.M. alleges among other 
things, that: 
"Jeffrey Epstein coerced, induced, or enticed ... the then minor 
Plaintiff to commit various acts of sexual misconduct. These acts 
included, but were not limited to, fondling and inappropriate and 
illegal sexual touching of the then minor Plaintiff, forcing or inducing 
the then minor plaintiff into oral sex or other sexual misconduct. .. " 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 26 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 25 
c. In her sworn FBI statement (pre-EDWARDS and RRA), L.M. testified that 
Carolyn Andriano, the individual who first brought L.M. to EPSTEIN's 
home, told L.M. "make sure you're 18 because Jeffrey doesn't want any 
underage girls." (p. 8 - FBI). 
Yet at her September, 2009 deposition now represented by 
EDWARDS and RRA, L.M. told a very different story: 
Q: My question was what did Carolyn tell you to tell Mr. Epstein 
about your age? 
A: She said it didn't matter. 
Q: That's your recollection about what she said? 
A: Yes, she said - I remember her saying it doesn't matter. Don't 
worry about it. 
(DT 199:20-25) 
d. 
Pre-EDWARDS and RRA, L.M. testified to the FBI: "I always made 
sure - I had a fake ID, anyways saying that I was 18." (p. 8 - FBI). 
stated: 
Yet, when questioned about her fake ID at her September 2009 depo, she 
Q: And did you have a fake ID? 
A: No. 
Q: Have you ever had a fake ID? 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 27 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 26 
A: No. 
(OT 300:5-8) 
e. 
In her FBI statement (pre-EDWARDS and RRA), L.M. testified 
about others L.M. brought to the Epstein home. L.M. testified that women she 
brought to EPSTEIN's home were eager for the opportunity and content with their 
experiences: 
A: None of my girls ever had a problem and they'd call me. They'd 
beg me, you know, for us to go to Jeffrey's house because they 
love Jeffrey. Jeffrey is a respectful man. He really is. I mean, and 
he all thought we were of age always. This is what's so sad about 
it. (p 30 - FBI). 
Q: Did any of the girls complain about what happened after they left 
there? 
A: No. You asked me that question. No, everybody loved Jeffrey. 
(p. 44 - FBI) 
A: Every girl that I brought to Jeffrey, they said they were fine with 
it. and like for example [E.W. - another of RRA's clients in the 
Civil Actions], a lot of girls begged me to bring them back for the 
money. And as far as I know, we all had fun there. (p. 45 - FBI) 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 28 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 27 
Yet, with EDWARDS and RRA as her attorneys, L.M. did a "180" at her 
September, 2009 deposition in saying: 
A: ... Once they were there, they were scared out of their mind. 
They did it anyways and some of them walked out and said L.M. 
don't ever do this to me again. That was the worst thing that ever 
happened to me. (OT 170:6-11) 
... A: And then, a lot of girls weren't comfortable. (DT 171 :13) 
f. 
The above represent only a few of the dramatic changes L.M. made 
in her testimony prior to her representation by EDWARDS/RRA and after she 
hired ROTHSTEIN, EDWARDS and RRA. 
48. As a result of the fraudulent investment or (Ponzi) scheme, L.M. may knowingly 
have compromised her alleged interests in her Civil Action, or committed a fraud on the 
court. 
49. RRA and the Litigation Team took an emotionally driven set of facts involving 
alleged innocent, unsuspecting, underage females and a Palm Beach Billionaire and 
sought to turn it into a gold mine. Rather than evaluating and resolving the cases based 
on the merits (i.e. facts) which included knowledgeable, voluntary and consensual 
actions by each of the claimants and substantial pre-Epstein psychological and 
emotional conditions of each of the claimants and substantial sexual experiences pre-
Epstein, RRA and the Litigation Team sought through protective orders and objections 
to block relevant discovery regarding their claimants. They instead forged ahead with 
discovery the main purpose of which was to pressure Epstein into settling the cases. 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 29 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 28 
Fortunately, their tactics have not been successful. 
As Magistrate Judge Linnea 
Johnson wrote in a discovery order dated September 15, 2009 (DE 299 in Federal Case 
#08-80119) in denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Protective Order: 
"This is his [Epstein's] right. The Record in this case is clear that the childhood of 
many of the Plaintiffs was marred by instances of abuse and neglect, which in 
turn may have resulted, in whole or in part, in the damages claimed by the 
Plaintiffs." 
In addition, in an Omnibus Order dated October 28, 2009 (DE 377 in Federal 
Case #08-80119) Magistrate Judge Linnea Johnson wrote: 
"Here the request at issue goes to the very heart of the Plaintiff's damage claims, 
requesting not only general information relating to Plaintiff's sexual history, but 
inquiring as to specific instances wherein Plaintiff received compensation or 
consideration for sex acts, claim other males sexually assaulted, battered, or 
abuses her, and/or claim other males committed lewd or lascivious acts on her. 
As a global matter, Plaintiffs clearly and unequivocally place their sexual history 
in issue by their allegations that Epstein's actions in this case has negatively 
affected their relationships by, among other things, "distrust in men," "sexual 
intimacy problems," "diminished trust," "social problems," " problems in personal 
relationships," " feeling of stress around men," "premature teenage pregnancy," 
"antisocial behaviors," and "hyper-sexuality and promiscuity." Considering these 
allegation, there simply can be no question that Epstein is entitled to know 
whether Plaintiffs were molested or the subject of other "sexual activity" or "lewd 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 30 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page 29 
and lascivious conduct" in order to determine whether there is an alternative 
basis for the psychological disorders Plaintiffs claim to have sustained, whether 
Plaintiffs engaged in prostitution or other similar type acts and how certain acts 
alleged in the Complaint materially affected Plaintiffs' relationships with others or 
how those acts did not have such an affect on those relationships and/or whether 
Plaintiffs suffered from the alleged emotional and psychological disorders as a 
result of other sexual acts prior to the acts alleged in the Complaint. To deny 
Epstein thus discovery, would be tantamount to barring him from mounting a 
defense." 
50. ROTHSTEIN, EDWARDS and L.M.'s actions constitute a fraud upon EPSTEIN 
as RRA, ROTHSTEIN and the Litigation Team represented themselves to be acting in 
good faith and with the bests interests of their clients in mind at all times when in reality, 
they were acting in furtherance of the investment or Ponzi scheme described herein. 
EPSTEIN justifiably relied to his detriment on the representations of RRA, and 
Defendants, ROTHSTEIN, EDWARDS and L.M. as to how he conducted and defended 
the Civil Actions brought against him. 
51. As a direct and proximate result of the fraudulent and illegal investment or Ponzi 
scheme orchestrated by ROTHSTEIN and as yet other unknown co-conspirators and as 
a result of the litigation tactics undertaken by the Litigation Team and L.M. as set forth 
herein, Plaintiff EPSTEIN has incurred and continues to incur the monetary damages 
including, but not limited to, having to pay an amount in excess of the Civil Actions' true 
value as a result of them refusing to settle in that a percentage of any payment by 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 10-17     Filed 06/30/16     Page 31 of 37
Epstein v. RRA, et al. 
Page30 
EPSTEIN may have been promised to third party investors; incurring significant 
additional legal fees and costs as result of Defendants refusal to conduct settlement 
negotiations in a forthright and good faith manner because any monies paid by 
EPSTEIN is in reality a promised return on an investment; and incurred significant 
attorneys' fees and costs in defending the discovery that was not relevant, material 
and/or calculated to lead to the admissibility of evidence, but which was done for the 
sole purpose of "pumping" the cases to investors. 
52. EPSTEIN has also been injured in that the scope of the fraudulent and criminal 
or racketeering activity so permeated the RRA law firm that EPSTEIN has been 
prevented from fully and fairly defending the civil actions brought against him. 
In 
essence, the very existence of RRA was based on the continuation of the massive 
Ponzi scheme orchestrated by ROTHSTEIN and other co-conspirators. 
In order to 
continue to bring in monies from investors, ROTHSTEIN and other co-conspirators used 
the Civil Actions against EPSTEIN, along with other manufactured lawsuits, as a means 
of obtaining massive amounts of money. 
53. ROTHSTEIN, EDWARDS and L.M. are liable for damages caused to EPSTEIN -
individually, and jointly and severally. 
Count I - Violation of §§772.101, et seq .• Fla. Stat. • 
Florida Civil Remedies for Criminal Practices Act -

In re: SUBPOENA TO  
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS 
Underlying Case:  
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,  
Plaintiff 
v.  
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,  
Defendant 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y) 
______________________________/ 
MOTION OF BRADLEY J. EDWARDS TO FILE AN OVER LENGTH  
REPLY IN SUPPORT OF HIS MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA OR,  
IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER 
         COME NOW Bradley J. Edwards, by and through undersigned counsel, to file this 
motion for leave to file a reply not to exceed 25 pages in support of his Motion to Quash 
Subpoena or, in the Alternative, for a Protective Order in this action.   
As the Court is aware, on June 13, 2016, Bradley J. Edwards filed a twenty page motion 
to quash a subpoena that had been served on him by Defendant Maxwell in connection with a 
complicated case in the Southern District of New York, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-07433-
RWS (S.D.N.Y.).  The motion was supported by seven exhibits.  The Court opened the case as a 
miscellaneous case. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 12     Filed 07/07/16     Page 1 of 3

On June 30, 2016, Defendant Maxwell filed a sixteen-page response to the Motion to 
Quash.  The response made allegations about whether Edwards had engaged in proper filings in 
other court cases. The response also suggested that Edwards’s client, Ms. Giuffre, had withheld 
discovery information that she was required to produce in the Southern District of New York.  
The response was supported by 18 exhibits, including 5 exhibits that were under seal.  The 
exhibits total approximately 200 pages in length. 
Edwards has now drafted a reply to the response filed by Maxwell.  The reply contains 
nine pages of introductory and factual material and fourteen pages of argument.  The fourteen 
pages of argument are required to fully address the issues raised by Maxwell’s response, 
including discussing recent developments in the underlying case in the Southern District of New 
York.  The subpoena at issue contains multiple sub-parts and a number of complicated issues are 
presented by the requests it contains.   
Opposing counsel have been contacted for a position on the motion. Plaintiff will 
supplement this motion once such position has been obtained.

Defendant,

----------------
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 
SEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN 
AND FOR BROW ARD COUNTY, FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: CACE 15-000072 
NOTICE OF WITHDRAW AL OF MOTION FOR 
PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
Plaintiffs, Edwards and Cassell, by and through their undersigned counsel, and pursuant to 
the terms of the confidential settlement agreement and mutual release between the parties to this 
action, do hereby give notice of the withdrawal of the motion for partial summary judgment they 
filed in this lawsuit and all supporting documents. 
In the event that the noticed withdrawal is determined to be subject to Court approval, the 
Plaintiffs would show in support of this notice that Edwards and Cassell continue to represent 
Virginia Giuffre in separate pending matters, and shall continue to advance her legitimate legal 
interests in those matters. As expressly understood by the parties upon the execution of the 
Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, Ms. Giuffre reaffirms her allegations, 
and the withdrawal of the referenced filings is not intended to be, and should not be construed as 
being, an acknowledgement by Edwards and Cassell that the allegations made by Ms. Giuffre were 
mistaken. Edwards and Cassell do acknowledge that the public filing in the Crime Victims' 

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13-2     Filed 07/07/16     Page 3 of 4
Edwards/Cassell vs. Dershowitz 
Case No.: CACE 15-000072 
Notice of Withdrawal of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment 
Page 2 of3 
Rights Act case of their client's allegations against Defendant Dershowitz became a major 
distraction from the merits of the well-founded Crime Victims' Rights Act case by causing delay 
and, as a consequence, turned out to have been a tactical mistake. For that reason, Edwards and 
Cassell have chosen to withdraw the referenced filing as a condition of settlement.

to all Counsel on the attached list, this 8 T JI

(Case called)
THE COURT: Extending discovery.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  This is Sigrid
McCawley on behalf of the plaintiff, and we had filed a motion
for additional time to complete six depositions.  Your Honor
may recall that we received an order on Monday that allowed for
alternative services to three of the witnesses that we were
seeking to depose.  Our discovery cutoff right now is set for
June 30th, which is I believe next Friday, if I'm correct.  So
at present we have six witnesses that we still need to depose,
the three that we had alternative service for, and then we have
Mr. Ross GOw, who was the defendant's agent who issued the
defamatory statement, Mr. Brunel --
THE COURT:  How much time do you want?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.  We were requesting 30 days to
complete those depositions to coordinate with their counsel and
then coordinate with the defendant's counsel and get those set,
and I believe we can do that without altering the Court's
deadline for a trial, which is set presently for November --
I'm sorry, October 17th.
THE COURT:  OK.  What is wrong with that?
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, in theory, initially there
is nothing wrong with that.  It seems to me that we're not
going to complete a variety of discovery issues by July 1.  The
problem, I think, your Honor, is the cascading effect of that

And if I could digress for a moment and just a moment?
When we were here I think in March, the Court raised the issue
of was this enough time for discovery at that time.  I told the
Court I didn't think so, and I didn't think that the trial date
was reasonable as a result of what I perceived to be problems
going forward with discovery.  Counsel on the other side
opposed my suggestion as to extension of time at that point and
we proceeded.  The Court agreed with the plaintiff and not with
me.
The problem I see, your Honor, is that now we are
scheduled to have expert disclosures due in July, dispositive
motions in August, and a trial date in October.  I don't
believe that it is feasible, if we continue discovery out until
the end of July, to have expert discovery done by the end of
August.  I don't believe it is going to be feasible to have
dispositive motions completed in the time set by the Court, and
all of that is going to push into whether or not we have an
October 18th trial date.
I think the Court also needs to consider, your Honor,
and of course is now familiar with the volume of paper that
gets filed in this court on a regular basis at all hours of the
day and night, and I anticipate that there are going to be
significant evidentiary issues that the Court is going to need
to rule on in advance of trial.  The Court sees a harbinger of

those issues today, I think, as a result of these subpoenas.
All of that tells me that the prudent course of action in my
view is to sort of try to sit down and rework some of these
discovery deadlines with an idea that we're going to actually
have realistic dates.
THE COURT:  OK.  Good.  I'll extend the deadline 30
days.  I'll direct counsel to meet and confer and see if they
can come up with a schedule that both sides will agree upon.
Second, the plaintiff wants to maintain certain
confidentiality designations.  What is the problem?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
So, with respect to our revised Rule 26 disclosures,
we, in order to divulge all information relevant to the case,
had a list of individuals on there who are allegedly victims of
sexual abuse themselves as minors or witnessed things.  So we
designated under our protective order in this case that Rule 26
disclosure as confidential.  It was challenged under the
Protective Order.  Once it is challenged, we have a ten-day
window to file something with the Court.  So we filed our
motion for the protective order.
On Friday of this past week, on the 17th, they issued
a new -- defendants issued a new Rule 26 disclosure with 42 new
names on it, those of which were on our disclosures, without
marking it as confidential.  So I sent them an email just
asking them to hold that as confidential until the Court has an

opportunity to rule on whether or not those names can remain
confidential under the protective order.  So that is the status
as we are right now.
So we are awaiting a ruling.  We believe those
individuals should be protected under the Court's protective
order and those names kept confidential during the course of
this, and it is my understanding that defendants oppose that
position.
THE COURT:  What is the attack?
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Well, your Honor, under the terms of
the protective order, certain categories of information is
likely confidential.  People's names, in my view, are not
confidential.  I didn't choose to list these folks in what I
understand is a Rule 26(a) disclosure, which is a good faith
disclosure of people who may have information relevant to the
claims or defenses in the case.  That's their listing.  All it
is is the names of people.
I have absolutely no idea or ability to understand why
someone's name could be considered to be confidential.  It is
their name.  They use it every day.  They walk around with it.
They have a driver's license with it.  I don't understand how
names in a 26A(a) disclosure could be deemed confidential.
And what I view this as is just simply, you know,
another step in the process here of preventing access and use
of information.

MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.  So with respect to the reason
why individuals who may have been victims of sexual assault
would be confidential, there is case law that we cite in our

pseudonyms of victims --

think it's a legitimate Rule 45 subpoena.  I don't understand
why it would be barred under Rule 45.  There is no objection by
the providers of the information.  They have indicated to us
that if there is a release that's provided to them by the
plaintiff, they will turn over the information.  And I don't
understand what the problem is.  This is information indeed,
your Honor, that the plaintiffs are required to produce to us
under our discovery requests and have not, which resulted in
these Rule 45 subpoenas.  After the Rule 45 --
THE COURT:  Well, as far as Apple, my understanding

been reviewed by counsel and everything has been turned over

Giuffre.  My client had two email accounts with Microsoft.
They are personal emails accounts.  We have not been able to
access that.
THE COURT:  Why not?
MS. SCHULTZ:  Well, it appears for one -- there is one
called live.com, and it appears for that, that that has been
administratively deleted.  I don't have personal knowledge of
that, but when you put in the email address to try to recover
it, I get a message saying we don't recognize this one, "this
one" being the email address.  That is Exhibit 1 to our brief
on this matter.
We wrote a letter to opposing counsel citing some
governing provisions of Microsoft's email policy that indicates
that due to inactivity they delete accounts after a certain
amount of time.  It's my understanding that that has happened
to that account but I can't say so for sure.  So we are unable
to access that whatsoever.
The second account is a hotmail.com account.  We have
also been unable to access that.  It appears that it still
exists, but despite multiple and diligent attempts to get into
that account, we have been unable to.  And I have been involved
in those attempts myself personally.  Accordingly, we have
captured and produced every electronic document to which we
have access.
And I'd like to speak a minute about the legality of

the Microsoft subpoena.  Even under Rule 26, it is a hopelessly
broad subpoena.  It is abusive civil discovery and on the face
of it appears to violate the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act and the Stored Communications Act, federal laws.  The email
seeks -- excuse me.  The subpoena seeks every email that has
ever been sent to that account or sent from that account.
That's every single personal email.  This is without
limitations, without exceptions, without a timeline.  And
pursuant to these subpoenas, these emails are to be turned over
to defense counsel.  So, plaintiff's counsel would not have an
opportunity to review for attorney-client privilege email,
review for relevance, and it wholly circumvents the protections
of the discovery process, which is why courts who have looked
at this issue have consistently rejected these broad subpoenas.
Defendants know that they are not entitled to every
single personal email plaintiff has ever sent or ever received
in the course of however many years these accounts were open.
In fact, Judge Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit allowed a civil
suit against those who propounded these improper subpoenas, and
that was with regard to a professional email account, as
opposed to personal email accounts, the issue in this case
THE COURT:  Do we know what the date of this account
is?
MS. SCHULTZ:  It's an old account.  I think, 2011 -- I

It's impossible for me to determine at this point when it was
opened and when it was last used because we don't have access
to them.
THE COURT:  Yes.  OK.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, this is the problem and I'm
going to be frank.  This is a hide-the-ball problem.  They tell
us -- so let me backup.
We were originally told these are the only email
accounts that the plaintiff had.  When we deposed her, we found
out about these accounts.  We then get into an issue with
counsel telling us, oh, we've done this due diligence search
and we can't access any of this information, these accounts are
closed.  Well, then we look into it a little bit further and we
find out, indeed, the accounts are not closed; indeed, they
have been active, and there are indeed emails that are relevant
to the issues in this case that were sent and received out of
these accounts.  That's a fact here.
Now, all they need to do, if they want to avoid
electronic privacy issues, is comply with their discovery
obligations, execute a release, and send it to Microsoft.
Microsoft will then give them the information.  That's what we
have been told in response to this subpoena.
So to sit here and say, oh, it's overbroad and it's a
problem and you can't do it, you know, you can't have it both
ways.  You either can't avoid discovery of something that you

are required to give up and then say, gee, we don't have access
to it.  That's the conundrum here, your Honor.
I'm sorry we are here at this point.  I agree, if
there is privileged information in there, maybe somebody should
review it.  But when you tell opposing counsel we don't have
access to it and the account is closed and that's indeed not
true, it seems to me that you have forfeited your ability to
then stand up and say the subpoena is overbroad.
THE COURT:  Forgive me, but what's the basis upon
which you say it's not true?
MR. PAGLIUCA:  The account is not closed?
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Because we have been told that by
Microsoft when we issued them the subpoena.
MS. SCHULTZ:  Can I address that really briefly?
My communications regarding these accounts are in
letters that are attached to the briefs in this case.  I never
said that the Hotmail account was closed.  I said that we are
unable to access it.
With regard to the Live.com account, I said it appears
to be closed because the website does not recognize the email
address.  I never told them that the accounts were closed.
I am more than happy to sign a release to Microsoft
for any data that they might have to be delivered to
plaintiff's counsel, at which point we will be more than happy

MR. FEDER:  Eric Felder, from Davis Wright Tremaine,
for the movant.
THE COURT:  Sure.  Of course.
MR. FEDER:  Good afternoon.  My name is Eric Feder
from Davis Wright Tremaine, for the movant, Sharon Churcher.
My client, Sharon Churcher, is a journalist.  She is
currently employed by American Media, Inc., where she is a
reporter for Radar Online and the National Inquirer.  And prior
to that she worked at the British newspaper, The Mail on
Sunday. She's also worked as a freelance reporter.  And she
has been subpoenaed as a third party here to give testimony and
to provide documents in this case.  We move to quash the
subpoena.
As Ms. Churcher states in her affidavit in support of
the motion, her entire involvement with this case, with the
plaintiff, with the defendant, all of the facts underlying the
case was as a reporter seeking to report and publish news
stories.  All the documents and the information described in
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

      G6ndgium
the subpoena and the document requests, which are quite broad,
by the way, and which we have to assume provide the contours of
the information they are seeking in deposition, were created or
obtained by Ms. Churcher in the course of her news-gathering
activities, and much of the information sought was communicated
in confidence, as well.  So under the New York State Shield
Law, which is the appropriate law and which defendants
acknowledge is the appropriate law, not the slightly less
protective Federal Reporters' privilege, the defendant has a
heavy burden to meet to even obtain nonconfidential
information, and confidential information is absolutely
privileged.
We just received an opposition to our motion which was
filed last night after close of business and we've been
reviewing it, but much of the substance of it is redacted out
pursuant, presumably, to the protective order.  We had
previously offered defense counsel to sign the acknowledgment
of the protective order, which does provide for disclosure to
witnesses and witnesses' counsel.  They didn't take us up on it
before.  Obviously, the offer still stands.
But what we can say based on what we've seen is that
the defendant claims that Ms. Churcher, who they fully
acknowledge reported stories about this case -- not this
litigation but the underlying case and who first met the
plaintiff when she traveled to Australia to interview her in
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

2011, that she at some point along the way transformed from a
reporter reporting news into a friend or a business adviser.
It's not clear again because of the redactions when this
transformation presumably took place.  But the reality is that
that is simply an incorrect characterization of the
relationship.
Since 2011, and continuing up, frankly, through the
present day, Ms. Churcher has continued to cover this story as
a reporter, has published stories, including just I think two
months ago, often using "Virginia" or her so-called agents as
sources, of course most prominently in early 2015, which is
what underlies this particular litigation.
By its terms, the Shield Law applies to any
information obtained or communications made, quote, in the
course of gathering or obtaining news for publication.  Now, of
course, a reporter's source relationship is complicated.  Not
every single interaction or every single communication is going
to be an interview with questions and answers that then get
published verbatim.  So to the extent that there are particular
emails where Sharon provided advice to Virginia, that doesn't
transform the overall relationship from reporter and source to
adviser and advisee or friend.
Reporters communicate with sources in a variety of
ways.  A police beat reporter may take a sergeant out for
drinks and talk about life in general with no intention of
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

      G6ndgium
publishing details but with the intention of maintaining that
close source relationship so that when the sergeant comes into
possession of information, he's right there as the first
recipient of that information.
As this Court stated in the Schoolcraft case, that the
reporter's privilege seeks to prevent the unnecessary enmeshing
of the press in litigation that arises from events they cover.
And that's exactly what this is.
The Second Circuit interprets the qualified privilege
very broadly to apply not only to individual bits of
information gathered from sources but also to unpublished
details of the news gathering process.  That's from the Baker
v. Goldman Sachs case, 669 F.3d 105, from 2012.
But either way, what they're seeking here, as
described in their opposition, is quintessential news gathering
Shield Law material.  They list it at a couple of different
points in their brief.  They are asking for Sharon Churcher's
interview notes, recordings, memos, and other documentation
that are clearly, and concededly by the defendant, from the
news gathering process.
In order to overcome this Shield Law for even the
nonconfidential information, they have to make a clear and
specific showing that the information is highly material and
relevant, that it's critical or necessary to the maintenance of
the claim or defense, and that it is not obtainable from any
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

      G6ndgium
alternate sources.  So as an initial point, it is quite clear
that they haven't exhausted all other sources up to and
including the proceedings here today, where they are continuing
to seek material from the plaintiff's email accounts, which
your Honor just granted an order that would facilitate that,
and also the pending motion to reopen plaintiff's deposition.
So clearly they haven't exhausted plaintiff as a source.
They are also asking for Ms. Churcher's communications
with the plaintiff's agents or attorneys or communications with
law enforcement about the plaintiff, but we're not aware of any
effort to obtain that information from those agents and
attorneys or from law enforcement.  Obviously, law enforcement
may have their own objections to a subpoena.  And while the
defendants may not like what the FBI would say here, but there
are certainly alternative sources that they are required under
the Shield Law to turn to before seeking this from a reporter.
In addition, the information -- again, we haven't seen
precisely what it is because it is blacked out of their
opposition but to the extent we understand it -- does not meet
the critical or necessary prong, which is, under the Second
Circuit law and under New York law, quite high.  As the Second
Circuit articulated in Krase v. Graco, 79 F.3d 346, the
information can be compelled, or disclosure can be compelled
when the claim or defense, quote, virtually rises or falls with
the admission or exclusion of the proffered evidence.  And they

      G6ndgium
just -- they have not made that showing here.
They talk about the fact that they need this
information because the credibility of the plaintiff is key,
but the credibility of a plaintiff is key in many kinds of
cases and certainly very often in libel case, where truth or
falsity is sort of the ultimate issue being tried, and there is
obviously not a wholesale exception for libel or any case where
the plaintiff's credibility is central to the Shield Law.
They also focus heavily on the idea that the story
changed over time from what was published in 2011 and what was
published in 2015 and after and, in particular, the question of
whether Virginia had sex with Prince Andrew or not.  In 2011,
the article stated that there was not evidence that that
happened.  In 2015, after court papers stated that it had
happened, they then reported that it had.  But I would submit
that's less an issue of the story changing than what changed
was what the newspapers were comfortable publishing.
There is actually a Vanity Fair article about this
that was published later in 2011 that talks about how -- it
talks about Prince Andrew -- that's what the article is
about -- and it talks about the strictness of British libel
laws that likely are what contributed to newspapers sort of
hedging on that point.
This also is not a case where the journalist was an
eyewitness to events in her capacity as a citizen.  She wasn't

      G6ndgium
there when whatever happened with Ms. Maxwell and Ms. Giuffre
took place, witnessing it as citizen Sharon Churcher.  All of
her knowledge about this comes from reporting as a reporter.
And, finally, because the documents all fall within
the Shield Law, a reporter should not be burdened with going
and sitting for a deposition where her counsel basically
objects to every question as privileged under the Shield Law.
And both the New York Court of Appeals and the Second Circuit
have emphasized that.  The New York Court of Appeals said, in
Holmes v. Winter, which we cite in our brief, where the entire
focus of a reporter's testimony would be on privileged topics,
quote, No legitimate purpose would be served by requiring a
witness to go through the formality of appearing to testify
only to refuse to answer questions concerning the information
sought.
And the Second Circuit, in Gonzalez, talked about the
dangers that if parties to a lawsuit were free to subpoena the
press at will, it would become standard operating procedure,
and the resulting wholesale exposure of press files to
litigants' scrutiny would burden the press with heavy costs of
subpoena compliance and could otherwise impair its ability to
perform its duties.
Finally, even setting aside the Shield Law, the scope
of the subpoena is very broad and overly burdensome even just

newspapers and is a freelancer, so we are talking about
multiple email accounts.  So even just gathering this broad
scope of communications which aren't limited by time or
specific subject matter would be quite burdensome, but, again,
because the Shield Law applies, a fortiori, as a journalist,
she should not be put to that burden.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, I start with -- I would
like to read to the Court an example of Ms. Churcher's
involvement in this case.  I have this as an audio file and if
I was allowed to bring my cell phone in, I would play it, but I
wrote it down to read it to the Court.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Excuse me, your Honor.  I just want to
make sure that we are not -- some documents have been labeled
confidential, which is why there are redactions and I believe
there are other individuals present in the courtroom --
THE COURT:  Yes.  Find out what it is.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  No.  Confer with counsel.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  This is not a document that has been

Ms. Churcher left for Paul Cassell, who is a lawyer in this
case who entered an appearance in this case, in February of
2015.
On February 5, 2015, your Honor, it starts out:  Paul,
it's Sharon.  I wanted to discuss and with you on a deep
background basis something that's in my file.  I, as you know,
feel almost like a friend of Virginia's.  I think that the FBI
affidavit was pretty close to perjury.  Give me a call when you
get a chance.  On a deep background basis, if it's not going to
be a conflict for you, it's something that I wanted to get your
advice on.  Take care.  Bye-bye.
This voice message is troubling on a number of levels,
your Honor, in connection with this case.  First, it has never
been provided to us, and there is a lawyer who has entered an
appearance in this case.  We have asked for this kind of
discovery from the plaintiff and it has never been provided,
and it's germane to the issues before the Court.  But what it
reveals is that this is not Ms. Churcher's first interaction
with Mr. Cassell, lawyer for the plaintiff.  They are on a
first-name basis.  She is feeling free to call him and leave
messages for him.
And what she wants to discuss is apparently an
affidavit prepared by the FBI that's been provided to
Ms. Churcher by someone; I don't know whom, your Honor, but I'm
going to presume it was provided to Ms. Churcher by the
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

plaintiff.  That's troubling as well because we went through
litigation in this case about our access to alleged
public-interest privileged documents that were not turned over
to us but were submitted in camera to the Court.  But to the
extent that that's part of those documents and Ms. Churcher has
it, that's a problem for the discovery process in this case.
And it's a problem for Ms. Churcher, your Honor,
because it's clear, as is attached to our papers, that
Ms. Churcher's role in this entire ordeal was not simply a
journalist.  Ms. Churcher is a self-described friend.  She is a
self-described adviser.  She's a self-described confidante.
She is a self-described advocate.  In many instances throughout
this ordeal, Ms. Churcher was acting as a source of information
to Mr. Edwards, who is another lawyer who has entered an
appearance in this case, and to law enforcement.
The Shield Law only applies when journalists are asked
to disclose information received in the course of gathering or
obtaining news for publication.  And Ms. Churcher's activities
in connection with this case are far outside of those bounds.
To be clear, we don't want that information from Ms. Churcher.
So whatever information Ms. Churcher has that was indeed
obtained in her job in the course of gathering or obtaining
news for publication, we haven't subpoenaed that information.
But I suggest, your Honor, that the blanket notion
that Ms. Churcher can't sit for a deposition in this case is

simply wrong, and these issues need to be resolved on a
question-and-answer basis by Ms. Churcher, because her role in
connection with this case far exceeded any role as a
journalist.
Indeed, your Honor, Ms. Churcher is a fact witness in
this case.  The Shield Law relied on is only applicable when
the journalist is asked to disclose information, again,
received in the course of gathering or obtaining news for
publication.  And much of the information that we are asking --
if, indeed, it is not all -- from Ms. Churcher has nothing to
do with information she gathered or collected in the course of
gathering news for publication.
We have Ms. Churcher meeting with the plaintiff in
early 2011 and then conducting a week-long series of interviews
leading to the publications in March of 2011.  We then go
through another five years here where the story changes, and it
is reasonable, I believe, to believe that the story is changing
not because of the truth of the story but because of
information that's being given to the plaintiff and she is then
changing her story to make it more salacious and more sellable
to various people through the world.
There is a series of exchanges between the plaintiff
and Ms. Churcher that we have in email communications that have
been provided to the Court that demonstrate this course of
conduct over time.  We also have a series of communications
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

between the plaintiff and law enforcement and the plaintiff's
lawyers that are not news-gathering activities.  These are
wholly outside of the process of gathering news.  And they are
sharing information back and forth, and Ms. Churcher is
providing information to Mr. Edwards, counsel in this case.
Ms. Churcher is advising the plaintiff on how to deal with her
own lawyer in connection with maximizing her return on
publishing details that appear to be provided to the plaintiff
by Ms. Churcher.  All of this is outside the bounds of any
Shield Law or any privilege.
I think the Court knows -- I'm sure the Court is
exhausted with all of the pleadings that have been filed in
this case related to discovery.  I believe we have exhausted
all avenues available to us to obtain this information.  There
is really no place else to go.  And so there is -- I think it
is not well founded, your Honor, that there is some notion that
we have not done everything that we can to get this information
from the plaintiff, Microsoft, other places before turning to a
subpoena to Ms. Churcher.
Ms. Churcher is likely the only source of this highly
relevant information, which is this 24-page fabricated diary
and the testimony around that, communications with law
enforcement and the FBI that have no legitimate investigative
reporter purpose.
So, for those reasons, Judge, I believe the Court

should deny the motion to quash, we should be allowed to
proceed forward with the deposition of Ms. Churcher.  If there
are particularized objections to the questions because counsel
believe that those invade some privilege, they should be raised
at that time, and we go forward on a question-by-question basis
because most of this information will not be subject to any
privilege.
Thank you.
MR. FEDER:  May I be heard briefly?
THE COURT:  Mm-hmm.
MR. FEDER:  Thank you.  Just very briefly.
First of all, the voicemail that my colleague read is
totally consistent with news gathering.  She mentions that it's
on deep background, and in trying to cultivate the source she
describes herself as almost a friend.  Again, I don't think
that type of less formal communication is indicative of a
transformation from a journalist into something else.
But more problematically, we haven't heard that
voicemail.  We haven't seen any of the emails they are talking
about because they are redacted; the exhibits containing them
were filed under seal.  So we don't know exactly which pieces
of information they are trying to seek and which pieces of
information they are claiming are not subject to the privilege.
I think we can all agree that Ms. Churcher is in fact
a journalist, that she did in fact publish stories from
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

actually going back to 2007 that Virginia wasn't named, but
from 2007 and certainly 2011 onward, publishing stories about
these matters.  So, clearly the Shield Law is floating around
here at a minimum somewhere.
And they have to make a clear and specific showing for
each piece of information that they claim either the Shield Law
doesn't apply because she wasn't acting in her capacity as a
journalist or that the Shield Law is overcome because it's
critical or necessary and they've exhausted alternative
sources.  And the Shield Law itself provides that the Court
shall order disclosure only of such portions of the news sought
as to which the above-described showing has been made and shall
support such order with clear and specific findings made after
a hearing.
So we can't go forward and just deny the motion to
quash entirely and just go to a deposition and start answering
questions when the Shield Law at a minimum applies to, we would
submit, all of it but at a minimum a substantial portion of the
information.  We need to see what they're specifically talking
about here.

MR. POE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Gregory Poe on
behalf of non-party Jeffrey Epstein.  With me, your Honor, is
my colleague Rachel Li Wai Suen.
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. POE:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.
We've attempted to be thorough in our briefing so I
won't belabor the issues.  I think the key issue is whether in
fact an undue burden would exist if Mr. Epstein were subjected
at this point to a deposition.  The plaintiff concedes, as the
law requires, that evidence must be relevant and admissible.
And here the examples the plaintiff's counsel has offered with
respect to a 2010 deposition in a different proceeding where
Mr. Epstein apparently answered some questions doesn't add
anything that the public record already doesn't reveal.  So, in
our view, that would not justify a deposition, which leaves
really the Fifth Amendment implications that have been
represented will be made, and that raises the LiButti issue.
And under LiButti, your Honor, really the permeating
factor is control.  And the typical case -- really, most of the
cases, to the extent courts have addressed this issue, are
employee invocations where the corporation for which the
employee works is the party, and there the invocation can be
imputed because it is controlled.  There is no control here,
and the factors that exist don't justify the deposition under
the LiButti analysis.  And I would point the Court, as I'm sure
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
                               (212) 805-0300

      G6ndgium
the Court has reviewed, to docket 228 -- that's the defendant's
pleading -- at pages 16 to 18, which lays out both in redacted
form, which I have not reviewed, and unredacted form, various
bases for why LiButti has not been met here by the plaintiff.
But the alternative argument the plaintiff makes,
which is this is not ripe for decision, while we certainly
concede that it would not be something that is the usual
practice in a typical case, this is not a typical case, we
would respectfully submit.  And we would ask the Court consider
as an alternative holding in abeyance any deposition of
Mr. Epstein until the record that the plaintiff refers to has
been developed.  That would not result in prejudice to either
party, and it would not subject Mr. Epstein to a burden of a
deposition or the cost or inconvenience, which, of course, need
to be considered with respect to a third party under Rule 45,
when, in fact, if we are correct that no litigation purpose
would be served, it would by definition, in our view, be an
unnecessary cost and inconvenience and, therefore, an undue
burden.
Finally, your Honor, if the Court -- and, ultimately,
if Mr. Epstein is not granted relief with respect to this
motion, we would ask in the alternative that the Court prohibit
videography for the reasons that we have outlined in our
briefs.  The plaintiff's opposition states that Mr. Epstein is
asking for preferential treatment.  We make legal arguments,

your Honor.  Whether the Court agrees or disagrees with our
legal arguments, Mr. Epstein is not asking to be treated better
or worse than anybody else under the law.
So with that, your Honor, we -- if the Court has any
questions, I am prepared to answer them.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. POE:  Thank you.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, may I be heard on the
motion to quash, please?
So with respect to Mr. Epstein, obviously the Court
has heard from us previously.  He is at the center of this
conspiracy, we allege, with Ms. Maxwell, the defendant.  It
would be highly prejudicial to the plaintiff here to not be
able to take his deposition.
To accommodate his concerns, even though he was
sighted just even days ago by his New York mansion, we have
agreed to fly down to the U.S. Virgin Islands to handle that
deposition.
With respect to his concerns over videography, he said
he was concerned that that would be leaked to the media, we
have a confidentiality order in place in this case and we will
gladly mark that as confidential so that is not a concern.
It's very important that we are entitled to ask him
those questions.  I know his counsel has stated that he intends
to take the Fifth.  As the Court well knows, there are many
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
                               (212) 805-0300

      G6ndgium
questions for which you have to have a basis to take the Fifth,
so it can't be just a carte blanche taking of the Fifth.  So
there will be questions that he can answer during that
deposition.
In addition, we're entitled to see his demeanor during
that, to have the jury see his demeanor on video if this goes
to trial.  So it's critical that we are entitled to take that
deposition of Mr. Epstein, who is the co-conspirator here.
With respect to the LiButti case, your Honor, that
case addresses, as the Court may well know -- it is a Second
Circuit case -- it addresses the standard by which a court can
allow a nonparty's invocation of the Fifth Amendment to have an
adverse inference against a party in a litigation.  We contend
that we meet all of the factors of LiButti, but at this point
that would not be the time for the Court to make that decision.
Obviously, the deposition needs to take place.  We need to have
a record of what he is taking the Fifth on, and then we can
make those arguments presumably in a motion in limine for why
we believe that that adverse inference should apply.
So, your Honor, I submit to you that this deposition
is critical to us.  We've done our part in trying to
accommodate this witness, and we believe that the deposition
should move forward and the motion to quash should be denied.
Thank you.

this motion as well?
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Thank you.
Your Honor, first, I think what I'd like to say to the
Court is that, indeed, I wish Mr. Epstein's deposition could go
forward.  I have every reason to expect that should Mr. Epstein
testify and testify truthfully, his testimony would be of
enormous support and corroboration of Ms. Maxwell's version of
events in this case.
It's important to note, your Honor, that Ms. Maxwell
was not the subject of this investigation that led to
Mr. Epstein's being charged and pleading guilty.  We just
finished the deposition of Detective Recarey, who was the lead
deposition -- the lead detective in the case, and he agreed
that throughout this investigation he never spoke to
Ms. Maxwell.  No one identified Ms. Maxwell as being involved
in any of the alleged crimes.  He did not seek any indictment
or prosecution against Ms. Maxwell.  And his only investigation
relative to Ms. Maxwell was to simply look her up on the
Internet.
There is no surveillance footage of Ms. Maxwell.  She
is not named in any of the affidavits that are filed with the
court.  So, in short, Ms. Maxwell was not implicated in any of
the conduct that Mr. Epstein was alleged to have committed.
It's important background, your Honor, for the next
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

      G6ndgium
point here, because the plaintiff has not raised what I think
is a very important issue here with regard to the Fifth
Amendment, and that is does Mr. Epstein indeed have the ability
to assert a Fifth Amendment privilege now in the context of
this litigation.  And there are a number of factors that are
considered, the first being, and I think it is important to
recognize, Mr. Epstein was granted immunity by the United
States Attorney in the District of Florida for the conduct that
I believe he is going to be questioned about.  And I don't
believe that it is appropriate for a witness to assert a Fifth
Amendment privilege after they have been granted immunity by
the prosecuting authority under 18 United States Code 6001.
So, I don't think that there has been any exploration of
whether Mr. Epstein can indeed invoke his Fifth Amendment
privilege.
He also pled guilty to state charges which likely
would act as a jeopardy bar and prohibit Mr. Epstein from
asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege in the state system to
the extent that the immunity from the federal government
doesn't cover him, which I submit that it would.
There is also the statute of limitations, your Honor,
which seems to me has long expired with regard to any of the
allegations in this case.
Now, why do I raise that, Judge?  They don't really
want Mr. Epstein to testify.  That's the point here.  They want
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

      G6ndgium
to be able to have him assert his Fifth Amendment privilege so
that they can then try to back-door this against Ms. Maxwell.
And, in effect, they are creating their own little dichotomy
here, which is he's taking the Fifth, we want him to take the
Fifth, because then we get to just do a list of questions about
everything that we want to have an adverse inference about as
it relates to Ms. Maxwell, not as to Mr. Epstein.  That is the
problem, because they haven't done what they should do to get
to that point in the first place.  I think that is a real issue
and a real problem for this motion before the Court now.
This is simply an attempt to manufacture -- and I use
that word deliberately, your Honor -- manufacture self-serving
evidence that they can then try to present to a jury through
this derivative adverse inference.
Final comment:  I have never had a court allow a
witness to come into court and assert a Fifth Amendment
privilege, whether that be in a criminal case or a civil case.
I've never had a court allow a jury to be shown someone's
deposition while they are asserting a Fifth Amendment
privilege.  I don't understand the point of that.  And it seems
to me there is no point in allowing a videotaped deposition of
somebody who is going to sit there and say to every question
"On the advice of my counsel, I assert my Fifth Amendment
privilege."  There is nothing to be served by the added expense
of that process.

So, your Honor, this is Mr. Epstein's fight, it is not
Ms. Maxwell's fight, but it becomes Ms. Maxwell's fight to the
extent that we're trying to create evidence down the road that
is used against Ms. Maxwell in this proceeding.
Thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Yes.  Anything further?
MR. POE:  Nothing further, your Honor.  Thank you.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, may I just briefly
address -- defendant's counsel didn't file a brief on this so I
just want to take a few moments to address the points he has
just raised very briefly.
First, we would love to have Mr. Epstein give complete
testimony in this case.  I look forward to that.  I hope that
he will do that for us, and that is why we want to take his
deposition.  Ms. Maxwell had given an indication she was going
to take the Fifth.  When we deposed her, she didn't.  So things
may change.  We need his deposition.
Second, with respect to the representations regarding
the deposition of Detective Recarey which occurred earlier this
week, Detective Recarey did say that he sought to interview
Ms. Maxwell in the course of that and did acknowledge that
Ms. Maxwell is in the police reports.  I just want to make sure
that that is corrected on the record.
Thank you, your Honor.

DECLARATION OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT TIMOTHY R. SLATER 
TIMOTHY R. SLATER declares as follows: 
I. 
I am a Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), currently assigned as a 
Section Chief at FBI Headquarters, Washington, D.C. I was appointed a Special Agent in May 
1999. Upon graduation from the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, in September I 999, I was 
assigned to the Detroit Field Office. I was subsequently transferred to the FBI Miami Field 
Office in May 2006. 
2. In 2006, I was assigned to work on an investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, who was 
accused of sexually abusing many young girls under the age of 18. In the course of our 
investigation, the FBI identified many potential victims of sexual abuse by Epstein. We obtained 
names by speaking to other victims, who frequently knew of friends who had also been paid 
money by Epstein to provide sexual services to him. 
3. One of the victims identified was 
In January - February 2007, I 
used various computer indices to try and locate Ms.- By using these indices and other 
means, I found two international phone numbers which I believed were being used by Ms.

4. Sometime during January - February 2007, I called the one of the numbers, in an 
attempt to speak to Ms.-
Also in my office was FBI Special Agent Nesbitt E. 
Kuyrkendall, the lead agent for the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. I was not using a 
speakerphone when I spoke with Ms.- I asked SIA Kuyrkendall to be present because 
she, as the lead agent, was thoroughly versed in the details of the entire investigation, and I might 
need her assistance to respond to a question posed by Ms.-
that I was unable to answer. 
5. When I dialed the number, a young woman answered the phone. I told her my name, 
identified myself as a Special Agent with the FBI, and asked if she was 
She 
said yes. I used a technique which I employ when speaking to people on the phone, who might 
question whether Jam truly an FBI agent. I provided her with the phone number of the FBI 
Field Office in Miami, Florida, and told ·her she could hang up and verify the number. She 
could then call me back at the number, and her call would be routed to me. Ms. -
said that 
would not be necessary. 
6. I told Ms. -
about our investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, and the allegations that 
Epstein had sexually abused many underage young girls. I told her we believed she might be a 
victim of sexual abuse by Epstein. 
7. Ms.-
answered basic questions, telling me that she did know Jeffrey Epstein. 
She quickly became uncomfortable, telling me she moved away to distance herself from this 
situation, and expressing her desire to "let this be in my past." She asked that l not bother her 
with this again. 
8. I thanked Ms. -
and told her J appreciated her time. 1 provided my name and 
encouraged her to call the FBI Miami Field Office, if she had any questions or needed assistance.

Attorneys for Bradley J. Edwards 
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
In re:  SUBPOENA TO BRADLEY J. 
EDWARDS
Underlying case: 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, Plaintiff 
v.
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, Defendant 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y.) 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS’S REPLY IN 
SUPPORT OF MOTION TO QUASH 
SUBPOENA OR, IN THE 
ALTERNATIVE, FOR A PROTECTIVE 
ORDER
Case No. 0:16-mc-61262-JEM 
Subpoena respondent Bradley J. Edwards, a non-party and attorney for the Plaintiff in the 
Giuffre v. Maxwell action, hereby files this reply in support of his motion to quash.   
In her response to the motion, Maxwell withdraws several of her requests for production in 
the wake of adverse rulings from Judge Sweet in the Southern District of New York.  With regard 
to the remainder, Edwards will clearly be unduly burdened, as a non-party, if he were required to 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 1 of 26

conduct burdensome searches for documents for no real purpose.  With regard to the first two 
requests, for example, relating to documents from the Dershowitz case, Maxwell now admits that 
she already possesses some of the information that she seeks to force Edwards to assemble.  
Maxwell also fails to substantively or effectively address the other arguments that Edwards 
presents regarding why the subpoena creates an undue burden on him.  The Court should 
accordingly grant Edwards’s motion to quash in its entirety. 
RESPONSE TO MAXWELL’S BACKGROUND FACTS. 
In his motion to quash, Edwards specifically advanced nineteen facts relevant to his 
motion. See Motion to Quash (“MTQ”) at 2-6.  Defendant Maxwell does not contest any of these 
facts, and the Court should therefore deem them admitted in ruling on Edwards’s motion. 
Maxwell, however, presents some additional alleged “background” facts which she asserts 
are relevant to determining the motion.  She presents a grossly distorted picture of some of the key 
events, and so a brief response is appropriate. 
The CVRA Case 
The facts relevant to this issue begin in 2008, when attorney Bradley J. Edwards (soon 
joined by co-counsel Professor Paul Cassell) on a pro bono basis, filed an action in the Southern 
District of Florida under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771.  Filed on 
behalf of Jane Doe 1 (and later Jane Doe 2) the CVRA action alleged that federal government had 
failed to protect the rights of Jane Doe 1 and other-situated victims of sex crimes committed by 
Jeffrey Epstein, a politically-connected billionaire.  See Complaint filed in Jane Doe 1 v. United 
States, No. 9:08-cv-80736, DE 1 (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2008).  The victims alleged that, while they 
were underage girls, Epstein and his co-conspirators sexually abused them in his Florida mansion 
under the guise of obtaining “massages.”  The victims further alleged that the Government 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 2 of 26

concealed from them a plea bargain under which the federal government extended to Epstein a 
non-prosecution agreement (NPA) in exchange for Epstein’s guilty plea to low level state 
offenses.  The CVRA case has been litigated for nearly eight years, with litigation continuing to 
date.  Jane Does 1 and 2 have achieved many precedent-setting victories in the case, including a 
ruling that the CVRA rights of victims could apply before charges were filed, Does 1 and 2 v. 
United States, 817 F.Supp.2d 1337 (S.D. Fla. 2011);1 that they had standing to challenge the non-
prosecution agreement reached between the Government and Epstein, Jane Does 1 and 2 v. United 
States, 950 F.Supp.2d 1262 (S.D. Fla. 2013); and that Epstein’s plea negotiations were not 
protected from disclosure by any federal rule of evidence, Does v. United States, 749 F.3d 999 
(11th Cir. 2014). Congress has also followed the developments in the case closely, recently 
amending the CVRA to insure that in the future crime victims receive notice of any non-
prosecution agreement entered into by the Government.  See Pub. L. 114-22, Title I, § 113(a), 
(c)(1), May 29, 2015, 129 Stat. 240, 241 (adding 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(9) to give victims “[t]he 
right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement).    
As part of the CVRA case, on December 30, 2014, Edwards and Cassell filed a Motion 
Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in the Action on behalf two additional victims: Jane Doe 3 and 
Jane Doe 4.  (Jane Doe 3, Ms. Virginia Giuffre, subsequently decided to reveal her name.)  The 
joinder motion argued that Jane Does 3 and 4 should be allowed to join the two existing plaintiffs 
in the action because they had suffered the same violations of their rights under the CVRA.  See 
Pagliuca Decl., Exhibit A, Jane Does’ 3 and 4 Joinder Motion.  To establish that they were 
“victims” of Epstein’s sex crimes with standing to join the suit, Jane Does 3 and 4 alleged that 
See generally Paul G. Cassell, Nathanael J. Mitchell & Bradley J. Edwards, Crime Victims’ Rights During Criminal 
Investigations? Applying the Crime Victims’ Rights Act before Criminal Charges are Filed, 104 J. CRIM. L. &
CRIMINOLOGY 59 (2014).  
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 3 of 26

they had suffered sexual abuse from Epstein and others.  
Maxwell asserts – without any supporting evidence or argument – that Edwards and 
Cassell filed this motion for the “purpose” of creating additional litigation.  Maxwell Resp. at 5.  
That is a spurious claim about counsel’s alleged improper motivation that lacks any support.  As is 
clear from the face of the motion to join, the legitimate purpose was to secure Jane Doe 3 and Jane 
Doe 4’s participation in the CVRA lawsuit.

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 5 of 26
Several months later, on April 7, 2015, the Court (Maim, J.) denied Jane Doe 3 and Jane 
Doe 4's motion for joinder. 
See Pagliuca Deel., Ex. C, Order denying Jane Doe 3's Motion to 
Join. With regard to the eight sepai·ate issues as to which the allegations 
relevant, the Comt addressed only the first (establishing "victim" status) and found that the 
"factual details regai·ding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are 
immaterial and impe1tinent to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein 
and the Government owed them CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve 
non-pm.ties who are not related to the respondent Government." Id. at 5.4 Accordingly, the Comt 
shuck the factual details from the victims' pleading as unnecessa1y at that time. The Comt 
specifically recognized, however, that the details could be reasse1ted by the pm.ties to the action -
i.e., Jane Doe I and Jane Doe 2 - if they could "demonsti·ate a good faith basis for believing that 
such details ai·e pe1tinent to a matter presented for the Comt 's consideration." Id. at 6. The comt 
also mled that their right to paiticipation in the case could be achieved by means of appeai·ance as 
witnesses. Following the Comt's mling, additional litigation has proceeded in the CVRA case. 

The Dershowitz case 
While the CVRA case was moving forward in the Southern District of Florida on behalf of 
Jane Does 1 and 2, separate litigation developed between the pro bono attorneys who had filed the 
lawsuit (Edwards and Cassell) and Dershowitz.  After Edwards and Cassell filed the joinder 
motion in the CVRA case, Dershowitz took the airwaves to attack not only Jane Doe 3’s 
allegations against him, but also Edwards and Cassell’s decision to file the allegations.  Typical of 
these attacks was one levelled on CNN, in which Dershowitz alleged: 
If they [Edwards and Cassell] had just done an hours’ worth of research and work, 
they would have seen she is lying through her teeth. . . . They’re prepared to lie, 
cheat, and steal.  These are unethical lawyers.  . . . They can’t be allowed to have a 
bar card to victimize more innocent people. 
Hala Gorani – CNN Live (Jan. 5, 2015).5
 Edwards and Cassell then filed a state law defamation action against Dershowitz in 
Broward County, Florida.  See Pagliuca Decl., Ex. E, Complaint in Edwards and Cassell v. 
Dershowitz.  The complaint alleged that Dershowitz had engaged in a “massive public media 
assault on the reputation and character” of Edwards and Cassell. Id. at 4.
The Settlement of the Defamation Case 
Ultimately, Edwards, Cassell, and Dershowitz agreed to settle their defamation case.  That 
settlement included both a public statement and confidential monetary payments.  As part of the 
settlement, Edwards and Cassell withdrew their allegations against Dershowitz in the defamation 
case contained in the then-pending summary judgment motion.  Edwards Reply Decl., Exhibit 2, 
Notice of Withdrawal of Summary Judgment Motion.  As explained in the notice of withdrawal of 
Available at http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/01/05/wrn-uk-sex-abuse-allegations-alan-dershowitz-intv.cnn.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 6 of 26

this motion, “the withdrawal of the referenced filings is not intended to be, and should not be 
construed as being, an acknowledgement by Edwards and Cassell that the allegation made by Ms. 
Giuffre were mistaken.  Edwards and Cassell do acknowledge that the public filing in the Crime 
Victims’ Rights Act case of their client’s allegation against Defendant Dershowitz became a major 
distraction from the merits of the well-founded Crime Victims’ Rights Act by causing delay and, 
as a consequence, turned out to be a tactical mistake.”  Id.  Thus, contrary to representations made 
by Maxwell in her brief (Maxwell Resp. at 7), in settling the case, Edwards and Cassell have never
reached any conclusion that Ms. Giuffre was mistaken in her allegations.  
Progress in the Underlying Case 
While Maxwell reviews the facts from other cases (e.g., the CVRA case and the 
Dershowitz case), she does not present for the Court any information about the course of this case 
– i.e., the underlying litigation in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.) (Sweet, J.).  
Because the course of that litigation is relevant to assessing the need for forcing Edwards to 
respond to the subpoena, background about this case may be useful. 
Ms. Giuffre’s complaint alleged that, after the filing of the joinder motion in which she 
stated that Maxwell was involved with Jeffrey Epstein in sexually abusing her while she was 
under the age of 18, Maxwell defamed her by falsely calling her (among other things) a “liar” and 
by falsely characterizing Giuffre’s various statements that Maxwell was involved in sexual abuse 
with Epstein as “obvious lies.”  Discovery then proceeded in the case, including preparations for 
deposition of Maxwell.  Maxwell repeatedly sought to delay her deposition, filing a motion just 
four days before her scheduled deposition seeking to delay her deposition to learn about on-going 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 7 of 26

law enforcement investigation of her sex offenses.  See Giuffre v. Maxwell, DE 101.6  Maxwell 
said that she would then be able to decide whether to invoke her Fifth Amendment right to refuse 
to answer questions.  DE 101 at 3.  Ultimately, however, Judge Sweet refused to delay her 
deposition, and so Maxwell was forced to answer questions under oath about her involvement in 
Epstein’s sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre and other minor girls.   During her deposition, however, 
This was not the first time Maxwell had sought to avoid being deposed.  In 2009, Brad Edwards served Ghislaine 
Maxwell with a subpoena for a deposition in a civil case against Jeffrey Epstein. After extensive discussion and 
coordinating a convenient time and place, as well as ultimately agreeing to a confidentiality agreement prepared by 
Maxwell’s attorney, at the eleventh hour Maxwell’s attorney informed Edwards that Maxwell’s mother was very ill 
and that consequently Maxwell was leaving the country with no plans to return. The deposition was cancelled. Yet a 
short time later, Maxwell was photographed at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in Rhinebeck, New York, confirming the 
suspicion that she was indeed still in the country and willing to say anything to avoid her deposition.  See Edwards 
Reply Decl., Ex. 1 at 15.   
See also note 3, supra (discussing Ms. Maxwell’s complete lack of memory of any of the circumstance surrounding 
her trip to London with Ms. Giuffre).

DISCUSSION 
As should be clear from the foregoing recitations of the facts in this case, defendant 
Maxwell has been unable to present any effective evidence that she was uninvolved in Epstein’s 
sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre and other minor girls.  Unable to contest the case on its merits, she 
has resorted to a blizzard of discovery motions – including subpoenas served on Ms. Giuffre’s 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 9 of 26

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 10 of 26
legal counsel such as Edwards. The specific issue before the Court is Edwards's motion to quash 
the subpoena served on him. That motion should be granted. 
I. 
VENUE IS PROPER OVER THE MOTION TO QUASH IN FLORIDA, WHERE 
EDWARDS RESIDES. 
Out of an abundance of caution, it should be noted that venue is proper in this Comi over 
the motion to quash served on Edwards (a Florida resident) in Florida. We address this issue 
because, on about June 15, 2016, defendant Maxwell's counsel contacted Edwards' counsel via 
email, asking for Edwards's consent to a motion to transfer his motion to quash to the U.S. District 
Comi for the Southern District of New York (Sweet, J.,) for decision. Maxwell's counsel took the 
position that the motion to quash should be determined by Judge Sweet in New York because he 
"has addressed all of the discove1y issues in the underlying litigation." Edwards indicated his 
opposition, in view of the bmden that would be imposed on him ifhe were forced to travel to New 
York to litigate the issue. A few days later, on June 20, 2016, Judge Sweet issued an order 
And on June 23, 2016, Judge Sweet held oral 
argument on motions in this case, thereafter quashing (for example) a subpoena served by 
Maxwell on Microsoft and Apple for all of Ms. Giuffre's email accounts. See Edwards Resp. 
Deel., Ex. 7 at 12, Tr. of Hearing on June 23, 2016. 
Following these adverse mlings from Judge Sweet, defendant Maxwell appears to have 
decided not to file a written motion to transfer this matter back to Judge Sweet. In the event that 
she makes such a motion orally, Edwards would note that in 2013, Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f) was 

amended to add protections for non-parties who are subpoenaed to produce materials in litigation 
conducted far from their residences.  As explained in the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 45(f), 
in the absence of consent, a court where the non-party resides may file a motion to quash an 
unduly burdensome subpoena in the district of his residence.  Thereafter, the court may transfer a 
motion to quash only “in exceptional circumstances, and the proponent of transfer bears the 
burden of showing that such circumstances are present. The prime concern should be avoiding 
burdens on local nonparties subject to subpoenas, and it should not be assumed that the issuing 
court is in a superior position to resolve subpoena-related motions.”  Edwards respectfully 
suggests that the issues regarding his motion to quash should be decided in this district where he 
resides. 
The Court should also be aware that parallel litigation is proceeding in Utah, where 
Edwards’ co-counsel, Cassell, resides.  Defendant Maxwell has served a largely identical 
subpoena on Cassell in Utah.  Cassell moved to quash the subpoena on grounds similar to those 
Edwards advances here. On June 30, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah (Furse, 
J.) entered an order transferring Cassell’s motion to quash back to the Southern District of New 
York under Rule 45(f), finding that “exceptional circumstances” existed for transfer.  In re: 
Subpoena to Paul G. Cassell, No. 2:16-mc-00602-DB-EJF, DE 20 (D. Utah).   
II.   
EDWARDS’S STATUS AS AN ATTORNEY FOR MS. GIUFFRE DOES NOT 
MAKE A SUBPOENA UPON HIM PROPER. 
At several points in her reply brief, Defendant Maxwell seems to argue that merely 
because Edwards has served as legal counsel for Ms. Giuffre he then becomes fair game for 
subpoenas for information.  As the Court knows from other discovery matters it has considered, 
subpoenas are rarely served on attorneys for parties to a case – and for good reason.  Discovery 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 11 of 26

requests are typically served on the client, and then the discovery matters are handled from there.
Defendant Maxwell has not been shy about serving voluminous and extensive discovery 
requests on Ms. Giuffre in the case.  But there is no good reason for additional requests served on 
her legal counsel, Edwards.  In an attempt to show a reason for departing from the ordinary 
approach, Ms. Maxwell cites Bridgeport Music Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc., No. 05 Civ. 6430, 
2007 WL 4410405 (S.D.N.Y. 2007), in which a subpoena was upheld for an attorney’s records.  
But in that case, the attorney had previously been deposed in connection with a copyright dispute, 
and testified that in his experience with “other agreements” and “typical record contract[s]”, 
certain issues were typically addressed in separate contacts.  At that point, the deposing party 
served a subpoena on the attorney, seeking production of those other agreements to which the 
attorney had referred in his deposition.  In denying a motion to quash, the Court explained that the 
central issue in the case concerned the interpretation of an agreement between the parties that had 
been negotiated by the attorney.  Id. at *3.  Moreover, the attorney had testified in his deposition 
about “other agreements,” and so a subpoena for the other agreements referred to was appropriate.   
Of course, in this case, Edwards has done nothing of the sort.  There is marked difference 
between inserting oneself into a case as fact witness and inserting oneself into a case as a lawyer to 
a party.  Despite Defendant Maxwell’s repeated attempts to assert that Edwards somehow 
“voluntarily chose to insert himself in this matter” [as a lawyer] (Maxwell Resp. at 16), the fact 
remains that this defamation case focuses solely on Maxwell’s defamatory statements.  
Defendant Maxwell also cites the case of Romano v. SLS Residential, Inc., 298 F.R.D. 103, 
111 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). See Maxwell Resp. at 9.  But that case, too, is inapposite, since it does not 
involve a subpoena directed to an attorney, but rather a subpoena directed to a party.  Maxwell 
offers no sound for reason for directing her subpoena to an opposing party’s legal counsel – a non-
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 12 of 26

party to the litigation.  As a result, “concern for the unwanted burden thrust upon non-parties is a 
factor entitled to special weight in evaluating the balance of competing needs” in a Rule 45 inquiry 
about whether to quash a subpoena as unduly burdensome.  Amini Innovation Corp. v. McFerran 
Home Furnishings, Inc., 300 F.R.D. 406, 409 (C.D. Cal. 2014).
III. 
The Court Should Quash Each of the Requests in the Subpoena to Edwards.
RFPs #1 and #2 Should be Quashed.  
The Court should quash RFPs #1 and #2, which ask Edwards to produce documents that 
were produced by Dershowitz (or to Dershowitz) as part of discovery in Edwards and Cassell v. 
Dershowitz litigation.   In his motion to quash, Edwards noted that defendant Maxwell could 
easily obtain the Dershowitz materials from Dershowitz himself.  MTQ at 9-10. In response, 
defendant Maxwell represents to the Court that information sought is “not available to Ms. 
Maxwell.”  Maxwell Resp. at 6.  This representation is untrue.  Defendant Maxwell already has 
Dershowitz discovery materials – materials that must have been provided to her by Dershowitz.  
This fact confirms that the discovery requests here are not about obtaining appropriate discovery, 
but rather about imposing a burden on Edwards as opposing legal counsel.   
The fact that defendant Maxwell already possesses Dershowitz discovery materials is 
demonstrated by her reference to a “recently discovered voice mail” from reporter Sharon 
Churcher to Cassell.  Maxwell Resp. at 8 (quoting from Feb. 2015 voicemail).  Maxwell is cagey 
about where she “discovered” this voicemail, but the only way it could have come into her 
possession is via actions by Dershowitz.  Cassell’s lawyer produced the voice mail to Dershowitz 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 13 of 26

as part of discovery in the Dershowitz litigation.  Presumably, Dershowitz has made it available to 
Maxwell, directly or indirectly.8
Defendant’s own brief thus belies her claim that she needs this discovery from Edwards 
because the materials are “not available” to her – her brief already cites some of this discovery. 
And now Maxwell asks this Court to force Edwards to painstakingly reassemble all the discovery 
in the Dershowitz case, collecting the same voicemail she quoted in her brief (and other materials) 
and producing it to her.  Obviously a subpoena to Edwards cannot be the “best, least burdensome, 
and most cost effective source for obtaining the information” (Maxwell Resp. at 7) given that 
Maxwell already possesses that same information.  It is clearly an “undue burden” to force 
Edwards to collect and produce, for example, a voicemail that defendant Maxwell has already 
obtained via Dershowitz. See Precourt v. Fairbank Reconstruction Corp., 280 F.R.D. 462, 467 
(D.S.D.2011) (“If the party seeking information can easily obtain the same information without 
burdening the non-party, the court will quash the subpoena.”). 
In addition to the fact that Maxwell already possesses Dershowitz discovery materials, she 
does not deny the main point of Edwards’s motion to quash: that it is far simpler for Maxwell to 
work with her ally Dershowitz on the Dershowitz discovery materials rather than force opposing 
counsel (Edwards) to assemble them for her.9  Indeed, in earlier litigation, Epstein’s attorney 
specifically stated that that there was a “common interest agreement” in place between Dershowitz 
and Maxwell.  See Edwards Decl., Ex. 4 at p. 524 (excerpt from Alan Dershowitz deposition) (“Q: 
So that I’m clear, there is a joint defense of the allegations regard Ghislaine Maxwell that’s New 
Maxwell is in a joint defense agreement with Epstein, who in turn is in a joint defense arrangement with Dershowitz.  
Dershowitz, accordingly, could have provided the voice mail to Epstein, who could have then provided it to his former 
girlfriend and co-conspirator, Maxwell.   
Dershowitz would have no shortage of lawyers to assist defendant Maxwell on this point.  Not only was he 
represented by legal team at a major Washington, D.C., law firm during the litigation, but he also used the services of 
more than two dozen other lawyers during the case.    
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 14 of 26

York litigation and this defamation case?  [Epstein’s Counsel:]  There’s a common interest 
agreement in effect with respect to the New York case and a common interest agreement with 
respect to this case [e.g., Edwards/Cassell v. Dershowitz].”).  Defendant Maxwell quibbles over 
the precise character of that agreement (Maxwell Resp. at 6), but does not deny the salient point 
that she and Dershowitz have a close working relationship through their common friend, Epstein.  
Once again, it is that close relationship that has presumably already allowed Maxwell to get a 
voicemail produced in Dershowitz discovery.  There is no reason why she can’t use that same 
relationship to smoothly obtain the other materials that are of interest to her. 
Maxwell argues, however, that it would require just “a few clicks of a mouse to copy 
production files.”  Maxwell Resp. at 9.  If this claim were true, it would argue for having 
Dershowitz make those “few” clicks.  Maxwell does not respond, however, to the affidavit from 
Edwards, explaining that, for him, the Dershowitz discovery was handled by private counsel, Jack 
Scarola – a Florida attorney who made and received production in various stages over the course 
of the extensive litigation.  See MTQ, Edwards Decl., Ex. 3 (Edwards Decl. at 2).  Maxwell, 
indeed, appears to concede that Edwards could not produce the documents in question on his own, 
but instead would be required to retain Scarola for this new legal matter (i.e., responding to a 
subpoena in a case to which Edwards is not a party, and in which obviously Scarola is not his 
counsel) and have Scarola piece together the discovery materials.  This could easily cost Edwards 
personally thousands of dollars in legal fees, an undue burden given that Maxwell already appears 
to have the information from Dershowitz or could easily obtain it from him.     
RFPs #3, #4, and #5 Should Be Quashed 
The Court should quash RFPs #3, #4, and #5, which seek discovery materials from the 
long-running case of Epstein v. Edwards.  In his motion to quash, Edwards explained why 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 15 of 26

production of the materials would be unduly burdensome, given the way in which the materials 
have been intermingled with other litigation over seven years.  See Edwards MTQ at 10-11.  In 
response, Defendant Maxwell simply asserts that Edwards has not offered factual support for his 
position.  Maxwell Resp. at 9.  This is simply untrue and, accordingly, Edwards Motion to Quash 
should be granted by Maxwell has failed to contest the arguments Edwards’ raises.   
Moreover, in his motion to quash, Edwards explained why the subpoena had to be 
regarded as unduly burdensome, because it was targeted at him – an opposing lawyer in the case – 
rather than to Epstein – with whom Defendant has a joint defense agreement.  See Edweard MTQ 
at 11.  Clearly it is far simpler for Defendant Maxwell to obtain these materials from her adversary 
(a billionaire with legions of lawyers) rather than from her adversary.  Her targeting of Edwards 
with the subpoena is clearly a tactic designed to burden opposing counsel and should be rejected. 
RFP #6 Should be Quashed. 
The Court should also quash RFP #6, which asks Edwards to produce documents provided 
in discovery from the case of Jane Does #1 et al. v. United States (S.D. Fla.) – i.e., correspondence 
between Epstein’s defense attorneys and the Government concerning the plea arrangement to be 
struck between the two.   This request seeks to have Edwards painstaking assemble a complete set 
of documents that was produced over eight years of complex, pro bono litigation.  The 
correspondence is currently subject to a protective order, obtained by defendant Maxwell’s co-
conspirator Jeffrey Epstein, entered in the Southern District of Florida, a fact which Edwards 
noted precluded his ability to comply with the subpoena in this case.  MTQ at 12. 
In response, Maxwell remarkably argues that the existence of the protective order is 
“irrelevant.”  Maxwell Resp. at 10.  Maxwell’s views of the relevance of the order 
notwithstanding, Edwards has no choice but to abide by the restrictions currently in place from the 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 16 of 26

Southern District of Florida.  Maxwell quickly retreats from this far-fetched argument to the 
fallback position that it “appears” that Edwards is not subject to a protective order.  Id.   But as her 
own hedged language suggests, an order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida restricts release of the materials provided to Edwards in discovery.  See Jane Does v. 
United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736 (S.D Fla. 2015), DE 326 at 4 (“On September 22, 2014, this 
Court granted Epstein’s request for a protective order in part and denied it in part. (DE 255). The 
Court held as follows:    “. . . The Court finds that Epstein has shown good cause to prevent 
potential dissemination of the correspondence between the government and the intervenors to the 
press for the purposes of generating publicity. Accordingly, the provisions [of the proposed 
protective order] that would limit disclosure of the correspondence in question to the proposed list 
of people are acceptable.”).  If Maxwell would like to pursue discovery of the plea bargain 
correspondence between Epstein’s lawyers and the Government’s lawyers, then she must first 
approach the court in the Southern District of Florida to obtain a modification of the protective 
order.
But, once again, Maxwell’s technical quibbling misses the larger point (raised by Edwards 
in his motion to quash at 12) – that the plea bargain correspondence between Epstein’s lawyers 
and Government prosecutors can be far more easily obtained by simply getting the materials 
directly from Epstein or the Government.10  Maxwell does not dispute that she is in joint defense 
agreement with her former boyfriend, Epstein, and is presumably working closely with him on this 
case.  It is an undue burden to force Edwards (a pro bono attorney on the CVRA case) to assemble 
In her response, Maxwell does not address why it would not be possibly to obtain the same materials from the 
federal Government, rather than from Cassell.  Given the vastly greater resources of the U.S. Government, compared 
to a law professor handling a pro bono crime victims’ rights case, it is an undue burden for Maxwell to try and force 
Cassell to assemble the documents – and, indeed, the sole object of the request appears to be discovery “merely for the 
sake” of creating a burden, a clear basis for quashing the subpoena.  See Jones, 219 F.R.D. at 78.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 17 of 26

materials that Maxwell’s billionaire boyfriend has at his fingertips and is able to produce (and, 
indeed, may have already described and produced) to Maxwell.  Defendant Maxwell also notes 
that, with regard to some discovery efforts in the past, Epstein has invoked his Fifth Amendment 
right against self-incrimination.  For example, rather than explaining what role Maxwell had in his 
sex trafficking operations, Epstein took the Fifth.  The Fifth Amendment, however, has absolutely 
no application to correspondence between Epstein’s lawyers and Government prosecutors.
Obviously, matters discussed with a prosecutor can hardly be claimed to be confidential materials 
for which a Fifth Amendment privilege applies.   
RPFs #7, #8, and #9 Should be Quashed. 
RFPs #7, #8, and #9 seek engagement letters between the plaintiff in the case (Virginia 
Giuffre) and Edwards as her attorney, as well as joint defense or common interest agreements 
relating to Ms. Giuffre.   Defendant Maxwell has withdrawn her request for these items. 
RFPs #10 and #11 Should be Quashed. 
The Court should also quash RFPs #10 and #11, which seek documents concerning 
Edwards’s work forming or on behalf of Victims Refuse Silence, Inc. (VRS).   Here again, the 
intent of these requests appear to be to force Edwards to search for and catalog materials that (to 
the extent they are not privileged) are available from another source – specifically VRS.  Forcing 
Edwards to search for these materials will, of course, divert him from performing his duties as an 
attorney litigating a case against Maxwell.  Indeed, Defendant Maxwell concedes that she has 
served a subpoena on the VRS itself for various records.  Maxwell Resp. at 11.  The real point of 
the duplicative request to Edwards, as Defendant herself appears to admit, is to have Edwards 
assemble exactly the same records and then compare all of his records to those from VRS.  See id. 
(“To the extent [there] are documents that will be produced by Victims Refuse Silence . . . under 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 18 of 26

the VRS subpoena, Edwards simply needs to state that they are being provided from that 
source.”).  It is an undue burden to force Edwards to duplicate efforts being untaken elsewhere. 
Maxwell also does not dispute the affidavit from Edwards, filed with his motion to quash, 
that “[w]ith regard to any work that I have done on behalf of a Florida corporation, Victims Refuse 
Silence, Inc. (VRS), that would have been work as an attorney for my client Ms. Giuffre and 
would, accordingly, be protected by the attorney-client privilege” (not to mention work product 
protection).  Edwards Decl. [DE 1-1] at ¶ 18.  Given the protected nature of such materials, the 
real point of the request does not appear to be to actually obtain any discovery of these items, but 
rather to force Edwards to spend time drafting a privilege log for work that he did for his client.  
See Maxwell Resp. at 11 (“To the extent that any communications are privileged, they can be 
logged as such.”).
It is also hard to understand Maxwell’s theory of relevance of these materials held by 
lawyer Edwards in the first instance.  Whatever bearing Ms. Giuffre’s non-profit organization has 
to this case can (and has been) explored through discovery from her directly.  Defendant Maxwell 
does not explain why that discovery was somehow inadequate or in need of supplementation.   
Finally, as Edwards explained in his motion to quash (at p. 14), these requests are 
hopelessly vague and overbroad.  The requests seek such things as “disclosures made by You to . . 
. any person associated with VRS.”  Edwards’s client, Ms. Giuffre, is plainly a person “associated 
with VRS,” id. at ¶ 11, so this request seems to ask for all communications between Edwards and 
his client, unrestricted as to time and subject.  Clearly, these requests are vague, overbroad, and 
unduly burdensome – as Maxwell’s failure to respond to these arguments seemingly admits.   
RFP #12 Should be Quashed. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 19 of 26

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 20 of 26
The Court should also quash RFP #12, which seeks "documents relating to any disclosures 
made by You [to] Virginia Roberts Giuffre, or consents provided to You by Virginia Giuffre, 
pursuant to any of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct." Defendant Maxwell does not 
dispute that all of these materials would necessarily involve privileged attorney-client 
communications. See Edwards MTQ at 15. Nor does she provide any reason for needing this 
info1mation or how it could possibly be relevant at trial. This RFP should be quashed as well. 
RFP # 13 Should be Quashed. 
The Court also quash RFP #13, which seeks all documents "concerning any investigation 
by any law enforcement agency that refer to Ghislaine Maxwell." 
In her response, Defendant 
Maxwell attempts to modify her request to exclude production of documents related to any 
"purpo1ied cmTently pending, unidentified law enforcement investigations." Presumably this 
nanowing of her request stems from 
What remains of Maxwell's request in the 
wake of that mling is unclear, because - if nanowed - the request would seem to apply only to 
identified law enforcement investigations that are no longer pending. But if the request is liinited 
only to "identified" law enforcement investigations, Defendant Maxwell has absolutely no basis 
In her pleading, Defendant Maxwell tries to cast doubt on the existence of on-going la:w enforcement investigation 
of her sex crimes by using the word "pwported" to describe the investigation. Maxwell Resp. at 13. However, as 
Maxwell well knows, Ms. Giuffre submitted materials concerning the on-going law enforcement investigation to 
Judge Sweet for in camera review, along with request that the materials not be disclosed to Maxwell to avoid 
compromising the investigation. 

for asking Edwards (a non-party) to produce government records.  Maxwell can simply make 
appropriate public records requests to the government agencies and obtain the materials that way.  
See, e.g., Brown v. City of Syracuse, 648 F.Supp.2d 461, 466 (N.D.N.Y.2009) (when balancing 
hardships between requesting party and non-party, court should consider whether there are other 
sources for obtaining the material).  It also hard to tell what a “pending” investigation would be in 
the newly-narrowed request – particularly with reference to the Florida federal investigation, 
which remains in litigation about whether additional prosecutions against Epstein and his co-
conspirators are proper in Florida.  That investigation would, accordingly, appear to be “pending” 
and therefore not covered by newly-narrowed request. 
Undeterred by these complexities, Defendant Maxwell proceeds to launch an attack on Ms. 
Giuffre’s alleged failures to produce appropriate discovery in the litigation.  According to 
Maxwell, Ms. Giuffre’s failures should lead this Court to force her attorney to produce the 
documents that Ms. Giuffre (allegedly) improperly withheld.  See Maxwell’s Resp. at 13-14.
As one of Ms. Giuffre’s attorneys, Edwards has tried to work diligently to assure that she 
has complied with all of her discovery obligations – and, Edwards strenuously contests that 
suggestion that she has failed to produce documents to which the Defendant is entitled.  But for 
purposes of this present motion to quash, the overarching point is that the Defendant Maxwell is 
improperly trying to litigate a party’s obligation to produce various documents in a lawsuit filed in 
the Southern District of New York by subpoenaing the party’s attorney in Florida – a non-party to 
the case – and then litigating the issue here.  A clearer example of an “undue burden” would be 
harder to find.  Maxwell is either entitled to the documents or not from Ms. Giuffre.  Satellite 
litigation against her attorney in a distant forum is not the proper way to resolve the issue.  If 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 21 of 26

Maxwell believes Ms. Giuffre should produce the documents, Maxwell should pursue that issue 
directly with Ms. Giuffre – not with her attorney.
RFP #15 Should be Quashed.   
The Court should quash RFP #15, which seeks documents relating to “any journalist, 
reporter, producer, author, director, or any employee or agent of the same,” connected to Virginia 
Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell, or Jeffrey Epstein.
As Edwards explained in his motion to quash, this request is hopelessly vague and 
overbroad.  See Motion to Quash at 16-17.  The categories of people included (e.g., any “author” 
or “journalist” or “agent of the same”) do not lend themselves to immediate and narrow 
identification.  Id. The request is also unbounded as to time, and thus sweeps in materials remote 
from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case.  For example, the request includes nearly eight years of pro
bono work that Edwards has done on Does v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736 (S.D. Fla.) – 
including approximately six years of work (2008 to 2014) before Edwards was even representing 
Ms. Giuffre.  Id. To answer RFP #11, Edwards would have to review more than 200,000 emails 
he received and sent during that time.  See Edwards Decl. [DE 1-1] at ¶ 23.  How he would search 
those emails and identify which came from “journalists” and “reporters” is not immediately clear 
and the burden imposed on him would clearly be substantial.  Id.
Remarkably, Defendant Maxwell does not substantively respond to the vagueness and 
overbreadth arguments.  Instead, Maxwell tries to explain why Edwards’s contacts with the media 
are relevant to the case.  Maxwell Resp. at 14-15.  But Defendant Maxwell does not explain how 
communications from Edwards are needed in light of the evidence that has already been 
developed.  Instead, she makes a gratuitous allegation that Ms. Giuffre’s counsel have 
“strategically employed communications to the press, leaking information when they thought it 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 22 of 26

would help generate interest in her book.”  Maxwell Resp. at 15 (citing Pagliuca Decl., Ex. N).  
But the evidence cited for the allegation that counsel have been “leaking information” is a court 
pleading (Ex. N) filed in the Southern District of Florida.  Maxwell never explains how filing a 
court pleading on behalf of a client constitutes a “leak.”    
The only specific argument Maxwell makes is to point to a “shocking” voicemail left by 
Sharon Churcher for Edwards in early February 2015, in which Churcher states that “I think the 
FBI affidavit is pretty close to perjury.”  Maxwell Resp. at 7.12  But it is a matter of public record 
that Churcher was following the CVRA case in Florida and that on January 30, 2015, there was an 
“FBI affidavit” filed in that case.  See Does v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736 (S.D. Fla.), DE 
304-1, available in Edwards Reply Decl., Ex. 8, Agent Slater Affidavit.  That affidavit did not 
pertain to the details of Ms. Giuffre’s sexual abuse, but rather the efforts of the FBI to maintain 
contact with Ms. Giuffre. But, in any event, whether what FBI Agent Slater said about the FBI’s 
contacts with Ms. Giuffre was or was not true has essentially no relevance to the Giuffre v. 
Maxwell lawsuit.  And other than baldly asserting that the voicemail as “a critically relevant 
communication,” Maxwell makes no attempt why details surrounding FBI Agent Slater’s affidavit 
have any real connection to the case.
Moreover, even if Agent Slater’s affidavit somehow did skirt the truth (a subject on which 
Ms. Giuffre takes no position here), that was an allegation being made by Ms. Churcher – not 
Edwards.  Maxwell currently has pending before Judge Sweet in New York a motion to compel 
Ms. Churcher to be deposed on all such subjects.  Maxwell made her argument before Judge 
Sweet on June 21, and he took the issue under advisement.  If Judge Sweet grants her motion, 
As discussed above in connection with RFPs #1 and #2, Maxwell already has access to this voicemail and 
presumably all other communications surrounding it.  Accordingly, for the reasons explain above, the duplicative 
request for production by Cassell is an undue burden.    
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 13     Filed 07/07/16     Page 23 of 26

Maxwell will be able to get all the information she wants on this subject from Churcher directly, 
and there is no need to burden Edwards on the subject.  If the motion is denied, then the Court 
should consider that limitation in deciding whether to force Edwards to go on wild goose chase 
through nearly 300,000 emails to try and identify materials that would have only the most remote 
connection to this case.  This Court should weigh “the burden to [the non-party subpoena 
recipient] against the value of the information to [the issuer of the subpoena]” and find that “the 
subpoena imposes an ‘undue burden’ on the nonparty.”  Moon, 232 F.R.D. at 637.
IV.  Edwards Reserves the Right to Raise Other Objections. 
For all the reasons just explained, the Court should quash the subpoena issued to Edwards 
in its entirety under Fed. R. Civ. P 45(c)(3)(A)(iv).  If for any reason the Court finds that any 
portion of the subpoena survives this motion to quash, Edwards would then respectfully request 
any opportunity to raise such other general and specific objections to the subpoena as may be 
appropriate, including overbreadth concerns and attorney-client privilege, work-product 
protections, public interest privilege and common-interest privilege.
CONCLUSION
For the forgoing reasons, Edwards respectfully requests that this Court grant the motion to 
quash or enter a protective order barring enforcement of the Subpoena.

NOTICE OF WITHDRAW AL OF MOTION FOR 
PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
Plaintiffs, Edwards and Cassell, by and through their undersigned counsel, and pursuant to 
the terms of the confidential settlement agreement and mutual release between the parties to this 
action, do hereby give notice of the withdrawal of the motion for partial summary judgment they 
filed in this lawsuit and all supporting documents. 
In the event that the noticed withdrawal is determined to be subject to Court approval, the 
Plaintiffs would show in support of this notice that Edwards and Cassell continue to represent 
Virginia Giuffre in separate pending matters, and shall continue to advance her legitimate legal 
interests in those matters. As expressly understood by the parties upon the execution of the 
Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, Ms. Giuffre reaffirms her allegations, 
and the withdrawal of the referenced filings is not intended to be, and should not be construed as 
being, an acknowledgement by Edwards and Cassell that the allegations made by Ms. Giuffre were 
mistaken. Edwards and Cassell do acknowledge that the public filing in the Crime Victims'

Rights Act case of their client's allegations against Defendant Dershowitz became a major

(Case called)
THE COURT: Extending discovery.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  This is Sigrid
McCawley on behalf of the plaintiff, and we had filed a motion
for additional time to complete six depositions.  Your Honor
may recall that we received an order on Monday that allowed for
alternative services to three of the witnesses that we were
seeking to depose.  Our discovery cutoff right now is set for
June 30th, which is I believe next Friday, if I'm correct.  So
at present we have six witnesses that we still need to depose,
the three that we had alternative service for, and then we have
Mr. Ross GOw, who was the defendant's agent who issued the
defamatory statement, Mr. Brunel --
THE COURT:  How much time do you want?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.  We were requesting 30 days to
complete those depositions to coordinate with their counsel and
then coordinate with the defendant's counsel and get those set,
and I believe we can do that without altering the Court's
deadline for a trial, which is set presently for November --
I'm sorry, October 17th.
THE COURT:  OK.  What is wrong with that?
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, in theory, initially there
is nothing wrong with that.  It seems to me that we're not
going to complete a variety of discovery issues by July 1.  The
problem, I think, your Honor, is the cascading effect of that

extension.
And if I could digress for a moment and just a moment?
When we were here I think in March, the Court raised the issue
of was this enough time for discovery at that time.  I told the
Court I didn't think so, and I didn't think that the trial date
was reasonable as a result of what I perceived to be problems
going forward with discovery.  Counsel on the other side
opposed my suggestion as to extension of time at that point and
we proceeded.  The Court agreed with the plaintiff and not with
me.
The problem I see, your Honor, is that now we are
scheduled to have expert disclosures due in July, dispositive
motions in August, and a trial date in October.  I don't
believe that it is feasible, if we continue discovery out until
the end of July, to have expert discovery done by the end of
August.  I don't believe it is going to be feasible to have
dispositive motions completed in the time set by the Court, and
all of that is going to push into whether or not we have an
October 18th trial date.
I think the Court also needs to consider, your Honor,
and of course is now familiar with the volume of paper that
gets filed in this court on a regular basis at all hours of the
day and night, and I anticipate that there are going to be
significant evidentiary issues that the Court is going to need
to rule on in advance of trial.  The Court sees a harbinger of

those issues today, I think, as a result of these subpoenas.
All of that tells me that the prudent course of action in my
view is to sort of try to sit down and rework some of these
discovery deadlines with an idea that we're going to actually
have realistic dates.
THE COURT:  OK.  Good.  I'll extend the deadline 30
days.  I'll direct counsel to meet and confer and see if they
can come up with a schedule that both sides will agree upon.
Second, the plaintiff wants to maintain certain
confidentiality designations.  What is the problem?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
So, with respect to our revised Rule 26 disclosures,
we, in order to divulge all information relevant to the case,
had a list of individuals on there who are allegedly victims of
sexual abuse themselves as minors or witnessed things.  So we
designated under our protective order in this case that Rule 26
disclosure as confidential.  It was challenged under the
Protective Order.  Once it is challenged, we have a ten-day
window to file something with the Court.  So we filed our
motion for the protective order.
On Friday of this past week, on the 17th, they issued
a new -- defendants issued a new Rule 26 disclosure with 42 new
names on it, those of which were on our disclosures, without
marking it as confidential.  So I sent them an email just
asking them to hold that as confidential until the Court has an

opportunity to rule on whether or not those names can remain
confidential under the protective order.  So that is the status
as we are right now.
So we are awaiting a ruling.  We believe those
individuals should be protected under the Court's protective
order and those names kept confidential during the course of
this, and it is my understanding that defendants oppose that
position.
THE COURT:  What is the attack?
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Well, your Honor, under the terms of
the protective order, certain categories of information is
likely confidential.  People's names, in my view, are not
confidential.  I didn't choose to list these folks in what I
understand is a Rule 26(a) disclosure, which is a good faith
disclosure of people who may have information relevant to the
claims or defenses in the case.  That's their listing.  All it
is is the names of people.
I have absolutely no idea or ability to understand why
someone's name could be considered to be confidential.  It is
their name.  They use it every day.  They walk around with it.
They have a driver's license with it.  I don't understand how
names in a 26A(a) disclosure could be deemed confidential.
And what I view this as is just simply, you know,
another step in the process here of preventing access and use
of information.

THE COURT:  Well, you've got the information.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  I do have the information.
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Why is it confidential?
THE COURT:  Why?
MS. McCAWLEY:  May I address that, your Honor?  Did
you want me to address that?
THE COURT:  Yes.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.  So with respect to the reason
why individuals who may have been victims of sexual assault
would be confidential, there is case law that we cite in our
brief, Doby v. Evans, which deals with using, for example,
pseudonyms of victims --
THE COURT:  Let's just -- I think we can shorthand in
the context of the patois of this case.
Victims.  OK.  You want to maintain the
confidentiality of the identity of the victims.  OK?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT:  Beyond that?
MS. McCAWLEY:  Right.  Beyond that we are fine.
THE COURT:  OK.  All right.  That will be maintained.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you.
THE COURT:  Apple and Microsoft.  Let me ask the
defense, seems to me the law bars the subpoenas.

think it's a legitimate Rule 45 subpoena.  I don't understand
why it would be barred under Rule 45.  There is no objection by
the providers of the information.  They have indicated to us
that if there is a release that's provided to them by the
plaintiff, they will turn over the information.  And I don't
understand what the problem is.  This is information indeed,
your Honor, that the plaintiffs are required to produce to us
under our discovery requests and have not, which resulted in
these Rule 45 subpoenas.  After the Rule 45 --
THE COURT:  Well, as far as Apple, my understanding
about Apple is that with respect to that, that material has
been reviewed by counsel and everything has been turned over
that's appropriate.
MS. SCHULTZ:  That is correct, your Honor.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Well, if that's true, your Honor, then
the issue is moot and I agree.
THE COURT:  If what?
MR. PAGLIUCA:  The issue is moot if that is true.
THE COURT:  So Apple is out.
Now, the problem with Microsoft, I'm not quite clear.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  The problem for me or the problem for
them?

Giuffre.  My client had two email accounts with Microsoft.
They are personal emails accounts.  We have not been able to
access that.
THE COURT:  Why not?
MS. SCHULTZ:  Well, it appears for one -- there is one
called live.com, and it appears for that, that that has been
administratively deleted.  I don't have personal knowledge of
that, but when you put in the email address to try to recover
it, I get a message saying we don't recognize this one, "this
one" being the email address.  That is Exhibit 1 to our brief
on this matter.
We wrote a letter to opposing counsel citing some
governing provisions of Microsoft's email policy that indicates
that due to inactivity they delete accounts after a certain
amount of time.  It's my understanding that that has happened
to that account but I can't say so for sure.  So we are unable
to access that whatsoever.
The second account is a hotmail.com account.  We have
also been unable to access that.  It appears that it still
exists, but despite multiple and diligent attempts to get into
that account, we have been unable to.  And I have been involved
in those attempts myself personally.  Accordingly, we have
captured and produced every electronic document to which we
have access.
And I'd like to speak a minute about the legality of

the Microsoft subpoena.  Even under Rule 26, it is a hopelessly
broad subpoena.  It is abusive civil discovery and on the face
of it appears to violate the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act and the Stored Communications Act, federal laws.  The email
seeks -- excuse me.  The subpoena seeks every email that has
ever been sent to that account or sent from that account.
That's every single personal email.  This is without
limitations, without exceptions, without a timeline.  And
pursuant to these subpoenas, these emails are to be turned over
to defense counsel.  So, plaintiff's counsel would not have an
opportunity to review for attorney-client privilege email,
review for relevance, and it wholly circumvents the protections
of the discovery process, which is why courts who have looked
at this issue have consistently rejected these broad subpoenas.
Defendants know that they are not entitled to every
single personal email plaintiff has ever sent or ever received
in the course of however many years these accounts were open.
In fact, Judge Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit allowed a civil
suit against those who propounded these improper subpoenas, and
that was with regard to a professional email account, as
opposed to personal email accounts, the issue in this case
THE COURT:  Do we know what the date of this account
is?
MS. SCHULTZ:  It's an old account.  I think, 2011 -- I
know that it was -- at least one of them was active in 2011.

It's impossible for me to determine at this point when it was
opened and when it was last used because we don't have access
to them.
THE COURT:  Yes.  OK.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, this is the problem and I'm
going to be frank.  This is a hide-the-ball problem.  They tell
us -- so let me backup.
We were originally told these are the only email
accounts that the plaintiff had.  When we deposed her, we found
out about these accounts.  We then get into an issue with
counsel telling us, oh, we've done this due diligence search
and we can't access any of this information, these accounts are
closed.  Well, then we look into it a little bit further and we
find out, indeed, the accounts are not closed; indeed, they
have been active, and there are indeed emails that are relevant
to the issues in this case that were sent and received out of
these accounts.  That's a fact here.
Now, all they need to do, if they want to avoid
electronic privacy issues, is comply with their discovery
obligations, execute a release, and send it to Microsoft.
Microsoft will then give them the information.  That's what we
have been told in response to this subpoena.
So to sit here and say, oh, it's overbroad and it's a
problem and you can't do it, you know, you can't have it both
ways.  You either can't avoid discovery of something that you

are required to give up and then say, gee, we don't have access
to it.  That's the conundrum here, your Honor.
I'm sorry we are here at this point.  I agree, if
there is privileged information in there, maybe somebody should
review it.  But when you tell opposing counsel we don't have
access to it and the account is closed and that's indeed not
true, it seems to me that you have forfeited your ability to
then stand up and say the subpoena is overbroad.
THE COURT:  Forgive me, but what's the basis upon
which you say it's not true?
MR. PAGLIUCA:  The account is not closed?
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Because we have been told that by
Microsoft when we issued them the subpoena.
MS. SCHULTZ:  Can I address that really briefly?
My communications regarding these accounts are in
letters that are attached to the briefs in this case.  I never
said that the Hotmail account was closed.  I said that we are
unable to access it.
With regard to the Live.com account, I said it appears
to be closed because the website does not recognize the email
address.  I never told them that the accounts were closed.
I am more than happy to sign a release to Microsoft
for any data that they might have to be delivered to
plaintiff's counsel, at which point we will be more than happy

to run our search terms, review it, and produce anything that

THE COURT:  That is good.
MS. SCHULTZ:  But the subpoenas are requesting that
all of our data be turned over to defense counsel.
THE COURT:  OK.  Well, so what we'll do is at the
moment -- yes, OK, we'll quash the subpoena on Microsoft, with
the understanding that that's not on the merits and it can be
renewed, if necessary.  Also, on the understanding that the
plaintiffs will do whatever is necessary to get access to these
accounts, review them, and determine -- treat it as the Apple
accounts have been treated.
OK.  So that solves that problem.

the subpoena and the document requests, which are quite broad,
by the way, and which we have to assume provide the contours of
the information they are seeking in deposition, were created or
obtained by Ms. Churcher in the course of her news-gathering
activities, and much of the information sought was communicated
in confidence, as well.  So under the New York State Shield
Law, which is the appropriate law and which defendants
acknowledge is the appropriate law, not the slightly less
protective Federal Reporters' privilege, the defendant has a
heavy burden to meet to even obtain nonconfidential
information, and confidential information is absolutely
privileged.
We just received an opposition to our motion which was
filed last night after close of business and we've been
reviewing it, but much of the substance of it is redacted out
pursuant, presumably, to the protective order.  We had
previously offered defense counsel to sign the acknowledgment
of the protective order, which does provide for disclosure to
witnesses and witnesses' counsel.  They didn't take us up on it
before.  Obviously, the offer still stands.
But what we can say based on what we've seen is that
the defendant claims that Ms. Churcher, who they fully
acknowledge reported stories about this case -- not this
litigation but the underlying case and who first met the
plaintiff when she traveled to Australia to interview her in
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

2011, that she at some point along the way transformed from a
reporter reporting news into a friend or a business adviser.
It's not clear again because of the redactions when this
transformation presumably took place.  But the reality is that
that is simply an incorrect characterization of the
relationship.
Since 2011, and continuing up, frankly, through the
present day, Ms. Churcher has continued to cover this story as
a reporter, has published stories, including just I think two
months ago, often using "Virginia" or her so-called agents as
sources, of course most prominently in early 2015, which is
what underlies this particular litigation.
By its terms, the Shield Law applies to any
information obtained or communications made, quote, in the
course of gathering or obtaining news for publication.  Now, of
course, a reporter's source relationship is complicated.  Not
every single interaction or every single communication is going
to be an interview with questions and answers that then get
published verbatim.  So to the extent that there are particular
emails where Sharon provided advice to Virginia, that doesn't
transform the overall relationship from reporter and source to
adviser and advisee or friend.
Reporters communicate with sources in a variety of
ways.  A police beat reporter may take a sergeant out for
drinks and talk about life in general with no intention of
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

      G6ndgium
publishing details but with the intention of maintaining that
close source relationship so that when the sergeant comes into
possession of information, he's right there as the first
recipient of that information.
As this Court stated in the Schoolcraft case, that the
reporter's privilege seeks to prevent the unnecessary enmeshing
of the press in litigation that arises from events they cover.
And that's exactly what this is.
The Second Circuit interprets the qualified privilege
very broadly to apply not only to individual bits of
information gathered from sources but also to unpublished
details of the news gathering process.  That's from the Baker
v. Goldman Sachs case, 669 F.3d 105, from 2012.
But either way, what they're seeking here, as
described in their opposition, is quintessential news gathering
Shield Law material.  They list it at a couple of different
points in their brief.  They are asking for Sharon Churcher's
interview notes, recordings, memos, and other documentation
that are clearly, and concededly by the defendant, from the
news gathering process.
In order to overcome this Shield Law for even the
nonconfidential information, they have to make a clear and
specific showing that the information is highly material and
relevant, that it's critical or necessary to the maintenance of
the claim or defense, and that it is not obtainable from any
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

      G6ndgium
alternate sources.  So as an initial point, it is quite clear
that they haven't exhausted all other sources up to and
including the proceedings here today, where they are continuing
to seek material from the plaintiff's email accounts, which
your Honor just granted an order that would facilitate that,
and also the pending motion to reopen plaintiff's deposition.
So clearly they haven't exhausted plaintiff as a source.
They are also asking for Ms. Churcher's communications
with the plaintiff's agents or attorneys or communications with
law enforcement about the plaintiff, but we're not aware of any
effort to obtain that information from those agents and
attorneys or from law enforcement.  Obviously, law enforcement
may have their own objections to a subpoena.  And while the
defendants may not like what the FBI would say here, but there
are certainly alternative sources that they are required under
the Shield Law to turn to before seeking this from a reporter.
In addition, the information -- again, we haven't seen
precisely what it is because it is blacked out of their
opposition but to the extent we understand it -- does not meet
the critical or necessary prong, which is, under the Second
Circuit law and under New York law, quite high.  As the Second
Circuit articulated in Krase v. Graco, 79 F.3d 346, the
information can be compelled, or disclosure can be compelled
when the claim or defense, quote, virtually rises or falls with
the admission or exclusion of the proffered evidence.  And they

just -- they have not made that showing here.
They talk about the fact that they need this
information because the credibility of the plaintiff is key,
but the credibility of a plaintiff is key in many kinds of
cases and certainly very often in libel case, where truth or
falsity is sort of the ultimate issue being tried, and there is
obviously not a wholesale exception for libel or any case where
the plaintiff's credibility is central to the Shield Law.
They also focus heavily on the idea that the story
changed over time from what was published in 2011 and what was
published in 2015 and after and, in particular, the question of
whether Virginia had sex with Prince Andrew or not.  In 2011,
the article stated that there was not evidence that that
happened.  In 2015, after court papers stated that it had
happened, they then reported that it had.  But I would submit
that's less an issue of the story changing than what changed
was what the newspapers were comfortable publishing.
There is actually a Vanity Fair article about this
that was published later in 2011 that talks about how -- it
talks about Prince Andrew -- that's what the article is
about -- and it talks about the strictness of British libel
laws that likely are what contributed to newspapers sort of
hedging on that point.
This also is not a case where the journalist was an
eyewitness to events in her capacity as a citizen.  She wasn't

      G6ndgium
there when whatever happened with Ms. Maxwell and Ms. Giuffre
took place, witnessing it as citizen Sharon Churcher.  All of
her knowledge about this comes from reporting as a reporter.
And, finally, because the documents all fall within
the Shield Law, a reporter should not be burdened with going
and sitting for a deposition where her counsel basically
objects to every question as privileged under the Shield Law.
And both the New York Court of Appeals and the Second Circuit
have emphasized that.  The New York Court of Appeals said, in
Holmes v. Winter, which we cite in our brief, where the entire
focus of a reporter's testimony would be on privileged topics,
quote, No legitimate purpose would be served by requiring a
witness to go through the formality of appearing to testify
only to refuse to answer questions concerning the information
sought.
And the Second Circuit, in Gonzalez, talked about the
dangers that if parties to a lawsuit were free to subpoena the
press at will, it would become standard operating procedure,
and the resulting wholesale exposure of press files to
litigants' scrutiny would burden the press with heavy costs of
subpoena compliance and could otherwise impair its ability to
perform its duties.
Finally, even setting aside the Shield Law, the scope
of the subpoena is very broad and overly burdensome even just
as a third party.  These communications go back at least five

years, if not more.  Ms. Churcher was employed at different
newspapers and is a freelancer, so we are talking about
multiple email accounts.  So even just gathering this broad
scope of communications which aren't limited by time or
specific subject matter would be quite burdensome, but, again,
because the Shield Law applies, a fortiori, as a journalist,
she should not be put to that burden.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, I start with -- I would
like to read to the Court an example of Ms. Churcher's

I was allowed to bring my cell phone in, I would play it, but I
wrote it down to read it to the Court.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Excuse me, your Honor.  I just want to
make sure that we are not -- some documents have been labeled

there are other individuals present in the courtroom --
THE COURT:  Yes.  Find out what it is.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you.

Ms. Churcher left for Paul Cassell, who is a lawyer in this
case who entered an appearance in this case, in February of
2015.
On February 5, 2015, your Honor, it starts out:  Paul,
it's Sharon.  I wanted to discuss and with you on a deep
background basis something that's in my file.  I, as you know,
feel almost like a friend of Virginia's.  I think that the FBI
affidavit was pretty close to perjury.  Give me a call when you
get a chance.  On a deep background basis, if it's not going to
be a conflict for you, it's something that I wanted to get your
advice on.  Take care.  Bye-bye.
This voice message is troubling on a number of levels,
your Honor, in connection with this case.  First, it has never
been provided to us, and there is a lawyer who has entered an
appearance in this case.  We have asked for this kind of
discovery from the plaintiff and it has never been provided,
and it's germane to the issues before the Court.  But what it
reveals is that this is not Ms. Churcher's first interaction
with Mr. Cassell, lawyer for the plaintiff.  They are on a
first-name basis.  She is feeling free to call him and leave
messages for him.
And what she wants to discuss is apparently an
affidavit prepared by the FBI that's been provided to
Ms. Churcher by someone; I don't know whom, your Honor, but I'm
going to presume it was provided to Ms. Churcher by the
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

plaintiff.  That's troubling as well because we went through
litigation in this case about our access to alleged
public-interest privileged documents that were not turned over
to us but were submitted in camera to the Court.  But to the
extent that that's part of those documents and Ms. Churcher has
it, that's a problem for the discovery process in this case.
And it's a problem for Ms. Churcher, your Honor,
because it's clear, as is attached to our papers, that
Ms. Churcher's role in this entire ordeal was not simply a
journalist.  Ms. Churcher is a self-described friend.  She is a
self-described adviser.  She's a self-described confidante.
She is a self-described advocate.  In many instances throughout
this ordeal, Ms. Churcher was acting as a source of information
to Mr. Edwards, who is another lawyer who has entered an
appearance in this case, and to law enforcement.
The Shield Law only applies when journalists are asked
to disclose information received in the course of gathering or
obtaining news for publication.  And Ms. Churcher's activities
in connection with this case are far outside of those bounds.
To be clear, we don't want that information from Ms. Churcher.
So whatever information Ms. Churcher has that was indeed
obtained in her job in the course of gathering or obtaining
news for publication, we haven't subpoenaed that information.
But I suggest, your Honor, that the blanket notion
that Ms. Churcher can't sit for a deposition in this case is

simply wrong, and these issues need to be resolved on a
question-and-answer basis by Ms. Churcher, because her role in
connection with this case far exceeded any role as a
journalist.
Indeed, your Honor, Ms. Churcher is a fact witness in
this case.  The Shield Law relied on is only applicable when
the journalist is asked to disclose information, again,
received in the course of gathering or obtaining news for
publication.  And much of the information that we are asking --
if, indeed, it is not all -- from Ms. Churcher has nothing to
do with information she gathered or collected in the course of
gathering news for publication.
We have Ms. Churcher meeting with the plaintiff in
early 2011 and then conducting a week-long series of interviews
leading to the publications in March of 2011.  We then go
through another five years here where the story changes, and it
is reasonable, I believe, to believe that the story is changing
not because of the truth of the story but because of
information that's being given to the plaintiff and she is then
changing her story to make it more salacious and more sellable
to various people through the world.
There is a series of exchanges between the plaintiff
and Ms. Churcher that we have in email communications that have
been provided to the Court that demonstrate this course of
conduct over time.  We also have a series of communications

between the plaintiff and law enforcement and the plaintiff's
lawyers that are not news-gathering activities.  These are
wholly outside of the process of gathering news.  And they are
sharing information back and forth, and Ms. Churcher is
providing information to Mr. Edwards, counsel in this case.
Ms. Churcher is advising the plaintiff on how to deal with her
own lawyer in connection with maximizing her return on
publishing details that appear to be provided to the plaintiff
by Ms. Churcher.  All of this is outside the bounds of any
Shield Law or any privilege.
I think the Court knows -- I'm sure the Court is
exhausted with all of the pleadings that have been filed in
this case related to discovery.  I believe we have exhausted
all avenues available to us to obtain this information.  There
is really no place else to go.  And so there is -- I think it
is not well founded, your Honor, that there is some notion that
we have not done everything that we can to get this information
from the plaintiff, Microsoft, other places before turning to a
subpoena to Ms. Churcher.
Ms. Churcher is likely the only source of this highly
relevant information, which is this 24-page fabricated diary
and the testimony around that, communications with law
enforcement and the FBI that have no legitimate investigative
reporter purpose.
So, for those reasons, Judge, I believe the Court

proceed forward with the deposition of Ms. Churcher.  If there
are particularized objections to the questions because counsel
believe that those invade some privilege, they should be raised
at that time, and we go forward on a question-by-question basis
because most of this information will not be subject to any
privilege.
Thank you.
MR. FEDER:  May I be heard briefly?
THE COURT:  Mm-hmm.
MR. FEDER:  Thank you.  Just very briefly.
First of all, the voicemail that my colleague read is
totally consistent with news gathering.  She mentions that it's
on deep background, and in trying to cultivate the source she
describes herself as almost a friend.  Again, I don't think
that type of less formal communication is indicative of a
transformation from a journalist into something else.
But more problematically, we haven't heard that
voicemail.  We haven't seen any of the emails they are talking
about because they are redacted; the exhibits containing them
were filed under seal.  So we don't know exactly which pieces
of information they are trying to seek and which pieces of
information they are claiming are not subject to the privilege.
I think we can all agree that Ms. Churcher is in fact
a journalist, that she did in fact publish stories from

actually going back to 2007 that Virginia wasn't named, but
from 2007 and certainly 2011 onward, publishing stories about
these matters.  So, clearly the Shield Law is floating around
here at a minimum somewhere.
And they have to make a clear and specific showing for
each piece of information that they claim either the Shield Law
doesn't apply because she wasn't acting in her capacity as a
journalist or that the Shield Law is overcome because it's
critical or necessary and they've exhausted alternative
sources.  And the Shield Law itself provides that the Court
shall order disclosure only of such portions of the news sought
as to which the above-described showing has been made and shall
support such order with clear and specific findings made after
a hearing.
So we can't go forward and just deny the motion to
quash entirely and just go to a deposition and start answering
questions when the Shield Law at a minimum applies to, we would
submit, all of it but at a minimum a substantial portion of the
information.  We need to see what they're specifically talking
about here.

MR. POE:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Gregory Poe on
behalf of non-party Jeffrey Epstein.  With me, your Honor, is
my colleague Rachel Li Wai Suen.
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. POE:  Yes, your Honor.  Thank you.
We've attempted to be thorough in our briefing so I
won't belabor the issues.  I think the key issue is whether in
fact an undue burden would exist if Mr. Epstein were subjected
at this point to a deposition.  The plaintiff concedes, as the
law requires, that evidence must be relevant and admissible.
And here the examples the plaintiff's counsel has offered with
respect to a 2010 deposition in a different proceeding where
Mr. Epstein apparently answered some questions doesn't add
anything that the public record already doesn't reveal.  So, in
our view, that would not justify a deposition, which leaves
really the Fifth Amendment implications that have been
represented will be made, and that raises the LiButti issue.
And under LiButti, your Honor, really the permeating
factor is control.  And the typical case -- really, most of the
cases, to the extent courts have addressed this issue, are
employee invocations where the corporation for which the
employee works is the party, and there the invocation can be
imputed because it is controlled.  There is no control here,
and the factors that exist don't justify the deposition under
the LiButti analysis.  And I would point the Court, as I'm sure
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

the Court has reviewed, to docket 228 -- that's the defendant's
pleading -- at pages 16 to 18, which lays out both in redacted
form, which I have not reviewed, and unredacted form, various
bases for why LiButti has not been met here by the plaintiff.
But the alternative argument the plaintiff makes,
which is this is not ripe for decision, while we certainly
concede that it would not be something that is the usual
practice in a typical case, this is not a typical case, we
would respectfully submit.  And we would ask the Court consider
as an alternative holding in abeyance any deposition of
Mr. Epstein until the record that the plaintiff refers to has
been developed.  That would not result in prejudice to either
party, and it would not subject Mr. Epstein to a burden of a
deposition or the cost or inconvenience, which, of course, need
to be considered with respect to a third party under Rule 45,
when, in fact, if we are correct that no litigation purpose
would be served, it would by definition, in our view, be an
unnecessary cost and inconvenience and, therefore, an undue
burden.
Finally, your Honor, if the Court -- and, ultimately,
if Mr. Epstein is not granted relief with respect to this
motion, we would ask in the alternative that the Court prohibit
videography for the reasons that we have outlined in our
briefs.  The plaintiff's opposition states that Mr. Epstein is
asking for preferential treatment.  We make legal arguments,

your Honor.  Whether the Court agrees or disagrees with our
legal arguments, Mr. Epstein is not asking to be treated better
or worse than anybody else under the law.
So with that, your Honor, we -- if the Court has any
questions, I am prepared to answer them.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
MR. POE:  Thank you.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, may I be heard on the
motion to quash, please?
So with respect to Mr. Epstein, obviously the Court
has heard from us previously.  He is at the center of this
conspiracy, we allege, with Ms. Maxwell, the defendant.  It
would be highly prejudicial to the plaintiff here to not be
able to take his deposition.
To accommodate his concerns, even though he was
sighted just even days ago by his New York mansion, we have
agreed to fly down to the U.S. Virgin Islands to handle that
deposition.
With respect to his concerns over videography, he said
he was concerned that that would be leaked to the media, we
have a confidentiality order in place in this case and we will
gladly mark that as confidential so that is not a concern.
It's very important that we are entitled to ask him
those questions.  I know his counsel has stated that he intends
to take the Fifth.  As the Court well knows, there are many
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

questions for which you have to have a basis to take the Fifth,
so it can't be just a carte blanche taking of the Fifth.  So
there will be questions that he can answer during that
deposition.
In addition, we're entitled to see his demeanor during
that, to have the jury see his demeanor on video if this goes
to trial.  So it's critical that we are entitled to take that
deposition of Mr. Epstein, who is the co-conspirator here.
With respect to the LiButti case, your Honor, that
case addresses, as the Court may well know -- it is a Second
Circuit case -- it addresses the standard by which a court can
allow a nonparty's invocation of the Fifth Amendment to have an
adverse inference against a party in a litigation.  We contend
that we meet all of the factors of LiButti, but at this point
that would not be the time for the Court to make that decision.
Obviously, the deposition needs to take place.  We need to have
a record of what he is taking the Fifth on, and then we can
make those arguments presumably in a motion in limine for why
we believe that that adverse inference should apply.
So, your Honor, I submit to you that this deposition
is critical to us.  We've done our part in trying to
accommodate this witness, and we believe that the deposition
should move forward and the motion to quash should be denied.
Thank you.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, may I make some comments on

this motion as well?
THE COURT:  Yes.
MR. PAGLIUCA:  Thank you.
Your Honor, first, I think what I'd like to say to the
Court is that, indeed, I wish Mr. Epstein's deposition could go
forward.  I have every reason to expect that should Mr. Epstein
testify and testify truthfully, his testimony would be of
enormous support and corroboration of Ms. Maxwell's version of
events in this case.
It's important to note, your Honor, that Ms. Maxwell
was not the subject of this investigation that led to
Mr. Epstein's being charged and pleading guilty.  We just
finished the deposition of Detective Recarey, who was the lead
deposition -- the lead detective in the case, and he agreed
that throughout this investigation he never spoke to
Ms. Maxwell.  No one identified Ms. Maxwell as being involved
in any of the alleged crimes.  He did not seek any indictment
or prosecution against Ms. Maxwell.  And his only investigation
relative to Ms. Maxwell was to simply look her up on the
Internet.
There is no surveillance footage of Ms. Maxwell.  She
is not named in any of the affidavits that are filed with the
court.  So, in short, Ms. Maxwell was not implicated in any of
the conduct that Mr. Epstein was alleged to have committed.
It's important background, your Honor, for the next
                     SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
                               (212) 805-0300
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 14-7     Filed 07/07/16     Page 32 of 37

      G6ndgium
point here, because the plaintiff has not raised what I think
is a very important issue here with regard to the Fifth
Amendment, and that is does Mr. Epstein indeed have the ability
to assert a Fifth Amendment privilege now in the context of
this litigation.  And there are a number of factors that are
considered, the first being, and I think it is important to
recognize, Mr. Epstein was granted immunity by the United
States Attorney in the District of Florida for the conduct that
I believe he is going to be questioned about.  And I don't
believe that it is appropriate for a witness to assert a Fifth
Amendment privilege after they have been granted immunity by
the prosecuting authority under 18 United States Code 6001.
So, I don't think that there has been any exploration of
whether Mr. Epstein can indeed invoke his Fifth Amendment
privilege.
He also pled guilty to state charges which likely
would act as a jeopardy bar and prohibit Mr. Epstein from
asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege in the state system to
the extent that the immunity from the federal government
doesn't cover him, which I submit that it would.
There is also the statute of limitations, your Honor,
which seems to me has long expired with regard to any of the
allegations in this case.
Now, why do I raise that, Judge?  They don't really
want Mr. Epstein to testify.  That's the point here.  They want

      G6ndgium
to be able to have him assert his Fifth Amendment privilege so
that they can then try to back-door this against Ms. Maxwell.
And, in effect, they are creating their own little dichotomy
here, which is he's taking the Fifth, we want him to take the
Fifth, because then we get to just do a list of questions about
everything that we want to have an adverse inference about as
it relates to Ms. Maxwell, not as to Mr. Epstein.  That is the
problem, because they haven't done what they should do to get
to that point in the first place.  I think that is a real issue
and a real problem for this motion before the Court now.
This is simply an attempt to manufacture -- and I use
that word deliberately, your Honor -- manufacture self-serving
evidence that they can then try to present to a jury through
this derivative adverse inference.
Final comment:  I have never had a court allow a
witness to come into court and assert a Fifth Amendment
privilege, whether that be in a criminal case or a civil case.
I've never had a court allow a jury to be shown someone's
deposition while they are asserting a Fifth Amendment
privilege.  I don't understand the point of that.  And it seems
to me there is no point in allowing a videotaped deposition of
somebody who is going to sit there and say to every question
"On the advice of my counsel, I assert my Fifth Amendment
privilege."  There is nothing to be served by the added expense
of that process.

So, your Honor, this is Mr. Epstein's fight, it is not
Ms. Maxwell's fight, but it becomes Ms. Maxwell's fight to the
extent that we're trying to create evidence down the road that
is used against Ms. Maxwell in this proceeding.
Thank you.
THE COURT:  Thank you.
Yes.  Anything further?
MR. POE:  Nothing further, your Honor.  Thank you.
MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, may I just briefly
address -- defendant's counsel didn't file a brief on this so I
just want to take a few moments to address the points he has
just raised very briefly.
First, we would love to have Mr. Epstein give complete
testimony in this case.  I look forward to that.  I hope that
he will do that for us, and that is why we want to take his
deposition.  Ms. Maxwell had given an indication she was going
to take the Fifth.  When we deposed her, she didn't.  So things
may change.  We need his deposition.
Second, with respect to the representations regarding
the deposition of Detective Recarey which occurred earlier this
week, Detective Recarey did say that he sought to interview
Ms. Maxwell in the course of that and did acknowledge that
Ms. Maxwell is in the police reports.  I just want to make sure
that that is corrected on the record.
Thank you, your Honor.

DECLARATION OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT TIMOTHY R. SLATER 
TIMOTHY R. SLATER declares as follows: 
I. 
I am a Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), currently assigned as a 
Section Chief at FBI Headquarters, Washington, D.C. I was appointed a Special Agent in May 
1999. Upon graduation from the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, in September I 999, I was 
assigned to the Detroit Field Office. I was subsequently transferred to the FBI Miami Field 
Office in May 2006. 
2. In 2006, I was assigned to work on an investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, who was 
accused of sexually abusing many young girls under the age of 18. In the course of our 
investigation, the FBI identified many potential victims of sexual abuse by Epstein. We obtained 
names by speaking to other victims, who frequently knew of friends who had also been paid 
money by Epstein to provide sexual services to him. 
3. One of the victims identified was 
In January - February 2007, I 
used various computer indices to try and locate Ms.- By using these indices and other 
means, I found two international phone numbers which I believed were being used by Ms.

4. Sometime during January - February 2007, I called the one of the numbers, in an 
attempt to speak to Ms.-
Also in my office was FBI Special Agent Nesbitt E. 
Kuyrkendall, the lead agent for the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. I was not using a 
speakerphone when I spoke with Ms.- I asked SIA Kuyrkendall to be present because 
she, as the lead agent, was thoroughly versed in the details of the entire investigation, and I might 
need her assistance to respond to a question posed by Ms.-
that I was unable to answer. 
5. When I dialed the number, a young woman answered the phone. I told her my name, 
identified myself as a Special Agent with the FBI, and asked if she was 
She 
said yes. I used a technique which I employ when speaking to people on the phone, who might 
question whether Jam truly an FBI agent. I provided her with the phone number of the FBI 
Field Office in Miami, Florida, and told ·her she could hang up and verify the number. She 
could then call me back at the number, and her call would be routed to me. Ms. -
said that 
would not be necessary. 
6. I told Ms. -
about our investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, and the allegations that 
Epstein had sexually abused many underage young girls. I told her we believed she might be a 
victim of sexual abuse by Epstein. 
7. Ms.-
answered basic questions, telling me that she did know Jeffrey Epstein. 
She quickly became uncomfortable, telling me she moved away to distance herself from this 
situation, and expressing her desire to "let this be in my past." She asked that l not bother her 
with this again. 
8. I thanked Ms. -
and told her J appreciated her time. 1 provided my name and 
encouraged her to call the FBI Miami Field Office, if she had any questions or needed assistance.

The entire phone conversation only last several minutes. 
9. I did not hear from Ms.-again. In mid-March 2007, I reported for my new 
assignment at FBI Headqua1ters in Washington, D.C. 
I 0. l declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

MOTION TO SEAL BRADLEY J. EDWARDS’ 
MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE,  
FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER  
Subpoena respondent Bradley J. Edwards, a non-party and attorney for the plaintiff in the 
Giuffre v. Maxwell action, hereby files this motion for leave to file materials under seal for his 
reply in support of his motion to quash.   
In his reply to his motion for to quash subpoena, Edwards attached eight exhibits.  Five of 
these exhibits contain a document that is under seal in another court, specifically: 
1. 
Exhibit 1 – Victims Response to Dershowitz Motion to Intervene, under seal in the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida; 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 15     Filed 07/07/16     Page 1 of 3

2. 
Exhibit 3 – Ms. Giuffre’s Motion for Leave to Exceed the Presumptive Ten 
Deposition Limit, the salient portions of which (i.e., the portions relied upon in this case) are under 
seal in the underlying case in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York; 
3. 
Exhibit 4 – Excerpts from the Confidential Deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell, which 
is under seal in the underlying case in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York; 
4. 
Exhibit 5 - Excerpts from the Confidential Deposition of Rinaldo Rizzo, which is 
under seal in the underlying case in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York; and 
5. 
Exhibit 6 – The Opinion of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
York (Sweet, J.) in Giuffre v. Maxwell, June 20, 2016, which is under seal in the underlying case 
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
In addition, portions of the reply memorandum itself quote from or refer to the sealed 
materials.  Accordingly, a redacted version of the reply memorandum has been prepared for 
inclusion in the public court file, which avoid disclosing the sealed information. 
Because the indicated materials are under seal by order of other federal courts, Edwards 
seeks leave to file these materials under seal here.  Edwards has followed the procedures of the 
Southern District of Florida for the handling of sealed materials.   
Opposing counsel has simply filed similar materials in this case under seal without seeking 
leave of court.  Accordingly, Edwards believes that opposing counsel would have no objection to 
his filing of similar materials under seal.  Because Edwards believes that a motion is required for 
a sealed filing, he proceeds by way of motion to this Court. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 15     Filed 07/07/16     Page 2 of 3

CONCLUSION 
For the forgoing reasons, Edwards respectfully requests that this Court allow him to submit 
materials under seal in his reply memorandum supporting his motion to quash.

AO 88B (Rev. 02/14) Subpoena to Produce Documents, Infonnation, or Objects or to Permit Inspection of Premises in a Civil Action(Page 3) 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 (c), (d), (e), and (g) (Effective 12/1/13) 
(c) Place of Compliance. 
(1) For a Trial, Hearing, or Deposition. A subpoena may command a 
person to attend a trial, hearing, or deposition only as follows: 
(A) within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or 
regularly transacts business in person; or 
(B) within the state where the person resides, is employed, or regularly 
transacts business in person, if the person 
(i) is a party or a party's officer; or 
(ii) is commanded to attend a trial and would not incur substantial 
expense. 
(2) For Other Discovery. A subpoena may command: 
(A) production of documents, electronically stored information, or 
tangible things at a place within 100 miles of where the person resides, is 
employed, or regularly transacts business in person; and 
(B) inspection of premises at the premises to be inspected. 
(d) Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena; Enforcement. 
(1) Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or attorney 
responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps 
to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the 
subpoena. The court for the district where compliance is required must 
enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction-which may include 
lost earnings and reasonable attorney's fees---on a party or attorney who 
fails to comply. 
(2) Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection. 
(A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce 
documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to 
permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of 
production or inspection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition, 
hearing, or trial. 
(B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or tangible 
things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated 
in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing, or 
sampling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the premises---or to 
producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested. 
The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for 
compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. Ifan objection is made, 
the following rules apply: 
(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party 
may move the court for the district where compliance is required for an 
order compelling production or inspection. 
(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the 
order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer from 
significant expense resulting from compliance. 
(3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena. 
(A) When Required. On timely motion, the court for the district where 
compliance is required must quash or modify a subpoena that: 
(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; 
(ii) requires a person to comply beyond the geographical limits 
specified in Rule 45(c); 
(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, ifno 
exception or waiver applies; or 
(iv) subjects a person to undue burden. 
(B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by a 
subpoena, the court for the district where compliance is required may, on 
motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires: 
(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, 
development, or commercial information; or 
(ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or information that does 
not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert's 
study that was not requested by a party. 
(C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circumstances 
described in Rule 45(d)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or 
modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under specified 
conditions if the serving party: 
(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be 
otherwise met without undue hardship; and 
(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated. 
(e) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena. 
(1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. These 
procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored 
information: 
(A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents 
must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary course of business or 
must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the demand. 
(B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not Specified. 
If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing electronically stored 
information, the person responding must produce it in a form or forms in 
which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms. 
(C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One Form. The 
person responding need not produce the same electronically stored 
information in more than one form. 
(D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information. The person 
responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored information 
from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because 
of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective 
order, the person responding must show that the information is not 
reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is 
made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the 
requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 
26(b )(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery. 
(2) Claiming Privilege or Protection. 
(A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed information 
under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation 
material must: 
(i) expressly make the claim; and 
(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or 
tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself 
privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim. 
(B) Information Produced. If information produced in response to a 
subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as 
trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party 
that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being 
notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified 
information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information 
until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the 
information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly 
present the information under seal to the court for the district where 
compliance is required for a determination of the claim. The person who 
produced the information must preserve the information until the claim is 
resolved. 
(g) Contempt. 
The court for the district where compliance is required-and also, after a 
motion is transferred, the issuing court- may hold in contempt a person 
who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the 
subpoena or an order related to it. 
For access to subpoena materials, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a) Committee Note (2013).

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
In re: SUBPOENA TO BRADLEY J. 
EDWARDS  
Underlying case: 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, Plaintiff 
v. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, Defendant 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y.) 
NOTICE OF STATUS OF SUBPOENA 
DUCES TECUM AND RELATED 
RULINGS IN UNDERLYING ACTION 
Case Number 0:16-mc-61262-JG 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files this notice of her position respecting 
the Subpoena Duces Tecum to Bradly Edwards and a Related Ruling in the underlying Action, 
and the Status of outstanding Requests for Production and the Motion to Quash, stating as 
follows: 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 24     Filed 12/16/16     Page 1 of 5

1. The Court should be advised that in addition to the Subpoena Duces Tecum served on 
Bradly Edwards (“Mr. Edwards”) which is the subject of the pending Motion to Quash, 
Ms. Maxwell served a similar, although not identical, Subpoena Duces Tecum on one of 
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre other attorneys, Paul Cassell (the “Cassell Subpoena”), Ex. A. 
2. Mr. Cassell, like Mr. Edwards, moved to quash.  The District Court for the District of 
Utah transferred the Motion to Quash to the Southern District of New York where the 
underlying action is pending.   
3. The Court presiding over the underlying action in the Southern District of New York 
issued a ruling on the Cassell Motion to Quash on August 30, 2016, attached hereto as 
Ex. B. 
4. Certain of the requests for production in the Cassell Subpoena are identical to the Request 
for Production to Mr. Edwards, which is subject to the Motion to Quash in the matter.  It 
is Ms. Maxwell’s position that the rulings made by the Court in the Southern District of 
New York are res judicata on the Edwards Subpoena with respect to the identical 
requests in the Cassell Subpoena, and binding Mr. Edwards and Ms. Maxwell.  For the 
Court’s convenience, the following is a table of the questions that are identical as 
between the Edwards Subpoena and the Cassell Subpoena, and the Court’s ruling on each 
in the Southern District of New York.

5. Based on the forgoing, Ms. Maxwell believes that the Court Should issue an Order 
consistent with the binding determinations of the Court in which the underlying case is 
pending on identical issues. 
a. Denying the Motion to Quash Request Numbers 1, 2, 10 and 11 and require 
Production of documents within 14 days of the Order1; 
b. Granting Motion to Quash 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 15; and 
c. Requiring Production of the Non-Contested Requests for production, Request 
Numbers 14, 16, 17 and 18 within 14 days of the Order. 
6. The case remains active and is scheduled for trial in March 2017.  Ms. Maxwell requests 
that the Court deny the Motion to Quash on the remaining outstanding Requests for 
Production, Requests 3, 4, 5, 12, 19 and 20 for the reasons set forth in the Response to the 
Motion to Quash.  
Ms. Maxwell does not seek a second production of documents that have already been produced in this 
matter, including those already produced third parties Mr. Cassell or Victims Refuse Silence.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
FORT LAUDERDALE DIVISION 
CASE NO. 16-61262-MC-GOODMAN 
UNDERLYING CASE NO. 15-CV-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y) 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS,  
Plaintiff, 
v. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,  
Defendant. 
                                          __/ 
ORDER TRANSFERRING MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA 
 OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER 
Bradley J. Edwards (“Edwards”) filed in the Southern District of Florida a motion 
to quash a subpoena issued to him by Ghislaine Maxwell (“Maxwell”). [ECF No. 1].1 
The subpoena was issued in the Southern District of New York in the underlying case, 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 1:15-cv-07433-RWS. Maxwell opposed the motion to quash. [ECF 
No. 8] and Edwards replied to Maxwell’s opposition. [ECF No. 13]. United States 
District Judge Jose E. Martinez referred Edwards’ motion to me. [ECF No. 11]. Maxwell 
filed a status update in this Court regarding the contested Edwards Subpoena and the 
related rulings in the underlying action (“notice”). [ECF No. 24].  
The subject subpoena of Edwards’ motion to quash is referred to as the 
“Edwards Subpoena.”[ECF No. 1-3]. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 29     Filed 12/22/16     Page 1 of 6

Having read the parties’ submissions and reviewed the docket in the underlying 
case in New York and a related motion filed in the District Court of Utah, the Court 
finds, sua sponte, that exceptional circumstances exist under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 45(f) that warrant transfer of Edwards’ motion to the court with jurisdiction 
over the underlying case.2 Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f). 
Rule 45(f) allows the court where compliance with a subpoena is required to 
transfer a subpoena-related motion to the issuing court in two situations: 1) when the 
subject of the subpoena consents, or 2) “if the court finds exceptional circumstances.” 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f). The Committee note to Rule 45(f) explains that in “some 
circumstances . . . transfer may be warranted in order to avoid disrupting the issuing 
court’s management of the underlying litigation, as when that court has already ruled 
on issues presented by the motion or the same issues are likely to arise in discovery in 
many districts.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f) advisory committee’s note to 2013 amendment.  
United States District Judge Robert W. Sweet of the Southern District of New 
York has already ruled on similar issues that Edwards’ motion presents.  Maxwell 
issued a subpoena to Paul Cassell (“Cassell”) in the underlying case (“Cassell 
Subpoena”). The Cassell Subpoena is extremely similar to the Edwards Subpoena, 
The issue of whether to transfer a motion to quash a subpoena to the court 
having jurisdiction over the underlying case is a non-dispositive matter. Elliott v. 
Mission Trust Servs., LLC, No. SA-14-MC-942-XR, 2014 WL 6772474, at *2 (W.D. Tex. 
Dec. 1, 2014) (unpublished); see also San Juan Cable LLC v. DISH Network LLC, No. 14-mc-
00261-RM-MJW, 2015 WL 500631, at *2 (D. Colo. Jan. 23, 2015) (unpublished).  
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 29     Filed 12/22/16     Page 2 of 6

which is also issued by Maxwell. Like Edwards, Cassell is a non-party attorney for 
plaintiff Virginia Giuffre in the underlying action.  
Cassell moved to quash the Cassell Subpoena in the District Court for the District 
of Utah. Maxwell attached to the notice the Cassell Subpoena and the Southern District 
of New York’s Order on Maxwell’s motion to quash the Cassell Subpoena. [ECF Nos. 
24-1; 24-2].3  
The reason District Judge Sweet ruled on Cassell’s motion to quash the Cassell 
Subpoena is because United States Magistrate Judge Evelyn J. Furse, sua sponte, found 
that exceptional circumstances existed under Rule 45(f) to transfer Cassell’s motion back 
to New York. In re Cassell, 16-mc-00602-DB-EJF, 2016 WL 3645166, at *3 (D. Utah June 
30, 2016).  Thus, another United States Magistrate Judge has already found that there 
are exceptional circumstances present that warrant transfer of the same motion 
regarding a similar subpoena in the same case. 
In support of her decision to transfer the case, Magistrate Judge Furse considered 
the fact that Virginia Giuffre filed the underlying case in September 2015. Id. at *1. She 
considered the fact that the parties have heavily litigated the underlying case as 
evidenced by the large amount of docket entries (253 entries at that time) and 
complexity of issues. Id. She also was concerned with the danger of impeding on 
District Judge Sweet’s discovery cutoff deadline. Id. at *3. 
District Judge Sweet’s Order is filed under seal in this case. [ECF No. 25]. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 29     Filed 12/22/16     Page 3 of 6

At this time, the underlying case now has 517 docket entries. As Maxwell has 
indicated in the notice, the case remains active and is scheduled for trial in March of 
2017. District Judge Sweet, because of his familiarity with the underlying case, will be 
able to rule on Edwards’ motion more quickly than this Court. It is also indisputable 
that transfer would avoid any interference with District Judge Sweet’s pretrial and trial 
schedule. 
Additionally, in Maxwell’s notice filed in this Court, Maxwell argues that 
“requests for production in the Cassell Subpoena are identical to the Request for 
Production to Mr. Edwards” and that District Judge Sweet’s rulings on the Cassell 
Subpoena are “res judicata on the Edwards Subpoena with respect to the identical 
requests in the Cassell Subpoena.” [ECF No. 24, p. 2]. After reviewing both the Edwards 
Subpoena and the Cassell Subpoena, the Undersigned finds that: 
1) Request 1 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 1 of the Edwards 
Subpoena; 
2) Request 2 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 2 of the Edwards 
Subpoena; 
3) Request 3 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 6 of the Edwards 
Subpoena; 
4) Request 4 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 7 of the Edwards 
Subpoena; 
5) Request 5 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 8 of the Edwards 
Subpoena; 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 29     Filed 12/22/16     Page 4 of 6

6) Request 6 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 9 of the Edwards 
Subpoena; 
7) Request 8 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 11 of the 
Edwards Subpoena; 
8) Request 9 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 10 of the 
Edwards Subpoena; 
9) Request 10 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 14 of the 
Edwards Subpoena; 
10)  Request 11 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 15 of the 
Edwards Subpoena; 
11) Request 12 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 16 of the 
Edwards Subpoena; 
12)  Request 13 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 17 of the 
Edwards Subpoena; and 
13) Request 14 of the Cassell Subpoena is identical to Request 18 of the 
Edwards Subpoena.  
[ECF Nos. 1-3; 24-1]. 
Based on the similarities of the two subpoenas, I find that there are exceptional 
circumstances present under Rule 45(f). Specifically, District Judge Sweet has already 
ruled on the Cassell Subpoena and there is a great risk of inconsistent rulings if my 
ruling on Edwards’ motion differs from District Judge Sweet’s ruling on the 
aforementioned requests. If such a result is foreseen, then the burden on Edwards to 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 29     Filed 12/22/16     Page 5 of 6

reconcile inconsistent orders in two different jurisdictions is surely outweighed by 
District Judge Sweet streamlining the discovery process with consistent decisions in one 
jurisdiction.  
Accordingly, I find that transfer fosters the interests of fairness, consistency, 
judicial economy, and speed of resolution. Uniformity of discovery rulings in a case of 
this complexity is critical to achieving fairness to the parties and non-parties. For the 
reasons stated above, I find that any ruling I might issue has great potential for 
disrupting the issuing court’s management of the underlying litigation, both 
procedurally and substantively. Therefore, I find that Edwards’ motion presents 
exceptional circumstances that warrant its transfer. As such, the Undersigned directs 
the Clerk of Court to transfer Edwards’ motion to the Southern District of New York, 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 1:15-cv-07433-RWS.   
DONE and ORDERED in Chambers, in Miami, Florida, on December 22, 2016.

The motion for leave to file an "over length reply" 12 represents that "plaintiff will supplement this
motion once such position [i.e., opposing counsel's position] has been obtained." No supplement has
been filed since the motion was filed. Therefore, Plaintiff shall by December 16, 2016 file a notice
advising the Undersigned of Defendant's position. If Defendant opposes the request for additional
pages for Plaintiff's reply, then Defendant shall by December 19, 2016 file a memorandum not to
exceed three pages (excluding signature block and certificate of service), explaining the reasons.
In addition, given the time which has passed since the motion to quash was initially filed, Plaintiff's
notice shall also explain the status of the underlying case in the Southern District of New York and
whether the subpoena issue is still active and in need of a ruling by the Undersigned. Assuming that
the issue is still an issue, then the Undersigned will rule on the motion for additional pages for the
reply.

Plaintiff, 
v. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL 
Defendant. 
 DECLARATION OF BRADLEY J. 
EDWARDS SUPPORT OF 
SUPPLEMENTAL REPLYH IN SUPPORT 
OF MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA OR, 
IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR A 
PROTECTIVE ORDER 
No.  1:17-mc-00025-RWS 
I, Bradley J. Edwards, declare as follows: 
1.  I am a board certified civil trial attorney at law duly licensed in the State of Florida and 
admitted to practice in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. I respectfully 
submit this declaration in support of the Supplemental Reply in Support of the Motion to Quash 
Subpoena or, in the Alternative, for a Protective Order. 
2.  I am a counsel of record for plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre in the case Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
No. 15-cv-07433-RWS (S.D.N.Y.), admitted pro hac vice. Other counsel of record include: Sigrid 
S. McCawley and Meredith Schulz of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, LLP (Ft. Lauderdale, Florida), 
and Paul G. Cassell (who maintains his law office at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, 
Utah).  I have great familiarity with the facts surrounding Ms. Giuffre’s case, have taken numerous 
of the depositions in this case, and I will be heavily involved in the trial of the case in May, 
handling many of the most important witnesses.  Preparing for that trial is consuming a great deal 
of my time currently and will continue to do so through trial. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33-1     Filed 03/13/17     Page 1 of 3

3.  I have received a subpoena to produce numerous documents in the Giuffre v. Maxwell 
case. I am not a party to that case, but the attorney for the plaintiff, Ms. Giuffre.  
4.  I have reviewed the subpoena served on me requesting, among other things, the 
production in paragraphs 19 and 20 of communications concerning “any witness or prospective 
witness in Giuffre v. Maxwell.”  While that term seems is presumably confined to Defendant’s 
Rule 26 disclosures, I am unclear who Defendant contemplates as a “prospective witness” and no 
further clarification is provided in the subpoena. 
5.  An added complication to attempting to fully analyze what a complete assembly of such 
communications would look like is that there is simply no way to search in exhaustive 
fashion.  While certain names of currently known “prospective witnesses” could be searched, 
without specific identities being provided to me there is no way to remember each person I may 
or may not have corresponded with by email.  For instance, typing in the search bar “prospective 
witness” would not produce any of the desired correspondence.   
6.  Even if I confined my search to witnesses identified by the parties in the pre-trial order, 
it appears that subpoena would require me to produce a privilege log for thousands of emails.  For 
example, one of the “witnesses” identified by the Defendant in this case is my co-counsel on 
various cases, Professor Paul G. Cassell at the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of 
Utah.  We have worked on several cases together for more than eight years, during the course of 
which we have exchanged several thousand emails covered by the attorney-client privilege and 
work-product protection.   
7.  With regard to witnesses who have been identified by the opposing parties in the pre-
trial order, in preparation for trying the case and as part of our legal team’s trial strategy, I have 
communicated with various individuals who had, or were believed to have, relevant 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33-1     Filed 03/13/17     Page 2 of 3

information.   All such communications were for no purpose other than to advance the preparation 
and furtherance of existing and/or contemplated litigation.   
8.  The purpose of some of my communications cannot be stated without invading the 
attorney-client privilege; however, the communications with any witness was because of the 
prospect of litigation.   
9.  Any identification of any such communications, if possible, would invade the attorney 
work-product privilege, including the production of a log containing identities of the people with 
whom I communicated, and the timing of those communications.  Providing any of this type of 
information, in this case, regarding which prospective witness we spoke with and the timing of 
those communications, would necessarily involve disclosure of the issues and witnesses who Ms. 
Giuffre’s trial team has been focusing on and the timing of that focus.   
10.  As a final consideration, I have communicated with individuals, all in anticipation of 
litigation, some who have expressed their fear of becoming known, and all in furtherance of 
litigation and our case strategy. 
DATED this 13th day of March, 2017.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL 
Defendant. 
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS’S REPLY IN 
SUPPORT OF MOTION TO QUASH 
SUBPOENA OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, 
FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER 
No.  1:17-mc-00025-RWS 
Subpoena respondent Bradley J. Edwards, a non-party and attorney for the Plaintiff in the 
Giuffre v. Maxwell action, hereby files this supplemental reply in support of his motion to 
quash.1  
BACKGROUND 
As the Court recalls, Defendant served subpoenas for documents on two of Ms. Giuffre’s 
lawyers: Paul G. Cassell, Esq., and Bradley J. Edwards, Esq.  The subpoenas were overlapping in 
most respects and largely substantively indistinguishable.  This Court has previously ruled on a 
motion to quash the Cassell subpoena, quashing most of the demands made there.  With regard to 
the overlapping Edwards subpoena, defense counsel has agreed that “the majority of this has 
been disposed of by [the Court’s] earlier opinion” on the Cassell subpoena.  Hearing Tr. Mar. 9, 
2017, at 57:16-17.   
The motion to quash RFPs #19 and #20 (and all other RFPs) should be denied for reasons explained 
earlier in Mr. Edwards’ Motion to Quash and Reply in Support of His Motion to Quash, which documents 
are incorporated by reference into this reply as if set forth verbatim.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 1 of 11

Two of the demands made in the Edwards subpoena that were not overlapping were 
Edwards Request for Production (“RFP”) #19 and #20.  These requests demanded that Mr. 
Edwards produce: 
19.  Any letter or communication from you to any witness or prospective witness 
in Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-07433-RWS. 
20.  Any letter or communication to you from any witness or prospective witness 
in Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv—07433-RWS. 
On June 13, 2016, Mr. Edwards filed a motion to quash the subpoena against him in his 
home judicial district, the Southern District of Florida.  See Bradley J. Edwards’ Motion to 
Quash Subpoena or, in the Alternative, for a Protective Order, Misc. No. 01:16-mc-61262-JG 
(June 13, 2016).  With regard to RFPs #19 and #20, Mr. Edwards explained that both sides in the 
case had identified more than 100 persons who could potentially be regarded as “prospective 
witnesses” in the trial, including the client, Ms. Giuffre, and his co-counsel, Mr. Cassell.  Id. at 
19.  Mr. Edwards also argued that this request appeared to be exclusively designed to burden him 
as an attorney for the opposing side in the case.  Id.  Mr. Edwards further argued that that there 
was no reason to require Mr. Edwards to produce any materials, since the witnesses could, if 
necessary, be questioned about any such communications.  Id.  Mr. Edwards accordingly asked 
for RFPs #19 and #20 to simply be quashed at the outset.  If RFPs #19 and #20 were not 
quashed, Mr. Edwards asked for leave to raise more specific objections, including attorney-client 
privilege and work-product protections associated with these requests.  Id. at 19-20.   
In response to these arguments, Defendant gave a three-sentence response: 
Mr. Edwards, as part of his litigation practice, has sent “witness solicitation 
letters” to prospective witnesses in this matter. These letters contain a skewed 
version of the allegations in this case and are potential impeachment evidence in 
this case. Mr. Edwards has immediate access to this information and the 
production of these letters would not be burdensome. 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 2 of 11

Resp. of Ghislaine Maxwell to Bradley J. Edwards’ Motion to Quash Subpoena at 16.  Mr. 
Edwards thereafter filed a reply in support of his motion to quash, but did not add any additional 
briefing on RFPs #19 and #20.   
Thereafter, the Motion to Quash was transferred to this Court (Sweet, J.).  On March 9, 
2017, this Court held argument on the Motion to Quash.  During the argument, the Court granted 
leave for Mr. Edwards to file an additional reply on the issue of RFPs #19 and #20.  Hearing Tr. 
Mar. 9, 2017, at 72:9-75:5.   
Mr. Edwards now files this additional reply on RFPs #19 and #20. 
DISCUSSION 
In regards to Subpoena Requests Number 19 and Number 20, Mr. Edwards will clearly 
be unduly burdened, as a non-party, if he were required to conduct extensive searches for 
documents for no real purpose as the documents sought are protected from discovery.  In fact, 
Maxwell continues to fail to substantively or effectively address the arguments that Edwards 
presents regarding why the subpoena creates an undue burden on him.  The Court should 
accordingly grant Edwards’s motion to quash all outstanding items. 
As should be clear from the facts in this case, as set out in some detail in Ms. Giuffre’s 
(thus far uncontested) Statement of Undisputed Facts in response to the summary judgment 
motion, Defendant Maxwell has no answer to facts demonstrating her involvement in Jeffrey 
Epstein’s sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre and other minor girls.  For example, Defendant has yet to 
explain what she was doing on 23 flights on Epstein’s private jet with a teenaged Ms. Giuffre.  
Nor has Defendant explained the message pads showing not only Defendant’s presence in 
Epstein’s mansion but numerous underage girls leaving phone messages in connection with 
“massages” to be provided at the home.  Unable to contest the case on its merits, Defendant has 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 3 of 11

instead resorted to a blizzard of discovery and other motions – including subpoenas served on 
Ms. Giuffre’s legal counsel Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell.   The Court largely quashed the 
subpoena to Cassell.  The specific issue remaining before the Court is Mr. Edwards’s Motion to 
Quash the subpoena served on him, and specifically RFPs #19 and #20.    
As recounted in the briefing above, Mr. Edwards explained that RFPs #19 and #20 were 
plainly overbroad.  They seek Mr. Edwards’s communications with “prospective witnesses” – a 
term that is undefined, largely undefinable and unsearchable.  If Defendant has complied with 
her Rule 26 obligations, then presumably the names of each of the “prospective witnesses” are 
on her list; however, we know that Defendant has not disclosed the names of the numerous 
females she recruited for Jeffrey Epstein so it is possible that the definition of “prospective 
witness” could be broader than Maxwell has already improperly defined pursuant to her Rule 26 
disclosures.  However, even if confined to Defendant’s Rule 26 disclosures, the term is still 
woefully overbroad, since the prospective witnesses in the case include, obviously, plaintiff Ms. 
Giuffre.  Mr. Edwards plainly has numerous communications with his client, which would be 
protected by attorney-client privilege.  Of course, creating a privilege log for his communications 
with his client would be unduly burdensome in this complex case, particularly given that it is 
obvious that his communications with his client would ultimately be protected.   
A further illustration of the overbreadth of this request comes from the fact that 
Defendant has designated Mr. Cassell as a witness in this case, by including him on their witness 
list.  While this effort appears to be an entirely improper effort to somehow disqualify Mr. 
Cassell from working on this case,2 for purpose of the subpoena, it would seem that, in the eyes 
Using designations of attorneys as “witnesses” is a contrived tactic being confronted by the courts.  Courts have 
recognized that “[d]isqualification motions have become increasingly popular tools of the litigation process, being 
used ... for purely strategic purposes.” Laker Airways Ltd. v. Pan Am. World Airways, 103 F.R.D. 22, 28 (D.D.C. 
1984) (denying motion to disqualify counsel). “Disqualification motions are subject to abuse for tactical purposes” 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 4 of 11

of the Defendant, Mr. Cassell is a “prospective witness” and therefore all communications 
between Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell are covered by the subpoena.  Mr. Edwards and Mr. 
Cassell have been working together as co-counsel, on a pro bono basis, for more than eight years 
in a case before Judge Marra in the Southern District of Florida under the Crime Victims’ Rights 
Act.  See Jane Does v. United States, 9:08-cv-80736-KAM (filed S.D. Fla. July 2008).  They 
have more than eight years of communications between the two of them on this highly 
complicated case as well as related cases.  Of course, these communication are protected by the 
attorney-client privilege as co-counsel as well as work-product protection.  Forcing Mr. Edwards 
to create a privilege log for these obviously-protected materials would be an undue burden 
because it would be a time-consuming yet pointless exercise – since all of the materials are 
protected.  Obviously, the product of such a request is not “reasonably calculated to lead to the 
discovery of admissible evidence.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)((1).   
The only specific justification that Defendant provided in earlier briefing for this request 
amounting to an attempt to piggyback Defendant’s trial preparation by gaining access to 
Plaintiff’s trial preparation was the claim that Mr. Edwards has somehow provided to some 
unidentified “prospective witness” a “skewed version of the allegations.”  Resp. at 16.  What 
exactly that means is not immediately clear, and Defendant offers no explanation.  But more 
important is the fact that this provides no basis for forcing Mr. Edwards to canvass his 
communications to try to identify “prospective witness” communications.  Any such 
resulting in “complex satellite litigation extraneous to the case before the court.” Universal City Studios, Inc. v. 
Reimerdes, 98 F. Supp. 2d 449, 455 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (denying motion to disqualify counsel). Indeed, “courts have in 
recent years become more and more skeptical of motions to disqualify counsel, and they now approach them with 
cautious scrutiny.” Laker Airways Ltd., 103 F.R.D. at 28. See also Ragdoll Prods. (UK) Ltd. v. Wal–Mart Stores, 
Inc., No. 99 CV 2101, 1999 WL 760209, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 1999) (holding that motions to disqualify are 
“subject to strict scrutiny”).  
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 5 of 11

communications would not be admissible in evidence, and therefore the discovery request is 
unlikely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)((1).   
In addition, any communications would clearly be protected attorney work-product.   If 
the Court were to allow proceedings on these RFPs to move forward, Mr. Edwards would be 
compelled to develop a privilege log showing (for example) work product protection for his 
communications.  In addition to this being an extraordinarily time-consuming exercise, that 
privilege log could show what prospective witnesses Mr. Edwards has contacted – and what 
witnesses he has not.  It could further show when Mr. Edwards became aware of these witnesses.  
This information would be highly useful to the Defendant in this case, as it would show what 
progress Ms. Giuffre’s attorneys have made in piercing the secrecy of the sex-trafficking 
conspiracy.  As the Court is aware from previous pleadings, Defendant has failed in her Rule 26 
disclosures to identify virtually any of the underage females who could provide testimony in this 
case – forcing Ms. Giuffre’s attorneys to track them down.  Defendant should not now benefit 
from these tactics by being able to force an attorney for the opposing side to produce a privilege 
log regarding such efforts.   
If Defendant’s efforts succeed, then it presumably every attorney in every civil case will 
propound a subpoena to the opposing side – demanding (as was done here) all communications 
with opposing witnesses.  In fact, if this is allowed we would immediately serve that subpoena 
on the Defendant’s attorneys.  But the very purpose of work product protection is that in 
“performing his various duties, however, it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree 
of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel. Proper 
preparation of a client's case demands that he assemble information, sift what he considers to be 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 6 of 11

the relevant from the irrelevant facts, prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without 
undue and needless interference.”  Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510-11 (1947).   
Applying these well-settled principles, Courts have protected attorneys from being forced 
to disclose their contact with prospective witnesses.  See, e.g., Stokes v. City of New York, 2006 
WL 2064976 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (“affidavits and other witness statements prepared or obtained in 
anticipation of litigation are generally entitled to protection” under the work product doctrine); 
EEOC v. Koch Meat Co., Inc., No. 91 C 4715, 1992 WL 332310, *3–4, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
17133, *11–12 (N.D. Ill. Nov.5, 1992) (finding that counsel’s communications with employee 
witnesses to gain information for employer to respond to an EEOC questionnaire were protected 
by the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine).  For example, Gerber v. Down East 
Community Hospital, 266 F.R.D. 29 (D. Maine 2010), considered whether an adversary could 
force opposing counsel to disclose electronic correspondence with potential witnesses.  In 
denying the request, Gerber began by noting that “witness statements prepared in anticipation of 
litigation or for trial are attorney work-product by nature.  Id. at 32-33 (citing McBride v. 
Medicalodges, Inc., Nos. 06–2535–JWL, 06–2536–JWL, 06–2538–JWL, 2008 WL 2157114, 
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42247 (D. Kan. May 22, 2008) (Rushfelt, Mag. J.) (denying defendant's 
motion to compel the plaintiffs to produce a witness statement they took of a former employee 
because it was protected by the work product doctrine and the defendant did not establish that it 
could not obtain the substantial equivalent by other means); EEOC v. Rose Casual Dining, L.P., 
No. 02–7485, 2004 WL 231287, *2–3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1983, *7–9 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 23, 
2004) (finding that witness statements generated after employee was fired and at the direction of 
counsel in preparation for litigation were protected by the work product doctrine)).  Gerber then 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 7 of 11

noted that such as request was “inherently designed to intrude upon Plaintiffs' work product.”  Id. 
at 33.   
Gerber also rejected the fallback request of an itemization of the witness names and 
dates.  The Court noted that this subject is handled by Rule 26, which requires both sides to make 
initial disclosures.  Id. at 35-36.   The Court explained that it was “not persuaded that there is a 
general rule that requires a privilege log to divulge the names of each witness from whom a party 
has sought a statement. When the work product at issue is interview correspondence for purposes 
of witness development, that communication is the work product.”  Id. at 36 (emphasis in 
original).   
 Here, by their very nature, Mr. Edwards’ communication with prospective witnesses are 
covered by work product protection.  The key issue is whether the material in question was 
“prepared because of existing or expected litigation.”  United States v. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 
1198 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Hickman, 329 U.S. at 510-11).  Applying this test, “documents are 
“deemed prepared in ‘anticipation of litigation’ if ‘in light of the nature of the document and the 
factual situation in the particular case, the document can fairly be said to have been prepared or 
obtained because of the prospect of litigation.’”  Strougo v. Bea Assocs., 199 F.R.D. 515, 520-21 
(S.D.N.Y.2001) (quoting Adlman, 134 F.3d at 1202).  According to her response brief, 
Defendant is seeking “witness solicitation letters.”  Resp. at 16.  By definition, such letters would 
be prepared because of existing or anticipated litigation.  Lest there be any doubt on this subject, 
Mr. Edwards’ affidavit makes clear that, to the extent “prospective witnesses” can be identified, 
any contact he may have had with such witnesses would have only been in anticipation and 
furtherance of litigation.   
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 8 of 11

During the March 9, 2017, hearing on this subpoena, Defendant seemingly suggested that 
because Mr. Edwards’ communication would have been sent to a witness who was not a client, 
work product protection would somehow be waived.  But “because the work product privilege 
looks to the vitality of the adversary system rather than simply seeking to preserve 
confidentiality, it is not automatically waived by the disclosure to a third party.” Fojtasek v. NCL 
(Bahamas) Ltd., 262 F.R.D. 650, 653–54 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (citing In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 
220 F.3d 406, 409 (5th Cir.2000)). 
To permit Defendant Maxwell to fish for communications by Mr. Edwards with 
prospective witnesses would create an unprecedented procedure wherein litigants could simply 
forego conducting this own investigation into allegations, and then subpoena opposing counsel.   
In this case, Defendant Maxwell was free to depose any witness about anything that may or may 
not have been said to the witness by any person.  However, she is not entitled to obtain copies of 
protected work product, and she is not entitled to supplement her own investigation with the 
investigation conducted by Plaintiff.     
CONCLUSION 
The requests at issue are a blatant attempt to unduly burden Mr. Edwards and invade 
precisely what the work-product privilege aims to protect.  Because of the nature of this request 
even the creation and production of a privilege log would itself unfairly unveil privileged, 
protected information, and this immense burden would be performed despite the obvious 
protection against its production.  For the forgoing reasons, Mr. Edwards respectfully requests 
that this Court grant the Motion to Quash or enter a protective order barring enforcement of 
RFPs #19 and #20 of the Subpoena.   If the Court believes that production of a privilege log is 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 33     Filed 03/13/17     Page 9 of 11

necessary to rule on these issues, Mr. Edwards requests leave to produce such a privilege log 
once the court narrows or defines the scope of the requests.

Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 36     Filed 03/20/17     Page 1 of 7

INTRODUCTION 
Almost one year after being served with a subpoena to produce documents in this matter 
Mr. Edwards, for the first time, claims, with no real legal support, that the letters he sent to 
various former employees of Jeffrey Epstein and other potential witnesses are “work product”.  
Mr. Edwards attempts to obfuscate the issue by claiming that he would have to review hundreds, 
no, thousands, of emails to determine to whom such solicitations were sent.  Mr. Edwards knows 
that he sent a form solicitation letter to many individuals, including former Epstein employees, 
requesting their assistance as a witness in this case.  It strains credibility to believe that Mr. 
Edwards did not keep files related to these people.  It also strains credibility to believe that it 
would take more than a simple word search to find these letters in Mr. Edwards’s files.  Mr. 
Edwards, who has had the subpoena for almost one year, has produced no privilege log 
supporting his assertion of “work product” and fails to address, at all, how the responses of the 
individuals who received the solicitation letters could possibly be his work product.   
I. 
MR. EDWARDS HAS WAIVED ANY CLAIM OF WORK PRODUCT BY HIS 
FAILURE TO PRODUCE A PRIVILEGE LOG. 
It is noteworthy that the initial objection by Mr. Edwards to RFP 19 and RFP 20 was that 
production would be a “burden” on Mr. Edwards. (Mot. To Quash, filed June 16, 2016, at page 
19.)  Now, almost one year later, Mr. Edwards claims that the solicitation letters are “work 
product.”  He has not, however, complied with Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(E)(2)(A). Although Mr. 
Edwards may be allowed to belatedly assert that privilege under Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(E)(2)(A), he 
also is required to produce a log of all documents withheld based on any alleged privilege or 
protection: 
(A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed information under a claim 
that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must: 
(i) expressly make the claim; and 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 36     Filed 03/20/17     Page 2 of 7

(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible 
things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will 
enable the parties to assess the claim. 
An “unjustified failure to list privileged documents on the required log of withheld 
documents in a timely and proper manner operates as a waiver of any applicable privilege,” 
OneBeacon Ins. Co. v. Forman Int'l Ltd., 04 CIV. 2271(RWS), 2006 WL 3771010, at *7–8 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2006).  As this Court noted in OneBeacon Ins. Co., the waiver of privilege is 
equally applicable where there is a failure to produce a privilege log under Rules 45 and 26.  Id. 
(citing In re Application for Subpoena to Kroll, 224 F.R.D. 326, 328 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (“Rule 
requires that the party claiming a privilege prepare a privilege log.... Failure to submit a 
privilege log may be deemed a waiver of the underlying privilege claim.”)); Labatt Ltd. v. 
Molson Breweries, Nos. 93 CV 75004, 94 CV 71540(RPP), 1995 WL 23603 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 20, 
1995), aff'd, Dorf & Stanton Commc'ns, Inc., 100 F.3d 919, 923 (Fed.Cir.1997) (upholding 
determination that privilege had been waived due to failure to satisfy Rules 45(d)(2) and 
26(b)(5)); see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 274 F.3d 563, 575-76 (1st Cir.2001) (stating that 
a “party that fails to submit a privilege log” pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(2) “is deemed to 
waive the underlying privilege claim”).   
II. 
MR. EDWARDS HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE 
SOLICITATION LETTERS ARE WORK PRODUCT AND THAT ANY 
PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THE WORK PRODUCT DOCTRINE HAS NOT 
BEEN WAIVED. 
The party seeking to assert a claim of privilege has the burden of demonstrating both that 
the privilege exists and that it has not been waived. See von Bulow v. von Bulow, 811 F.2d 136, 
144 (2d Cir.1987); Smith v. Conway Org., 154 F.R.D. 73, 77 (S.D.N.Y.1994); Nikkal Indus., Ltd. 
v. Salton, Inc., 689 F. Supp. 187, 191 (S.D.N.Y.1988). This burden stems from the recognition 
that “enforcement of a claim of privilege acts in derogation of the overriding goals of liberal 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 36     Filed 03/20/17     Page 3 of 7

discovery and adjudication on their merits.” Bowne of New York City, Inc. v. AmBase Corp., 150 
F.R.D. 465, 473 (S.D.N.Y.1993). It is for this reason that privileges are “disfavored and 
generally to be narrowly construed.” Id.; see, e.g., United States v. Goldberger & Dubin, 
P.C., 935 F.2d 501, 504 (2d Cir.1991). 
The work product doctrine, codified at Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3), shields 
from discovery “documents and tangible things ... prepared in anticipation of litigation.” Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 26(b)(3). It “is intended to preserve a zone of privacy in which a lawyer can prepare and 
develop legal theories and strategy ‘with an eye toward litigation,’ free from unnecessary 
intrusion by his adversaries.” United States v. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1196 (2d 
Cir.1998) (quoting Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510–11 (1947)). 
Work product protection “is not absolute. Like other qualified privileges, it may be 
waived.” United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 239 (1975). The party asserting the protection 
afforded by the work product doctrine has the burden of showing both that the protection exists 
and that it has not been waived. See e.g., Resolution Trust Corp. v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 200 
F.R.D. 183, 188 (W.D.N.Y.2001) (citation omitted); Granite Partners v. Bear, Stearns & Co. 
Inc., 184 F.R.D. 49, 52 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (citing cases).  As the court held in Bristol–Myers 
Squibb Co. v. Rhone–Poulenc Rorer, No. 95 Civ. 8833, 1997 WL 801454, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 
31, 1997), waiver, “of either the lawyer-client or work product privilege, is designed to assure 
fairness to litigants.”  
The solicitation letters at issue here are not work product.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine 
how the type of form letter sent to former Epstein employees could be “work product”.  Mr. 
Edwards, in these form letters, is essentially attempting to “guilt” witnesses into contacting him.  
The factual assertions, or other promises, made by Edwards are certainly not confidential, as they 
Case 1:17-mc-00025-RWS     Document 36     Filed 03/20/17     Page 4 of 7

are being directed at persons outside the litigation.  Mr. Edwards has no expectation of privacy or 
confidentiality when he is sending these letters.  To the extent that the purported facts in the 
letters are inaccurate or misrepresented they may be part of any witnesses’ bias or motive to 
testify.  If the witness testifies, the witness can be asked if the witness received a solicitation 
letter from Mr. Edwards, which would not be protected from disclosure.  The proffering of the 
witness acts as a waiver of any work product protection under these circumstances because it 
would be fundamentally unfair to have influenced the witnesses’ testimony but shield the 
influence by a claim of work product. Mr. Edwards has not produced an example of the form 
letter for the Court to review, likely because he knows that the Court would reject the claim that 
the form solicitation letter is work product. 
III. 
MR. EDWARDS HAS NO CLAIM THAT RESPONSES TO THE SOLICITATION 
LETTERS ARE WORK PRODUCT. 
RFP 20 requests the responses to any of the solicitation letters.  Mr. Edwards has no 
claim that what a prospective witness writes back to him is “work product”.  The RFP does not 
ask for Mr. Edwards’s notes or interview memoranda.  It requests whatever response Mr. 
Edwards received from the solicitation.  Mr. Edwards has failed to log any of these 
communications, a waiver in and of itself.  Again, it is likely that he has refused to produce a log 
because to do so would demonstrate the frivolousness of this claim. 
CONCLUSION 
For the above stated reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Motion to Quash 
be denied.
