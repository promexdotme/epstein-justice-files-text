federal standards applicable to the removal of r9tistration requirements for a sexual offender 
or r~ rad to be met as a condition for the receipt of federal funds by the state; and the court 
is othorwfse satisfied that tho offender is not a current or potential thraat to public safety. rhe

law or court order in the state or jurisdiction in which the desiption was made, and providod 
such perwn no le>ni« meets the criteria for registration as a sexual offender under the laws of

(12) The Letislature finds that sexual offenders, especially thaw who haw committed offenses 
aaaf nst minors, often pose a high risk of ~aina in sexual offenses ewn after beint releasod 
from incarceration or commitment and that protection of the public from sexual offenders is a 
pararnouit gowrnmant interest. Sexual offenders haw a reduced expectation of privacy 
bclQuse of the public's interGSt in public safety and in the effiK:tiw operation of go"91"nment. 
Releasint information concornint sexual offonders to law enforcement aaancles and to periOns 
who request such information, and the release of such information to the public by a law 
enforcement atancY « public agency, will further the IO'Wlfflfflantal interests of public safoty.

THEREUPON: 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Good morning, Judge, 
Jack Goldberger on behalf of Jeffrey 
Epstein. 
THE COURT: 
Good morning. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, we are 
here for a plea conference. 
THE COURT: 
Raise your right hand. 
THEREUPON: 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
after being called as a witness by the Defense and 
after being first duly sworn by the Court, was 
examined and testified as follows: 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Is this one case or two? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Two. 
THE COURT: 
May I see the PC

affidavit in both cases, please? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
There are no PC 
affidavits. 
There was originally an 
Indictment, the second charge was filed 
arising out of the booking. 
It was all 
testimony presented to the grand jury. 
THE COURT: 
Let me see the Indictment 
then? 
I have one Indictment, one 
Information? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
So one case is charged by 
Indictment, one is charged by Information? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
In case 2006036744 you 
are charged with procuring a person under 
for prostitution, a second degree 
felony, maximum penalty of fifteen years 
Department of Corrections; minimum, some 
period of probation. 
No mandatory minimum 
apply, is that correct, State? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
And in case number 06 
9454CF, you are charged with felony 
solicitation to prostitution, a third 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
degree felony, punishable by a maximum 
penalty of five years in the Department of 
Corrections, and a minimum, probation. 
No 
mandatory minimums, correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
The defendant has no 
prior criminal record? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
,Yes, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
You checked the NCIC as 
well as State records? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes. 
THE COURT: 
And the guideline score 
sheet I have before me shows 21.5 months in 
the Department of Corrections as the lowest 
permissible prison sentence in months. 
Both sides agree to the preparation of the 
guideline score sheet? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We so agree, Your 
Honor. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes. 
THE COURT: 
What is proposed -- it 
goes on for pages. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, much of 
the documentation is acknowledgement by my

client to community control, sex offender 
status. 
THE COURT: 
I understand. 
Okay. 
What is proposed -- those 
are the maximums and minimums, Mr. Epstein. 
What is proposed is that you will be 
pleading guilty to felony solicitation to 
prostitution and procuring a person under 
for prosecution. 
A PSI would be waived, 
you would be adjudicated guilty of both 
felonies, is that correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
And on 06 9454, the 
defendant to be sentenced to 12-months in 
the Palm Beach County 
detention 
facility? 
He's going to do time in the 
jail? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes. 
THE COURT: 
With credit for one day 
served. 
And on 08 9381, he is to be 
sentenced to six months in the Palm Beach 
County jail detention facility, with credit 
for one day served. 
And the six month 
sentence is to be served consecutive to the 
month sentence?

( 
<I 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
Following the six months 
sentence, the defendant will be placed on 
12-months of community control one. 
The 
conditions of the community control are 
attached hereto and incorporated herein. 
As a special condition of 
community control, he's to have no 
unsupervised contact with minors and the 
supervising adult must be approved -- and I 
would say, pre-approved, approved ahead of 
time, not after the fact by the Department 
of Corrections. 
And you would mean by that 
his community control officer? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
The defendant is 
designated as a sexual offender pursuant to 
Florida Statute 943.0435 and must abide by 
all the corresponding requirements of the 
statute, a copy of which is attached hereto 
and incorporated herein. 
The defendant 
must provide a DNA sample in court at the 
time of this plea. 
Is this the --
and the 
attachments are the terms and conditions of 
community control. 
There are some

squiggles on the bottom of the page, what 
would those squiggles be? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Thank you, Your 
Honor, those are my client's signature 
acknowledging that we have gone over all 
the conditions. 
THE COURT: 
One page after the plea 
sheet that really spells out the terms and 
conditions of community control, Florida 
Statute 948.101, Mr. Epstein, is that 
squiggle at the bottom your squiggle? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Would those be your 
initials? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Did you read all of that 
page? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Can you read? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
How far did you go in 
school? 
THE DEFENDANT:

signature on the plea sheet that recites 
the terms of the plea I just read? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Did you read that 
document as well? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
You understand once you 
do your 12 months followed by your six 
months all in the Palm Beach County jail 
you will then be put on community control 
which involves having an electronic monitor 
attached to you and --
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Actually Your Honor, 
the agreement of the parties is to, it's 
community control one which is not monitor. 
THE COURT: 
Oh, community control 
one, is that spelled out in here? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes, it is, Your 
Honor. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
He does not fall 
under the Jessica Lunsford Act which 
requires the bracelet.

THE COURT: 
Community control two. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct, 
THE COURT: 
Community control one 
that would be no electronic monitor? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That is correct. 
THE COURT: 
Now which of the terms 
and conditions of community control one are 
you incorporating? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
I can go through 
them with Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
None of the them appear 
to be articulated in the plea sheet which 
is why I'm asking. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
These are the 
standard conditions of community control by 
statute would apply to anyone that goes on 
community control and out of an abundance 
of caution, we simply memorialized those 
standard conditions in the plea sheet 
agreement. 
THE COURT: 
The Court shall require 
intensive supervision and surveillance for 
an offender placed on community control 
which may include but is not limited to 
specified contact with the parole and 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
probation officer, specified by who? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
Specified by you, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
I don't see that in the 
plea sheet. 
That's why I'm asking the 
questions. 
No one has specified how often, 
how frequently he is to have contact with 
his parole and probation officer. 
Confinement to an agreed upon residence 
during the ·hours away from employment and. 
public service activity, has that been 
articulated? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
I believe 
Judge Mcsorley has a standard order 
somewhere on the bench up there regarding 
this, I'm told by the prosecutor. 
MS. LENHARDT: 
Judge, usually this is 
the probation sheet she hands out to folks. 
THE COURT: 
I have seen those 
sheets --
I have seen them incorporated in 
plea agreements which is why I'm asking. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
I see. 
THE COURT: 
Is there some reason you 
didn't use this particular document in this 
case? 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
• 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
I didn't realize 
until Ms. Lenhardt just told me that Judge 
Mcsorley has that. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We'd be happy to 
execute that document, Your Honor. 
We were 
--
we overreacted by just having him sign 
off on all conditions of community control. 
THE COURT: 
Well, this is --
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Perhaps the better 
practice would be 
THE COURT: 
This is, the reason 
Judge Mcsorley does this which makes 
ultimate sense is we're going to be here 
half the morning if we're going to decide 
among ourselv~s now what the --
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That makes sense. 
THE COURT: 
I'm not going to leave 
this just unspecified. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
We can take care of 
that right now if you could give us a few 
minutes. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
These are the standard conditions 
that Judge Mcsorley normally uses. 
If you 
like them, you need to circle the ones that 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
• 
apply and everyone must initial them. 
We 
will go over it. 
If you wish to change 
you understand there is quite a bit of 
latitude given the court in putting 
somebody on community control. 
If you 
agree to some change, let me know, but 
understand at the outset that I'm a big fan 
of specificity. 
I want to know what he 
will be doing for employment. 
I want to 
know exactly where he is going to.be living 
and I want it on the record now. 
It can 
change but it can only change with 
preapproval by DOC. 
I want it crystal 
clear. 
I don't want the community control 
officer who gets this case the day he walks 
out the Palm Beach County to have any doubt 
or confusion as to exactly what this 
defendant is supposed to do, where he is 
supposed to be when, exactly what I am 
requesting that officer to supervise. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Absolutely. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We will work on it. 
Thank you, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
We will recall that case. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
(Brief recess.} 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, we are 
back on Jeffrey Epstein, actually it 
worked, we had an opportunity to go through 
Judge McSorley's conditions of community 
control and we asked the Department of 
Corrections representative to assist us to 
make sure we did everything properly. 
They were very helpful and we executed the 
document. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes, and Your Honor, 
this defendant doesn't fall under the sex 
offender probation but we have included 
special sex offender conditions as part of 
the community control and they are all 
circled there. 
THE COURT: 
The plea agreement stated 
the defendant is designated as a sexual 
offender pursuant to Florida Statute 
942.035. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
But the 
sex offender probation, the statute is 
different and only applies to certain 
offenses and this one was not enumerated. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
I want to make 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
sure both I and the defendant are clear. 
The sexual offender statute you are 
referring to in the plea sheet is the one 
that requires registration? 
that. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
And we will talk about 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Okay. 
THE COURT: 
But it is not the one 
that requires the special conditions of sex 
offender probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
Now, rather than 948, do 
you want me to disregard 948? 
He's read 
it? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
He's read it. 
THE COURT: 
We will leave it in 
there. 
But these conditions we are going 
to go over right now are going to be viewed 
in my mind, yes, and they have been signed 
by the defendant and we will go over that 
in a second as a part of the whole plea. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
So circled are 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
conditions, A, you will remain confined to 
your residence except one half hour before 
and after your approved employment, 
community service work or any other 
activity approved by your probation 
officer. 
B, you will maintain an hourly 
accounting of all your activities on a 
daily log which you will submit to your 
supervising officer upon request. 
My understanding about the daily 
log, maybe I'm just confused from other 
cases I've heard, is the daily log is a 
weekly log, I guess it is submitted ahead 
of time, is that correct? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
So part A, where he has 
to stay in his residence except for one 
hour before and after the approved 
employment, community service work and 
other activity. 
All that's information 
that will be recorded in writing and the 
defendant will have a copy and he will know 
exactly where he is supposed to be when. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
As will his supervising 
probation officer. 
And then to document 
that he's supposedly done all that he 
himself will be keeping a daily log? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
And the log form will be 
provided by the department and he will be 
turning that in every time he meets with 
the probation officer? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
So that applies 
and F applies. 
Does E apply? 
No. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Did I circle E? 
THE COURT: 
No. 
F -- made one up, 
the defendant will be residing at 358 El 
Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, 33480. 
He 
knows now that that's where he will be 
living when he is released after his 12 
months and six months. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
THE COURT: 
That's a private 
residence? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That is his home. 
THE COURT: 
Does he own th~ 
residence? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
He does, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Is there any possibility 
that he no longer owns the residence? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Not anticipated, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
for whatever reason 
Should he not be 
18-months is a long 
time, should he not be owning that 
residence or able to reside there, he will 
have the obligation of notifying his 
probation officer prior, and I emphasize 
this, prior to his release from custody. 
I 
assume that the department will be notified 
prior to, to his release? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
And then you would need 
to send someone to meet with him before he 
walks out of the Palm Beach County jail and 
verify his address and employment 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
information? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct. 
THE COURT: 
All address --
I assume 
all of this to and from work and any other 
approved activities restricts him to Palm 
Beach County, is that correct? 
PROBATION OFFICER: 
That is correct, 
Your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
So let's be clear, 
everything, from the day he walks out 
occurs in Palm Beach County, is that clear? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We understand, Your 
Honor. 
That's correct. 
THE COURT: 
Then the additional 
condition of his probation, they are not 
sex offender standard conditions, they are 
just conditions that are being imposed 
especially in this case? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
They are as follows, you 
shall submit to a mandatory curfew from 10 
p.m. to 6:00 a.m. regardless of any other 
restrictions regarding work or approved 
activity, there will be no exceptions to 
being at home in house from 10 p.m. to 6 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
a.m., is that correct? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Yes. 
THE COURT: 
If the victim was under 
age of 18 years which I gather is the case 
because it's circled, you shall not live 
within 1000 feet of a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place 
where children regularly congregate. 
Has someone verified that 358 El 
Brillo is such a place? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
No, but that will be 
done prior to his release. 
THE COURT: 
So 358 El Brillo will not 
be approved if it should happen to be one 
thousand feet from a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place 
this is rather open. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Where children 
gather. 
THE COURT: 
Where children regularly 
congregate. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Right. 
THE COURT: 
The Court knows 358 El 
Brillo Way is a residential neighborhood, 
are there areas there where children 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
regularly congregate? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
I personally do not 
know. 
THE COURT: 
Neither do I, which is 
why I'm asking. 
Has that been 
investigated? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We have done our due 
diligence, for what it's worth, there is a 
residential street. 
There are not children 
congregating on that street. 
We think the 
address applies, if it doesn't, we fully 
recognize that he can't live there. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Dis, you shall 
not have any contact with the victim, are 
there more than one victim? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
There's several. 
THE COURT: 
Several, all of the 
victims. 
So this should be plural. 
I'm 
making that plural. 
You are not to have 
any contact direct or indirect, and in this 
day and age I find it necessary to go over 
exactly what we mean by indirect. 
By 
indirect, we mean no text messages, no 
e-mail, no Face Book, no My Space, no 
telephone calls, no voice mails, no 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES, 
OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
messages through carrier pigeon, no 
messages through third parties, no hey 
would you tell so and so for me, no having 
a friend, acquaintance or stranger approach 
any of these victims with a message of any 
sort from you, is that clear? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am 
THE COURT: 
And then it states, 
unless approved by the victim, the 
therapist and the sentencing court. 
Okay. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
I understand. 
THE COURT: 
And the sentencing court. 
So, if there is a desire which, I would 
think would be a bit strange to have 
contact with any of the victims the court 
must approve it. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
If the victim was under 
the age of 18, which was the case, you 
shall not until you have successfully 
attended and completed the sex offender 
program. 
So, is this sex offender program 
becoming a condition of probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
That is not. 
I 
don't believe I circled that one.

Beach County jail followed by six months? 
Why not just send him to DOC?

It was the agreement 
of the parties, Your Honor. 
We just 
decided that was the best way to accomplish 
what needed to be done here and the parties 
agreed that that sentence satisfied 
everyone's requirements.

Yes, ma'am.

And this registration 
occurs when? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Within 48-hours of 
release. 
THE COURT: 
So when he gets out of 
the Palm Beach County jail, he needs to 
register? 
Okay. 
And the department 
who 
is going to provide him with the form? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
He actually 
registers out at the Sheriff's Office, Your 
Honor, we can do it out there. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
It has been 
brought to my attention that FDLE is the 
one who is statutorily required to handle 
these registrations but some of our 
municipal jurisdictions have taken it upon 
themselves to impose additional 
requirements, y'all understand that? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Right. 
THE COURT: 
What you are telling him 
PHYLLIS A. DAMES,

' 
' 
he has to do is the official State of 
Florida registration? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: 
Mr. Epstein, I need to 
make sure you understand that that's what's 
required by this plea. 
Anyone on 
probation, community control is required to 
live and abide by the laws. 
So if a 
jurisdiction you choose to reside in should 
have some additional municipal requirements 
you will be required in order to comply 
with the law of living there, just like you 
can't get a parking ticket or speeding 
ticket, to comply with those regulations 
but I want to make sure you understand 
because I have seen some defendants who 
have been confused about this. 
If you 
don't, for example, if the Town of Palm 
Beach has you register that does not take 
care of your requirement. 
Your requirement 
to register with FDLE through the Sheriff's 
office is separate, distinct and must be 
done on their form according to their 
schedule. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am.

last few months is of any value, they are 
very serious about enforcing this.

will be tracking you for the rest of your 
life. 
Do not move. 
Do not go --
I don't 
care when you are done with community 
control, they need to know exactly where 
you are and if you go anywhere without 
registering, they will find and you will be 
locked up. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Any questions 
about that? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
No, ma'am.

the circuit court form that describes all 
the rights you are giving up by entering

by jury, there is not going to be a jury

There won't be witnesses called. 
That your attorney and you would have a

right to remain silent and that you would 
not have to say or do anything at the trial

THE COURT: 
Defendant needs to

The reason why I 
asked to come sidebar, there is a 
nonprosecution agreement with the United 
States Attorney's office that triggers as a 
result of this plea agreement. 
In other 
words, they have signed off and said they 
will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the 
Southern District of Florida for any 
offense upon his successful taking of this 
plea today. 
That is a confidential 
document that the parties have agreed to. 
Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted 
to tell the court. 
THE COURT: 
I understand, that would 
also be invalidated should he violate his

Mr. Epstein needs to come 
closer. 
Mr. Epstein, 
your attorney has 
told me that in addition to everything, we 
talked about another Inducement, shall we 
say, to your taking this plea is that the 
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
the State of Florida, federal prosecutor, 
has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement 
with you, meaning that if you successfully 
complete probation and do everything you're 
supposed to, they have, have agreed not to 
prosecute you federally, did you understand 
that? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
And I would view that as 
a significant inducement in accepting this 
plea.

They are actually in

MOTION TO CLARIFY SENTENCE TO CORRECT SCRIVENER'S ERROR 
COMES NOW the Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his undersigned 
attorney and moves this Honorable Court to enter an Order clarifying the sentence to 
correct a scrivener 's error contained in the sentencing documents in the Defendant's 
case. In support thereof the Defendant would state as follows: 
1. The Defendant was charged by Information in the above referenced case and 
the case was assigned to Criminal Division "W'. 
2. The case was resolved by a guilty plea after plea negotiations between the 
parties. It was a condition of the plea negotiations that the case be resolved on June 30, 
2008. 
3. The case was scheduled for a plea conference on June 30, 2008 in Criminal 
Division "W", the division that this case and the companion case had always been assigned 
to. On that date, retired Judge Deborah Pucillo was substituting for the assigned Division 
"W" judge, Sandra Mcsorley, because Judge McSorley would not be sitting on that day. 
4. Judge Pucillo handled all cases assigned to Division "W' on June 30, 2008 
including that of the Defendant. 
SCANNED 
DEC O 8 2008 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
5. The Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, entered his guilty pleas on June 30, 2008 in 
Division "W' before Judge Pucillo. All plea documents and court commitments from court 
on June 30, 2008 reflect that this was a Division "W' case and was being resolved in 
Division "W', the division the case had always been assigned to. 
6. As part of the negotiated settlement of the case, the Defendant was sentenced 
to a twelve month sentence in Case No. 2006CF009454AXX, followed by a six month 
sentence on this case, consecutive with the first twelve month sentence in the in Case No. 
2006CF009454AXX. The Defendant is sentenced to twelve months of community control 
I consecutive to the two above referenced jail sentences. The community control sentence 
begins only after the two jail sentences have been served. 
7. On July 18, 2008 Judge Sandra Mcsorley, the permanent judge assigned to 
Division "W', signed an Order of Community Control, without notice to the parties, nunc 
pro tune to June 30, 2008. The reason for this is that the substitute judge had neglected 
to sign an Order of Community Control in this case at the time of the plea. See the Order 
of Community Control attached as Exhibit "A". 
8. The Order of Community Control signed by Division "W' Judge Mcsorley on July 
18, 2008, contains a minor scrivener's error that needs to be corrected. The Order of 
Community Control could be misinterpreted to suggest that the Defendant was placed on 
community control on June 30, 2008 based on the box that the clerk checked in error when 
preparing the Order of Community Control. 
9. The parties agree that the Defendant's twelve month sentence on Case No. 
2006CF009454AXX is followed by a six month sentence in the instant case. The parties 
agree that the one year period of community control is to only begin after the Defendant

has completed his jail sentences. 
Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek does not to object to Motion to Clarify 
Sentence to Correct Scrivener's Error. 
WHEREFORE the Defendant moves this Honorable Court to enter an Order 
correcting the scrivener's error in the original Order of Community Control clarifying the 
intent to the parties that the Defendant's community control sentence begins only after his 
jail sentence terminates. 
I HEREBY CERTIFY that a copy of the foregoing has been furnished by mail to 
Lanna Belohlavek, State Attorney's Office, 401 North Dixie Highway, West Palm Beach,

MOT 1O N TO VACATE ORDER SEALING RECORDS AND 
UNSEAL RECORDS 
1111, a nonparty, moves pursuant to the Rules of Judicial Administration Rule 
2.420(d)(5) to vacate the order sealing records and unseal two documents in these files on 
the following grounds: 
.• 
is a victim of sexual abuse by defendant who was convicted of procuring a 
person under 18 for prostitution and felony solicitation of prostitution. See attached 
judgments of conviction (Exhibit "A".) -presently has a pending civil action in this 
court against defendant for damages. Case number 502008CA028058XXXXMB AB. 
2. On June 30, 2008 and August 25, 2008, this Court sealed two documents, a 
non-prosecution agreement and an addendum to non-prosecution agreement. 
See 
attached copies of envelopes containing the sealed documents and also an Agreed Order 
Sealing Document In Court File entered July 2, 2008 (Exhibit "B".) 
3. The sealing of these documents was done without written motion required by 
Rule 2.420(d)(l) or notice to the public, the media, the record newspaper and the victims 
of defendant required by Rule 2.420( d)(2). The Agreed Order does not set forth the 
SCANNED MA 1 14 2009 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
grounds set forth in Rule 2.420(d)(3). The clerk of court did not post a copy of the notice 
of the order as required by Rule 2.420(d)(4). 
4. The sealing of these documents was also done contrary to the Administrative 
Orders of this Court, AO 2.104, 2.032, 2.303and11.046. 
5. The request to seal the first document was made orally at the plea hearing on 
June 30, 2008. A copy of the relevant portion of the transcript is attached (see pages 38-
40) (Exhibit "C".) 
6. It is against public policy for these documents to have been sealed and hidden 
from public scrutiny. 
As a member of the public, -
has a right to have these 
documents unsealed. Furthermore, these documents are relevant and material to -
civil action against defendant. As stated in the plea colloquy, they were an inducement 
for defendant to enter into his guilty pleas. 
They are proper objects of discovery. 
However, unless they are unsealed, 1111 is unable to obtain them or utilize them in her 
case. 
7. Pursuant to Rule 2.420(d)(5), the Court must hold a hearing on this motion in 
open court. 
WHEREFORE movant requests the Court vacate the order sealing records and 
unseal the two documents.

on that, Your Honor? 
THE COURT: 
It is going to be 
recorded. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That's fine. 
THE COURT: 
Defendant needs to 
approach as well. 
(Whereupon, there was a conference at 
the bench.) 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
The reason why I 
asked to come sidebar, there is a 
nonprosecution agreement with the United 
States Attorney's office that triggers as a 
result of this plea agreement. 
In other 
words, they have signed off and said they 
will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the 
Southern District of Florida for any 
offense upon his successful taking of this 
plea today. 
That is a confidential 
document that the parties have agreed to. 
Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted 
to tell the court. 
THE COURT: 
I understand, that would 
also be invalidated should he violate his 
community control? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Absolutely. 
That

nonprosecution agreement --
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
They spell all that 
out. 
THE COURT: 
Mr. Epstein needs to come 
closer. 
Mr. Epstein, 
your attorney has 
told me that in addition to everything, we 
talked about another Inducement, shall we 
say, to your taking this plea is that the 
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
the State of Florida, federal prosecutor, 
has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement 
with you, meaning that if you successfully 
complete probation and do everything you're 
supposed to, they have, have agreed not to 
prosecute you federally, did you understand 
that? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
And I would view that as 
a significant inducement in accepting this 
plea. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
They are actually in 
court here today, also. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
And the plea

• 
agreement very carefully spelled out if 
there was a breach that would violate this 
agreement, so we are well aware of it. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
I would request 
that a sealed copy of that --
Mr. Epstein 
has signed that document? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes, I would like to 
seal the copy. 
THE COURT: 
I want a sealed copy of 
that filed in this case. 
That is the only 
other condition of 
the agreement that is 
influencing this defendant to make this 
decision? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Absolutely. 
I think 
that's the right idea. 
(Return to open court.) 
THE COURT: 
Mr. Epstein, is there 
anything else? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
No, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
Because I don't take 
these pleas unless they are freely and 
voluntarily made. 
THE DEFENDANT: 
I understand that. 
THE COURT: 
I also don't want 
somebody or anybody coming back a year,

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 
FIFTEENTH JUDICAL CIRCUIT 
IN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY 
FLORIDA, CRIMINAL DIVISION 
Case Nos. 
2008-9381CF AXX 
-
w 
NONPARTY-MOTION TO VACATE ORDER SEALING RECORl)S AND 
UNSEAL RECORDS 
w 
-
a nonparty, moves pursuant to the Rules of Judicial Administration Rule 
2.420(d)(5) to vacate the order sealing records and unseal two documents in these files on 
the following grounds: 
1. -
is a victim of sexual abuse by defendant who was convicted of procuring a 
person under 18 for prostitution and felony solicitation of prostitution. See attached 
judgments of conviction (Exhibit "A".) -
presently has a pending civil action in this 
court against defendant for damages. Case number 502008CA028058XXXXMB AB. 
2. On June 30, 2008 and August 25, 2008, this Court sealed two documents, a 
non-prosecution agreement and an addendum to non-prosecution agreement. 
See 
attached copies of envelopes containing the sealed documents and also an Agreed Order 
Sealing Document In Court File entered July 2, 2008 (Exhibit "B".) 
3. The sealing of these documents was done without written motion required by 
Rule 2.420(d)(l) or notice to the public, the media, the record newspaper and the victims 
of defendant required by Rule 2.420(d)(2). The Agreed Order does not set forth the 
SENT TO JUDGE 
ONu!\>i\t:PiBY .~ 
SCANNED

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
grounds set forth in Rule 2.420( d)(3). The clerk of court did not post a copy of the notice 
of the order as required by Rule 2.420(d)(4). 
4. The sealing of these documents was also done contrary to the Administrative 
Orders of this Court, AO 2.104, 2.032, 2.303and11.046. 
5. The request to seal the first document was made orally at the plea he¢ng on 
June 30, 2008. A copy of the relevant portion of the transcript is attached (see pages 38-
40) (Exhibit "C".) 
6. It is against public policy for these documents to have been sealed and hidden 
from public scrutiny. 
As a member of the public, -
has a right to have these 
documents unsealed. Furthermore, these documents are relevant and material to 
civil action against defendant. As stated in the plea colloquy, they were an inducement 
for defendant to enter into his guilty pleas. 
They are proper objects of discovery. 
However, unless they are unsealed, 1111 is unable to obtain them or utilize them in her 
case. 
7. Pursuant to Rule 2.420(d)(5), the Court must hold a hearing on this motion in 
open court. 
WHEREFORE movant requests the Court vacate the order sealing records and 
unseal the two documents.

THE COURT: 
It is going to be

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That's fine. 
THE COURT: 
Defendant needs to 
approach as well. 
{Whereupon, there was a conference at 
the bench.) 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
The reason why I 
asked to come sidebar, there is a 
nonprosecution agreement with the United 
States Attorney's office that triggers as a 
result of this plea agreement. 
In other 
words, they have signed off and said they 
will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the 
Southern District of Florida for any 
offense upon his successful taking of this 
plea today. 
That is a confidential 
document that the parties have agreed to. 
Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted 
to tell the court.

MS. BELOHLAVEK: 
They spell all that

THE COURT: 
Mr. Epstein needs to come 
closer. 
Mr. Epstein, 
your attorney has 
told me that in addition to everything, we 
talked about another Inducement, shall we 
say, to your taking this plea is that the 
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
the State of Florida, federal prosecutor, 
has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement 
with you, meaning that if you successfully 
complete probation and do everything you're 
supposed to, they have, have ag~eed not to 
prosecute you federally, did you understand 
that? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: 
And I would view that as 
a significant inducement in accepting this 
plea.

there was a breach that would violate this

THE COURT: 
Okay. 
I would request 
that a sealed copy of that --
Mr. Epstein 
has signed that document? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes, 
I would like to 
seal the copy. 
THE COURT: 
I want a sealed copy of 
that filed in this case. 
That is the only 
other condition of 
the agreement that is 
influencing this defendant to make this 
decision? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Absolutely. 
that's the right idea. 
(Return to open court.) 
I think 
THE COURT: 
Mr. Epstein, is there· 
anything else? 
THE DEFENDANT: 
No, ma'am.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
I 
----------------
PALM BEACH POST'S MOTION TO INTERVENE 
AND PETITION FOR ACCESS 
Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc., d/b/a The Palm Beach Post (the "Post") moves to 
. intervene in this action for the limited purpose of seeking access to documents filed under seal. 
The documents relate directly to the Defendant's guilty plea and sentence. Thus, the sealed 
documents go to the heart of the disposition of this case. But in requesting that Judge Pucillo 
seal these docwnents, the parties failed to comply with Florida's strict procedural and substantive 
requirements for sealing judicial records. In addition, continued sealing of these documents is 
pointless, because these docwnents have been discussed repeatedly in open court records. For all 
of these reasons, the docwnents must be unsealed. As grounds for this Motion, the Post states: 
1. 
The Post is a daily newspaper that has covered this matter and relat~ 
r--..> 
-C.s: g 
proceedings. In an effort to inform its readers concerning these matters, the Po~ff~esion

proceedings for the limited purpose of seeking access to proceedings and reco;~;;;~se~arron v. 
Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531 So. 2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (news media have standing 
to challenge any closure order); Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Lewis, 426 So. 2d 1, 7 (Fla. 1982) 
(news media must be given an opportunity to be heard on question of closure).

3. 
The particular documents under seal in this case are a non-prosecution agreement 
that was docketed on July 2, 2008, and an addendum docketed on August 25, 2008. Together, 
these documents apparently restrict any federal prosecution of the Defendant for offenses related 
to the conduct to which he pleaded guilty in this case. Judge Pucillo accepted the agreement for 
filing during a bench conference on June 30, 2008. The agreement, Judge Pucillo found, was "a 
significant inducement in accepting this plea." Such agreements and related documents typically 
are public record. See Oregonian Publishing Co. v. United States District Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 
1465 (9th Cir. 1990) ("plea agreements have typically been open to the public"); United States v. 
Kooistra, 796 F.3d 1390, 1390-91 (11th Cir. 1986) (documents relating to defendant's change of 
plea and sentencing could be sealed only upon finding of a compelling interest that justified 
denial of public access). 
4. 
The Florida Constitution provides that judicial branch records generally must be 
open for public inspection. See Art. I, § 24(a), Fla. Const. Closure of such records is allowed 
only under narrow circumstances, such as to "prevent a serious and imminent threat to the fair, 
impartial and orderly administration of justice," or to protect a compelling governmental interest. 
See Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(c)(9)(A). Additionally, closure must be effective and no broader 
than necessary to accomplish the desired purpose, and is lawful only if no less restrictive 
measures will accomplish that purpose. See Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2. 420(c)(9)(B) & (C); Lewis, 
426 So. 2d at 3. 
5. 
In this case, the non-prosecution agreement and, later, the addendum were sealed 
without any of the requisite findings. Rather, it appears from the record, the documents were 
sealed merely because the Defendant's counsel represented to Judge Pucillo that the non-
prosecution agreement "is a confidential document." See Plea Conference Transcript page 38 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
(June 30, 2008). Such a representation falls well short of demonstrating a compelling interest, a 
genuine necessity, narrow tailoring, and that no less restrictive measures will suffice. 
Consequently, the sealing was improper and ought to be set aside. 
6. 
In addition, at this time good cause exists for unsealing the documents because of 
their public significance. Since the Defendant pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for 
prostitution, he has been named in at least 12 civil lawsuits that- like the charges in this case -
allege he brought and paid teenage girls to come his home for sex and/or "massages."1 At least 
cases are pending. In another lawsuit, one of the Defendant's accusers has alleged that 
federal prosecutors failed to consult with her regarding the disposition of possible charges 
against the Defendant. 2 State prosecutors also have been criticized: The Palm Beach Police 
Chief has faulted the State Attorney's handing of these cases as "highly unusual" and called for 
the State Attorney's disqualification. Consequently, this case - and particularly the Defendant's 
agreements with prosecutors - are of considerable public interest and concern. 
7. 
The Defendant's non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors also was 
important to Judge Pucillo. As she noted in the June 2008 plea conference, "I would view [the 
non-prosecution agreement] as a significant inducement in accepting this plea." See Plea 
Conference Transcript page 39. Florida law recognizes a strong public right of access to 
documents a court considers in connection with sentencing. See Sarasota Herald Tribune, Div. 
See. e.g .. Doe v. Epstein, Case No. 08-80069 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, 
Case No. 08-80119 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Doe No. 3. v. Epstein, Case No. 08-80232 (S.D. Fla. 2008); 
Doe No. 4. v. Epstein, Case No. 08-80380 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Doe No. 5 v. Epstein, Case No. 08-
80381 (S.D. Fla. 2008); C.M.A. v. Epstein, Case No. 08-80811 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Doe v. Epstein, 
Case No. 08-80893 (S.D. Fla 2008); Doe No. 7 v. Epstein, Case No. 08-80993 (S.D. Fla. 2008); 
Doe No. 6 v. Epstein, Case No. 08-80994 (S.D. Fla. 2008); Doe II v. Epstein, Case No. 09-80469 
(S.D. Fla. 2009); Doe No. 101 v. Epstein, Case No. 09-80591 (S.D. Fla. 2009); Doe No. 102 v. 
Epstein, Case No. 09-80656 (S.D. Fla. 2009); Doe No. 8 v. Epstein, Case No. 09-80802 (S.D. 
Fla. 2009). 
See In re: Jane Doe, Case No. 08-80736 (S.D. Fla. 2008). 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
of the New York Times Co. v. Holtzendorf, 507 So. 2d 667,668 (Fla. 2d DCA 1987) ("While a 
judge may impose whatever legal sentence he chooses, if such sentence is based on a tangible 
proceeding or document, it is within the public domain unless otherwise privileged."). In this 
case, no interest justifies continued sealing of these "significant" documents that Judge Pucillo 
considered in accepting the plea and sentencing the Defendant. The lack of any such 
compelling interest - as well as the parties' failure to comply with the standards for sealing 
documents initially - provide good cause for unsealing the documents at this time. 
8. 
Finally, continued closure of these documents is pointless, because many portions 
of the sealed documents already have been made public. For example, court papers quoting 
excerpts of the agreement have been made public in related federal proceedings.3 As the Florida 
Supreme Court has noted, "there would be little justification for closing a pretrial hearing in 
order to prevent only the disclosure of details which had already been publicized." Lewis, 426 
So. 2d at 8. Similarly, in this case, to the extent that information already has been made public, 
continued closure is pointless and, therefore, unconstitutional. 
9. 
The Post has no objection to the redaction of victims' names (if any) that appear 
in the sealed documents. In addition, insofar as the Defendant or State Attorney seek continued 
closure, the Post requests that the Court inspect the documents in camera in order to assess 
whether, in fact, continued closure is proper. 
See, e.g., "Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen's Motion for Stay," C.M.A. v. 
Epstein, Case No. 08-80811 (S.D. Fla. July 25, 2008) (filed publicly Jan. 7, 2009).

WHEREFORE, the Post respectfully requests that this Court unseal the non-prosecution 
agreement and addendum and grant the Post such other relief as the Court deems proper.

EPSTEIN, JEFFREY E, 
Defendant. 
I 
------------------
MOTION TO INTERVENE AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
COMES NOW, Applicant,1111 and requests this Court, pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil 
Procedure 1.230, for leave to intervene as a party in Mr. Epstein's criminal matter for the 
following reasons: 
1. 
Applicant's intervention is in subordination to, and in recognition of, the propriety 
of the main proceeding. 
2. 
Applicant stands to either gain or lose by the court's direct legal operation and 
effect of judgment in the pending matter. 
3. 
Applicant is not injecting a new issue into the pending matter. 
4. 
Applicant's motion to intervene is timely. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
5. 
Defense counsel, Robert Critton, Jr. in the civil matter, does not object to 
Applicant's motion, but Plaintiff's counsel has not heard back from Defendant 
Epstein's criminal counsel, Jack Goldberger as to whether he opposes this motion. 
MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Anyone claiming an interest in pending litigation may at any time be permitted to assert a 
right by intervention, but the intervention shall be in subordination to, and in recognition of, the 
propriety of the main proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the court in its discretion. 
Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.230. "A person seeking leave to intervene must claim an interest of such a direct 
and immediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation 
and effect of the judgment." Litvak v. Scylla Properties, LLC, 946 So.2d 1165, 1172 (Fla. 5th 
DCA 2006). Additionally, "an intervenor my not inject a new issue into the case." 
Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc., v. IMC Phosphates, Inc., 857 So.2d 
207, 211 (Fla. I st DCA 2003). "An intervention is thus only appropriate where the issue the 
intervenor raises are related to the case being litigated." Racing Properties, L.P., v. Baldwin, 885 
So.2d 881,883 (Fla. 3rd DCA 2004). 
Once the trial court determines that the intervenor's interest is sufficient, it exercises its 
discretion to determine whether to permit intervention. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co. v. Carlisle, 593 
So.2d 505, 507 (Fla. 1992). "In deciding this question the court should consider a number of 
factors, including the derivation of the interest, any pertinent contractual language, the size of the 
interest, the potential for conflicts or new issues, and any other relevant circumstance." Id. 
Finally, an intervention is generally considered timely if it is made before a final decree has been 
entered. See Technical Chemicals And Products, Inc., v. Porchester Holdings, Inc., 748 So.2d 
1090, 1091 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000). 
Page of 4 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
Applicant's proposed intervention is subordinate and in recognition of the propriety of 
the main proceeding. Additionally, Applicant will not inject any new issue into Mr. Epstein's 
criminal case. In fact, Applicant's intervention is for the limited purpose of joining already 
intervening parties._,, and "the Palm Beach Post" in their arguments regarding the sealed 
Federal non-prosecution agreement in Mr. Epstein's criminal file. Finally, Applicant's interest is 
of such a direct and immediate character that the Applicant stands to either gain or lose by the 
court's judgment in the pending matter. The Applicant currently has a civil complaint against 
Mr. Epstien regarding allegations similar to those in this pending criminal mater. The sealed 
document may contain discoverable information or may lead to the discovery of new relevant 
informatiop.. See Fla.R.Civ.P. l.280(b)(l). Additionally, the document may contain valuable 
impeachment information that the Applicant would intend to use if the Applicant's civil case 
proceeded to trial. 
WHEREFORE, Applicant, 1111 respectfully requests the Court grant-motion to 
intervene in the pending criminal matter.

EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO STAY DISCLOSURE OF THE NON-
PROSECUTION AGREEMENT AND ADDENDUM PENDING REVIEW 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel and pursuant to Rule 9.310, Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure, moves to stay 
disclosure of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and Addendum (collectively, the "NPA") 
pending review, and states: 
• 1. 
In the event the Court grants Non party -
Motion to Vacate Order 
Sealing Records and Unseal Records, grants Palm Beach Post's Motion to Intervene and 
Petition for Access and/or denies EPSTEIN's Motion to Make Court Records 
Confidential, EPSTEIN moves to stay the disclosure of the NP A pending review by the 
Fourth District Court of Appeals. 
2. 
Rule 9.310(a), Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure, provides in pertinent 
part, " ... a party seeking to stay a final or non-fmal order pending review shall file a 
motion in the lower tribunal, which shall have continuing jurisdiction, in its discretion , to 
grant, modify or deny such relief." 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
3. 
A stay pending review is warranted under the circumstances because of 
the irreparable harm that would be caused by disclosure of the NP A including, but not 
limited to, substantial injury to a party by disclosing matters protected by common ,law 
and privacy rights, substantial injury to a compelling government interest, substantial 
injury to innocent third parties and a serious imminent threat to the fair, impartial and 
orderly administration of justice as set forth in the hearing record date June 25, 2009. 
4. 
In Mariner Health Care of Nashville, Inc. v. Baker, 739 So. 2d 608, 609 
(Fla. 1st DCA 1999), defendant Mariner filed a petition for writ of certiorari after the trial 
court compelled it to produce certain incident reports. Mariner also moved for a stay 
pending review pursuant to Fla. R. App. Pro. 9.310. The trial court advised the parties 
that Mariner would be required to submit the incident reports to the court under seal as a 
prerequisite to a stay. Mariner refused to produce the documents under seal and the trial 
court denied the motion for stay and imposed daily fines until the documents were 
produced. Id. The First District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order and 
noted 
Id. at 610. 
Mariner has failed to explain how the production of the 
reports under seal would result in any prejudice. To the 
contrary, the records will be protected from disclosure 
during the entire course of the certiorari proceeding before 
this court. No harm can be done if this court ultimately 
determines that the reports are protected by the work 
product privilege. 
5. 
In the instant case the NP A is already filed under seal. Should the Court 
grant Nonparty- Motion to Vacate Order Sealing Records and Unseal Records, 
grant Palm Beach Post's Motion to Intervene and Petition for Access and/or deny 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
:,..,; 
EPSTEIN's .Motion to Make Court Records Confidential, EPSTEIN requests the Court 
exercise its discretion under Fla. R. App. Pro. 9.310(a) and enter a stay pending review 
by the 4th DCA. 
6. 
No harm will be done if the NPA remains under seal pending appellate 
review. To the contrary, EPSTEIN will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not entered 
and the NP A is disclosed to the public. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, respectfully requests that if the 
Court grants Nonparty -
Motion to Vacate Order Sealing Records and Unseal 
Records, grants Palm Beach Post's Motion to Intervene and Petition for Access and/or 
denies EPSTEIN's Motion to Make Court Records Confidential, the Court enter a stay 
• pending review and grant any additional relief the Court deems just and proper.

INTERVENOR PALM BEACH POST'S 
. MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS 
·····;·~ 
a> 
Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc., d/b/a The Palm Beach Post (the "Post") moves this Court 
for an award of attorneys? fees and costs in connection with this matter. In support thereof, the 
Post states: 
1. 
The Post is a daily newspaper that has covered this matter and related 
proceedings. In an effort to inform its readers concerning these matters, the Post relies upon 
( among other things) law enforcement records and judicial records. 
2. 
On June 10, 2009, the Court granted the Post's Motion to Intervene in this action 
for the purpose of seeking access to court records. Specifically, the Post sought access to a non-
prosecution agreement that was docketed on July 2, 2008, and an addendum docketed on August 
25, 2008. 
3. 
On June 25, 2009, the Court heard oral argument on the Post's (and other non-
parties') motions. The Court found that the documents has not properly been sealed in the first 
instance and further denied Defendant's Motion to Make Court Records Confidential dated June 
11, 2009. 
4. 
The Post is entitled to its fess and costs in this matter pursuant to Administrative 
Order Number 2.303 of this Court. Specifically, Rule 2.303 allows sanctions to be imposed 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
against the moving party "if a motion to seal is not made in good faith and is not supported by a 
sound legal and factual basis." Admin. Or. 15th Jud. Cir. Fla. 2.303. 
5. 
In this case, Mr. Epstein's Motion to Make Court Records Confidential was 
neither made in good faith nor supported by a sound legal and factual basis. Defendant's Motion 
asserted four interests that ostensibly would be protected by closure, but the motion cited no facts 
in support of that assertion. At the hearing on the motion, Defendant made no additional effort 
to demonstrate how and why the asserted interests would be served by closure. Instead, 
Defendant's arguments addressed extraneous, inapplicable issues that did not support closure and 
demonstrated the Defendant's lack of good faith in bringing his motion. In sum, the motion was 
wholly without merit, and the Post is entitled to an award of its fees and costs in defending its 
rights of access. 
WHEREFORE, the Post respectfully requests that this Court award to it its fees and costs 
in connection with this matter and grant such other relief as the Court deems proper.

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
Page Two 
Case No. 502008CF009381AXXMB/502006CF009454AXXMB 
1. 
The State of Florida charged the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, with Felony 
Solicitation of Prostitution. 
2. 
The State of Florida and Mr. Epstein T-~ to a negotiated resolutiOJl of the 
charges. 
Part of that resolution included an agreement entered into 
between Mr. Epstein and the United States. At the plea conference in 
State court Mr. Epstein plead guilty to the State charges. At the plea 
conference the agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States were 
made part of this Court's record. The agreement was sealed in two 
separate filings. At the time the State court took these matters under seal, 
the proper procedure for sealing such documents had not been followed. 
The June 25th hearing was to give Mr. Epstein, the State, and/or the 
United States an opportunity to comply with the well-defined and narrow 
parameters for sealing such documents. 
After hearing argument of 
counsel, the Court makes the following findings and rulings: 
1) 
Neither the State of Florida nor the U.S. Government nor Mr. Epstein have 
presented sufficient evidence to warrant the sealing of documents 
currently held by the Court. 
2) 
The Motions to seal the Court records are denied. 
3) 
The Motions to intervene are granted. 
4) 
The Motion to unseal the documents is granted.

The originals will not be disclosed, however the undersigned will do an in-
camera inspection and redact the names of the underage victims, if any, 
so their identity will be indicated by their initials. 
6) 
This Order is in no way to be interpreted as permission to not comply with 
U.S. District Court Kenneth Marra's previous Orders. 
7) 
The disclosure of the sealed documents shall be stayed at least until June 
26, 2009, at 9:00 a.m., at which time the Court will hear "Epstein's Motion 
to Stay Disclosure of Non-Prosecution Agreement and Addendum Pending 
Review".

STATE, 
vs. 
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 
15TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND 
FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, • 
FLORIDA 
EPSTEIN, JEFFREY E, 
Defendant. 
-------------"--------'/ 
INTERVENER'S RESPONSE TO MOTION TO STAY 
AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
COMES NOW, Intervener-and files this Response to Defendant Jeffrey Epstein's 
, Motion to Stay, and states: 
In their motion, Defendant asks the Court to stay its ruling on the production of the NP A 
agreement pending review by the Fourth DCA. Since this NPA was never properly sealed in the 
. first place, a Stay is improper because this document is a public record until such time as it has 
been properly sealed. Furthermore, as Defendant EPSTEIN has failed to demonstrate that he is 
likely to succeed on . the merits of his appeal or describe how he will be harmed by this 
disclosure, Intervenerllll respectfully requests the Court deny their Motion. 
Pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.310(a), a trial court has the discretion 
to enter a stay pending interlocutory review of a non-final order. The burden to satisfy the 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
requirements for a stay rests with the party requesting the stay. A trial court is not obligated, or. 
even encouraged, to enter such a stay as the Appellate Rules specifically provide, "In the absence 
. of a stay, during the pendency of a review of a non':"final order, the lower tribunal may proceed 
with all matters, including trial or final hearing; provided that the lower tribunal may not render 
a final order disposing of the cause pending such review." Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(t) (emphasis 
added). 
Defendants ask the Court to stay disclosure of a public document which was never 
properly sealed. Factors to be considered by a court when deciding whether to enter a stay 
"include the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits, and the likelihood of harm 
should astay not be granted." Perez v. Perez, 769 So.2d 389, 391 n.4 (Fla 3d DCA 1999). 
Defendants fail to adequately address these factors in their motion. 
In fact, Defendant 
completely ignores the likelihood of success analysis. 
Likely this is because there is no 
likelihood that the Fourth District would reverse this court's ruling since the proper procedures 
for sealing the NP A were never followed. 
As to likelihood of harm, the only reference Defendant 1111 makes to this issue is in 
paragraph 3 of his motion. Here, Defendant merely makes a broad assertion that there will be. 
"irreparable harm caused by the disclosure of the NP A." There is no explanation of who will be 
harmed or what harm will be caused. How can a public document which redacts the names of 
the minor victims cause harm? This necessary question is never answered. Defendant's broad 
and vague assertion is insufficient to grant a stay. 
Finally, since there has been no showing by Defendant EPSTEIN that the proper 
procedure for sealing • court documents were ever followed, the NP A is a public record.

Let me call up the case

~ 
~ 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Good afternoon, 
Judge, Jack Goldberger and Robert Critton 
on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein. 
THE COURT: 
And I'm guessing that, 
Mr. Kuvin, if I grant the motion to unseal 
that which has been sealed, your motion to 
intervene will be moot. 
MR. KUVIN: 
Will be. 
THE COURT: 
I thought so. 
This is 
what I'm thinking and -- oh, we've got 
more. 
MS. BURNS: 
One more appearance, 
excuse me, Judge, Barbara Burns on behalf 
of the state of Florida, the state 
attorney's office of the 15th Judicial 
Circuit. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Procedurally, 
I think the way that this came to us is 
that at the conclusion or at some point 
during a plea conference between the state 
of Florida and Mr. Epstein, the state and 
the defense hand an agreed order to 
Judge Puccillo. 
MS. BURNS: 
Puccillo. 
THE COURT: 
And asked her to sign an 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
agreement to seal some portion of some 
documents, which she signed off on and now 
it is the intervener's and the Post's 
motion to unseal those documents; is that 
kind of procedurally where we are? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Procedurally not 
exactly correct, I don't know if you want 
me to clarify that. 
THE COURT: 
Please do. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, this 
started during the course of a plea 
colloquy in Mr. Epstein's state proceeding 
before Judge Puccillo, who is a retired 
senior judge who was filling in for 
Judge Mcsorley on that day, who was the 
judge assigned to this division. 
It was a 
plea agreement with the state attorney's 
office and it is normal and consistent with 
any plea colloquy Judge Puccillo asked the 
defense whether there were any other 
promises or inducements for Mr. Epstein to 
enter into his plea agreement other than 
what was contained in the state standard 
plea agreement that we had. 
I felt 
obligated under the circumstances to alert 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
to the Court that there was a confidential 
agreement between Mr. Epstein's 
Mr. Epstein's attorneys and the United 
States attorney's office for the Southern 
District of Florida which would have been 
triggered upon the successful taking of the 
plea by Judge Puccillo. 
In other words, if the plea was 
accepted by Judge Puccillo, there's a 
confidential agreement between U.S. 
attorney's office and the defense that 
would be triggered and they would agree not 
to take some actions against Mr. Epstein. 
I advised Judge Puccillo of that, and at 
that time she said she would like to see 
the matter sealed in the court file. 
I 
said fine, and then we later --
I then 
filed that document, and the clerk's office 
notified me and said we need an order 
sealing this, and we submitted an order to 
seal the document. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Is there 
anybody here from the U.S. attorney's 
office? 
Has anybody notified them, or is 
there a dog in this fight or do they care? 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
\., 
If they're a party to this confidential 
thing, wouldn't you think that they might 
be. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, they 
have been noticed. 
They have taken a 
position in parallel proceedings that this 
matter should remain confidential, and they 
have done that in federal court, and I 
believe that is their position still. 
MR. 
EDWARDS: 
Your Honor, I have been 
in communication with the U.S. attorney's 
office, and they are not taking a position 
on this issue, which is why they're not in 
court right now. 
THE COURT: 
What's going on in 
federal court? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
There are a number 
of civil cases that are pending right now. 
THE COURT: 
And they're talking about 
the same documents that are under seal here 
in our court? 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Yes. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes, your Honor, and 
I will address that at the appropriate time 
what's going on here. 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
THE COURT: 
All right. 
So thank you, 
Mr. Goldberger for getting that 
straightened out. 
MR. GERBER: 
one other point. 
Judge, just to clarify 
THE COURT: 
Sure. 
MR. GERBER: 
I think actually there's 
an additional step because Mr. Goldberger 
on behalf of Mr. Epstein or Mr. Critton I 
believe filed motion, and I think that that 
will tell us who goes first today and who 
has the burden today. 
THE COURT: 
This is -- and I'm 
thinking outloud that my take on that is 
that my review of the file shows that the 
appropriate steps to seal these documents 
wasn't followed initially. 
I'm looking at 
it as it would be whoever's moving to have 
them sealed, it's their burden to prove the 
steps that you have to prove to get things 
sealed by the Court, and so that's --
I 
hinted last meeting that we all had 
together but that's where I'd go, so I'd 
shift the burden over to the federal 
government and to Mr. Epstein, that's what 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
\., 
I'm thinking. 
Let me ask first go over to 
the Post, Ms. Shullman, what are your 
thoughts on that procedure? 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Your Honor, I think 
that's the correct procedure here. 
I think 
Mr. Epstein's motion to make court records 
confidential tacitly admits what we 
suspected last time, which was that the 
initial closure of the documents was not 
done pursuant to the acceptable procedures. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Mr. Berger, 
Mr. Edwards, that's all right with you? 
MR. EDWARDS: 
We agree. 
MR. GERBER: 
That's what my point 
was, yes, your Honor, thank you. 
THE COURT: 
you think? 
Mr. Goldberger, what do 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That's fine, your 
Honor, with the -- I'll wait until after 
the proceeding. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
You may 
proceed. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Judge, as I said to 
clarify the record, this matter started 
during the course of Mr. Epstein's plea 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
colloquy in state court and just so that 
the record was clear that all inducements 
for Mr. Epstein's plea was on the record 
when Judge Puccillo asked me if there had 
been any promises made to Mr. Epstein, I 
think properly and ethically we told the 
Court that there was an agreed --
confidential agreement with the federal 
government that was in place that basically 
said we will not prosecute Mr. Epstein for 
federal offenses if the state plea 
agreement is accepted by the Court and 
Mr. Epstein's sentence is imposed. 
The state proceeding was over at the 
time that I advised Judge Puccillo that, in 
other words, we had gone through the plea 
colloquy and I simply was advising her of 
this other agreement. 
It was 
Judge Puccillo who then asked us to 
approach, and the Court has a copy of that 
transcript, I believe. 
It was 
Judge Puccillo that said I'd like to have 
that document sealed in the court file, and 
I acquiesced to that, I said that's fine. 
So, first, as a preliminary matter, 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
'-' 
it wasn't like we were coming into court on 
that day and asking to seal something, so 
it would have been presumptuous of me to 
file something to request to have something 
sealed when it came up during the course of 
the proceeding, and, in fact, the committee 
notes on the rule of judicial 
administration talk about that and say 
matters come up all the time during the 
course of hearings and the fact that 
something is not filed in advance does not 
necessarily taint the entire process, so we 
agreed to come forward and file our motion 
to seal after the fact, because we didn't 
know this matter would be coming up. 
But having said that, Judge, this 
confidential agreement was not part of any 
state plea agreement, it's not part of the 
proceedings, it was ancillary to the state 
proceedings and it had nothing to do with 
the state proceedings. 
As an accommodation 
to Judge Puccillo, we filed it in the court 
file. 
Quite frankly, it's unnecessary, it 
doesn't need to be there, and the simplest 
approach would be to simply remove it from 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
the court file at this point. 
We didn't 
have for it to be there. 
It's not part of 
the plea, it's not part of the state 
resolution of the case, and that would be 
the simple logical approach to that. 
If the Court is inclined not do that 
or if the parties object to that, then I 
think we move onto some other very, very 
important issues in this case and for both 
the intervenors in this case as well as the 
Palm Beach Post motion for access to this 
proceeding for really two very, very 
significant reasons, they are in the wrong 
place and they're attempting to march up 
the wrong hill here, your Honor. 
This matter needs to -- has to be 
litigated in federal court before 
Judge Marra who has already heard hearings 
on this matter. 
Now, at our last 
abbreviated hearing two weeks ago, I told 
you for the first time that there have been 
two hearings in front of Judge Marra on 
this very issue, whether this 
nonprosecution agreement and that's the 
matter that is sealed in your court file, 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
whether this nonprosecution agreement 
should be released to the plaintiffs for 
their use. 
Judge Marra heard two hearings on 
this matter and the court has those orders. 
And in the first hearing Judge Marra very, 
very, carefully balanced the 
confidentiality issues of the 
nonprosecution agreement, the intent of the 
parties as well of the rules of criminal 
procedure that I will talk about in a 
moment, with the plaintiff's right to know 
what's going on and to have access to this 
agreement. 
And Judge Marra crafted an 
order and in the nature of a protective 
order and said, plaintiffs, you can have 
this nonprosecution agreement, you can use 
it, you can review it, you cannot give it 
to anyone else other than your clients, and 
if you want to use it or you want to give 
it to your clients, you need to tell them 
about this order that is not to be 
disclosed to anybody else. 
And these 
plaintiffs that are sitting here will tell 
you that from day one they have had this 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
nonprosecution agreement, they have it for 
their use, they know every clause that's in 
that nonprosecution agreement, and I 
suggest to the Court as to their motions 
why are we here; they have an agreement 
already. 
They went back to Judge Marra 
sometime thereafter and asked the Court to 
expand their use of the nonprosecution 
agreement, and they said, Judge Marra, we 
have the nonprosecution agreement but we 
would like to be able to disclose that 
agreement to other sides, and Judge Marra 
in another carefully crafted order said, 
nuh-uh, no, you have not satisfied your 
burden, you cannot disseminate this to 
anyone else, and the order that I have 
entered remains in place, but most 
significantly he said, you know what, this 
is without prejudice. 
If you have some basis, you have some 
need that you have not briefed, you have 
not litigated with me yet concerning 
dissemination of nonprosecution agreement, 
come back to me and I'll review it for you. 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
~ 
And they have every right to do so, and 
they have not done so, and it is this 
motion to intervene that they filed in this 
court is simply an effort to skirt and to 
avoid and to go behind the order of 
Judge Marra that dealt with this issue 
already. 
And I think just for the purpose of 
our hearing, we need to have the two orders 
of Judge Marra entered into the record of 
this proceeding. 
I know I gave copies to 
the Court, but I have additional copies. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, I 
believe there is no objection from either 
of the parties. 
THE COURT: 
Thank you so much. 
Let's 
go ahead and mark these as Defendant's 
Exhibits No. 1 and 2 for identification 
purposes. 
Anybody object to me taking 
judicial notice of Judge Marra's order? 
By 
hearing no objection, I'll go ahead and 
take judicial notice of it. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
So, your Honor, 
Judge Marra has dealt with this issue 
squarely, there's a procedure in place and

these matters should be litigated in front 
of the district court judge that has 
already heard these matters. 
THE COURT: 
Well, let's say that may 
be true as it relates to these individual 
plaintiffs in the federal litigation, what 
about the Post's and the press's -- the 
media's right to take a look at these 
things? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, and this 
is the second reason why not only the 
plaintiffs but the Post appear to be 
marching up the wrong hill here. 
The Palm 
Beach Post has filed a motion for access to 
these documents and they certainly do have 
first amendment rights and no one would 
dispute that they have first amendment 
rights to access to public records, 
however, most significantly in this case is 
that the nonprosecution agreement which we 
gave the court permission to review two 
weeks ago and presumably the Court has had 
an opportunity to take a look at it, the 
nonprosecution agreement talks about and 
relates to a grand jury matter that is

absolutely 100 percent protected from 
disclosure by Federal Rule of Criminal 
Procedure Six.

THE COURT: 
that, please. 
I have a copy of that rule 
Let me take a look of 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Give us one moment, 
your Honor, we have it here somewhere. 
MR. KUVIN: 
Your Honor, just briefly 
while they're looking on behalf of the 
plaintiff -
I just wanted to point out on 
my client motion to intervene, we are not 
party to the federal action. 
She only has 
a state court claim. 
She's not bound by 
any federal court order, she is not with 
the federal court on their claim, so as to 
that issue, my client stands here 
synonymous with the Post. 
THE COURT: 
that out to me. 
Thank you for pointing 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We'll have it for 
you in one moment, your Honor. 
Your Honor, Federal Rule of Criminal 
Procedure Six is a rule that deals with 
grand jury proceedings, and it confers in 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
the federal system secrecy of all grand 
jury matters and it's pretty clear in this 
case that the nonprosecution agreement 
specifically talks about a grand jury 
investigation of Mr. Epstein, there's 
specific reference to a grand jury 
investigation in the nonprosecution 
agreement. 
The rule does not prevent us from 
telling the Court that there was a grand 
jury investigation of Mr. Epstein, but what 
it prevents us from doing, what it prevents 
this Court from doing, I believe, is 
disclosing the content of the grand jury 
investigation, and the agreement itself is 
very specific as to the grand jury 
investigation of Mr. Epstein. 
However, all is not lost for the Palm 
Beach Post and the intervenors, for that 
matter. 
The rule has a specific procedure 
that allows you to go to the district court 
where the grand jury is convened, in this 
case it would be in the Southern District 
of Florida before Judge Marra and that is 
under Rule 6E, your Honor, I think it's 6E 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
~ 
3E actually. 
It says: 
In limited 
circumstances the Court may authorize 
disclosure of grand jury matters under 
request made in connection with the 
judicial proceeding, so -- and the rule 
goes onto clearly say, that request must be 
filed in the district where the grand jury 
is proceeding. 
So the first -- you know the Palm 
Beach Post may have first amendment rights 
to access but those first amendment rights 
cannot circumvent the federally protected 
secrecy of grand jury proceedings and 
that's what the Post is doing by making 
this request before this Court. 
This matter has been sealed for 
almost a year now, 11 months and some days 
and the Palm Beach Post has not filed 
anything in this matter until most 
recently, and their remedy is to go into 
the federal court and invoke the process of 
Rule Six and asked Judge Marra to make a 
limited disclosure of the nonprosecution 
agreement and the grand jury matters that 
are contained therein. 
Who knows whether 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
~ 
he will do it, but that's where this battle 
need to be fought. 
As a matter of comity, your Honor, 
this Court should defer to Judge Marra 
because, A, he has already ruled on the 
disclosure of the nonpros agreement, but 
even more importantly, the supremacy clause 
requires you to defer to the federal laws 
of criminal procedure that say these 
matters should be protected and should not 
be disclosed unless the district court says 
so. 
If the Court is going to go on and 
wants to go to the issues that would be 
contained if it were not dealing with a 
grand jury proceeding, obviously there's a 
test that the Court must then use under the 
Rules of Judicial Administration and it 
says matters can be sealed but they should 
be sealed if there's a compelling 
government interest or if the sealing is 
important to the administration of justice. 
There's a couple other criteria, but the 
ones obviously that would apply in this 
case are the compelling government 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

interest, and the importance to the 
administration of justice. 
Again, we are dealing with a secret 
grand jury matter. 
We cannot circumvent 
that secrecy by asking the Court to invoke 
its unsealing power. 
THE COURT: 
Thank you. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Thank you, your 
Honor.

wants to go first? 
Post, who 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Mr. Edwards. 
THE COURT: 
Mr. Edwards. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
Your Honor, inasmuch as 
Mr. Epstein is relying on Judge Marra's 
order to support the argument that the 
nonprosecution agreement needs to remain 
sealed, I'd like to address that if you are 
inclined to be persuaded by that argument 
at all. 
The orders that have now been moved 
into evidence are in case No. 80736, and 
just to put that order in context in 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
actuality, the order says -- specifically 
puts it back on this Court and confers 
authority on this Court over this 
particular document, when in the second 
page of the February 12th, 2009 order, it's 
misdated 2009 but it's a 2009 order, and 
the last two sentences read: 
If and when 
petitioners have a specific tangible need 
to be relieved of the restrictions, they 
should file an appropriate motion, which we 
believe we have done in this case, if a 
specific tangle need arises in the civil 
cases, which are in circuit court in Palm 
Beach County, then relief should be sought 
there and notice to all parties, so to give 
the Court context for that order, there was 
a state court plea taken June 30th, 2008, 
where Mr. Epstein pled guilty to the state 
court cases as it related to two victims. 
Now, parallel to that, there was an 
investigation in federal court where the 
United States attorney's office and the FBI 
had more than 30 victims of sex abuse of 
Mr. Epstein's and they were working with 
these girls and their cases. 
Now, several 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
~ 
of those girls came to me and said, hey, 
we're worried that there's a secret deal 
going on between Epstein and the U.S. 
attorney's office, so I filed an emergency 
petition against the U.S. attorney's office 
asking the federal court to intervene and 
get in the middle of this and not let this 
deal go forward without meaningfully 
conferring with these girls because I was 
alleging it violated the Crimes Victim's 
Rights Act; these girls have a right to be 
heard. 
That emergency motion was filed 
July 7th, 2008, and I have that for the 
Court, and I'd like to enter that into 
evidence as well. 
THE COURT: 
We'll mark that as -
Exhibit No. 1. 
MR. EDWARDS: 
And an emergency 
hearing was held four days later in front 
of Judge Marra, who was randomly assigned 
to this case at the time the plea was taken 
and the prosecution agreement was sealed. 
Judge Marra had nothing to do with the 
agreement, with Epstein, he didn't know 
anything about it. 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
~ 
So four days later now we're in front 
of him and the United States attorney's 
office says for the first time, sorry, 
girls, you are too late, the deal has 
already been done as to all of your federal 
cases and it resulted in the nonprosecution 
agreement that is attached in the state 
court case. 
Judge Marra turned to us and 
said, what is your remedy. 
At that point in time I said we don't 
know because we don't know what protections 
are inside that agreement, so we want you 
to unseal it, that's where the motion for 
protective order came about where he gave 
us the agreement so we can look at it and 
determine what remedy, if any, was 
available. 
Once we had that agreement 
under the caveat that we were not able to 
disseminate to third parties and reviewed 
it and saw there is very little protection 
for the girls, we asked to unseal it 
completely, so that we can talk to third 
parties, to victim's rights groups and get 
some insight as to what our possible remedy 
would be. 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
\. 
And so our reason for wanting him to 
unseal it at that time was we want to be 
able to talk to other people, and that's 
where this order from February 12th, 2009, 
came in, and he denied that motion to 
unseal it for three reasons. 
First and foremost, this 
nonprosecution agreement was not sealed in 
my Court, you are talking to the wrong 
judge, you need to go back, so we're 
getting the back and forth here and it's 
not in my court, I can't mess with some 
other judge's order. 
Obviously, there was 
a hearing held and that document was sealed 
for a reason, I'm not privy for those 
reasons, so I'm not going to override 
whatever that judge was thinking when they 
sealed that document. 
Second, your reason is you just want 
to talk to other people about them, and if 
I'm going to override some other judge's 
order, I need to have a more compelling 
reason than you just want to talk to people 
about. 
Third, if and when a specific need 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
arises in any of the civil cases, which by 
the time this order was coming about they 
were stacking up in state and federal court 
against Mr. Epstein, petition that court, 
petition the appropriate court, and he 
implies that appropriate court is this 
court where it was initially sealed, which 
we've done in this case. 
This court has none of the problems 
that Judge Marra had in that it was sealed 
in this courtroom. 
We have noticed 
Mr. Epstein to be heard at this hearing, 
which is one of the requirements that 
Judge Marra placed on us, and a specific 
need has arisen. 
It has been sealed for 
over a year now, correct, Mr. Goldberger is 
correct, but the specific need is arising 
because we are in the middle of discovery. 
And this document is, as Mr. Goldberger 
said, a great inducement to Mr. Epstein 
pleaing guilty to sex crimes in state 
court, and to ultimately being labeled a 
sex offender, and the only document that 
pertains to my clients, my client as a 
victim of Mr. Epstein's sex crime, so at

THE COURT: 
I haven't considered your 
motion to intervene yet. 
MR. KUVIN: 
I don't believe it was an 
objection. 
When it was filed, there was no 
objection by Mr. Goldberger or Mr. Critton. 
THE COURT: 
Are you going to advocate 
by motion to intervene or are you going to 
be jumping into the merits of the sealing? 
MR. 
KUVIN: 
I'll jump right into the 
merits, I'm not going to duplicate anything 
that was just raised or anything that the 
press is going to raise, I have an 
individual interest. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Go ahead 
Mr. Kuvin. 
MR. KUVIN: 
Very briefly, your Honor. 
I represent. who has filed only a state 
court action, she is not under the federal 
jurisdiction of Judge Marra, she does not 
subject herself to the federal jurisdiction 
of Judge Marra, she was never provided an 
opportunity to brief any issues before 
Judge Marra with respect to that order that 
was entered by Judge Marra or either order. 
In addition, what's also very important is 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
she has never seen this document, so she 
does not know what is in the contents of 
the order, so the issue is raised by 
Mr. Goldberger about the girls are able to 
see the document and evaluate how they 
might need to evaluate this document does 
not apply to my client because she has 
never seen it and, frankly, without 
subjecting herself voluntarily to the 
jurisdiction of Judge Marra, which she 
chooses not to do, then she cannot get this 
document, otherwise she would have to go to 
federal court, submit herself to the 
jurisdiction of the federal court to then 
see a state court document, which does not 
make any sense because if it is a state 
court document in state court, as 
previously stated under Judge Marra's 
order, it is within your purview and your 
jurisdiction to rule on a state court 
document. 
Finally, with respect to why the 
document may be relevant, the contents of 
that document speak to the issues of 
whether or not Mr. Epstein can or cannot

assert his fifth amendment right against 
self incrimination, and we believe on a 
good faith believe that on the contents of 
that document speak to the issues of 
whether or not he can or cannot deny the 
claims that have been brought against him 
both in state and federal court. 
In other 
words, whether or not he must, in fact, 
admit that he molested these 14 year old 
girls, so, therefore, the content of that 
document is paramount as to the issues in 
the civil proceedings that are currently 
pending in state court which is why we 
would like that document.

MS. SHULLMAN: 
Thank you, your Honor. 
I feel a little bit like I have stepped 
into the twilight zone here, so I'd like to 
address a couple of the things we've 
addressed and get us to what we are really 
here to do today. 
THE COURT: 
I don't know if you are 
referring specifically to the courtroom or 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

~ 
the convoluted situation that brings us to 
the courtroom. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Just this whole 
federal state situation. 
There is no hill 
for the public and the press to march up in 
Judge Marra's court as Mr. Edwards pointed 
out, Judge Marra has specifically held the 
agreement was not filed in this case under 
seal or otherwise, so were I to march into 
Judge Marra's courtroom and do my whole 
public access spiel, he would say take it 
to you, your Honor, because it's not a 
record in my court. 
It is a record here, 
and in the state court as we talked about 
the last time, we were here, there's a 
presumption of openness. 
The burden is on 
Mr. Epstein to overcome that presumption. 
While he filed a very brief memorandum 
after our last hearing, which identified 
for interest, he has by no means met the 
test of either establishing those interest 
or establishing the remainder of that test 
which would be that closures no broader 
than necessary ineffective no other 
reasonable alternatives, so if I could, I'd 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
~ 
like to sort of focus us back to the 
inquiry we're here to make today in this 
court, and that is whether your Honor is 
going to provide public access to two 
records that are, I think, indisputably in 
your Honor's court file in this court's 
file. 
It's a plea agreement and an 
addendum; those are historically and 
typically open records. 
Mr. Goldberger mentioned that the 
plea agreement was sort of incidentally 
filed in this court file, and that it was 
sort of an afterthought that happened. 
He 
never came into court intending that it 
even be part of the court file, but 
Judge Pucillo specifically said, this is a 
significant inducement to accepting the 
plea in my court. 
This agreement that you 
have with federal prosecutors is 
significantly the reason why you're 
entering this plea before me. 
And she took 
those records into the court file 
presumably because they are significant to 
this litigation. 
Even if there was an 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
~ 
incidental filing, which cannot possibly be 
the case here, there is no mechanism in 
Florida law to call a Mulligan and to pull 
it out of the court file. 
As you know, the 
Floridians have a constitutional right of 
access, there's no mechanism in that law to 
just say, oopsy, let's take it out of the 
file, so they have to meet their burden and 
they have to show under Rule 2.420 that one 
of those interests is satisfied. 
They have 
identified four here. 
I have not heard 
them discuss them at any great length. 
But 
I will go through them quickly. 
The imminent threat to the fair, 
impartial orderly administration of 
justice, or to protect a compelling 
government interest. 
As your Honor is 
aware, the federal government is not here 
today. 
I have spoken with the state 
attorney's office who has indicated that 
their only interest is in protecting to the 
extent necessary because I've not seen 
these documents the identity of the victims 
of these crimes. 
The Post in its motion to intervene 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
has already set forth that we have no 
objection to redacting the victim's names 
if, in fact, that is required because we 
haven't seen the agreement. 
To avoid 
substantial injury to innocent third 
parties, again, absolutely no showing on 
that test. 
I have no burden at this point, 
but I will simply state that the law in 
Florida is clear that Mr. Epstein doesn't 
have standing to assert that interest. 
And, finally, something else I heard 
nothing about to avoid substantial injury 
to a party which, I guess, presumably would 
be Mr. Epstein by disclosure of matters 
protected by a privacy right not generally 
inherent in this specific type of 
proceedings. 
Again, I have not heard any 
attempt to meet the burden on that issue, 
however, Florida law is equally clear that 
participants in crimes lose their privacy 
interest in the matters and facts and 
circumstances of the commission of those 
crimes, so Mr. Epstein surely cannot 
establish that there is a separate privacy 
interest not inherent in a criminal 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
prosecution regarding the molestation of 
young girls. 
The circumstances under which closure 
is allowed in Florida are exceedingly 
narrow. 
We first -- and before we do 
anything else -- have to find that one of 
those interests is met here, that it exists 
and that the movant has met its burden in 
demonstrating that it's significant enough 
to require the court to consider closure. 
That's not the end of inquiry. 
And, of 
course, I have not yet heard anything else 
about that second half of the test which 
talks about the idea that closure is no 
broader than necessary to protect that 
interest and that it would be effective and 
that there are no other alternatives. 
In speaking of the federal litigation 
there are instances when both Mr. Epstein's 
lawyers and the federal prosecutors have 
placed portions of the agreement into the 
public court file. 
There are -- thus 
attempts to seal those records in the 
federal litigation have been unsuccessful, 
so part of this agreement the cat is 
SUSAN WIGGINS,

already out of the bag. 
But there is also 
an enormous public interest in what's going 
on here, apart from the idea that this man 
is accused of having many, many victims who 
were all young children which, of course, 
in itself creates a lot of public concern, 
the chief of police at the time sent a 
letter to the state prosecutors and said, 
what are you guys doing, how are you 
handling this, this is highly unusual; I 
don't like what I'm seeing here. 
And even 
went so far as to say, state attorney's 
office, should you all step away from this 
case. 
So we have public interest from the 
perspective of the police chief questioning 
the state attorney's office about whether 
it's doing its job. 
We have public 
interest that's spurned by the idea that 
some of the victims in the federal 
prosecution -- in the federal court claimed 
they weren't aware of it, we just heard 
Mr. Edwards talk about the fact that his 
clients weren't aware of the agreement 
unless it all went down, so we have a 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
significant public interest about how 
everybody in this litigation is doing their 
job. 
There is nothing more fundamentally 
important than the ability of the public 
and the press to observe how its 
government, all branches of its government, 
do its job. 
There are multiple, as Mr. Edwards 
also mentioned, multiple civil lawsuits 
that have spurned as a result of 
Mr. Epstein's conduct, and, again, the 
public has an interest in what's going on 
in civil litigation matters. 
In short, this matter involves a 
major public interest from a lot of 
different levels. 
There is no basis for 
closure that has been asserted here. 
It's 
a heavy burden to meet. 
We start with the 
idea that openness is the right thing to do 
but there is essentially no purpose served 
at this point by keeping these agreements 
sealed in this case. 
Unless your Honor has any questions, 
I think that's it.

evaluations. 
Number one, does the document, in 
fact, have a relationship to the criminal 
case in the state matter. 
And, number two, 
evaluate the right of public access versus 
the victim's right to confidentiality. 
If 
this Court does decide to unseal those 
records, then the State would ask that this 
Court before making the document public 
access, then make certain that in place is 
that the victim's identities are amended to 
initials if their names are used. 
The State does have a concern 
regarding the argument of the Federal Rule 
Six in that is this Court bound by a 
federal rule which perhaps has been made 
unenforcible by virtue of making it a part 
of the state file, so I think the Court 
also would need to address that issue 
before making its ruling.

learned in the law school that the 
supremacy clause controls and to the extent 
there's a conflict between the federal 
doctrine and the state doctrine, the 
supremacy clause requires the federal rule 
of law to apply and to control. 
And 
certainly in this case you cannot use a 
state procedure to circumvent a federal 
rule of criminal procedure that confers 
secrecy to a grand jury proceeding. 
And the Palm Beach Post response to 
the argument never made note of the grand 
jury rule, they simply avoided that issue 
and that in our mind is equally important 
as the fact in the interest of comity this 
Court should defer to the rulings of 
Judge Marra already.

~ 
As to Mr. Kuvin's argument that he 
has a client that is in state court and is 
not in federal court and therefore he 
doesn't have a remedy in federal court. 
With all due respect to Mr. Kuvin, that's 
similarly wrong. 
Judge Marra's order 
specifically dealt with a class of 
individuals who were identified as victims 
of Mr. Epstein's conduct, and Judge Marra's 
order says that anyone who's been 
identified by the United States attorney's 
office as a victim has right to the 
nonprosecution agreement under the same 
rules. 
Just so the Court understands, I know 
we are talking like the Court understands 
everything about this case. 
There was a 
list of victims that was created at the 
time that the nonprosecution agreement was 
entered into and Mr. Kuvin's client is on 
that list. 
That list was created by the 
U.S. attorney's office. 
He has the same 
rights to the nonprosecution agreement as 
if he filed this case in federal court and 
he knows that we've told him that he has

that access. 
As to the fact that the 
nonprosecution agreement is presumably not 
filed in the federal case in our last 
hearing in front of Judge Marra on June 5th 
-- I'm sorry, June 12th, Mr. Edwards 
advised Judge Marra that he had, in fact, 
filed a nonprosecution agreement to no 
one's surprise under seal in the federal 
file, so the nonprosecution agreement 
according to Mr. Edwards' declaration at 
that hearing is contained in the federal 
court system. 
For all of those reasons, your Honor, 
and the reasons that I previously indicated 
to the Court, we would ask the Court to 
defer to the federal court in this matter. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Thank you very 
much. 
Here is what I'm planning on doing, 
so you know where I'm going on this. 
I'll 
make an oral announcement and I'll follow 
it up with a written order so that you all 
can have something to take to wherever you 
want to take it. 
I find that the appropriate procedure 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
to seal or close these documents has not 
been met, so I'll deny the motion to seal 
the documents. 
I'll grant the motion to 
unseal them. 
I will take a look at the 
documents. 
I will redact out of them 
the -- what I'll do is, I'll leave the 
originals intact sealed in the court file 
to protect the names of any underage 
victims. 
I will make copies of those. 
I'll 
redact out the names leaving -- expose the 
initials of any of the individuals. 
I'll 
get that done -- I'll get my written order 
out granting and denying the respective 
motions hopefully by the end of today. 
If 
not today, tomorrow. 
I plan on releasing 
the redacted versions probably Monday, so 
that those will be available for public 
consumption on Monday. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor, thank 
you. 
Thank you for the oral pronouncement. 
Your Honor, based on the Court's ruling, we 
do have a motion to stay disclosure of the 
nonprosecution agreement. 
The rules of 
appellate procedure require us to file that 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

before, your Honor. 
Your Honor, we do intend to take 
certiorari on this to the Fourth District 
Court. 
THE COURT: 
That's why I figure 
between the written rule and the disclosure 
give you a chance to catch your breath and 
do that. 
I guess you might want that. 
Monday 5 p.m. enough time for you to get 
over to the DCA? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Actually, your 
Honor, the Rule of Appellate Procedure 
maintains jurisdiction with you on this 
matter to entertain the motion to stay. 
Is 
THE COURT: 
So I need to handle the 
motion to stay? 
MR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
Correct, your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Do you want to argue that 
now? 
Do you want to take a look at that, 
catch your breath, come back and see me 
Monday sometime; what's your pleasure? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
We're ready to do it 
now, your Honor.

your thoughts. 
We're ready to do it now. 
All right.

MR. KUVIN: 
Matter of procedure 
point, I just want to make sure that the 
motion to intervene is, in fact, granted. 
THE COURT: 
You' re -
motion to 
intervene is granted. 
Do you have a 
written order for me to sign off on there? 
MR. KUVIN: 
I can submit that. 
THE COURT: 
Why don't you catch your 
breath and come back tomorrow and I'll hear 
argument. 
It will give me a chance to read 
the motion, check out the rules, take a 
look, got to get myself gassed up. 
Anybody 
want to drop anything off for me to read 
before the hearing, please do that. 
Why 
don't we do that tomorrow morning, and why 
don't we reconvene here tomorrow at 1:30 on 
the motion to stay. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
That's fine. 
THE COURT: 
How does your schedule 
look? 
MR. GERBER: 
Your Honor, is it 
possible to have it a little later, perhaps 
an hour later tomorrow? 
THE COURT: 
2:30. 
MR. GERBER: 
If possible.

How about a little later 
than that still, let me take a look at our 
official calendaring system here. 
MR. 
CRITTON: 
Judge Colbath, I'm gone 
tomorrow, I'm going to Gainesville at one 
or 12:30-ish. 
home at one. 
I told my wife I would be 
My daughter's birthday, 21, 
she's having a party, I plan to be there. 
Can we do it tomorrow morning any time, it 
would be great. 
THE COURT: 
Tomorrow morning is ugly. 
This isn't going to take long. 
MS. BURNS: 
This is a five-minute 
motion. 
THE COURT: 
Why don't we do this, 
meet at 8:15?

going to be able to get my kids to school 
if I have to be here at 8:15.

I don't mean to jump

I wonder if we can do some of this 
telephonically.

Yes, I can appear by 
phone or I can have one of my partners.

THE COURT: 
In the morning what would 
be a good start time for you? 
MS. SHULLMAN:

I can't drop them off before eight. 
THE COURT: 
It's going to be brief 
argument, let's do it 9:00 tomorrow 
morning; 9:00 work for you? 
MR. CRITTON: 
Yes, sir. 
Thank you. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Just very briefly, 
the Court is going to look at the 
nonprosecution agreement and do some 
redacting, I believe. 
I just need to 
advise the court in addition to Mr. Epstein 
and perhaps victims mention the 
nonprosecution agreement, there are third 
parties who the Court needs to look about 
redacting their names also, and that's 
contained in the nonprosecution agreement. 
In other words, there are other 
people beside Mr. Epstein and Mr. Victims 
whose names are mentioned in the 
nonprosecution agreement, and I would ask 
the Court to look at those names also for 
the purpose of redacting. 
THE COURT: 
I'll like a look. 
SUSAN WIGGINS, 
R.P.R. AND OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

MR. 
EDWARDS: 
Your Honor, those are 
not names of victims, those are 
co-conspirators as listed in the agreement 
and we would object to any redaction of 
those names. 
I don't think there's any 
standing to ask for that. 
THE COURT: 
I'll take a look. 
All 
right. 
See you all tomorrow morning at 
nine. 
If you want to send anything to me 
later this afternoon or tomorrow morning 
before we take the bench, I'm happy to 
receive it. 
Have a good afternoon.

That's it, it's a wrap. 
THE COURT: 
Okay. 
Orders. 
Who's not 
here that I have to mail it to? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Mr. Edwards is not

Mr. Berger, 
Mr. Edwards. 
Did I give you enough copies

I have 
just enough. 
Do you want me to get a copy

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Thank you, your 
Honor.

Mr. Critton. 
MR. CRITTON: 
Good morning, Judge 
Colbath, do you have a copy of our Motion 
SUSAN S. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

\., 
to Stay? 
THE COURT: 
I do, the one that was 
handed up to me yesterday? 
MR. CRITTON: 
Yes, sir, and I have a 
proposed order in the event the Court 
chooses to grant; may I provide that to the 
Court as well? 
Your Honor, as you know, 
Mr. Goldberger and I represent Mr. Epstein. 
We have hired Ms. Walsh and Ms. Compiani as 
appellate counsel to assist in the filing 
of a writ of certiorari. 
I know that comes 
as no surprise to the Court in that whoever 
prevailed and lost yesterday, I think the 
Court recognized we probably filed a writ 
of certiorari. 
THE COURT: 
Let me ask real quick. 
Anybody objecting to the defendant having 
the ability to have my decision reviewed by 
the appellate court before I release these 
things? 
I mean, it seems pretty straight 
forward. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
We have an objection, 
your Honor, to some extent. 
The -- you 
know, the procedure in place here is very 
SUSAN S. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
similar to that for which they would have 
to obtain a preliminary injunction. 
THE COURT: 
Right. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
So to demonstrate 
likelihood of success and irreparable harm, 
I don't think they can do that. 
I think 
the plan that you put in -- proposed 
yesterday is a good one, that is you redact 
and you release on Monday and that gives 
them today and Monday to get to the Fourth, 
otherwise, we're stuck in a position where 
we have a 30-day window to appeal, and we 
are all delay, delay, delay. 
THE COURT: 
What if I do that? 
I 
don't know if it's a difference with that 
or distinction, but, procedurally, I was 
thinking I was leaning yesterday towards 
issuing the order that I just issued. 
I 
think that that's a fairly accurate 
rendition of the written version of my oral 
pronouncement yesterday, but I order that 
nothing -- that the redacted orders not be 
released until -- I'll make it, you know, 
five of five Monday. 
That will give you 
Monday to get down to the Fourth to get 
SUSAN s. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
them to stop this from being released; what 
do you think? 
MR. CRITTON: 
Here's what the problem 
is, Judge, is Ms. Compiani and Ms. Walsh 
spoke to them yesterday and today, we need 
a transcript from the hearing yesterday 
which has not yet been obtained. 
They need 
the underlying motions, they need some time 
to research. 
It's not a matter of simply 
filing a writ of petition and that stays 
the release of the order. 
There would have 
to be a separate motion that would be filed 
with the Appellate Court. 
The Motion to 
Stay that we file under Appellate Rule 
9.310, subsection A, it provides that the 
party that seeks review shall come to the 
lower tribal, which is the trial court, 
which is you, in this instance, and then 
it's within your discretion either to stay 
or not to stay under the circumstances, and 
we simply don't have the time within which 
to file the appeal under those 
circumstances. 
There are two criteria that have 
to be met here, one is the likelihood of 
SUSAN s. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
harm where no stay is granted, and the 
second criteria, not necessary mutually 
exclusive; that is, you don't have to have 
both of them, but you certainly have to 
give an indicia of both of them. 
The 
second one is the likelihood of success on 
the merits. 
We believe that based upon the 
Court decision, respectfully, that the 
Court, that the Appellate Court, will quash 
your order, for the reasons Judge Puccillo 
was the one who requested that the document 
in this -- this was argued yesterday, so 
I'm going to be very brief. 
She is the one 
who requested post sentencing, that the 
document be filed under seal. 
It was her 
request that the defense seceded to that 
under the circumstances. 
That certainly 
was inadvertent, could have just as easily 
remained under seal with Mr. Goldberger or 
with the State Attorney under those 
circumstances. 
Secondly, that it relates to the 
portions of it, specifically, within the 
MPA to deal with the grand jury proceeding, 
SUSAN S. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
~ 
that would be a violation of Federal Rule 
Six. 
I note you just handed us your order 
about two minutes ago, Judge, so no one's 
had an opportunity to review it, certainly 
appellate counsel has not had an 
opportunity to review it. 
I don't know if 
you dealt with the appellate rule, but I do 
note that within your written order, that 
you, basically, said that in the second to 
last page, you said this order is no way to 
be interpreted as permission not to comply 
with U.S. District Court Judge Marra's 
previous orders. 
We respectfully submit that it would 
not comply with Judge Marra's previously 
issued orders. 
We also believe that the 
supremacy clause, as Mr. Goldberger argued 
yesterday in conjunction with comity 
principle, that we think that there's a 
substantial likelihood on success of the 
merits on this. 
With regard to the likelihood of 
harm, this is a paramount issue here. 
It's 
undisputed that this was a confidential 
agreement. 
It's a confidential contract 
SUSAN S. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
between Mr. Epstein and the United States. 
United States vigorously defended 
Mr. Edwards when he came into federal court 
and filed an action to have the MPA 
released, Judge Marra subsequently entered 
an order. 
Another attempt that was made to 
make the MPA public again. 
All plaintiffs' counsel has it. 
The only ones that don't have it is the 
Post, under the circumstances, and public 
under the circumstances, but all the 
plaintiffs' lawyers of the alleged victims, 
they either have the MPA and the addendum, 
which I will refer to as the MPA, or they 
have the ability to get that. 
That is very 
clear from Judge Marra's order. 
So there's certainly no harm to 
the plaintiffs from under these 
circumstances. 
And the harm in this 
instance is only to Mr. Epstein under the 
circumstances because as Judge Letz 
(phonetic) once said, it's very much like 
an attorney/client privilege or a privilege 
document where once the proverbial horse is 
out of the barn, you can't get him back in. 
SUSAN S. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
We cited a case called Mariner versus 
Baker 3 -- So. 39, So.2d 608 First District 
1989. 
In the Mariner case, this was not a 
usual incident report and the Court, I know 
your Honor previously did a great deal of 
personal injury work and related work, 
you're very familiar. 
In fact, you 
commented yesterday and said, I don't see 
how the MPA is going to be admissible in a 
civil proceeding anyway. 
Again, you're not 
ruling on that ultimately, the judges in 
both the State and federal court cases will 
do that. 
In the Mariner case, the judge 
ordered that the defendants object at the 
direction of incident reports. 
The judge 
said, sorry, you've got to produce those 
incident reports. 
And the Court said, give 
them to me under seal because, again, we 
are talking about incident reports as 
distinct from an agreement between two 
parties which was deemed to be confidential 
between the United States government and 
Mr. Epstein. 
Only irreparable harm here as 
to Mr. Epstein because if it's released, 
SUSAN s. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
you cannot remedy that harm on appeal. 
And in the Mariner case, if the judge 
said, if you put the documents under seal, 
which is exactly the situation we have now 
is, I will grant the stay and let the 
appellate court determine whether or not 
incident reports, which have a much lower 
threshold for production or for discovery 
reasons, and, again, there's no harm in an 
instance like that, even in an incident 
report came out in the Mariner cases, so 
what. 
It won't be used, you can't use any 
of the information you obtained. 
In this 
particular instance, because it is 
confidential, there is no way the Court can 
remedy the harm. 
With regard to the defendants in this 
case, again, I think we've demonstrated 
both irreparable harm, and we believe a 
substantial likelihood on the success. 
Again, how do you demonstrate a substantial 
likelihood on the success? 
The fact that 
we would -- if this Court thought that we 
should prevail, my guess, you would not 
have ruled as you did, but as the Court is 
SUSAN S. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
aware, oh, surprise to all of the lawyers 
here. 
Sometimes judges get reversed. 
I 
know that's a shock to most of the lawyers 
in this room and most of the courts, but 
that happens on occasion, and, therefore, 
we believe we can show through the 
supremacy clause, the grand jury reference 
that we will prevail and that your order 
will be quashed. 
With regard to alleged harm by any 
other party, the Post in this instance 
reported at the sentencing of Mr. Epstein 
on or about June 30th of 2008. 
They waited 
until June 1st of '09. 
This was such a 
pressing issue, the Post wanted to get this 
desperately out to the public, they were so 
anxious to do it, that they waited 11 
months before they did anything. 
Mr. Edwards, who is not here 
today, filed a federal court action and 
those issues were talked about and 
discussed at some length with regard to 
Judge Marra's two orders. 
Judge Marra's rule, you can't get 
them, if you want to get them, go to that 
SUSAN S. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
case, that would be Judge Hafele or two of 
Mr. Edwards' cases are where is Mr. Kuvin's 
case is or Judge Marra, where Mr. Edwards' 
case is. 
Judge Marra can certainly control 
whether or not they should be released, and 
I've covered Mr. 
oh, and Mr. Edwards 
because he could have gone back to Judge 
Marra because he's got one federal court 
case -- did he try for that form and get 
it 
no, they came in here. 
He tried to 
do it in a run around Judge Marra. 
He didn't file his motion until 
late May of '09. 
My guess is it was 
Mr. Edwards who probably said to the Post, 
gee, why don't you join in this, you 
haven't been here for 11 months, why don't 
you come in now, maybe intervene. 
And then 
Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, 1111 
estate court case, came in on June 11th, 
again, almost a year to the date after 
Mr. Epstein's sentence. 
It's no burning issue, there's no 
fire here to put out, giving us 30 days, or 
at least a reasonable period of time to 
file petition for writ, and then if the 
SUSAN s. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
Court denies our stay at least asking the 
appellate court for stay under the 
circumstances. 
There's no harm to them. 
The harm is only to Mr. Epstein, and we 
think as a substantial likelihood, that we 
would succeed. 
Therefore, we would request the 
Court grant a stay as I've suggested in my 
proposed order for 30 days of giving 
Ms. Walsh and Ms. Compiani an opportunity 
to actually do their job under the 
circumstances, so the court reporter 
doesn't have to work over the weekend to 
expedite transcripts for us, and secondly, 
if we file within the 30 days, then let the 
appellate court determine whether or not 
the stay remains or not. 
THE COURT: 
Thank you much. 
Ms. Shullman, don't worry about 
responding to the issue of motive or 
seeking this relief or the timing of your 
request or party's request. 
I don't think 
that bears upon the merits of either 
parties. 
MS. SHULLMAN:

provision, your Honor. 
THE COURT: 
Well, go ahead. 
Let me 
hear -- I'm on board so far with 
Mr. Critton's version of, Judge, if you let 
it out, you let it out, so irreparable harm 
is kind of easy. 
two-prong test. 
I think that it is a 
I think he's got to jump 
over both hurdles. 
I think he's got to 
show some likelihood of success. 
If you 
want to spend some energy arguing that 
there's no irreparable harm, you may do so, 
but if I hand it out today and everybody 
gets to see it, you can't fix that 
tomorrow. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Sure. 
THE COURT: 
So I think they've 
established that. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Let me address that 
very briefly first, your Honor, to remind 
you in meeting this burden that they failed 
to meet yesterday, they identified four 
interests which they liken now to the 
motion to stay to the four harms. 
One, of -- for the first three of 
SUSAN s. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

them, they mentioned they have no standing 
to assert the compelling government 
interest, the government didn't show up, 
the imminent threat to the administration 
of justice, again, that's the government's 
issue. 
The innocent third party privacy 
rights, they have no standing. 
The only 
one is, he's not really articulated today 
it's some sort of invasion of Mr. Epstein's 
privacy rights. 
Florida law is clear that those 
who are participants in crimes do not have 
privacy rights with respect to the facts 
and circumstances surrounding those crimes. 
So unless I'm going hear something outside 
of the context of Mr. Epstein's criminal 
prosecution, he has no privacy right in 
this agreement. 
THE COURT: 
Let me share with you 
what I'm thinking about doing, even at the 
conclusion of Mr. Critton's presentation, 
and that is deny the motion to stay, but 
delay the release of the records in 
question until noon Friday. 
That will give 
them a little bit of time to see if the

\,, 
Fourth sees this case from a different 
vantage point, a different light, and maybe 
they'll look down and say, oh, Judge 
Colbath, you missed it and, you know, stay 
the matter. 
That will give them a 
reasonable amount of time to get the 
transcripts to go to the Fourth because I'm 
a big fan of appellate review and making 
case law. 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
And I understand, your 
Honor, if you are suggesting a week from 
today, that's a little bit long. 
Remember 
the status quo here, we are in sort of a 
strange procedural posture because your 
Honor decided that the initial closure was 
improper, but the recent request for 
closure was denied, so instead of a status 
quo where we have a document that should be 
released, it's under seal where it 
shouldn't be, so any moment that it is kept 
under seal is a serious deprivation of the 
public and the press's right to access, 
which you have already determined they 
have, we think you are correct, of course, 
so I would ask that any stay --

MR. CRITTON: 
She's pandering, your 
Honor. 
MS. SHULLMAN:

respectfully disagreed with you, so I think 
a week is too long.

these matters in my career.

necessary. 
I think, in fact, it under

THE COURT: 
All right. 
Any other 
respondents want to go anything further? 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
The State Attorney's 
office also advises me that Friday is a 
holiday and the courts are closed. 
THE COURT: 
Thank you for telling me 
that. 
Friday is a holiday. 
MR. KUVIN: 
July 4th. 
THE COURT: 
The day of the birth of 
our constitution. 
MR. KUVIN: 
Good morning, your Honor. 
On behalf of intervenor 1111 obviously, the 
Court is inclined to delay the disclosure 
SUSAN s. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
of this, but under Rule 9.310, if your 
Honor were to issue such a stay, we would 
point out the provision C of the rule, 
which requires a posting of the bond. 
We not only agree with your Honor's 
ruling, but we believe such appeal they are 
filing is absolutely frivolous and we are 
going to be requesting fees and cost for 
the filing of that appeal, so as a result, 
we are requesting a bond be posted if a 
stay of any type is issued in this case 
because of the fact that we want to make 
sure that our attorneys' fee and costs are 
covered for the frivolous nature of the 
appeal. 
And it's dictated strictly in 
subsection A. 
It gives the Court the 
authority. 
It says: 
A stay pending review may be 
conditioned upon a good and sufficient 
bond, other conditions or both. 
Therefore, 
we believe your Honor does have the 
authority to issue such a requirement that 
the posting of a bond be issued. 
THE COURT: 
All right. 
Thank you 
very much. 
I will deny the motion to stay. 
SUSAN S. WIGGINS. R.P.R. and OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
I will delay the release of the documents 
until noon Thursday. 
I will deny the 
request to compel the movant, the 
defendant, Mr. Epstein, to post a bond, and 
I'll let the appellate court tell us and 
teach us what the law on this case will be. 
It's always interesting how these 
cases unfold and come to us a little 
different than everyone else. 
Now, let me 
have the attorneys come up here and 
approach. 
(The following proceedings were held 
sidebar, out of the hearing of the jury.) 
THE COURT: 
I reviewed the two 
documents, I didn't see any kids' names in 
there. 
Everybody was hinting the 
children's names or the initials' names. 
I 
had my big black highlighter out, I don't 
see anything worth redacting, so. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
It's the plaintiff's 
document that identifies the children's 
names. 
It's a letter to me actually. 
THE COURT: 
I was wondering if 
everybody thought there was something in 
there that wasn't in there.

MR. CRITTON: 
It's a test of your

THE COURT:

One is page one through seven, and the 
second one is just two pages that's not

MR. GOLDBERGER: 
While we're all up 
here chatting, there are references to 
other names up here. 
THE COURT: 
Yes, Mr. Goldberger, and 
no one has identified in the document says 
these are people that are not going to be

that these are co-conspirators.

("'"J 
INTERVENER'S RESPONSE TO MOTION TO STAY 
AND SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
COMES NOW, Intervener,~ and files this Response to Defendant Jeffrey Epstein's 
Motion to Stay, and states: 
In their motion, Defendant asks the Court to stay its ruling on the production of the NP A 
agreement pending review by the Fourth DCA. Since this NPA was never properly sealed in the 
first place, a Stay is improper because this document is a public record until such time as it has 
been properly sealed. Furthermore, as Defendant EPSTEIN has failed to demonstrate that he is 
likely to succeed on the merits of his appeal or describe how he will be banned by this 
disclosure, Intervenerllll respectfully requests the Court deny their Motion. 
Pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.3I0(a), a trial court has the discretion 
to enter a stay pending interlocutory review of a non-final order. The burden to satisfy the 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
..,.,. 
i 
requirements for a stay rests with the party requesting the stay. A trial ~ourt is not obligated, or 
even encouraged, to enter such a stay as the Appellate Rules specifically provide, "In the absence 
of a stay, during the pendency of a review of a non-final order, the lower tribunal may proceed 
with all matten, including trial or final hearing; provided that the lower tribunal may not render 
a final order disposing of the cause pending such review." Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(f) (emphasis 
added). 
Defendants ask the Court to stay disclosure of a public document which was never 
properly sealed. Factors to be considered by a court when deciding whether to enter a stay 
"include the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits, and the likelihood of hann 
should a stay not be granted." Perez v. Perez, 769 So.2d 389, 391 n.4 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999). 
Defendants fail to adequately address these factors in their motion. 
In fact, Defendant 
completely ignores the likelihood of success analysis. 
Likely this is because there is no 
likelihood that the Fourth District would reverse this court's ruling since the proper procedures 
for sealing the NP A were never followed. 
As to likelihood of hann, the only reference Defendantllllllll makes to this issue is in 
paragraph 3 of his motion. Here, Defendant merely makes a broad assertion that there will be 
"irrep~ble harm caused by the disclosure of the NP A." There is no explanation of who will be 
banned or what harm will be caused. How can a public document which redacts the names of 
the minor victims cause harm? This necessary question is never answered. Defendant's broad 
and vague assertion is insufficient to grant a stay. 
Finally, since there has been no showing by Defendant EPSTEIN that the proper 
procedure for sealing court documents were ever followed, the NP A is a public record.

INTRODUCTION 
This appeal concerns attempts to thwart public scrutiny of how government 
responded to the prostitution of children in Palm Beach County. In the order at 
issue below, the trial court correctly unsealed a non-prosecution agreement and its 
addendum. A predecessor judge found that the agreement significantly induced 
Petitioner to accept a plea agreement that allowed him to serve 18 months in jail 
for luring children to his Palm Beach mansion for "massages" or sexual activity. 
At the time that the non-prosecution agreement and its addendum ( collectively "the 
NP A") were accepted for filing, no basis for closure was asserted or found. Thus, 
the NP A was not properly sealed, and the prior closure order was properly vacated. 
Moreover, no basis currently exists for closure, and the pending petition - like 
Petitioner's filings below- contain nothing more than unsubstantiated assertions 
that confidentiality is required. Thus, continued closure is not warranted. 
Certainly unsealing the documents was not such a clear departure from the 
essential requirements oflaw as to warrant certiorari relief. Consequently, the 
pending petition must be denied. 
In addition, this Court should exercise its inherent authority under Rule 
.410 of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure to sanction Petitioner for his 
frivolous and bad faith attempts to cloak the resolution of the criminal charges

against him in secrecy by awarding to Respondent, Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc. 
d/b/a The Palm Beach Post ("the Post") its attorneys' fees and costs in responding 
to this petition. 
JURISDICTION 
The Post adopts Responden~ statement concerning jurisdiction. 
Insofar as this Court finds jurisdiction, the Post requests that this Court expedite its 
consideration of this matter, so as to remedy the denial to date of the public's and 
press's constitutional and common law rights of access. Art. I,§ 24, Fla. Const.; 
Fla. R. App. P. 9.l00(d); Sarasota-Herald Tribune v. State, 924 So. 2d 8, 11 (Fla. 
2d DCA 2006) (rule 9.l00(d) permits "expedited" review of orders excluding the 
press). 
NATURE OF THE RELIEF SOUGHT 
The Post asks this Court to deny the pending petition and to let stand the 
circuit court's Orders dated June 25, 2009 and June 26, 2009, which unsealed the 
NP A, and directed the Clerk of Court in and for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit of 
Florida to release these records to the public. 1 
Petitioner has sought review of the June 26, 2009 Order by motion rather than 
by petition for writ of certiorari. Though the June 26 Order does address the 
• 
matter of Petitioner's request for stay, the order also directs the Clerk of Courts to 
release the records, review of which should have been sought by certiorari.

STATEMENT OFTHE CASE AND FACTS 
This proceeding concerns the public's constitutional and common law rights 
of access to records crucial to the disposition of criminal charges against Petitioner 
Jeffrey Epstein. Specifically, Petitioner seeks review of two orders unsealing a 
non-prosecution agreement and its addendum ( collectively the "NP A"), which are 
records of the trial court below. State v. Epstein, Case Nos. 06 CF9454AMB, 08 
CF9381AMB. 
Petitioner was investigated by the State of Florida for felony solicitation of 
children for prostitution. (A-7 at p. 3, 1. 15 -p. 4, 1. 4; A-8.) The victims allege 
Epstein brought and paid teenage girls to come to his home for sex and/or 
"massages." (A-11 at ,I 6 and n. 1.) Epstein's minor victims are numerous (A-7 at 
p. 20, 11. 13-18) and the case drew attention of the highest-ranking law enforcement 
officials in Palm Beach County. Frustrated during the course of the investigation, 
Police Chief Michael Reiter even penned a letter to State Attorney Barry Krischer, 
calling his office's handling of the investigation "highly unusual" and suggesting 
that he disqualify himself from the case if the state would not act (A-11 at ,I 6; A-
at p. 36, 11. 7-142.) A federal investigation of Epstein's conduct as it relates to 
soliciting children for prostitution ensued. 
References to "A-" are to Petitioner's Appendix. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
Then abruptly, in June 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty in the trial court below 
to felony solicitation of minors for prostitution, was designated a Sexual Offender 
pursuant to Florida law, and was sentenced to 18-months jail and community 
control. 
(A-8.) Before accepting the terms of his state plea, Epstein entered into 
a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors. (A-7 at p. 38, 11. 9-18.) The 
non-prosecution agreement and its addendum were filed under seal in the lower 
court on July 2, 2008 and August 25, 2008, respectively.3 
According to Epstein's lawyers (and presumably the NPA itself), taking 
the state plea was a condition of the NPA. (A-7 at p. 38, 11. 13-18.) The NPA is 
invalidated if Epstein fails to fulfill the obligations of the state plea deal (A-7 at p. 
38, 11. 22 - 25.) In accepting the state plea, the trial court viewed the NPA a 
"significant inducement in accepting" the plea and recognized that the NP A 
influenced the defendant to make the state plea. (A-7 at p. 39, 11. 19-21; p. 40, 11. 
10-13.) 
In considering the plea at the hearing, the court requested a sealed copy of 
the non-prosecution agreement and asked whether Petitioner had signed it. (A-7 at 
The NP A and its addendum were filed under seal in this Court on July 1, 
2009. 
The Post and its lawyers have not seen the NP A, though it was reviewed, in 
camera, by the trial court (A-19).

p. 40, 11. 4-6.) Epstein's lawyer indicated it was signed and interjected that he 
"would like to seal the copy." (A-7 at p. 40, 11. 7-9.) Representatives from the 
U.S. Attorneys' Office were present at the hearing (A-7 at p. 39, 11. 22-23) but 
stated no objection to filing the non-prosecution agreement in the state court file. 
Thereupon, without any further consideration, the trial court requested a sealed 
copy of the non-prosecution agreement. (A-7 at p. 40, 11. 9-10.) On July 2, 2098, 
without any further proceedings on the issue, the court entered an Agreed Order 
Sealing Document in Court File, which allowed Epstein to file the non-prosecution 
agreement that was attached to the Agreed Order under seal. (A-9.) By its terms, 
the closure order was limited to the non-prosecution agreement and did not include 
its addendum. The order makes no findings with respect to closure and never 
expires. (A-9.) The addendum was filed six weeks later, on August 25, 2008, 
without any further order of the Court with respect to closure. 
Since Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution, he has 
been named in at least 12 civil lawsuits that- like the charges in this case - allege 
Epstein lured teenage girls to his Palm Beach mansion for sex and/or "massages." 
(A-1)5 At least 11 cases are pending. In another lawsuit, one of the Epstein's

accusers has alleged that federal prosecutors failed to consult with her regarding 
the disposition of possible charges against Epstein. (A-1; A-18 at p. 22, 1. 20 - p. 
23, 1. 15.)6 
Given the important public interest in this matter, on June 1, 2009, the Post 
moved to intervene below for the purpose of obtaining access to the NP A. The 
Court granted the Post's motion to intervene on June 10, 2009 (Supp.A.-1 at 1.)7 
The trial court granted the Post's petition for access on June 25, 2009 (A-16, A-18) 
and on June 26, 2009 denied Epstein's motion for stay and directed the clerk to 
release the records at noon on Thursday, July 2, 2009. (A-17, A-19.) Epstein's 
emergency petition for writ of certiorari regarding the June 25, 2009 order and his 
emergency motion to review the June 26, 2009 order followed.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
Petitioner's initial filing of the NP A under seal was achieved without any 
regard for the public's constitutional, statutory and common law rights of access. 
Florida law flatly prohibits the standardless permanent closure that was achieved in 
this case. The public has a right to know what transpires in its courtrooms 
generally and in particular has an interest in understanding how the resolution of 
this highly unusual prosecution occurred. 
Moreover, no present basis for closure exists. Petitioner has not shown -
and cannot show - that continued closure is proper. Instead, he has made 
conclusory assertions and relied on red herrings in attempting to keep the public 
from understanding how government responded to his solicitation of children to 
perform sex acts. 
The trial court, having reviewed the records in camera, saw through 
Petitioner's flimsy arguments. The trial court did not depart from the essential 
requirements of law in ordering the records unsealed.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
STANDARD OF REVIEW. 
The standard of review for a petition for writ of certiorari is whether the trial 
court departed from the essential requirements of law. See Combs v. State, 436 
So. 2d 93, 95 (Fla. 1983); Anderson v. E.T., 862 So. 2d 839, 840 (Fla. 4th DCA 
2003). 
II. 
THE TRIAL COURT CORRECTLY UNSEALED THE NP A. 
The NP A was neither properly sealed in the first instance nor is properly 
sealed at present. The trial court did not depart from the essential requirements of 
law in unsealing the records. 
A. 
The NP A was not Properly Sealed in the First Instance. 
The NPA- a significant inducement to Petitioner's acceptance of the plea-
was accepted for filing under seal without any deference to the public's right of 
access to court records. Such standardless closure cannot withstand scrutiny. 
Florida has traditionally served as a model for open government and courts. 
It is well-settled in Florida that "[a] trial is a public event [and] [w]hat transpires in 
the court room is public property." Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Lewis, 426 So. 2d 
1, 7 (Fla. 1982) (quoting Craig v. Hamey, 331 U.S. 367,376 (1947)). When 
considering a request to seal judicial records, this Court's "analysis must begin 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
with the proposition that all civil and criminal court proceedings are public events, 
records of court proceedings are public records and there is a strong presumption in 
favor of public access to such matters." Sentinel Communications Co. v. Watson, 
615 So. 2d 768, 770 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993). Indeed, the people of this State added 
Article I, Section 24 to the Declaration of Rights in the Florida Constitution to 
make clear that the right of access to the records of all three branches of 
government is of constitutional magnitude. All citizens possess the right to 
"inspect or copy" such records. 
Plea agreements and related documents typically are public record. See 
Oregonian Publishing Co. v. United States District Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 1465 
(9th Cir. 1990) ("plea agreements have typically been open to the public"); United 
States v. Kooistra, 796 F.3d 1390, 1390-91 (11th Cir. 1986) (documents relating to 
defendant's change of plea and sentencing could be sealed only upon finding of a 
compelling interest that justified denial of public access). Florida law likewise 
recognizes a strong public right of access to documents a court considers in 
connection with sentencing. See Sarasota Herald Tribune, Div. of the New York 
Times Co. v. Holtzendorf, 507 So. 2d 667,668 (Fla. 2d DCA 1987) ("While a 
judge may impose whatever legal sentence he chooses, if such sentence is based on 
a tangible proceeding or document, it is within the public domain unless otherwise 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
privileged."). 
Under Florida law, closure of judicial records is warranted only under very 
limited circumstances. In particular, the party seeking closure must demonstrate 
that: 
1. 
restricting public access is necessary to prevent a serious and 
imminent threat to the administration of justice; 
2. 
no alternatives, other than a change of venue, would protect the 
defendant's right to a fair trial; and 
3. 
closure would be effective in protecting the rights of the accused, 
without being broader than necessary to accomplish this purpose. 
Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Lewis, 426 So. 2d 1, 6 (Fla. 1982). This test, as well 
as the standard announced in Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531 So. 
2d 113 (Fla. 1988), was essentially codified in former Rule of Judicial 
Administration 2.051, now 2.420, which was applicable in both criminal and civil 
cases. Sarasota-Herald Tribune, 924 So. 2d at 11. 
In April 2007, the Florida Supreme Court adopted emergency amendments 
to Rule 2.420 in response to Florida media reports of hidden cases and secret 
dockets, a process that has come to be known as "super-sealing." In re 
Amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420, 954 So. 2d 16 (Fla. 
2007). In adopting the interim rule, the Florida Supreme Court confirmed its 
commitment to safeguarding the public's constitutional right of access to court 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
records, which the Court held "must remain inviolate." Id. at 17. By its terms, 
Rule 2.420 does not apply to criminal cases; however, later this year the Supreme 
Court will consider amendments to the rule that essentially seek to apply the 
standards applicable in civil cases to criminal ones. See In re Amendments to 
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420, Case No. 07-2050 (Fla. 2007). In 
the circuit below, however, the new Rule 2.420 procedures have been in effect 
since September 29, 2008. (Supp.A.-2.) In addition, the sealing of the NPA 
violated principles of Florida law established long before the amendments to Rule 
2.420. Consequently, the unsealing of these documents was proper. 
1. Closure of the Non-Prosecution Agreement Improperly 
Occurred without a Motion, Notice, Hearing, or a Proper 
Order. 
The non-prosecution agreement was sealed pursuant to an agreed order 
dated July 2, 2008 (A-9.) At the time, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Administrative 
Order 2.032 applied to requests for closure of court records in the lower court. 
(Supp.A.-3.) The order requires a motion, notice, and a hearing, none of which 
occurred in this case. (Id. at ilil 1 - 3.) The order further provides that closure is 
proper only upon showing that the factors set forth in Lewis have been met (Id. at ,I 
4) and that "[t]he reasons supporting sealing the file must be stated with specificity 
in the order sealing the court record" (Id. at ,I 5), neither of which occurred in this 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
case. 
Contrary to Petitioner's assertion (Petition at 13) neither this rule, nor the 
common law of Florida, nor the Florida constitution contemplates sua sponte 
closure of court records upon simple request of the Court or any party. Nor was 
the closure, in fact, sua sponte, as Epstein himself requested closure (A-7 at p. 40, 
11. 7-9.) and admittedly filed the NP A in the court file under seal pursuant to an 
agreed order (A-18 at p. 11, 11. 22-23). The agreed order (A-9) contains none of 
the findings required by Lewis or paragraph 5 of the Administrative Order. 
The 
closure order is invalid and was properly vacated. 
2. Closure of the Addendum Improperly Occurred without any 
Procedures to Protect the Right of Access at all. 
With respect to the sealing of the addendum to the non-prosecution 
agreement, no procedures were put in place at all. The original non-prosecution 
agreement was attached to the July 2, 2008 agreed order, which allowed to be filed 
under seal the "attached document" only. (A-9.) It appears from the record that 
the addendum - which was not attached to the July 2, 2008 order but was filed six 
weeks later - was simply filed and accepted under seal without any order allowing 
for closure. Closure of the addendum was thus improper on that basis as well. The 
trial court properly unsealed these documents. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
B. 
No Basis Exists for Current Closure of the Non-prosecution 
Agreement or Its Addendum. 
After the Post intervened, at a June 10, 2009 hearing on the issue of closure, 
the trial court asked Epstein's counsel about the Post's motion (A-11) specifically. 
Epstein's counsel replied: 
If the Post's position is the public has a right to ace - access this then 
there is a procedure in place and ultimately the Court has to conduct a 
hearing and do a balancing test where you look at whether there is 
some compelling government interest and that's going to require an 
evidentiary hearing. So I have no great objection to filing the Request 
for Closure and then having a hearing in front of the Court. 
(Supp.A.-1 at p. 3, 1. 22 -p. 4, I. 5.) Importantly, Petitioner's counsel did not 
assert that he had complied with these requirements, but that he would. The Court 
reset the hearing for June 25, 2009. 
Petitioner filed a Motion to Make Court Records Confidential (A-13) on 
June 11, 2009. In it, Epstein cited four reasons the NPA should remain under seal: 
1. to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the administration of justice8; 2. to 
protect a compelling government interest; 3. to avoid substantial injury to innocent 
This assertion apparently has been abandoned by Petitioner, because his 
petition asserts that he has asserted three bases for confidentiality, and does not 
include this basis. Accordingly, it will not be addressed, except to make note of 
the fact that Epstein has not at any point in this proceeding identified a threat to the 
administration of justice, much less a serious and imminent threat. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
third parties; and 4. to avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters 
protected by a common law and privacy right, not generally inherent in these 
specific type of proceedings sought to be closed. (A-13 at ,r 5.) The motion failed 
to explain how these interests were implicated, failed to address alternatives to 
closure, and failed to explain how closure would protect the interests. (A-13.) 
The lower court heard argument on June 25, 2009. The United States 
Attorneys' Office was provided notice of the hearing, but chose not to appear. (A-
at p. 7, 11. 10-14.) In fact, the U.S. Attorney's Office has taken no position on 
this matter throughout the lower court proceedings and specifically informed 
counsel for -that it had no position (A-18 at p. 7, 11. 10-14.) At that hearing, 
the Court found that the proper procedures to initially seal the records were not 
followed and then heard argument from Epstein's counsel on his June 11, 2009 
motion (A-13). Epstein's counsel consented to that procedure. (A-18 at p. 9, 11. 16 
-18.) The Judge held that neither the State, nor the U.S. Government, nor Epstein 
had shown why the NP A ought to remain confidential and ordered the records 
unsealed.9 (A-16.) 
It is important to note that the State Attorney's Office appeared at the hearing 
for the limited purpose of objecting to the release of minor victim's names, which 
turned out to be a non-issue because the Court, having reviewed the documents in 
camera, determined that no victim's names were included in the documents (A-19 
at p. 21, 11. 14-19.) The federal government, as mentioned above, took no position 
(Footnote continued on next page) 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
The trial court did not depart from the essential requirements of law in 
unsealing the NPA. Administrative Order of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit 2.303 
applies to Petitioner's June 11, 2009 request to seal the records in this case. 
(Supp.A.-2.) That administrative order - consistent with Lewis and its progeny-
applies Rule 2.420's standards to requests for closure of records in criminal 
proceedings in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit. Any order authorizing closure must 
contain findings that one of the interests set forth in Rule of Judicial 
Administration 2.420( c )(9)(A) is met and that closure is no broader than necessary 
to protect that interest. (Supp.A.-2 at, 4.); see also Lewis, 426 So. 2d at 3. 
Motions seeking closure must include a "signed certification by the party making 
the request that the motion is being made in good faith and is supported by a sound 
factual and legal basis." (Supp.A.-2 at, 1.) Epstein's initial oral request for 
closure failed to comply with the requirements of then-applicable law, and he has 
never presented a sound factual or legal basis for present closure. Consequently, 
unsealing the documents was fully consistent with the essential requirements of 
law. 
and did not appear at any of the hearings on this matter. Nor has either agency 
appealed the lower court's decision. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
1. Petitioner Cannot Identify a Rule 2.420(c)(9) Interest that 
Warrants Closure. 
Though Epstein's belated written motion identified four interests set forth in 
Rule 2.420( c )(9) that purportedly warrant closure, he failed to explain - either in 
his motion or at the hearing - how any of them applied. Instead, Petitioner 
asserted closure was proper because these broad interests would be served by 
closure, principles of comity require closure, and because the records contain 
information protected from disclosure by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6. 
Even though Petitioner now attempts to craft his arguments around the interests set 
forth in Rule 2.420( c )(9), the trial court cannot be said to have departed from the 
essential requirements of the law in holding that Epstein's burden had not been 
met. 
Epstein's petition asserts that closure is necessary to protect a compelling 
government interest because, he claims, the U.S. Attorneys' Office -who has been 
notified of these proceedings and has taken no position whatsoever - has a 
compelling interest in having the confidentiality provision of its contract with Mr. 
Epstein honored. See Petition at 15. Assuming such a provision exists (the Post 
has not seen the document), Petitioner is in no position to assert a compelling 
interest on the government's behalf, given its decision to take no position on the 
matter. If such an interest exists, the U.S. government is the party to assert it, and 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
it has specifically failed to do so. The trial court did not depart from the essential 
requirements of law in holding that Petitioner failed to demonstrate a compelling 
interest in closure. 
Epstein next asserts that closure is warranted to protect the interest of 
"innocent third parties" and identifies those third parties as Mr. Epstein's co-
conspirators. (Petition at 15). Again, Mr. Epstein lacks standing to assert the 
interests of third parties. Doe v. Museum of Science and History of Jacksonville, 
Inc., Case No. 92-32567, 1994 WL 741009 (Fla. 7th Jud. Cir. June 8, 1994) 
(plaintiff lacks standing to assert privacy interest of third party, minor victims of 
sexual assault by defendant's former employee, who had been convicted) ( copy 
attached at Supp.A.-4). In addition, even if the third parties Mr. Epstein identifies 
- his purported co-conspirators - were before the Court, they would have no 
privacy interest in matters pertaining to their criminal conduct. Post-Newsweek 
Stations, Florida, Inc. v. Doe, 612 So. 2d 549 (Fla. 1992) (Does, whose names 
were implicated in criminal prostitution scheme, had no right to privacy by virtue 
of their participation in a crime and thus their names could not be redacted from 
records provided to the public). Thus, the trial judge did not depart from the 
essential requirements of law in finding insufficient third-party interests to justify 
closure. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
The third interest Epstein seeks to invoke is his own right to privacy. See 
Petition at 15. While Epstein actually does have standing to assert his own right to 
privacy, Florida law is clear that closure is only proper to protect a "substantial 
injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a common law or privacy 
right not generally inherent in the specific type of proceeding sought to be closed." 
Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(c)(9)(A)(vi) (emphasis added). Epstein argues 
disclosure of a plea agreement is not generally inherent in a state court plea hearing 
See Petition at 16. That argument is absurd. Of course Epstein's plea agreement is 
generally inherent in his criminal prosecution. It is the very reason that 
prosecution ended, and as the lower court recognized in accepting the plea, it was a 
"significant inducement" to Petitioner to take the state's deal. (A-7 at p. 39, 11. 19-
21.; p. 40, 11. 10-13.) 
Moreover, Florida's constitutional right to privacy is expressly subordinate 
to the rights of Floridians to access the records of their government. To wit, 
Article I, § 23, which sets forth the right to privacy, further provides: "[t]his 
section shall not be construed to limit the public's right of access to public records 
and meetings as provided by law." Fla. Const. Art. I, § 23. As the Florida 
Supreme Court has recognized, the privacy amendment has not been construed to 
protect names and addresses contained in public records. Post Newsweek, 612 So. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
2d at 552. The trial court, having reviewed the NP A in camera, certainly had an 
opportunity to assess whether a privacy interest not inherent in his criminal 
prosecution for felony solicitation of children for prostitution is implicated by the 
NP A. It cannot in good faith be argued that the trial court departed from the 
essential requirements of law in determining that no such privacy interest was 
implicated. 
2. The Federal Court's Decisions in Case No. 08-80736 
(S.D. Fla. 2008) Did Not Preclude the Lower Court's 
Orders Unsealing the NPA.10 
Nor did the trial court's rejection of Petitioner's comity argument depart 
from the essential requirements of law. In the Southern District of Florida, one of 
the minor victims of Epstein filed a Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim's 
Rights Acts (A-1 ). 11 The victim also asked the federal court to allow her to share 
the NPA with third parties (A-3). Judge Marra denied the motion, finding- as the 
U.S. Government had argued (A-4)-that the NPA was not a record of the federal 
court. (A-6) ("First, as respondent points out, the Agreement was not filed in this 
The Post adopts and incorporates -
arguments and analysis on this issue 
in addition to the arguments it sets forth herein. 
The Post notes that A-3 through A-5 were not part of the record below. If the 
Court is inclined to consider these federal court pleadings, then in fairness it must 
consider those related pleadings which are attached hereto as Supp.A.-5 through 
Supp.A.-7 of the Post's Supplemental Appendix. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
case, under seal or otherwise."). The federal court also declined to provide any 
relief from restrictions on the parties' use and dissemination of the discovery 
document without prejudice. (A-6 at p.2.) 
Petitioner argues that the Post should be required to seek relief in Judge 
Marra's court. He mischaracterizes the nature of the proceedings there. There is 
no document to unseal in Judge Marra's court. The NPA is not a record of that 
court, and thus any effort by the Post to obtain access to the NP A there would be 
futile, and any order requiring it be unsealed by the lower court herein does not 
conflict with any decision of the federal court. (A-16 at p.3.) 
In fact, when Judge Marra has been asked to seal records of his court that 
quote the NP A, he has refused to do so, and has required such records to be filed in 
the public court file (Supp.A.-5 through Supp.A.-7)12 Thus, though the NP A is not 
a record of the federal court, the federal court has rejected attempts to file portions 
of it under seal. As a result, portions of the NPA appear in the public court file in 
Page 4 of Supp.A.-5 and paragraph 5 of Supp.A.-6, both publicly on file in the 
federal court, quote from the NP A. In addition, Epstein's own lawyers quoted 
extensively from the NPA in seeking to stay one of the civil suits against him. (A-
at ,r 6; A-18, p. 35, 1. 18 - p. 36, 1. 1 (incorporating by reference Supp.A.-5 
through Supp.A-6 and Supp.A.-7 (C.M.A. v. Epstein, Case No. 08-cv-80811 (S.D. 
Fla. 2008) at Dkt. 33 pp. 2-5)).) 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
the federal civil litigation against Epstein. (Supp.A-5 at p. 4; Supp.A.-6 at, 5; 
Supp.A.-7 at pp. 2-5.) The proverbial cat is already out of the bag. 
Notwithstanding, the NP A is a record of this lower court. The lower court 
did not enter an order conflicting with Judge Marra's rulings (A-16 at p. 3 -
expressly noting lack of conflict with Judge Marra's orders) and did not depart 
from the essential requirements of law in unsealing the NP A. 
3. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6 Did Not Preclude 
the Lower Court's Orders Unsealing the NPA.13 
Finally, unsealing the NPA did not conflict with federal law. Records 
available under state law are sealed by federal law only when federal law 
absolutely conflicts with state law and requires confidentiality of the records. The 
Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. VI, U.S. Const., comes 
into play only when federal law clearly requires the records to be closed, and the 
state is clearly subject to its provisions. !uh Wallace v. Guzman, 687 So. 2d 
1351, 1353 (Fla. 3d DCA 1997) (exemptions to federal Freedom of Information 
Act do not apply to state agencies); Hous. Auth. of the City of Daytona Beach v. 
Gomillion, 639 So. 2d 117 (Fla. 5th DCA 1994) (Federal Privacy Act does not 
exempt from disclosure records of housing authority which are open for inspection 
The Post adopts and incorporates -

under Florida Public Records Act); Fla. Sugar Cane League, Inc. v. Fla. Dept. of 
Envtl. Reg., Case No. 91-2108 (Fla. 2d Jud. Cir. Sept. 20, 1991), per curiam 
affirmed. 606 So. 2d 1267 (Fla. 1st DCA 1992 (documents received by state 
agency in course of settlement negotiations to resolve federal lawsuit and 
confidential settlement agreement with U.S. Department of Justice open to 
inspection because federal law did not clearly require confidentiality) (Supp.A.-8.) 
Federal law imposes no such preemption of the Florida constitution and common 
law in this case. 
In particular, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) does not restrict 
access to the NPA. Federal Rule 6(e) restrains grand jurors, court reporters, 
government attorneys, interpreters and the like from disclosing matters occurring 
before the grand jury. Petitioner - apparently the former target of the grand jury -
is none of these persons. His actions in filing the NP A under seal do not implicate 
Rule 6( e) no matter what information the NP A contains. The lower court's actions 
in unsealing the NP A likewise do not implicate Rule 6, because the lower court 
also is not restrained by Rule 6( e ). 
Moreover, the information contained in the NP A does not constitute 
"matters occurring before the grand jury" within the meaning of Rule 6. The 
secrecy rule is limited to such matters for the purpose of "preventing targets of an 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
investigation from fleeing or tampering with witnesses or grand jurors, 
encouraging witnesses to appear voluntarily and speak fully and frankly, avoiding 
damage to the reputation of subjects or targets of the investigation who are not 
indicted, and encouraging grand jurors to investigate suspected crimes without 
\ 
inhibition and engage in unrestricted deliberations." Lockhead Martin Corp. v. 
Boeing Co., 393 F. Supp. 2d 1276, 1279 (M.D. Fla. 2005). The rule aims to 
"prevent disclosure of the way in which information was presented to the grand 
jury, the specific questions and inquiries ofthe grand jury, the deliberations and 
vote of the grand jury, the targets upon which the grand jury's suspicion focuses, 
and specific details of what took place before the grand jury." In re Grand Jury 
Investigation of Ven-Fuel, 441 F. Supp. 1299, 1302-03 (M.D. Fla. 1977). In other 
words, Rule 6 is implicated if disclosure would reveal secret inner workings of the 
grand jury. U.S. v. Rosen, 471 F. Supp. 2d 651,654 (E.D. Va. 2007). 
Disclosure of details of a government investigation that is independent of a 
parallel grand jury proceeding does not violate Rule 6. Id. Statements by a 
prosecutor's office about its own investigation, therefore, are not covered by the 
secrecy rule. Id. at 655. Likewise, the mere mention of other targets of an 
investigation does not implicate the grand jury secrecy rule. £.:&..,_ In re Interested 
Party. 530 F. Supp. 2d 136,140-42 (D.D.C. 2008) (government not prohibited by 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
Rule 6 from disclosing plea agreement and other materials); Doe v. Hammond, 502 
F. Supp. 2d 94, 99-l0l(D.D.C. 2007) (same). Moreover, "when the fact or 
document is sought for itself, independently, rather than because it was stated 
before or displayed to the grand jury, there is no bar of secrecy." In re Grand Jury 
Investigation of Ven-Fuel, 441 F. Supp. at 1304. Here, the Post seeks to review 
the NP A for its own intrinsic value, and not for the purpose of discerning what 
transpired before the grand jury now more than a year ago. It is clearly well within 
the public's right and interest to review the NP A, given the circumstances 
surrounding the investigation and prosecution of Petitioner as well as the civil 
claims by women who say Epstein sought to make them his child prostitutes. 
These facts clearly constitute a proper basis for unsealing these improperly sealed 
documents. 
Finally, and even assuming for a moment that the NP A contains grand jury 
information -which the Post doubts -when the grand jury's work has concluded, 
and the accused apprehended, the veil of secrecy no longer is necessary and safely 
may be lifted. In re Grand Jury Investigation of Ven-Fuel, 441 F. Supp. at 1303. 
Here, Petitioner has been convicted, and nothing in the record suggests the grand 
jury's work is ongoing. Consequently, no basis exists for finding that the trial 
court departed from the essential requirements of law. 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
CONCLUSION 
The trial court was correct in unsealing the non-prosecution agreement and 
its addendum. These materials were not properly sealed in the first instance. 
Moreover, Epstein has not and cannot provide any basis for closure at this juncture. 
The trial court did not depart from the essential requirements of law in unsealing 
the NP A. Its order should be affirmed, and the Post should be awarded its fees and 
costs and such other further relief as this Court deems proper.

THE COURT: 
Okay, 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
For the other side, Your Honor, 
Jack Goldberger along with Robert Critton on behalf of 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
THE COURT: 
It is the POSt'S and 
Motion to 
Intervene for the purpose of unsealing records?· 
MR. 
BERGER: 
Yes, sir. 
THE COURT: 
Hera's what I 
think I 
know, and I tell 
you this so that you can fill in the gaps of what you know 
that I don"t know and suggest what you think I ought to 
do. It appears to me tbat there was some agreement --
an 
agreement that was sealed and then an addendum or 
amendment to the agreement that was sealed as to documents 
in the court's tiles under seal and it appears as though 
the punitive intervener& want to unseal those and take a 
peak at them. 
I don't see where any of the proper 
procadura& to seal the· documents was aver followed to 
begin with. I don't know but it's not jumping out at ffle 
when I reviewed the file. So, I'm thinking that it might 
be appropriate and the burden might be on the moving 
party, being the State and Mr. Epstein, to give them the 
opportunity to jump through the hur --
hoops to seal the 
documents if they are entitled to have them sealed, then

I'll grant that request. If they're not entitled to seal 
then I'll order it as documents unsealed. But that's kind 
of procedurally where I think the case is. I will allow 
Mr. Berger and Ms. Shullmao to argue if they wish to, 
otherwise I will go over to Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Critton 
to perhaps talk about what they think about my suggestion. 
Mr. Berger? 
MR. 
BERGER: 
I -- I'd like to hear what they say. 
THE COURT: 
Ms. Shullman? 
MS. SHULLMAN: 
Agreed. 
THE COURT: 
Mr. Goldberger? 
MR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
Your Honor 
THE COURT: 
I mean, it ·1ooks like they just handed 
up an Agreed Order to sign. 
MR. 
GOLDBERGER: 
Well, if the Court 
I know the 
Court is trying to short circuit here and the idea in 
theory is not horrible, it's not terrible, it's actually 
not so bad. But let me alert the Court to a couple of 
issues. First of all, this iS not something that came up 
ahead of time where we ware moving to close a hearing or 
file documents under seal and the Rules of Judicial 
Administration makes an important distinction between 
things that are done in advance and things that come up 
during a hearing and the fact that maybe it goaa to the 
Rule -- talk about situations that arise during the course

of a hearing, that the Rules would not apply to that. 
secondly,
■■■■ Motion to Intervene is brought under a 
Rule that does not apply because she brought it under a 
Rule that applies to non-criminal cases. Having said that 
I know the Court's desire to get to the issues here and I 
just need to alert the Court to one other matter because I 
think it's really important. The PlaintiCt•s, -• has 
this agreement already. They have this agreement. counsel 
will tell you they have this agreement. There have been 
two hearings in front of Judge Marra who bas the Federal 
cases here. They moved to unseal the non-prosecution 
agreement in front of Judge Marra. He entered an initial 
Order, a very, very well reasoned Order which I have a 
copy for the court. 
THB COURT: 
Oh, thanks. 
MR. 
GOLDBERGBR: 
He entered a very, very well 
reasoned Order weighing the interest of the Plaintiffs to 
have access to the non~prosacution agreement with the 
confidentiality that the parties inrended to be part of

want to review it with somebody else, they need to give

Plaintiffs went back and said we want to disseminate this 
Order. we want to disseminate this agreement to other 
parties and Judge Marra entered a second Order denying 
that request and said, no. My Order is in place but if you 
have some compelling reason why you want this agreement to 
be diaseminated to others, file a motion and come back to 
me. 
THB COURT: 
This is as a result of some civil 
litigation pending in the Federal Courthouse? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Yes. 
THB COURT: 
going on1 
As opposed to any criminal prosecution 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
It is civil proceedings that are 
going on in Federal court. But in the interest of comedy, 
Your Honor, the Court has ruled on the confidentiality 
agreement and has put a well reasoned procmdure into 
place. It the parties want that agreement unsealed where 
they need to go is go back to Federal Court and Judge 
Marra invited them to do so. 
THE COURT1 
That may be as it pertains to_, but 
what about The Post? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
I think --
and I think I know where 
the Court is going on this. If The Post's position is the 
public has right to ace -- access to this then there is a 
procedure in place and ultimately the court has to ccnduct

a hearing and do the balancing test where you look at 
whether there 1s some compelling government interest and 
that's going to require an evidentiary hearing. so I have 
no great objection to filing tha Request for Closure and 
then have a hearing in front of the Court. 
THE COURT: 
Well, let's do 
I'm thinking out loud. 
I'm not ruling. I will give you all a chance to argue 
further, but this is what I'm thinking I will do, grant 
the Motion to Intervene. It gives standing to -
It 
gives standing to The Post to contest the tact that these 
were sealed. And then I will shift the burden back on the 
State and Defendant, Mr. Epstein, to petition the Court to 
seal these documents. Until such time that I rule on that 
I will leave them under seal because they might have been 
correctly sealed but the procedure wasn't followed. 
There's got to be notice. You've got to comply with the 
Administrative order 2.303. You've got to comply with the 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(dl. I think even 
though that•~ a civil -- it addresse• a civil matter this 
is, you know, in the nature of a civil procedure. So, I'll 
do that. And thank you for these Orders. so, where do we

I think the Court needs to deal with this

Supreme Court has placed incredible scrutiny over. And the 
Rule that we are traveling under -- we're not only 
traveling under a Rule of Judicial Administration that 
applies to criminal and civil cases, we're applying to an 
Administrative Order of this Court that was in place when 
the sealing was done and that superseded the sealing.

MR. 
BERGER: 
Pardon me? 
THE COURT: 
You've got the agreements anyway. You've 
got what's under seal. 
MR. 
BERGER: 
Judge, we cannot do anything with them. 
THE COURT: 
Take that up with Judge Marra. 
MR. 
BERGER: 
No, air. That is not what tha Order 
says. May I quote Judge Marra. "If a specific tangible 
need arises in a civil case the relief should be sought in 
that case. 
In other words, the civil cases which are in 
front of Judge Hafele is one forum that Judge Marra said 
go to it. Judge Marra did not say that this Court does not 
have jurisdiction to unseal its own sealed records or to 
vacate its own Order sealing. And any characterization is 
is false. 
THE COURT: 
I'll take a look at it and I'll draw

that he's not clear that the procedures 
My review of the record does not reveal that 
the procedures were complied with. My review is similar to 
Your Honor's. It looks like sort of everybody approached 
the bench and Judge Pucillo said let's take it under seal. 
If Mr. Epstein's counsel is not prepared to go forward 
today and meet hie burden, then I would ask that this 
Court set a hearing as soon as practical because the right 
solution here should be to unseal the records and then,

possible and give them until Friday to tile their notice 
and tan days after that we have an evidentiary hearing. I 
go through the procesa then. What bad thing ia going to 
happen by waiting theae extra twelve to fifteen days? 
MS. 
SHULLMAN: 
The bad thing that's going to happen, 
Your Honor, is that the status quo in Florida is that the 
constitutional right of access is openness. 
THE COURT: 
Right. 
MS. 
SHULLMAN: 
You know, certainly if Your Honor is 
inclined to postpone this hearing I would ask that it be 
done expeditiously as you suggest. 
THE COURT: 
Yeah. 
MS. 
SHULLMAN: 
You know, Friday and then ten days 
thereafter, it just delays access for another two weeks 
and it infringes on our rights.

believe that this Court has the jurisdiction to revisit 
the propriety of the sealing of these records and give the 
Defendant or the State, for that matter, a second bite at 
the apple, If the records are sealed improperly, which the 
Court hae said on its face that appears to have occurred, 
I do not believe that this Court has jurisdiction to allow 
them a second bite at the apple to go through with the 
notice requirements. They should have done that in front 
of Judge Pucillo a year ago and they did not do it. The 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 simply does not give 
this Court the right to reactivate the procedure that you 
outlined. 
THE COURT: 
Okay, 
MR.

Thank you. 
THE COURT: 
Anything further, Mr. Goldberger or Mr. 
Critton? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Just note, Your Honor, as far as 
the timing of this and we want to do this expeditiously, 
of course, this sealing occurred not last week, not two 
weeks ago, not four months ago but eleven and 
months ago. The Post reported this last July.

I've indicated, that is that I'll grant the Intervener's 
Motion to Intervene. You have standing. 1 will order that

of --
comply with the Administrative Order 2.)03 and the 
Judicial Rule --
the Rule of Judicial Administration 
2.420, paragraph d, that outline ■ the procadures to seal 
tiles in these types of cases and then we•ll get a hearing 
scheduled for argument on whether or not they will be 
sealed. Until that time they will remain sealed because 
Judge Pucillo signed off on the Order and I'm not inclined 
to disturb that until I find more about the merits of the 
movant•s position.

take? I don't think I'm going to have any surprises. How 
much time do you think we need? A half hour?

MR. GOLDBERGER: For the other side, Your Honor, Jack Goldberger along with 
Robert Critton on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein. 
TIIE COURT: It is the Post's and -
Motion to Intervene for the purpose of 
unsealing records? 
MR. BERGER: Yes, sir. 
TI-IE COURT: Here's what I think I know, and I tell you this so that you can fill in 
the gaps of what you know that I don't know and suggest what you think I ought to do. It 
appears to me that there was some agreement -- an agreement that was sealed and then an 
addendum or amendment to the agreement that was sealed as to documents in the Court's files 
under seal and it appears as though the pWlitive interveners want to unseal those and take a 
peak at them. I don"t see where any of the proper procedures t.o seal the documents was ever 
followed to begin with. I don't know but it•s not jumping out at me when I reviewed the 
file. So, I'm thinking that it might be appropriate and the burden might be on the moving 
party, being the State and Mr. Epstein, to give them the opportWlity to jump through the bur 
hoops to seal the documents if they are entitled to have them sealed, then

of a hearing, that the Rules would not apply to that. Secondly, -Motion to Intervene 
1s brought under a Rule that does not apply because she brought it under a Rule that 
applies to non-criminal cases. Having said that I know the Court's desire to get to the 
issues here and I just need to alert the Court to one other matter because I think its 
really important. The Plaintiff's, -
has this agreement already. They have this 
agreement. Counsel will tell you they have this agreement. There have been two hearings in 
front of Judge Marra who has the Federal cases here. They moved to unseal the non-
prosecution agreement in front of Judge Marra. He entered an initial Order, a very, very 
well reasoned order which I have a copy for the Court. 
TI-IE COURT: Oh, thanks. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: He entered a very, very well reasoned order weighing the 
interest of the Plaintiffs to have access to the non-prosecution agreement with the 
confidentiality that the parties intended to be part of this agreement. And what he did, 
he said they can have this agreement. They can review it all they want. If they want to 
review it with somebody else, they need. to give them a copy of this Order that it is not 
to be disclosed to anyone else. Subsequent to that -- so that's the Rule that's in place 
right now. Subsequent to that the

Plaintiffs went back and said we want to disseminate this Order. we want to disseminate 
this agreement to other parties and Judge Marra entered a second Order denying that request 
and said, no. My Order is in place but if you have some compelling reason why you want this 
agreement to be disseminated to others, file a motion and come back to 
THE COURT: This is as a result of some civil litigation pending in the 
Federal Courthouse? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes. 
TiiE COURT: As opposed to any criminal prosecution going on? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: It is civil proceedings that are going on in Federal court. But 
in the interest of comedy, Your Honor, the Court has ruled on the confidentiality 
agreement and has put a well reasoned procedure into place. If the parties want that 
agreement unsealed where they need to go is go back to Federal Court and Judge Marra 
invited them to do so. 
THE COURT: That may be as it pertains to .... but what about The Post? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: I think 
and I think I know where the court is going on this. If 
The Post's position is the public has right to ace -- access to this then there is a 
procedure in place and ultimately the Court has to conduct

a hearing and do the balancing test where you look at whether there is some compelling 
government interest and that's going to require an evidentiary hearing. So I have no great 
objection to filing the Request tor Closure and then have a hearing in front of the court. 
THE COURT: well, let's do~- I•m thinking out loud. I'm not ruling. I will give 
you all a chance to argue further, but this is what I"m thinking I will do, grant the 
~tion to Intervene. It gives standing to,. It gives standing to The Post to contest the 
fact that these were sealed. And then I will shift the burden back on the State and 
Defendant, Mr. Epstein, to petition the Court to seal these documents. Until such time that 
I rule on that I will leave them under seal because they might have been correctly sealed 
but the procedure wasn't followed. There's got to be notice. You"ve got to comply with the 
Administrative order 2.303. You"ve got to comply with the Rule of Judicial Administration 
2.420{d). I think even though that's a civil -- it addresses a civil matter this is, you 
know, in the nature of a civil procedure. so, I'll do that. And thank you for these orders. 
so, where do we go from here? I'm thinking out loud, not n.iling. Mr. Berger?

In other words, the civil cases which are in front of Judge Hafele is one fon.im that Judge

believe that this Court has the jurisdiction to revisit the propriety of the sealing of 
these records and give the Defendant or the State, for that matter, a second bite at the 
apple. If the records are aealed improperly, which the court has said on its face that 
appcillar ■ to have occurred, I do not believe that this Court has jurisdiction to allow them a 
second bite at the apple to go through with the notice requirements. They should have done 
that in front of Judge Pucillo a year ago and they did not do it. The Rule of Judicial

IN THE CIRCUIT OCURT OF THE FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT 
IN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA 
ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 2.303-9/08 
IN RE: SEALING OF COURT HEARINGS 
AND RECORDS 
The Florida constitution mandates that the public shall have access to court records, subject 
only to certain enumerated limitations which are restricted by operation of state law, federal law, or 
court rule. In re Amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial Admin. 2.420- Sealing of Court Records, 
954 So.2d 16 (Fla. 2007). The Rules of the Supreme Court strongly disfavor court records that are 
hidden from public scrutiny. The Florida Supreme Court recently adopted Interim Rule 2.420 of the 
Florida Rules of Judicial Administration which addresses the procedures for sealing noncriminal 
court records. In order to ensure that both criminal and noncriminal court records are sealed properly 
it is 
NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority conferred by Florida Rule of Judicial 
Administration 2.215, it is ORDERED as follows: 
1. 
A request to make court records or a court hearing confidential in any type of case must be 
made by written motion. Parties cannot submit an agreed-upon order. The Motion must be 
captioned "Motion to Make Court Records Confidential" or "Motion to Make Court Hearing 
Confidential". The Motion must identify with particularity the records or hearing to be made 
confidential and the grounds upon which it is based. The Motion must include a signed 
certification by the party making the request that the motion is being made in good faith and 
is supported by a sound factual and legal basis. 
2. 
3. 
The records that are the subject of a Motion to Make Court Records Confidential will be 
treated as confidential pending resolution of the motion. The case number, docket number, 
or other identifying number of a case will remain public. Pseudonyms may be used as 
permitted by the court. Court records made confidential under this rule must be treated as 
confidential during any appellate proceeding in this Circuit. 
A public hearing on any motion to seal a court record or court hearing will be held as soon as 
practicable but no less than ten (I 0) days prior to the notice being given to the public and the 
press and no later than 30 days after the filing of the motion. A party may seek to hold all or

a portion of the hearing on a Motion to Make Court Records Confidential in camera if 
necessary to protect any of the interests listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 
2.420(c)(9)(A). The moving party will be responsible for ensuring that a complete record of 
any hearing be created either by use of a court reporter or by any recording device that is 
provided as a matter of right by the court. 
A sealing order issued by a court must state with specificity the grounds for sealing and the 
findings of the court that justify sealing. The order granting the sealing request must contain 
as much detail as possible including the parties' names or pseudonyms, whethe.rthe progress 
docket is to be confidential, the court records that are to be confidential and the names of 
persons who are permitted access. The order must contain specific findings that the degree, 
duration, and manner of confidentiality are no broader than necessary to protect the interests 
listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(c)(9)(A). The order will not reveal 
the information that is to be made confidential. The order will direct whether the progress 
docket is to be sealed. 
If an order sealing a court file is silent as to whether the progress docket is to be sealed, the 
clerk shall seal the court file but maintain a public docket with no alternation of the parties' 
names. In accordance with Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(c)(9) the Clerk 
shall NOT seal the case number, docket number, or any other identifying number of a case 
that is sealed by court order. 
The Court will direct the Clerk to post the order sealing the court file on the Clerk's website 
as well as on the bulletin board located at the Main Courthouse within ten (10) days 
following the entry of the order and must remain posted in both locations for at least 30 days. 
A nonparty may file a written motion to vacate a sealing order in accordance with Florida 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 (2007); In re Amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial 
Admin. 2.420 - Sealing of Court Records, 954 So.2d 16 (Fla. 2007). 
A public hearing must be held on any contested motion to vacate a sealing order. The court, 
in its discretion, may hold a hearing on an uncontested motion. While challenge hearings 
must be open to the public, a party may seek to hold a portion or all of the hearing in camera 
if necessary to protect the interests listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 
2.420(c)(9)(A). The movant must ensure that a record of the hearing is made. The movant 
seeking to vacate an order bears the burden of showing that the order is unsound. 
If the identity of a party is to remain ·confidential, all applicable pleadings will be filed with 
the following designation on the front of the pleading: "Confidential Party- Court Service 
Requested". 
The judicial assistant for the division in which the pleading is filed is 
responsible for providing such notice to the applicable parties. The judicial assistant is to 
provide such notice so as not to inadvertently reveal the identity of the confidential party.

OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO· 
CLOSE TRIAL 
RICHARD B. ORFINGER, Circuit Judge. 
*I THIS MATTER is before the Court on the 
plaintiffs' motion to exclude the public from the tri-
al of this case. Notice of hearing was given to rep-
resentatives of the media as required by law. News-
Journal Corporation, publisher of The News-
Journal, filed a response and appeared in opposi-
tion to the motion. Defendant took no position. 
According to the complaint, a man who worked at 
the local museum sexually abused the minor 
plaintiffs. He had first come into contact with three 
of the minors as they served as volunteers under his 
supervision. More than four years ago, the abuser 
was prosecuted and sentenced to prison. Since then 
the plaintiffs have settled suits for damages result-
ing from this abuse against the Daytona Beach Mu-
seum of Arts and Sciences, the Volusia County 
School Board, and the Florida Department of 
Health and Rehabilitative Services. As a previous 
employer of the abuser, plaintiffs allege this de-
fendant failed to disclose information about the ab-
user's record of sexual abuse when it received an 
inquiry related to his employment in this com-
munity. 
Although so many persons have become familiar 
with the case that defendant has listed eighty-one 
potential fact witnesses, no victim has yet been 
identified in the media. 
Relying on a privacy interest in the facts relating to 
the sexual abuse, plaintiffs argue that closure is ne-
cessary to prevent the substantial harm that likely 
would result from revelation of these facts and 
"d 
·r,

FNI 
t entt 1catton as the victims. 
Thus the motion 
calls upon the court to decide whether a privacy in-
terest in the facts relating to sexual abuse suffered 
by the minors provides a proper basis for closure of 
the trial of the minors' suit for damages arising out 
of this abuse. For the reasons that follow, the court 
concludes that this is not a proper basis for closure 
and denies the motion. 
FNI. Previously, plaintiffs moved for an 
order restraining anyone, including the me-
dia, from publishing information disclosed 
during the trial that would identify the 
minor victims. The court denied this mo-
tion. See: Nebraska Press Association v. 
Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976) and The Flor-
ida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524 (1989). 
Whenever other interests compete with the public 
interest in open judicial proceedings, "[ o ]ur analys-
is must begin with the proposition that all civil and 
criminal court proceedings are public events, re-
cords of court proceedings are public records, and 
there is a strong presumption in favor of public ac-
cess to such matters." Sentinel Communications Co. • 
v. Watson, 615 So.2d 768, 770 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993) 
( citing Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, 
Inc., 53 l So.2d I 13 (Fla.1988)). This presumption 
rests on the most fundamental values of American 
government.

Not Reported in So.2d, I 994 WL 741009 (Fla Cir.Ct.), 22 Media L. Rep. 2497 
(Cite as: 1994 WL 741009 (Fla.Cir.Ct.)) 
"[T]he people have a right to know what is done in 
their courts .... [T]he greatest publicity to the acts of 
those holding positions of public trust, and the 
greatest freedom in the discussion of the proceed-
ings of public tribunals that is consistent with truth 
and decency, are regarded as essential to the public 
welfare." Barron, 531 So.2d at I 16-7 (citing In re 
Shortridge, 34 P. 227, 228-29 (Cal.I893) ). Open-
ness in courts has a salutary effect on the 
propensity of witnesses to tell the truth and of judi-
cial officers to perform their duties conscientiously. 
It informs persons affected by litigation of its effect 
upon them and fosters "respect for the law[,] intelli-
gent acquaintance ... with the methods of govern-
ment[. and] a strong confidence in judicial remedies 
... which could never be inspired by a system of 
secrecy .... " Id., (citing 6 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE 
§ 1834 (Chadbourn rev. I 976) ). These fundamental 
values come into play whenever the court is in ses-
sion, and the presumption of openness applies in 
hard cases as well as easy cases. "The reason for 
openness is basic to our form of government." Id. 
*2 This motion is opposed by various news organ-
izations, but the presumption of openness is of lar-
ger importance than the immediate interest of the 
press in the case of the moment. To be sure, the 
press has a cognizable interest in maintaining open 
courts "because its ability to gather news is directly 
impaired or curtailed" by restrictions on access. 
Moreover, the press is assigned a fiduciary role in 
enforcing public rights of access because the press 
"may be properly considered as a representative of 
the public [for] enforcement of public right of ac-
cess." Nevertheless, the values of openness in 
courts transcend the interests of the press because 
"[ f]reedom of the press is not, and has never been a 
private property right granted to those who own the 
news media. It is a cherished and almost sacred 
right of each citizen to be informed about current 
events on a timely basis so each can exercise his 
discretion in determining the destiny and security 
of himself, other people, and the Nation." State ex 
rel. Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. McIntosh, 340 So.2d 
904, 908 (Fla.1977). In serving the right of each cit-
izen to be informed, judicial openness, of which the 
press is an instrument, sustains public confidence in 
the judiciary and thus serves the ultimate value of 
popular sovereignty. 
This higher purpose of openness is not always ap-
parent in the public scrutiny of the daily business of 
the courts. Depending on the definition of news-
worthiness, it may be possible to dismiss as un-
worthy much that transpires in civil courts. Here, it 
is easy to ask what public interest is served by sub-
jecting these minor victims to the risk of public 
identification. However, Barron teaches that this is 
the wrong question because it overlooks the higher 
• purpose of openness in the courts. 
In Barron, a case involving privacy concerns inher-
ent in a divorce case, the court strongly reaffirmed 
the presumption that Florida civil courts are open. 
In dissent, Justice McDonald saw the question in 
case-specific terms. He would have closed the pro-
. ceeding because "the rights of the public to inform-
ation contained in a domestic relations lawsuit is 
minimal, if existent at all." 531 So.2d at 121. Impli-
citly, this approach would have required the pro-
ponent of openness to show a particular need to 
know facts of the specific case in order to gain ac-
cess. The majority rejected this approach because it 
saw the conflicting interests in broader terms. ''The 
parties seeking a dissolution of their marriage are 
not entitled to a private court proceeding just be-
cause they are required to utilize the judicial sys-
tem." 531 So.2d at I 19, 
A closure request implicates the integrity and cred-
ibility of the judicial system itself and not just the 
immediate concerns of the parties. The balance to 
be struck is not between the people's need to know 
the particular facts of the case versus the parties' 
need to keep these facts private but between the 
public interest in open courts versus the personal 
desire for a private forum. "Public trials are essen-
tial to the judicial system's credibility in a free soci-
ety." Barron at 116.

"the public and the press have a fundamental right 
of access to all judicial proceedings," however, this 
right is not absolute. State ex rel. Miami Herald 
Pub. Co. v. McIntosh, 340 So.2d at 908-9. In Bar-
ron, the court took the occasion to establish the 
standards upon which the presumption of openness 
may be overcome when necessary "to protect com-
peting interests." The court wrote a "definitive 
statement ... to assist judicial officers in this sensit-
ive area." 531 So.2d at 117-8. 
Barron establishes a strong presumption of open-
ness for all court proceedings and records, places 
the burden on the proponent of closure, and grants 
standing to the public and media to challenge clos-
ure orders. Before a court may enter any order of 
closure it must determine there are no reasonable 
alternatives to closure and must order the least re-
strictive closure necessary to accomplish the pur-
pose of closure. 531 So.2d at 118-9. A closure or-
der should be "drawn with particularity and nar-
rowly applied." 53 I So.2d at 117. 
Barron specifies an exclusive listing of those com-
peting interests that may under appropriate circum-
stances be sufficiently weighty to justify closure. 
Closure may be ordered "only when necessary" to 
serve one of six competing interests: 
(a) to comply with established public policy set 
forth in the constitution, statutes, rules, or case 
law; 
(b) to protect trade secrets; 
(c) to protect a compelling governmental interest 
[e.g., national security; confidential informants]; 
(d) to obtain evidence to properly determine legal 
issues in a case; 
(e) to avoid substantial injury to innocent third 
parties [e.g., to protect young witnesses from of-
fensive testimony; to protect children in a di-
vorce]; or 
(t) to avoid substantial injury to a party by disclos-
ure of matters protected by a common law or pri-
vacy right not generally inherent in the specific 
type of civil proceeding sought to be closed .... 
At the outset, the proponent of closure must identi-
fy one or more of such interests that is implicated in 
the proposed closure. Here it is not necessary to go 
beyond this first level of analysis because plaintiffs 
have not connected their motion to a valid interest 
that would justify closure. 
This motion poses a direct confrontation between 
the individual interest in privacy and the public in-
terest in open courts. Because there is inherent in 
the case sensitiye, intimate, and embarrassing 
private facts, plaintiffs seek to litigate their claim in 
a closed proceeding. They argue "[t]hat revelation 
of [the identities of the minor plaintiffs] has the po-
tential to inflict substantial harm upon them [as] a 
matter of common sense." 
There is no question there are strong reasons to 
keep private the facts surrounding the abuse prac-
ticed on the minors by the now-imprisoned abuser. 
The question this court must decide, however, is 
whether these are reasons to secure the courtroom. 
The question is not whether to afford privacy to the 
plaintiffs but whether to afford plaintiffs a closed 
forum in which to disclose these facts. 
*4 Although there is no case directly on this point, 
the present question comes fully within the holding 
of Barron, which thoroughly considered the com-
petition between the people's interest in public 
courts and the personal interest in private facts. ln 
effect, Barron raised the question of the role to be 
assigned to privacy in a system of public courts, 
and the majority resolved the issue by granting a 
narrow role to privacy based on considerations re-
lating to the legitimate expectations of privacy. 
ln the Florida Supreme Court's well-developed pri-
vacy jurisprudence, the fundamental basis of the 
right of privacy is a legitimate expectation of pri-
vacy. Not every fact in every circumstance is 
private, and not every act of government violates

the right to be let alone. The concept by which the 
court separates the appropriate from the inappropri-
ate instance for invoking the privacy right is this 
expectation. Stall v. State, 570 So.2d 257, 261 
(Fla.1990). ln order to establish a right of privacy, 
the individual must establish that "a reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy ... exist(s]." Winfield v. Divi-
.<ion of Pari-Mutue/ Wagering, 477 So.2d 544, 547 
(Fla.1985). 
A right of privacy cannot attach when there is no 
expectation of privacy. Under our historic tradition 
of public courts, what reasonable expectation of 
privacy could a litigant possibly entertain? Concur-
ring in Barron, Justice Erhlich would have con-
ceded the litigant no reasonable expectation of pri-
vacy. He pointed out, "we have ... recognized that 
'[t]he potential for invasion of privacy is inherent 
in the litigation process.' Rasmussen v. South Flor-
ida Blood Service, 500 So.2d 533, 535 (Fla.1987). 
While civil litigants may have a legitimate expecta-
tion of privacy in pretrial depositions and interrog-
atories which are not filed with the court (citations 
omitted), no such expectation exists in connection 
with civil proceedings and court files which histor-
ica11y have been open to the public. See Forsberg v. 
Housing Authority, 455 So.2d 373, 375 (Fla.1984) 
(Overton, J., concurring) (there is traditiona11y no 
expectation of privacy in court files)." 531 So.2d at 
120. Justice Erhlich shows the conflict between pri-
vacy and publicness. If the privacy interest were al-
lowed unbounded scope, it would overcome the 
public nature of trials. Thus a system of public tri-
als must insist that litigants abandon qualms about 
disc1osure of private facts when they place them in 
contest in the court. 
Without rejecting this view entirely, the majority 
nevertheless identified a limited scope of privacy 
within civil litigation. "We find that, under appro-
priate circumstances, the constitutional right of pri-
vacy established in Florida by the adoption of art-
icle I, section 23, could form a constitutional basis 
for closure under (e) or (f)." 531 So.2d at 118. The 
majority thus conceived of two instances in which a 
reasonable expectation of privacy might be found. 
*S First, there is the privacy expectation of persons 
who are not parties to the case. Involuntary parti-
cipants may have a reasonable claim of privacy. 
Thus under item (g), Barron recognizes that closure 
may be justified if the proponent carries the heavy 
burden of showing closure is necessary "to avoid 
substantial injury to innocent third parties {e.g., to 
protect young witnesses from offensive testimony; 
to protect children in a divorce]." 531 So.2d at I 18. 
Second, there is the more limited privacy expecta-
tion of a party. Again, the doctrine of legitimate ex-
pectation is applicable. Alth9ugh a litigant has no 
right to expect privacy in matters involved in the 
case litigated in a public court, there may be mat-
ters extrinsic to the case with respect to which a lit-
igant has a reasonable privacy claim. Under Bar-
ron's item (f), a proponent may be entitled to clos-
ure if he or she carries the burden of showing that 
closure is necessary "to avoid substantial injury to a 
party by disclosure of matteis protected by a com-
mon law or privacy right not generally inherent in 
the specific type of civil proceeding sought to be 
closed," 531 So.2d at l 18. 
Barron rules out closure based on privacy interests 
of parties in the subject matter of the case itself. In 
recognizing a peripheral role for the privacy claims 
of civil litigants, the majority held there can be no 
privacy interest in that which is inherent in the 
case. Because litigation in a public court system in-
volves an inherent tendency to invade privacy, a lit-
igant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in 
the subject matter of a case. This must be so if, as 
Barron soundly affirms, there is to be a system of 
open courts in Florida. 
Applying this standard in Barron, the court determ-
ined the medical history in question should not be 
sealed because it was inherent in the case. 
"Although generally protected by one's privacy 
right, medical reports and history are no longer pro-
tected when the medical condition becomes an in-
tegral part of the civil proceeding, particularly

when the condition is asserted as an issue by the 
party seeking closure .... [M]edical information is an 
inherent part of these proceedings and cannot be 
utilized as a proper basis for closure." 531 So.2d at 
119. 
The same is true in this case. Those private facts 
which form the basis of the motion for closure are 
the facts inherent in the plaintiffs' case. Neverthe-
less, plaintiffs argue their request implicates the 
competing interests Barron listed in item (a) deal-
ing with public policy, item (e), dealing with pri-
vacy of third party, and item (I), dealing with pri-
vacy ofa party. 
Plaintiffs first argue that closure of the trial is ne-
cessary under item (a) "to comply with established 
public policy set forth in the constitution, statutes, 
rules, or case law." 531 So.2d at 118. Plaintiffs 
rightly contend "[t]he State of Florida has long re-
cognized, as a matter of public policy, the need to 
protect minors who come into contact with the 
justice system," and cite statutory provisions ex-
empting records of sex crimes and child abuse from 
public records disclosure and providing for closure 
of adoption and dependency proceedings. See 
Fla.Stat. §§ l 19.07(h); 63.162; 39.408(c). 
*6 To be sure, it is public policy to protect minor 
victims of sex crimes from unnecessary public ex-
posure. The cited exceptions to public records laws 
i11ustrate this as does the practice of anonymous 
pleading. 
However, state policy neither requires nor permits 
closure of public trials on the basis of the privacy 
interests of minor victims of sex crimes. The trial of 
the perpetrator of a sex crime against a minor must 
be conducted in public as a matter of Florida com-
FN2 
mon law. 
Under Fla.Stat., § 918.16, the court 
has a certain ability to clear the courtroom during 
testimony of a person under the age of 1 ~ but the 
press specifically may not be excluded. F 3 A re-
cent statute protecting minor witnesses does not 
purport to authorize closure of the trial to protect 
minor witnesses. FN4 When the state prosecutes the 
parent of a minor child for sexual abuses practiced 
on the child, the trial is not closed nor is there sup-
pression of the identity of the parent from which, as 
plaintiffs argue here, the identity of the child is 
readily inferred.FN5 Indeed, from the reports of 
tort suits by minor victims of sexual crimes seeking 
damages from the perpetrator or those vicariously 
liable. it can be seen that the courts of this state 
conduct cases like the present as open public trials

The court concludes that it is not necessary to close 
this trial in order to comply with any public policy 
of the State of Florida. 
The plaintiffs next argue that closure is necessary to 
serve the interest of innocent third parties whose 
privacy warrants closure under item (e) of Barron. 
The plaintiffs assert that each minor in this consol-
idated cause is a third party as to the other three ac-
tions and thus the trial should be closed to protect 
them as third parties in the consolidated cases. Hav-
ing voluntarily joined to bring the action, they can-
not claim to be third parties to the action nor assert 
a legitimate expectation of privacy in the disclos-
ures that necessarily follow from their decision to 
act in concert. 
Plaintiffs also assert the privacy interest of other 
minors who were victims of this same abuse but 
who have not joined in this suit. There is no evid-
ence that trial of this case would implicate these 
third parties. In any event, plaintiffs lack standing 
to assert the interest of these third parties, and the 
Court will not decide any issue affecting their rights 
unless a party with standing raises the issue. 
Finally, plaintiffs attempt to bring their motion un-
der item (f) relating to the privacy interest of a 
party. To be entitled to an order of closure under 
this item, however, plaintiffs must show that clos-
ure is necessary "to avoid substantial injury to. -a 
party by disclosure of matters protected by a com-
mon law or privacy right not generally inherent in 
the specific type of civil proceeding sought to be 
closed." 531 
So.2d at 119.(emphasis added). 
Plaintiffs argue their identities are not inherent facts 
in the case and thus the trial should be closed to 
prevent revelation of the identity. However, 
plaintiffs also contend it will be impossible to try 
the case without revelation of their names. Their ar-
gument refutes itself. The identity of a party is in-
herent in the case, and that concern alone could not 
justify total closure. This argument is a proxy for 
the ineffective argument that the sensitive nature of 
inherent private facts should justify a private forum. 
Facts regarding abuse form the core of their case, 
and thus it "is an inherent part of these proceedings 
and cannot be utilized as a proper basis for clos-
ure." 531 So.2d at 119. The decision to litigate this 
issue is tantamount to a decision to place the in-
formation before the public. 
*7 As sympathetic as their claim is, it fails to state 
a cognizable reason for closure under the law. The

request to close a civil trial because of a party's dis-
closural concerns with facts inherent in the cause 
cannot be reconciled with Barron. Facts generally 
protected by a party's privacy right are no longer 
protected from disclosure when they become an in-
tegral part of a civil proceeding. Indeed, plaintiffs' 
argument for a private forum could be asserted as 
the basis for a wide array of exceptions that would

GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO VICTIM'S EMERGENCY PETITION 
FOR ENFORCEMENT OF CRIME VICTIM RIGHTS ACT. 18 U.S.C. § 3771 
The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, files its Response 
to Victim's Emergency Petition for Enforcement of Victim Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, and 
states: 
I. 
THERE IS NO "COURT PROCEEDING" UNDER 18 U.S.C. § 3771{b) 
Petitioner complains that she has been denied her rights under the Crime Victims Rights 
Act, I 8 U.S.C. § 3771. In the emergency petition filed by the victim, she alleges the Government 
has denied her rights since she has received no consultation with the attorney for the government 
regarding possible disposition of the charges (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5)); no notice ofany public 
court proceedings ( 18 U .S.C. § 3771 (a)(2)); no information regarding her right to restitution ( 18 
U.S.C. § 377l(a)(6)); and no notice of rights under the Crime Victim Rights Act (CVRA). 
Emergency Petition, ,i S. 
The instant case is unique in several respects. First, in 2006, Jeffrey Epstein was charged 
with felony solicitation of prostitution in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm 
Beach County, Florida. This charge was based upon the offenses alleged in paragraph I of the 
petition. Second, while Epstein has been under federal investigation, he has not been charged in

Title 18, U.S.C., Section 377l(b)(I) provides in pertinent part that, "[i]n any court 
proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime 
victim is afforded the rights described in subsection (a)." There is no "court proceeding" in the 
instant case since Epstein has not been charged with violation of any federal statute. No federal 
grand jury indictment has been returned, nor has any criminal information been filed. There can 
thus be no failure c,f a right to notice of a public court proceeding or the right to restitution. 
In her memorandum, petitioner relies upon In Re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008), 
where the Fifth Circuit held that the CVRA required the government to "confer in some 
reasonable way with the victims before ultimately exercising its broad discretion." Id. at 395. In 
Dean, the government sought and obtained an g ~ 
order permitting it to negotiate a plea 
agreement with BP Products North America, without first consulting with the victims, 
individuals injured and survivors of those killed in a refinery explosion. A plea agreement wa~ 
ultimately negotiated and the victims objected. The appellate court found that the CVRA granted 
a right to confer. However, the court declined to grant mandamus relief for prudential reasons, 
finding that the district court had the benefit of the views of the victims who chose to participate 
at the hearing held on whether the plea agreement should be accepted. M.. at 396. 
Dean is legally distinguishable in several respects. For one thing, the court's discussion 
of the scope of the right to confer was unnecessary because the court ultimately declined to issue 
mandamus relief. lliru:!, 527 F.3d at 395. Also, in offering its view that this right applies pre-
charge, it is noteworthy that the court, in purporting to quote the statute, omitted the last three 
words of section 3 771 (a)(5)("in the case"), words that arguably point in the opposite direction by

suggesting that the right applies post-charge. Further, the court went to great lengths to 
emphasize that its holding was limited to the particular circumstances presented in that case (i.e., 
the simultaneous filing of a plea agreement and formal charges), which of course, is not the case 
here. No federal charges have been filed in the instant case, and this case, unlike Dean, involves 
an agreement to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida and not a 
guilty plea. 1lL at 394. Finally, the Dean court expressly declined to "speculate on the [right to 
confer's] applicability to other situations." Id. Nothing in§ 3771(a)(5) supports the petitioner's 
claim that she had a right to be consulted before the Government could enter into a non-
prosecution agreement which defers federal prosecution in exchange for state court resolution of 
criminal liability, and a significant concession on an element of a claim for compensation under 
U.S.C. § 2255. 
II. 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED ITS BEST EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH 
U.S.C. § 377Ha) 
The Epstein case was investigated initially by the Palm Beach Police Department in 2006. 
Exhibit A, Declaration of Assistant United States Attorney A. Marie Villafana,, 2. 
Subsequently, the Palm Beach Police Department sought the assistance of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI). Id. Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim 
notification letters were provided to the victim by both the FBI Victim-Witness Specialist and 
AUSA Villafai\a. Id.,, 3. Petitioner's counsel, Brad Edwards, Esq., currently represents-

on May 30, 2008. Villafana Deel.,, 3. 
Throughou1 the investigation, AUSA Villafana and the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist 
had contact with- Villafana Deel.,, 4. Earlier in the investigation,_ was represented by 
James Eisenberg, Esq. Consequently, all contact witJ-al was made through Mr. Eisenberg. 
In mid-2007, Epstein's attorneys approached the U.S. Attorney's Office in an effort to 
resolve the federal investigation. Id.,, 5. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the 
State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.07. Mr. 
Epstein's attorneys sought a global resolution of this matter. The United States subsequently 
agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as 
certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was 10 
preserve a federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one 
condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is the 
following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an 
offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, 
will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she 
would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and 
convicted ofan enumerated offense. For purposes of 
implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. 
Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared 
to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by 
Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, 
including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens if 
any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the 
parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they 
would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No 
more; no less."

IV. Services to Victims and Witnesses, provides the following guidance for proposed plea 
agreements: 
(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable 
efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims' views about, 
prospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible 
official should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving 
notice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but 
not limited to, the following factors: 
(a} The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety. 
(b} The number of victims. 
(,) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea. 
(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions. 
( e) Whether there is another need for confidentiality. 
(f} Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that relaying any 
information may have on the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
Throughout negotiations, Epstein's attorneys claimed that one reason victims came 
forward and pressed their claims was their desire for money. They argued that victims might 
have an inducement to fabricate or enhance their testimony, in order to maximize their 
opportunities to obtain financial recompense. Villafana Deel.. 'II 8. The Government was 
extremely concerned that disclosure of the proposed terms would compromise the investigation 
by providing Epstein the means of impeaching the victim witnesses, should the parties fail to 
reach an agreement. In light of the fact (i) that the United States agreed to defer prosecution to a 
previously filed state criminal case; (ii) that as a result sentencing would take place in state court 
before a state judge; (iii) that if the state resolution failed to meet minimum standards such that a 
federal prosecution was warranted, the victims would be witnesses and thus potential

impeachment issues were of concern; and (iv) the United States was already making efforts to 
secure for victims the right to proceed federally under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 even if prosecution took 
place in state court, the Government determined that its actions in proceeding with this 
agreement best balanced the dual position of the Jane Does as both victims and potential 
witnesses in a criminal proceeding. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA Villafana received a copy 
of the proposed state plea agreement, and learned that Epstein's state plea hearing was scheduled 
for Monday, June 30, 2008, at 8:30 a.m. Villafana Deel.,, 10. AUSA Villafana and the Palm 
Beach Police Department attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that they 
had . .14.. Although all known victims were not notified, AUSA Villafana did call attorney 
Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. AUSA Villafana did this, even 
though she had no obligation to provide notice of a state court hearing. Mr. Edwards advised that 
he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Id. 
The Government has complied with 18 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l) by using its best efforts to 
··see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in subsection (a)." 
Specifically, petitioner was afforded the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government under 18 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(5). Disclosure of the specific terms of the negotiation 
were not disclosed prior to a final agreement being reached because the Government believed 
doing so would jeopardize and prejudice the prosecution in the event an agreement could not be 
made. Further, although 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(2) does not apply to state court proceedings, the 
government nonetheless notified petitioner's counsel on June 27, 2008, of the plea hearing in 
state court on June 30, 2008.

Section 377l(d)(6) provides, in relevant part, that "[n]othing in this chapter shall be 
construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his 
direction." The Government exercised its judgment and discretion in determining that there was 
a need for confidentiality in the negotiations with Epstein. The significant benefit of obtaining 
Epstein's concession that victims suing him under 18 U. S.C. § 2255(a) were "victims" of the 
enumerated offenses, despite the fact he has not been convicted in federal court, was of sufficient 
importance to justify confidentiality of the negotiations.

2. 
I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation ("FBI"). 
The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police 
Department ("PBPD") into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had 
used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and 
seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses. 
3. 
Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification 
letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness 
Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three 
clients,--• and-1 Your Affiant's letter to- was provided by the FBI. (Ex. 
I). Your Affiant's letter to -
was hand-delivered by myself to- at the time that she 
was interviewed (Ex. 2).2 Both •. and-also received letters from the FBI's Victim-
Witness Specialist, which were sent on January I 0, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4). -was identified 
via the FBI's investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to speak with investigators. 
status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by 
1Attomey Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of "Jane Doe," without ident~ which of 
his clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to_,_, an~ 
All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when 
they were fifteen years old. 
'Please note that the dates on the U.S. Attorney's Office letters to- an- are not the 
dates that the letters were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in the 
investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.

federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter t~ 
on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5). 
4. 
Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBl's Victim-Witness 
Specialist, and your Affiant had contact with- and-Attorney Edwards' other client, 
-• 
was represented by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with-was made through 
that attorney. That attorney was James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, 
the target of the investigation. 3 
S. 
In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida ("the Office") entered into negotiations to resolve the 
investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with 
solicitation of prostitution, in violation ofFlorida Statutes§ 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys 
sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer 
federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic 
preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a 
federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one 
condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008. is 
the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same 
rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein 
3The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing- or whether 
-
ever formally terminated Mr. Eisenberg' s representation.

had been tried federally and convicted ofan enumerated offense. For purposes 
of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an 
Indictment as victims ofan enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is 
the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position 
as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no 
less." 
6. 
An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an 
express confidentiality provision. 
7. 
Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, 
several had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they 
desired a prompt resolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in 
September 2007, -
was openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted 
to interview- in October 2007, at which time she refused to provide any information 
regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be 
consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation. 
8. 
As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution 
to the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, 
shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions 
were discussed. One of those victims was- who at the time was not represented, and she 
was given notice of the agreement. Notice was also provided ofan expected change of plea 
in October 2007. When Epstein's attorneys learned that some of the victims had been

notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their 
involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your Affiant 
knew that the victims' statements had been taken and corroborated with independent 
evidence well before they were informed of the potential for damages, the agents and I 
concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the witnesses' credibilit) at 
trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement. 
9. 
Afterll■lhad been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein 
performed his obligations,_ contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was attempting 
to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro 
bono counsel to rcpresen •. 
and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was 
able to assist -
in avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bona counsel did not 
express to your Affiant tha~ was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter. 
10. 
In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affianl to inform me that 
he represente~ and- and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding 
Epstein. I invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to 
consider. Nothing was provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider 
contacting the State Attorney's Office, ifhe so wished. I understand that no contact with that 
office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to- so I advised him that, to my 
knowledge 
was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg.

11. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a 
copy of the proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 
a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. Your Affiant and the Palm Beach Police Department 
attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that Epstein's counsel had ghen 
us. Although all known victims were not notified, your Affiant specifically called attorney 
Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. Your Affiant believes that 
it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards notified me that he represented-
and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney Edwards informed 
your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Your 
Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards' clients was present. 
I 2. 
On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to 
-
and • 
via their attorney, Bradley Edwards (Exs. 6 & 7). A notification was not 
provided to -
because the U.S. Attorney's modification limited Epstein's liability to 
victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an indictment. In light of-
prior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not in good faith include-as a 
victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to 
Epstein's counsel. 
13. 
Furthermore, with respect to the Certification of Emergency, Attorney Edwards 
did not ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he 
requests in his Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had

Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully move for a 
mandatory stay of this action under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k), 
Section l 595(b)(l ), and alternatively, under this Court's discretionary authority to 
stay civil litigation, based on the existence of a pending federal criminal action. 
Introduction 
This lawsuit anses from a pending federal criminal action concerning, 
among other things, an alleged assault of the plaintiff Jane Doe, who, according to 
her complaint, on "numerous occasions" provided "massages" to Epstein with "no 
credentials to provide massage therapy" and was "sometimes paid . . . for the 
'sessions'." Comp!., ,i,i 6, 11. A federal statute directly on point provides that 
when a civil suit alleging damages to a minor victim arises out of the same 
occurrence as a "criminal action," the civil suit "shall be stayed until the end of all 
phases of the criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added).' 
The full text of the mandatory-stay provision reads: 
If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for damage or 
injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is pending which arises out 
of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim, the civil action shall 
be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action and any mention of the 
civil action during the criminal proceeding is prohibited. As used in this 
subsection, a criminal action is pending until its final adjudication in the trial 
court.

Accordingly, a stay of this case is mandatory until the criminal action arising from 
the same allegations is no longer pending. 
The Pending Federal Criminal Action 
In 2006, a Florida state grand jury indicted Jeffrey Epstein on allegations 
similar to those in the instant action (State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 
2006 CF 09454A, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County) (the "Florida 
Criminal Action"). Shortly thereafter, the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (the "USAO") began a federal grand-jury investigation 
into allegations arising out of the same incidents alleged in the instant action (Grand 
Jury No. 07-103 (WPB), United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida) ("the Federal Criminal Action"). 
In September 2007, the USAO and Mr. Epstein entered into a highly unusual 
and unprecedented deferred-prosecution agreement (the "Agreement"), in which the 
USAO agreed to defer (not dismiss or close) the Federal Criminal Action on the 
condition that Mr. Epstein continue to comply with numerous obligations, the first of 
which was pleading guilty to certain state charges in the Florida Criminal Action. 
The Agreement itself uses the term "deferred'' (rather than "dismissed" or "closed") 
to describe the status of the Federal Criminal Action: 
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prosecution in this 
District, for these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by

the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following 
conditions and the requirements of this Agreement .... 
Agreement, at 2. 
By no stretch did the USAO finalize, close, complete, dismiss or abandon 
the Federal Criminal Action. 
Indeed, as the lead federal prosecutor recently 
explained, the USAO merely "agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of 
prosecution by the State of Florida .... " 
See In re: Jane Doe, Case No. 08-
80736-CIV-Marra/Johnson (S.D. Fla.) (D.E. 14), Deel. of AUSA Villafana, 
07/09/08, ~ 5, attached hereto as Exhibit "A" (emphasis added). 
Under the 
Agreement, the USAO presently retains the continuing right to indict Mr. Epstein -
- or to unseal "any" already-existing federal "charges" that may already have been 
handed up by the federal grand jury and sealed - - should he breach any of its 
provisions. Agreement, at 2. 
The period of the deferral continues until three months after Mr. Epstein 
completes service of his sentence in the Florida Criminal Action. Id. Indeed, the 
final three months of the Agreement's term constitute an extended period during 
which the USAO expressly retains the ability to evaluate whether Epstein 
committed any breaches of his numerous obligations under the agreement while he 
was serving his state sentence, and, if it so determines, reserves the right to indict

( or unseal an existing indictment against) Mr. Epstein - - even after he has 
completed serving his entire state sentence. 
The Agreement further provides that upon Epstein's execution of a plea 
agreement in the State Criminal Case, the Federal Criminal Action "will be 
suspended" and all pending grand-jury subpoenas "will be held in abeyance unless 
and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement." Agreement, at S 
(emphasis added). The Agreement directs the USAO and Epstein to· "maintain 
their evidence, specifically evidence requested by or directly related to the grand 
jury subpoenas that have been issued," and to maintain such evidence "inviolate." 
Id. (emphasis added). It also expressly provides that the grand-jury subpoenas 
continue to remain "outstanding" until "the successful completion of the terms of 
this agreement." Id. ( emphasis added). 
Further, it includes a promise not to prosecute movant/defendant Sarah 
Kellen, only if "Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of th[ e] 
agreement." Id. 
Finally, the Agreement provides that the USAO's declination of prosecution 
for certain enumerated offenses and dismissal of any existing (sealed) charges will 
not occur until 90 days following the completion of his state sentence: 
If the United States Attorney should determine, based on 
reliable evidence, that, during the period of the Agreement, Epstein 
willfully violated any of the conditions of this Agreement, then the

the charges against Epstein, if any, will be dismissed. 
Agreement, at 2. 
Page 6 of 41 
Consistent with the Agreement and its position that the Federal Criminal 
Action continues to remain pending, the USAO recently sent letters to attorneys for 
people that the USAO has designated as "victims." In those letters, the USAO 
asked, "[I]fyou do file a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and Mr. Epstein denies that 
your client is a victim of an enumerated offense, please provide notice of that 
denial to the undersigned [AUSA]." See Deel. of AUSA Villafana, Exhs. 6 & 7, at 
(July 9, 2008). The clear implication of the USAO's request (by which the 
USAO appears to involve itself in the instant litigation, despite advising the 
recipients that it cannot "take part in or otherwise assist in civil litigation," id. at 2), 
is that the USAO believes that such denial might breach the Agreement.

Accordingly, the Federal Criminal Action remains "pending." 
Discussion 
I. 
Section 3509(k) Imposes a Mandatory Stay. 
The language of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k) is clear and 
mandatory: a parallel "civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the 
criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added). The word "sha/f' means 
that the statute's command is mandatory and not subject to a Court's discretion. 
See, e.g., Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230,241 (2001) (noting Congress' "use ofa 
mandatory 'shall' to impose discretion/ess obligations") (emphasis added); 
Lexecon Inc. v. Mi/berg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998) 
(explaining that "the mandatory 'shall' ... normally creates an obligation 
impervious to judicial discretion") (emphasis added). Cf Miller v. French, 530 
U.S. 327, 350 (2000) (construing the litigation-stay provision of the Prison 
Litigation Reform Act, holding, "Through the PLRA, Congress clearly intended to 
make operation of the automatic stay mandatory, precluding courts from 
exercising their equitable powers to enjoin the stay. And we conclude that this 
provision does not violate separation of powers principles.") (emphasis added). 
One District Court within the Eleventh Circuit recently construed "the plain 
language of § 3509(k)" as "requirfing/ a stay in a case ... where ... a parallel 
criminal action [is] pending." Doe v. Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 950623,

parallel criminal action is pending which arises from the same occurrence 
involving minor victims") ( emphasis added). There is no contrary opinion from 
any court. 
In detennining that the federal stay provision is mandatory, the Francis JI 
court expressed that there was apparently no case law supporting, or even 
"discussing the [avoidance] of a stay [under the command of] § 3509(k)." Francis 
II, 2005 WL 950623, at *2. Deferring to the statute as written, the Francis II court 
rejected the plaintiffs' argument that some of the alleged victims had already 
reached their majority. 
See id. 
The court similarly rejected the plaintiffs' 
argument that it would be in the victims' best interests to avoid a stay so as to 
counteract the victims' "ongoing and increasing mental harm due to the 'frustrating 
delay in both the criminal case and [the civil] case."' Id.

II. 
Section 3509(k) Applies to Investigations, Not Just Indictments. 
While there is no unsealed indicted criminal case against Mr. Epstein, the 
government's criminal investigation against him remains open. Section 3509(k) 
clearly applies to stay civil cases during the pendency, not only of indicted 
criminal cases, but also of pre-indictment criminal investigations. 
The term "criminal action" is not expressly defined in § 3 509(k). 
It is 
defined, however, by a closely related statute. Title 18, U.S.C. § 1595 provides a 
civil remedy for "forced labor" and "sex trafficking" violations, but stays such 
actions "during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same 
occurrence in which the claimant is the victim."2 In enacting § 1595, Congress 
The full text of that statute provides: 
§ 1595. Civil remedy 
(a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of section 1589, 
1590, or 1591 of this chapter may bring a civil action against 
the perpetrator in an appropriate district court of the United 
States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys 
fees. 
(b) 
(I) 
Any civil action filed under this section shall be 
I 8 U.S.C. § 1595. 
stayed during the pendency of any criminal action 
arising out of the same occurrence in which the 
claimant is the victim. 
(2) 
In this subsection, a "criminal action" includes 
investigation and prosecution and is pending until 
final adjudication in the trial court.

specifically intended that the term "criminal action" would be applied extremely 
broadly. Accordingly, Congress took pains to ensure that courts would give it the 
broadest possible construction and, for that reason, speci fled in the definition 
provision that "criminal action" also "includes investigation." 
u.s.c. 
§ 1595(b)(2). The only reported decision addressing this provision interpreted it 
according to its plain language. See Ara v. Khan, No. CV 07-1251, 2007 WL 
1726456, *2 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 2007) (ordering "all proceedings in this case 
stayed pending the conclusion of the government's criminal investigation of the 
defendants and of any resulting criminal prosecution") (emphasis added). 
Given that the USAO's Agreement with Epstein indicates that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the grand-jury's subpoenas remain "outstanding" (Agreement, at 5); 
the subpoenas are "h[ e ]Id ... in abeyance" (id.); 
the subpoenas are not "withdrawn" (id.); 
the parties must "maintain their evidence" (id.) (which would be 
entirely unnecessary if the investigation against Epstein were closed); 
"any" existing "charges" will not "be dismissed" until after Epstein 
has "timely fulfill[ed] all the terms and conditions of the Agreement" 
(id. at 2) ( emphasis added); and 
• 
"prosecution in this District ... shall be deferred" (id.) (but not closed 
or dismissed) - -
then the only reasonable conclusion is that the Federal Criminal Action remains 
"pending."

The ordinary meaning of the adjective "pending" is "[r]emaining undecided; 
awaiting decision .... " Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004). 3 See also 
White v. Klitzkie, 281 F .3d 920, 928 (9th Cir. 2002) (relying on Black's Law 
Dictionary, in the context of a criminal case, for the definition of "pending" as 
"awaiting decision"); Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 421 (3d Cir. 2000) (relying 
on Black's Law Dictionary for the definition of "pending," expressly because 
'"pending' is not defined in the statute"). Any common-sense reading of the 
Agreement and the USAO's recent sworn construction of it, is consonant with the 
Federal Criminal Action's "remaining undecided" and "awaiting decision." See 
Unified Gov 't of Athens-Clarke County v. Athens Newspapers, LLC, No. 
S07Gl 133, _S.E.2d _, 2008 WL 2579238, *3 (Ga. June 30, 2008) (reviewing a 
public-records request against Georgia's "pending investigation" exception to its 
open-records law, and holding that "a seemingly inactive investigation which has 
not yet resulted in a prosecution logically "remains undecided," and is therefore 
"pending," until it "is concluded and the file closed") (emphasis added). 
' The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit routinely relies on Black's Law 
Dictionary for the definition of statutory terms, including in criminal cases. See e.g., United 
States v. Young, 528 F.3d 1294, 1297 n.3 (11th Cir. 2008) (definitions of criminal "complaint" 
and "indictment"); United States v. Brown, 526 F.3d 691, 705 (11th Cir. 2008) (definition of 
"knowingly" in criminal statute).

III. 
Section 3509(k) Applies Even After a Plaintiff Turns 18. 
The parallel stay provision in § 1595, discussed supra at 8-9, mandates, 
without exception, that any civil action brought under that section for violation of 
§ 1591 (prohibiting transportation of minors for prostitution) "shall be stayed 
during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in 
which the claimant is the victim." 18 U.S.C. § 159l(b)(I). Whether the§ 1595 
plaintiff has turned 18 does not vitiate the efficacy of this mandatory stay. 
An example illustrates why the stay provided in § 3509(k) has the same 
broad scope as the stay provided in§ 159l(b)(l). As discussed above,§ 3509(k) 
stays any civil suit for injury to a minor, arising out of the same occurrence as a 
pending criminal action. One type of civil suit falling within § 3509(k)'s ambit is a 
suit seeking redress for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Section 2423(a) - - just 
like § 1591 - - prohibits transportation of minors for prostitution. The elements of 
both statutes are identical. There would simply be no legitimate basis for Congress 
to differentiate between the consequences attached to violating these two sections. 
Thus, just as Congress mandated under § l 595(b )( 1) that civil discovery shall be 
stayed when there is an ongoing federal investigation under§ 1591 (even after the 
victim turns 18), the identical treatment should apply under § 3509(k) to civil 
actions brought for the identical violation of§ 2423(a).

Logic compels a rule requiring continued application of the§ 3509(k) stay to 
a putative victim who has since turned 18. 
Consider again the example of 
§ 2243(a). Assume that the USAO is investigating a § 2243(a) violator with two 
alleged victims; one who is now 17, and one who has turned 19. Assume further 
that both decide to sue the alleged offender while the USAO is still in the process 
of conducting its criminal investigation. Why would Congress enact § 3509(k) to 
prohibit the defendant from conducting civil discovery in the 17-year-old's lawsuit, 
but permit him to conduct full discovery in the 19-year-old's lawsuit, including 
taking the depositions of both the 19- and the I 7-year-old, the federal investigating 
agents and all the grand-jury witnesses? This could not have been Congress' 
intent. 
The legislative history to a statute resembling § 1595 is also instructive. 
When Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. § 2255, it provided a civil remedy to any 
"minor ... victim" of enumerated federal sex offenses. See Child Abuse Victims' 
Rights Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-500, 100 Stat. 1783, § 703 ( 1986). In 2006, 
Congress amended the statute to clarify that the civil cause of action was available 
not just while the victim was a minor, but even after she or he turned 18. See Pub. 
L. 109-248, 120 Stat. 650, § 707 (b)(l)(A) (amending § 2255 to permit suit by 
adults who were victims of enumerated federal offenses when they were minors,

completion of a criminal action. See also 18 USC § 3509(k). 
H.R. Rep. 108-264(Il), 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003), reprinted at 2003 WL 
22272907, at *16-17 ("agency view" by the Department of Justice on bill later 
codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595). 
The Department specifically argued to Congress in the clearest terms: "We 
believe that prosecutions should take priority over civil redress and that 
prosecutions should be complete prior to going forward with civil suits." Id. at 17 
( emphasis added). Nowhere did the Department suggest that pending prosecutions 
warrant less protection (i.e., should be "hinder[ed]") simply because a particular 
civil plaintiff happens to reach his or her 18th birthday. 
IV. 
A Stay is Mandatory Despite Resulting "Delay" to Civil Lawsuits. 
Inherent in any § 3509(k) stay is delay to the progress (discovery, trial, 
appeal) of all related civil lawsuits. Congress recognized this in enacting the stay 
provision, which necessarily prioritized the interests of completing a criminal 
investigation and prosecution over the interests of a particular plaintiff in seeking 
personal pecuniary damages. 
Based on this reasoning, the Francis II court 
specifically refused to provide any relief to plaintiffs "simply because the state 
[criminal] matter is not progressing as fast as they would hope." The court made 
this determination despite the plaintiffs' complaints about the "frustrating delay" 
and that "the state criminal case 'has languished for almost two years with no end

in sight,"' finding that this "is a matter to be addressed in state [ criminal) court." 
Id. 
Accordingly, the anticipated delay in this case, attendant to the term of the 
deferred-prosecution agreement, does not change the clear command of§ 3509(k). 
According to her own pleadings, the plaintiff waited seven years before 
filing this lawsuit, Comp!. ,i,i 2,6, and so cannot rightfully claim prejudice from 
additional temporary delay. 
V. 
Section 3509 Aside, a Discretionary Stay is Warranted. 
Even, arguendo, were this Court not to apply the mandate of § 3509, a 
discretionary stay should still be entered during the pendency of the Federal 
Criminal Action. SEC v. Hea/thsouth Corp., 261 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1326 (N.D. 
Ala. 2003) ("No question exists that this court has the power to stay a civil 
proceeding due to an active, parallel criminal investigation."). 
Other federal 
statutes support such a stay -- particularly when the criminal action may be 
adversely affected by the civil litigation. 
For example, under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2712(e)(l), "the court shall stay any action commenced [against the United 
States) if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability 
of the Government to conduct a related investigation or prosecution of a related 
criminal case." Allowing this lawsuit to progress while Epstein remains subject to 
the Federal Criminal Action will prejudice him irrevocably and irreparably. As

provided below, there are several adverse effects to allowing this case to proceed 
while the Federal Criminal Action remains pending. 
In this lawsuit, Epstein has a right to defend himself. 
In the Federal 
Criminal Action, Epstein has a right against self-incrimination.4 
Without a stay, 
Epstein will be immediately forced to abandon one of these rights. 
Should he choose his Fifth Amendment rights, he will expose himself to an 
adverse inference at the summary-judgment stage and at trial. 
See generally. 
Wehling v. Columbia Broad. Sys, 611 F.2d 1026, 1027 (5th Cir. 1980) (observing 
that "invocation of the privilege would be subject to the drawing of an adverse 
inference by the trier of fact"). On the other hand, should Epstein choose his right 
to defend himself in this lawsuit, the USAO will be able to use his responses at 
every stage of the discovery and trial process (e.g., his Answer, responses to 
document requests, responses to requests for admissions, sworn answers to 
interrogatories, answers to deposition questions, and trial testimony) to his 
detriment in the Federal Criminal Action. 5 
' The privilege applies in "instances where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend 
danger" of criminal liability. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951). 
' This could give the USAO a tremendous advantage in prosecuting Epstein in the Federal 
Criminal Action. See Comment, Using Equitable Powers to Coordinate Parallel Civil and 
Criminal Actions, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1023, 1026 (1985) (observing that "the prosecutor may have 
access to detailed civil depositions of the accused witnesses, while the rules of criminal 
procedure bar the accused from deposing the prosecutor's witnesses").

In this lawsuit, even before civil discovery begins, under the Initial 
Disclosures required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and S.D. Fla. Local Rule 26.1, Epstein 
"must" disclose the identities of all the witnesses he would call in his defense to 
the Federal Criminal Action (Rule 26(a)(I )(A)(i)), copies of "all documents" he 
"may use to support [his] defenses" (Rule 26(a)( I )(A)(ii)), as well as the identity 
of "any" expert witness he "may use at trial," along with mandatory disclosure of 
"a written report" containing "a complete statement of all opinions the [expert] will 
express and the basis and reasons for them" (Rule 26(a)(2)(A) and (B)(i)). 
In contrast, in the pending Federal Criminal Action, which is governed 
exclusively by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the USAO would not be 
entitled to compel pre-trial production of any of this information. See Fed. R. Cr. 
P. 16(b)(l)(A), (C), and 16(b)(2); United States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 
1355-56 (I Ith Cir. 1991) (explaining act-of-production privilege). 
Thus, absent a stay of this civil action, the USAO would receive 
fundamentally unfair access to defense information and highly prejudicial advance 
insight into criminal defense strategy. See Comment, 98 Harv. L. Rev. at 1030 
("To the extent that a prosecutor acquires evidence that was elicited from the 
accused in a parallel civil proceeding, the criminal process becomes less 
adversarial.").

Without a stay m place, discovery will proceed, including against third 
parties. 
Mr. Epstein will have no alternative but to issue subpoenas seeking 
evidence from state and federal law-enforcement officers. For example, Epstein is 
clearly entitled to discover evidence of prior statements (including inconsistent 
statements) given by witnesses whom law-enforcement has previously interviewed. 
See, e.g., Cox v. Treadway, 75 F.3d 230 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding that district court 
properly admitted testimony of prosecutor about prior inconsistent statements that 
witness made to the prosecutor). Likewise, Epstein may be entitled to discovery of 
relevant evidence that is in the present possession of the grand jury or other law-
enforcement agencies. See, e.g., Simpson v. Hines, 729 F. Supp. 526, 527 (E.D. 
Tex. 1989) ("The grand jury has concluded its deliberations .... The need for 
secrecy of these specific tapes no longer outweighs other concerns."); Golden 
Quality Ice Cream Co., Inc. v. Deerfield Specialty Papers, Inc., 87 F.R.D. 53, 59 
(E.D. Pa. 1980) ("[W]here, as here, the grand jury has completed its work and all 
that is sought are those documents turned over to the grand jury by the 
corporations which are defendants in the civil case, the considerations . . . 
militating against disclosure are beside the point.") (citing Douglas Oil Co. of 
Calif v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211 (1979)). 
In response to such third-party subpoenas to law-enforcement witnesses, we 
anticipate that it will be the government, not Mr. Epstein, who will object to

l am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). 
The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police 
Department ("PBPD") into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had 
used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and 
seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses. 
3. 
Throughoutthe investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification 
letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBl's Victim-Witness 
Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three 
clients, •.•. and., Your Affiant's letter to- was provided by the FBI. (Ell. 
l ). Your Affiant's letter to-was hand-delivered by myself to- at the time that'She 
was interviewed (Ex. 2).2 Both -
and- also received letters from the FBl's Victim-
Witness Specialist, which were sent on January 10, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4}. -was identified 
via the FBl's investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to speak with investigators. 
status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by 
Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of"Jane Doe," without identifying which of 
his clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, l will address facts related to_,_ and. 
All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when 
they were fifteen years old. 
'Please not" that the dates on the U.S. Attorney's Office letters to •. and •. are not the 
dates that the letters were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in lhe 
investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.

federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBl's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to-
on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5). 
4. 
Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents. the FBl's Victim-Witness 
Specialist, and your Affiant had contact with- and. Attorney Edwards• other client, 
·• 
was represented by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with-was made through 
that attorney. That attorney was James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, 
the target of the investigation.3 
5. 
In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (·'the Office") entered into negotiations to resolve the 
investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with 
solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes§ 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys 
sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer 
federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic 
preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a 
federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one 
condition of that agreement. notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008. is 
the following: 
"Any pers•Jn, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same 
rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein 
'The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing -
or whether 
-ever fonnally tenninated Mr. Eisenberg's representation.

had been tried federully and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes 
ofimplem~nling this paragraph, the United Stales shall provide Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an 
Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority detennining 
which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is 
the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position 
as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no 
less.
' 
6. 
An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an 
express confidentiality provision. 
7. 
Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, 
several had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they 
desired a prompt resolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in 
September 2007, -was openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted 
to interview • 
in October 2007, at which time she refused to provide any infonnation 
regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be 
consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation. 
8. 
As explained above, one of the lenns of the agreement deferring prosecution 
to the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, 
shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions 
were discussed. One of those victims wasalll.vho at the time was not represented, and she 
was given notice of the agreement. Notice was also provided of an expected change of pJea 
in October 2007. When Epstein's attorneys learned that some of the victims had been

notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their 
involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your Affiant 
knew that the victims' statements had been taken and corroborated with independent 
evidence well before they were infonned of the potential for damages, the agents and I 
concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the witnesses' credibilit) at 
trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.

Afier •. 
had been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein 
performed his obligations,_ contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was attempting 
to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro 
bono counsel to represent •. and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was 
able to assist -· in avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bono counsel did not 
express to your Affiant that-was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter. 
I 0. 
In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to infonn me that 
he represented- and. and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding 
Epstein. I invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to 
consider. Nothing was provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider 
contacting the State Attorney's Office, ifhe so wished. I understand that no contact with that 
office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to -
so 1 advised him that, to my 
knowledge .• 
was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg.

11. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Alliant received a 
copy or the proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 
a.m., Monday, lune 30, 2008. Your A rfiant and the Palm Beach Police Department 
attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that Epstein's counsel had gi, en 
us. Although all known victims were not notified, your Alliant specifically called attorney 
Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. Your Arfiant believes that 
it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards notified me that he represente~ 
and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney Edwards informed 
your A ffiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Your 
Arfiant attended lhe hearing, but none or Attorney Edwards' clients was present. 
12. 
On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to 
-
and. via their attorney, Bradley Edwards (Exs. 6 & 7). A notification was not 
provided to • 
because the U.S. Attorney's modification limited Epstein's liability to 
victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an indictment. In light o-
prior statements to law enforcement. your Arfiant could not in good raith includ •. 
as a 
victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to 
Epstein's counsel. 
13. 
Furthermore, with respect to the Certification ofEm~ency, Attorney Edwards 
did not ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he 
requests in his Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had

C '··--
This cause is before the Court on the Complaint of the Florida 
sugar cane League, Inc. ("League") . 
The League seeks an order 
requiring a state agency, the Florida Department of Environmental 
Regulation ("DER") , to release certain documents under its custody 
and control, pursuant to the Florida Public Records Act, Chapter 
119, Florida Statutes. 
The facts in this case are as follows: 
DER is a Defendant in the case styled United States v. South 
Florida Water Management District. et al., case No. 88-1886-CIV-
Hoeveler, United States District Court, 
Southern District of 
Florida ("U.S. v. SFWMD") . 
DER, as a Defendant in that case, 
entered 
into settlement negotiations with the plaintiff as 
represented by the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"). 
During the negotiations, drafts of proposed settlement agreements 
and other information relating to the settlement proposal were 
made, sent or received by DER to and from federal agencies and

DER also entered into an agreement

On May 21, 1991, the League made a public records request for 
a draft of the settlement Agreement which the Secretary of DER had 
publicly stated as having been received by DER. 
On May 28, 1991, 
DER responded to the League's request by refusing to disclose the 
requested document claiming the document was privileged and immune 
to discovery. 
on May 31, 1991·, the League filed this action, 
pursuant to Chapter 119, 
Florida Statutes. 
A hearing was 
originally scheduled before this Court for June 5, 1991, but DER 
removed the case to federal district court, where it was ultimately 
transferred to the Southern District of Florida. 
The League filed 
a Motion to Quash DER's Notice of Removal, which motion was argued 
before Judge William Hoeveler on July 10, 1991, and was granted on 
September 10, 1991. 
The federal court held that there was no 
federal jurisdiction over the matter as the League's claim arises 
purely under state law, and Judge Hoeveler remanded the case back 
to this Court. 
A hearing was held before this Court on September 
16, 1991. 
Attorneys for the parties appeared and argued their 
respective positions. 
DOJ also appeared, pursuant to title 28, 
United states Codes, section 517, to argue in support of DER and to 
advise the Court of the United states' asserted interest in keeping 
the documents from public disclosure. 
DER asserts that Florida I s 
Public Records Act is ·not applicable in this matter because it has 
been preempted by "federal immunities and privileges. 11 
DER further 
claims that it has contractually vowed to the United States to 
withhold requested documents under the confidentiality agreement

into which it entered with DOJ, and that DER is acting as DOJ's 
agent in withholding the documents from public disclosure. 
This court rejects these arguments. Florida's public records 
law is sweeping in its breadth and requires virtua1ly unfettered 
public access to records in the custody of state agencies. 
Unless 
a statutorily provided exemption permits nondisclosure of public 
records, Florida law requires that all such records in the custody 
of state agencies be open and available for public inspection. The 
parties agreed that there is no statutory exemption in the Florida 
Public Records Act which would prevent disclosure of public records 
received by state agencies during settlement negotiations in u.s. 
v. SFWMD, including the records sought by the League in this case. 
DER has cited no applicable statutory exemption in the Florida 
Public Records Act, and the judiciary is without any authority to 
expand or create an exemption to Florida's public records law. 
Wait v. Florida Power & Light Co., 372 So. 2d 420 (Fla. 1979); 
Times Publishing co. v. city of st. Petersburg. 558 So. 2d 487 
(Fla. 2d DCA 1990). 
Principles of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause 
may, 
in limited circumstances, act to prevent application of 
Florida's public records law where there is a clear conflict with 
an express requirement of confidentiality provided in a federal 
statute. 
See Cummer v. Pace, 159 So. 2d 679, 681-82 (Fla. 1935); 
see generally. pp. 81-82, Florida's Government-in-the-Sunshine 
Manual, Office of the Attorney General (1991). 
In this case, 
although DER claims preemption under federal law of privileges and

immunities, it has cited no specific federal statute which clearly 
requires that the documents in question be kept confidential. 
DER also relies on DOJ's assertion that the documents would 
not be "discoverable" from DOJ in the pending case, and that 
documents are exempt from disclosure by DOJ under FOIA. 
Even 
assuming that were true, it is irrelevant to the application of 
Florida's public records law to documents in the custody of 
Florida's state agencies. 
As stated by Judge Hoeveler in remanding 
this action: 
Thus, while FOIA may provide an independent cause of 
action insofar as the document ~n dispute is also in the 
custody of a federal agency, 
1.. e. , the Department of 
Justice, it cannot be said to displace and supplant a 
state statute directed at state agencies and state 
records. 
(Hoeveler Order at p. 12.) 
DER's reliance on its confidentiality agreement with DOJ is 
equally misplaced. 
A state agency cannot bargain away its Public 
Records Act duties or create a "self-exemption" with a promise to 
third parties to keep records from disclosure to the public.

Judicial Circuit in and for Hardee County, Florida.

THEREFORE, it is hereby ORDERED and ADJUDGED that:

1. 
Settlement agreements made or received at any time by DER 
in connection with U.S. v. SFWMD are hereby declared to be public 
records subject to disclosure under the PUblic Records Act, Chapter

AGREED ORDER 
This cause came on to be heard upon the agreement of the parties, Jack 
Goldberger representing Jeffrey Epstein and Barbara Burns representing the State of 
Florida, and the Court being fully advised that the parties have reviewed both the plea 
agreement and the transcript of the plea conference in the Defendants case and have 
confirmed that the requirement of "mandatory public service" as a special condition of 
community control checked off on the Order Placing the Defendant on Community Control 
was due to a clerical error. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that the special 
condition of "mandatory public service" is deleted. 
The Court being further advised that the Order Placing the Defendant on Community 
Control did not address the Defendant's travel outside the State of Florida for work or 
business purposes and the parties desire to clarify that omission, it is hereby ordered and 
adjudged that the Defendant is authorized to travel outside the State of Florida for business 
and work purposes if allowed by his community control officer. At least 48 hours before 
the need to travel outside the State of Florida for work purposes the Defendant shall first 
obtain the permission of his community control officer and then follow any instructions or

COMES NOW the Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his undersigned 
attorney and moves this Honorable Court to enter an Order authorizing the Defendant to 
travel to New York on December 3, 2009 and December 12, 2009. In support thereof the 
Defendant would state as follows: 
1. The Defendant has been on community control since July 22, 2009. 
The Defendant has been in complete compliance with his conditions of community 
control since being placed on supervision. 
At a hearing on November 18, 2009 concerning the status of a No Contact Order, 
the Defendant, through counsel, requested this Honorable Court to allow the Defendant to 
travel for business purposes as long as he received the prior approval of his probation 
officer. The Court denied the motion at that time without prejudice and indicated that when 
there is a specific business trip planned for the Defendant to bring the matter back before 
the Court and it would be considered. 
The Defendant desires to travel to New York on December 3, 2009 and to return 
to West Palm Beach on the same date. The purpose of the meeting is forthe Defendant 
to meet with his attorney, Stephen Susman at the Law Office of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 
located at450 LexingtonAvenue, New York, New York 10017. The purpose of the meeting 

NOT A CERTIFIED COPY
is for Mr. Epstein and his attorney to review documents at the Davis Polk Law Offices. 
Attached hereto as Exhibit "A" is a letter from the Defendant's civil counsel, Stephen 
Susman, confirming the need for the meeting to take place at the Davis Polk Law Office in 
New York. 
The Defendant would travel to New York on the morning of December 3, 2009 and 
would return to West Palm Beach on the evening of December 3, 2009. The Defendant 
would confirm the specific times of his travel with his probation officer prior to travel. 
6. The Defendant also needs to travel to New York on December 12, 2009 for a 
meeting with a governmental official from a foreign country. Once again, the Defendant 
would travel to New York on the morning of December 12, 2009 and would return the 
evening of December 12, 2009. The Defendant would once again confirm the specific travel 
times with his probation officer prior to travel. 
WHEREFORE, the Defendant moves this Honorable Court to enter an Order 
authorizing the Defendant to travel for the day on December 3, 2009 and December 12, 
2009. 
I HEREBY CERTIFY that a copy of the foregoing has been furnished by mail to

On December 3, 2009, Jeffrey Epstein and I met with opposing counsel in New 
York City, New York on a matter to review certain confidential documents, which 
counsel only would provide for our review in his offices. The meeting was very 
helpful,- but necessary time with Mr. Epstein was cut short due to his obvious time 
constraints. 
It is clear that the case requires considerable time, and is at the stage that we must 
review considerable additional documents and attempt to interview potential 
witnesses. It is impractical to bring the lawyers for the other side with their 
documents to Florida and Mr. Epstein's presence is required to prepare for and 
interview potential witnesses, who live in the New York area. We will need three 
more days of meetings with Mr. Epstein to determine our next course of action.

As a result, I would request that you provide me with a period of three days when 
Mr. Epstein can be available in New York to continue to work with us on this 
matter. 
Thank you.

You are hereby notified that you have completed your term( s) of supervision, as referenced above, and are no 
longer under the supervision of the Department of Corrections. 
If you were adjudicated guilty of a felony offense, your name will be submitted to the Florida Parole Commission 
for consideration for restoration of the civil rights that you lost as a result of your felony conviction (right to vote, 
right to hold public office, and the right to serve on a jury). If your rights are restored, a certificate ofrestoration of 
civil rights will be mailed by the Office of Executive Clemency to your last mailing address of record usually within 
one year following the termination of supervision. If your rights are not restored through this initial referral, you 
will be notified by the Florida Parole Commission and furnished an additional application for submission for 
restoration of civil rights with a hearing. If you have any questions about your civil rights, you may contact the 
Office of Executive Clemency for further information by calling (850) 488-2952 or by writing to that office at 
Florida Parole Commission, 2601 Blair Stone Road, Building C, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2450. Information and 
application forms may be accessed through the following web site: www.state.fl.us/fpc/exclem.html. 
After eight (8) years from termination of your supervision, you may apply to regain your right to own firearms. 
Applications can be obtained from the Office of Executive Clemency or be accessed by the web site noted above. 
If adjudication was withheld, you did not lose your civil rights, however, the Florida Department of Law 
Enforcement (FDLE) may refuse the right for you to purchase a firearm following successful completion of 
supervision, pursuant to Section 790.065 Florida Statutes. Contact your local FDLE office if you have questions 
regarding this law.
