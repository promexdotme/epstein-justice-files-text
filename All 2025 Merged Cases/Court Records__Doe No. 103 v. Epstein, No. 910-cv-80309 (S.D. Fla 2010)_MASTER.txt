STATEMENT OF FACTS 
8. 
At all relevant times, Defendant was an adult male spanning the ages of 45 and 55 
years old. Defendant is known as a billionaire financier and money manager with a secret 
clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is a man of tremendous wealth, power, and 
influence. He owns a fleet of aircraft that includes a Gulfstream IV, a he1.icopter, and a Boeing 
727, as well as a fleet of motor vehicles. Until his incarceration pursuant to the plea entered and 
sentencing, which occurred on June 30, 2008, he maintained his principal place of residence in 
the largest dwelling in Manhattan, a 51,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on the Upper East 
Side. He also owns a $6.8 million mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a $30 million 7 ,500-acre 
ranch in New Mexico he named "Zorro," a 70-acre private island known as Little St. James in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, a mansion in London's Westminster neighborhood, and another 
residence in the Avenue Foch area of Paris. The allegations herein concern Defendant's conduct 
while at his lavish residence in Palm Beach and numerous other locations both nationally and 
internationally. 
9. 
Defendant has a sexual preference for underage minor girls. He engaged in a 
plan, scheme, or enterprise in which he gained access to countless vulnerable and relatively 
economically disadvantaged minor girls, and sexually assaulted, molested, and/or exploited these 
girls, and then gave them money.

10. 
Beginning in or around 1998 through in or around September 2007, Defendant 
used his resources and his influence over vulnerable minor girls to engage in a systematic pattern 
of sexually exploitative behavior. 
11. 
Defendant's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. 
Defendant coerced and enticed impressionable, vulnerable, and relatively economically less 
fortunate minor girls to participate in various acts of sexual misconduct that he committed upon 
them. Defendant's scheme involved the use of underage girls, as well as other individuals, to 
recruit underage girls. Defendant and/or an authorized agent would call and alert Defendant's 
assistants shortly before or after he arrived at his Palm Beach residence. His assistants would 
call economically disadvantaged and underage girls from West Palm Beach and surrounding 
areas who would be enticed by the money being offered and who Defendant and/or his assistants 
perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility issues if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. The then minor Plaintiff and other minor girls, some as young as 
years old, were transported to Defendant's Palm Beach mansion by Defondant's employees, 
agents, and/or assistants in order to provide Defendant with "massages." 
12. 
Many of the instances of illegal sexual conduct committed by Defendant were 
perpetrated with the assistance, support, and facilitation of at least three assistants who helped 
him orchestrate this child exploitation enterprise. These assistants would arrange times for 
underage girls to come to Defendant's residence, transport or cause the transportation of 
underage girls to Defendant's residence, escmi the underage girls to the massage room where 
Defendant would be waiting or would enter shortly thereafter, urge the underage girls to remove 
their clothes, deliver cash from Defendant to the underage girls and/or their procurers at the 
conclusion of each "massage appointment," and assist Defendant in taking nude photographs

and/or videos of the underage girls with and/or without their knowledge. Defendant would pay 
the procurer of each girl's "appointment" hundreds of dollars. 
13. 
Defendant designed this scheme to secure a private place in Defendant's Palm 
Beach mansion where only persons employed and invited by Defendant would be present, so as 
to reduce the chance of detection of Defendant's sexual abuse and/or exploitation, as well as to 
make it more difficult for the minor girls to flee the premises and/or to credibly report his actions 
to law enforcement or other authorities. The girls were usually transported by his employee(s), 
agent(s), and/or assistant(s) and/or by taxicab(s) and/or motor vehicle(s) paid for by Defendant, 
which also made it difficult for the girls to flee his mansion. 
14. 
Upon her initial arrival at Defendant's Palm Beach mans10n, each underage 
victim would generally be introduced to one of Defendant's assistants, who would gather the 
girl's personal contact information. The minor girl would be led up a remote flight of stairs to a 
room that contained a massage table and a large shower. 
15. 
At times, if it was the girl's first "massage" appointment, another female would 
be in the room to "lead the way." Generally the other female would leave, or Defendant would 
dismiss her. Often, Defendant would start his massage wearing only a small towel, which 
eventually would be removed. Defendant and/or the other female would direct the girl to 
massage him, giving the minor girl specific instructions as to where and how he wanted to be 
touched, and then direct her to remove her clothing. Defendant would then perform one or more 
lewd, lascivious, and sexual acts, including masturbation; fondling the minor's breasts and/or 
sexual organs; touching the minor's vulva, vagina, and/or anus with a vibrator, back massager, 
his finger(s), and/or his penis; digitally penetrating her vagina; performing intercourse, oral sex, 
and/or anal sex; and/or coercing or attempting to coerce the girl to engage in lewd acts and/or

prostitution and/or enticing the then minor girl to engage in sexual acts with another female in 
Defendant's presence. The exact degree of molestation and frequency with which the sexual 
exploitations took place varied and is not yet completely known; however, Defendant committed 
such acts regularly on a daily basis and, in most instances, several times a day. In order to 
facilitate the daily exchanges of money for sexual assault and abuse, Defendant kept U.S. 
currency readily available. 
16. 
Defendant traveled out of Florida to Palm Beach for the purpose of luring 
minor girls to his mansion to sexually abuse and/or batter them. He used the telephone to contact 
these minor girls for the purpose of coercing them into acts of prostitution and to enable himself 
to commit sexual battery against them and/or acts of lewdness in their presence, and he conspired 
with others, including his employee(s), assistant(s), driver(s), pilot(s), and/or agent(s), to 
facilitate these acts and to avoid police detection. Defendant's systematic pattern of sexually 
exploitative behavior described above also occurred in Defendant's other domestic and/or 
international residences, places oflodging, and/or modes of transportation. 
17. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Defend.ant used his money, 
wealth, and power to unduly and improperly manipulate and influence the then minor Plaintiff. 
A vulnerable young girl, Plaintiff was merely a seventeen year old high school student when she 
was first lured into Defendant's sexually exploitative world in or about January 2004. Plaintiff 
was recruited while at work by a co-worker, one of the minor victims Defendant paid to procure 
underage females. Plaintiff went to Defendant's Palm Beach mansion accompanied by this co-
worker. Upon arriving, Plaintiff was led by one of Defendant's assistants up a flight of stairs to a 
spa room with a shower and a massage table. Defendant entered this room wearing only a towel. 
Defendant suddenly removed his towel, exposing his naked body, and then lay on the massage

table. Defendant told Plaintiff to massage his back and take off her clothing, which she refused 
to do. Defendant then began to try to touch the minor Plaintiff and/or take off her clothing. 
After Defendant's relentless pawing, she reluctantly removed some of her clothing. During this 
encounter, Defendant turned over on his back and fondled Plaintiffs breasts, despite her 
repeatedly telling him not to do so. As Plaintiff massaged Defendant, Defendant proceeded to 
masturbate until ejaculation. Defendant then paid Plaintiff two hundred dollars, and Plaintiff 
was escorted out of Defendant's mansion and left Defendant's property. 
18. 
A similar pattern of grooming continued, and the sexual exploitation 
progressively escalated, over the course of approximately seventeen months during which 
Defendant would often travel to Palm Beach. Prior to arriving and wf·,ile in Palm Beach, 
Defendant and/or his agent(s) would frequently call Plaintiff at her home telephone number 
and/or other telephone numbers, arranging for encounters with her for Defendant, sometimes 
twice daily. While usually such contacts were made by his assistants, Defendant personally 
called Plaintiff repeatedly, despite being told to leave Plaintiff alone. After the first few 
encounters, Defendant coerced Plaintiff to remove all her clothing, and Defendant penetrated the 
minor Plaintiffs vagina digitally. Defendant sexually abused and/or battered and/or exploited 
Plaintiff at least a hundred times between approximately January 2004 and May 2005. Such 
exploitation included, but was not limited to, Defendant's sexual abuse and battery of Plaintiff 
with vibrator(s), back massager(s), his finger(s), and his penis. At times, Defendant manipulated 
Plaintiff to interact sexually with another female. During one encounter, Dt!fendant penetrated 
the minor Plaintiffs vagina with his penis, all the while narrating and demonstrating his sexual 
battery of Plaintiff to another female present in the room. While some of the precise dates that 
Defendant's acts of sexual exploitation occurred are unknown to Plaintiff, these dates are known

to Defendant, as he and/or his assistants kept written records, some of which are in the custody 
of law enforcement, of each instance in which he committed lewd acts upon minor girls, 
including the then minor Plaintiff. 
19. 
Defendant's preference for underage girls was well-known to those who regularly 
procured them for him. The above-described acts of abuse began to occur during a time when 
Defendant knew that Plaintiff was a minor. Defendant, at all times material to this cause of 
action, knew and/or should have known of Plaintiff's age of minority. In fact, Defendant 
repeatedly urged the minor Plaintiff to become legally emancipated in order to accompany him 
as he traveled, both nationally and internationally. Additionally, Defendant, knowing that 
Plaintiff was merely seventeen years old, lured her by inviting her to stay with him at his 
mansion in Manhattan and arranging and/or paying for airplane tickets, theater tickets, and a 
personal chauffeur as gifts for her upcoming birthday. 
20. 
As part of Defendant's persistent process of grooming Plaintiff and immersing her 
in his lewd and abusive lifestyle, Defendant regularly showered the adoL~3cent Plaintiff with 
gifts, including, but not limited to lingerie, flowers, bikini bathing suit(s), art book(s), purse(s), 
envelopes of U.S. currency, use of a car, and/or other accoutrements. 
21. 
Defendant possessed photographs of nude underage girls, some of which may 
have been taken with hidden cameras set up in his residence in Palm Beach. On the day of 
Defendant's arrest, police found two hidden cameras and photographs of underage girls in 
Defendant's mansion. Defendant took lewd photographs of Plaintiff with his hidden cameras 
and transported lewd photographs of Plaintiff and other victims elsewhere using a facility or 
means of interstate and/or foreign commerce. On one occasion, Defendant manipulated the 
minor Plaintiff to pose nude for him and photographed her using several rolls of film. One or

more of those nude photographs of Plaintiff that were taken by the Defendant when she was a 
minor were confiscated by the Palm Beach Police Department during its execution of a search 
warrant of Defendant's Palm Beach mansion on October 20, 2005. 
22. 
Defendant was particularly skillful at discerning his minor victims' respective 
hopes, dreams, and ambitions. As he did with many of his victims, Defendant lured Plaintiff 
early-on with modeling opportunities, impressing her with his modeling business and contacts 
with supermodels, indicating that he could help her with a modeling career. 
23. 
Knowing that the minor Plaintiff was an excellent student and desired to attend 
New York University or Columbia University, Defendant pretended to show great interest in her 
college admission, and offered to help her with her applications and to assist her with her 
tuition. Defendant had told Plaintiff of his substantial connections within the academic 
community, a matter about which he often bragged. Defendant took it upon himself to take 
control of Plaintiff's college application process and led Plaintiff to believe that he was sincere 
about helping her. Even though she had earned a Bright Futures Scholarship to the Florida 
college of her choice, Defendant insisted that she would not need it, and that, with his 
involvement, she would be admitted into one or both of the universities in New York. As a 
result of Defendant's manipulation, Plaintiff did not apply timely for the Bright Futures 
Scholarship or to any college, and therefore missed the fall semester of her freshman year. When 
the Palm Beach Police Department executed the search warrant on Defend.m1t's mansion, among 
the artifacts found and confiscated were Plaintiff's high school transcript. 
24. 
In June 2008, after an investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department, the 
State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's 
Office, Defendant entered pleas of "guilty" to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in

violation of Fla. Stat. § 796.07, and one count of solicitation of a minor to engage in prostitution, 
in violation of Fla. Stat. § 796.03 in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County, Florida. 
25. 
As a condition of that plea, Defendant entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement, 
Addendum, and Affirmation (collectively, the "NPA") with the United States Attorney's Office 
for the Southern District of Florida on September 24, 2007, October 29, 2007, and December 7, 
2007, respectively. In so doing, Defendant acknowledged that Plaintiff was one of his victims 
and agreed to the following provisions of the NP A : 
8. If any of the [acknowledged victims] elects to file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court 
for the Southern District of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and 
Epstein waives his right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest 
damages up to an amount agreed to between the identified individual and Epstein, 
so long as the identified individual elects to proceed exclusively under 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, and agrees to waive any other claim for damages, whether pursuant to 
state, federal or common law. 
10. Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under 18 
US.C. §2255, as set forth in paragraph (8), supra, neither Epstein's signature on 
this agreement, nor its terms, nor any resulting waivers or settlements by Epstein 
are to be construed as admissions of evidence or evidence of civil or criminal 
liability or a waive of any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person, whether 
or not her name appears on the list provided by the United States ( emphasis 
added). 
26. 
Plaintiff was among the individuals identified by the United States Attorney's 
Office as victims of Defendant upon whose testimony it intended to base its federal prosecution 
of Defendant for his illegal conduct. Consequently, Defendant is estopped by his state court plea 
and the Non-Prosecution Agreement from denying the acts alleged in this Complaint and must 
effectively admit liability to Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 103.

UNOPPOSED MOTION TO SEAL AND PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY 
AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 103, by and through her undersigned counsel and pursuant to Rule 
.4 S. D .Fla.LR., moves this Court to enter an Order granting Plaintiff permission to file her identity 
under seal and to proceed in this action under the pseudonym "Jane Doe No. 103" and, as grounds, 
states as follows: 
1. 
As outlined in detail in the Complaint, Jane Doe No. 103 was sexually abused by 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, when she was under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a result of Defendant's sexual abuse, Plaintiff has in the past suffered, and will 
in the future suffer, physical injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, psychological and/or 
psychiatric trauma, mental anguish, humiliation, confusion, embarrassment, loss of educational 
opportunities, loss of self-esteem, loss of dignity, invasion of her privacy, and other damages 
associated with Defendant's manipulating and leading her into a perverse and unhealthy way oflife 
for a minor.

3. 
Disclosure of Plaintiff's name would cause her much additional embarrassment, 
humiliation, and psychological trauma. 
4. 
The subject matter of the Complaint clearly contains highly sensitive and intimate 
information about Plaintiff. 
5. 
Plaintiff was an identified victim by the State Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau 
Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office in their criminal investigations against 
Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein. 
6. 
During the related criminal investigations, and up and to this point in time, Plaintiff's 
identity has been sealed, as all parties recognize the highly sensitive subject matter of the charges 
and the need to protect the privacy interest of Plaintiff's identity. 
7. 
In this civil action, Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, already knows Plaintiff's identity and 
will be privy to the sealed document containing Plaintiff's name. Therefore, he knows the identity 
of Plaintiff and will not be prejudiced by public non-disclosure of Jane Doe No. 103 's identity. 
8. 
There is great need, in this case, to protect intimate information about Plaintiff, Jane 
Doe No. 103, and to protect her privacy interest. 
Memorandum of Law 
The general presumption against anonymous or pseudonymous pleadings, is commonly 
overcome in certain types of cases, and courts have discretion to permit such pleading in appropriate 
circumstances. "[P]rivacy or confidentiality concerns are sometimes sufficiently critical that parties 
or witnesses should be allowed this rare dispensation." James v. Jacobson, 6 F.3d 233,238 ( 4th Cir. 
1993 ). As is ordinarily the case where trial courts have discretion, judicial guidelines exist for the

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 2   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/09/2010   Page 3 of 7
CASE NO. 
exercise of such discretion in the form of factors that courts should consider in deciding whether to 
grant anonymity requests. They are not many, for the question happily is one that is seldom raised. 
Nevertheless, some guidelines can be gleaned from the relatively few cases-both at the trial and 
appellate levels-that have wrestled with the problem. Among them are the following that have 
relevance to this case: whether the justification asserted by the requesting party is merely to avoid 
the annoyance and criticism that may attend any litigation or to preserve privacy in a matter of 
sensitive and highly personal nature; whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or 
mental harm to the requesting party or, even more critically, to innocent non-parties; the ages of the 
persons whose privacy interests are sought to be protected; and, relatedly, the risk of unfairness to 
the opposing party from allowing an action against it to proceed anonymously. See id. (internal 
citations omitted). 
In deciding whether to permit pseudonymous pleadings, courts must balance "the plaintiff's 
right to privacy and security against the dual concerns of (1) public interest in identification of 
litigants and (2) harm to the defendant stemming from [suppression] of plaintiff's name." Doe v. 
Smith, 105 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (internal citation omitted). The ultimate test for 
permitting a plaintiff to proceed anonymously is whether the plaintiff has a substantial privacy right 
that outweighs the customary presumption of openness in judicial proceedings. See Doe v. Stegall, 
653 F.2d 180, 185-86 (5th Cir., 1981). Courts typically accept pseudonym filing in cases where the 
nature of the pleading unveils highly sensitive information and detail about the plaintiff, such that 
the non-disclosure of the party's name is necessary to protect her from harassment, injury, ridicule, 
or personal embarrassment. See United States v. Doe, 655 F.2d 920, 922 n.1 (9th Cir. 1981); see

discriminatory practices; no unfairness to defendant, who was aware of claimant's identity); Candy 
H v. Redemption Ranch, 563 F. Supp. 505 (M.D. Ala. 1983) (anonymity allowed in suit by pregnant 
19-year-old alleging fraudulent inducement to enter defendant's Home for Girls). 
It is clear from the allegations of sexual abuse of a minor in the Complaint that the 
information is of a highly sensitive nature. Jane Doe No. 103 's name remained anonymous in the 
related criminal cases, and Defendant's attorneys, the State Attorney's Office, as well as the United 
States government, redacted all documents containing her name. The present case is not one in 
which permitting Plaintiffs identity to be kept under seal and allowing her to proceed anonymously 
will disadvantage Defendant in any way. Defendant already knows Plaintiffs identity and will be

DEFINITE STATEMENT & STRIKE DIRECTED TO PLAINTIFF 
JANE DOE NO. 103'S COMPLAINT (dated 2/23/20101 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his undersigned counsel, moves to 
exceed the page limitation of20 pages imposed by Loe. Gen. Rule 7.1. C. 2. (S.D. Fla.), 
in his response to Plaintiff JANE DOE NO. 103 's Complaint, dated February 23, 2010. 
In support of his motion, Defendant states: 
1. Local Gen. Rule 7 .1 C. 2. provides in part that absent prior permission of the 
court, no party shall file any legal memorandum exceeding twenty pages in length. 
Defendant is in the process of preparing his response to Plaintiffs Complaint, (presently 
due on March 26, 2010, but Plaintiff has agreed to an extension until April 5, 2010), and 
the response will exceed the 20 page limitation. It is clear, based on the issues raised in 
Plaintiffs Complaint that in excess of 20 pages is required to fully and adequately 
respond to and discuss the issues raised. Defendant anticipates needing to exceed the 
page limitation for his legal memorandum by 6 to 8 pages. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 7   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/25/2010   Page 2 of 3
2. A length exceeding 20 pages is required so that Defendant may fully address the 
issues raised in Plaintiffs Complaint which attempts to assert six counts pursuant to I 8 
U.S.C. §2255. Under the constitutional guarantees of due process, including a fair and 
full opportunity to be heard, and in the interests of justice so that the Court may render a 
fully informed decision on the issue, Defendant is entitled to an order granting his motion 
to exceed the 20 page limitation in his response. 
3. As certified below herein, Plaintiffs counsel agreed to the request to exceed 20 
pages. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court grant Defendant's 
motion, and enter an order allowing a response in excess of 20 pages.

CASE NO. 10-80309-CIV-
JANE DOE No. 103, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFERY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
------------~/ 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO DISMISS.COUNT VI & 
FOR MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT & TO STRIKE 
DIRECTED TO PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO. 103'S 
COMPLAINT (dated 2/23/2010) 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel, moves to dismiss Count Six of Plaintiff JANE DOE 103's Complaint for failure 
to state a cause of action, as specified herein. Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P. (2009); Local 
Gen. Rule 7.1 (S.D. Fla. 2009). Defendant further moves for More Definite Statement 
and to Strike. Rule 12( e) and (f), In support of his motion, Defendant states: 
The Complaint attempts to allege 6 counts, all of which are purportedly brought 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255-Civil Remedies for Personal Injuries. Count Six is subject 
to dismissal because the predicate act relied upon by Plaintiff for her claims did not come 
into effect until July 27, 2006, well after the conduct alleged by Plaintiff occurred. The 
More Definite Statement requested is for Plaintiff to allege her date of birth in that her 
being a minor has significance in the claims she alleges.

Supporting Memorandum of Law 
Principles of Statutory Interpretation 
It is well settled that in interpreting a statute, the court's inquiry begins with the 
plain and unambiguous language of the statutory text. CBS, Inc. v. Prime Time 24 
Venture, 245 F.3d 1217 (I I th Cir. 2001); U.S. v. Castroneves, 2009 WL 528251, *3 (S.D. 
Fla. 2009), citing Reeves v. Astrue, 526 F.3d 732, 734 (11 th Cir. 2008); and Smith v. 
Husband, 376 F.Supp.2d at 610 ("When interpreting a statute, [a court's] inquiry begins 
with the text."). "The Court must first look to the plain meaning of the words, and 
scrutinize the statute's 'language, structure, and purpose."' Id. In addition, in construing 
a statute, a court is to presume that the legislature said what it means and means what it 
said, and not add language or give some absurd or strained interpretation. As stated in 
CBS, Inc., supra at 1228 - "Those who ask courts to give effect to perceived legislative 
intent by interpreting statutory language contrary to its plain and unambiguous meaning 
are in effect asking courts to alter that language, and ' [ c ]ourts have no authority to alter 
statutory language .... We cannot add to the terms of [the] provision what Congress left 
out.' Merritt, 120 F.3d at 1187." See also Dodd v. U.S., 125 S.Ct. 2478 (2005); 73 
Am.Jur.2d Statutes§ 124. 
Title 18 of the U.S.C. is entitled "Crimes and Criminal Procedure." §2255 is 
contained in "Part I. Crimes, Chap. 110. Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of 
Children." 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2002)1, is entitled Civil remedy for personal injuries, and 
provides: 
(a) Any minor who is a victim ofa violation of section 224l(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 
2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers 
The above quoted version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 was the same beginning in 1999 until 
amended in 2006, effective July 27, 2006. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 3 of 15
personal injury as a result of such violation may sue in any appropriate United 
States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such minor sustains 
and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as 
described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages 
of no less than $50,000 in value. 
(b) Any action commenced under this section shall be barred unless the complaint 
is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues or in the case of a 
person under a legal disability, not later than three years after the disability. 
See endnote 1 hereto for statutory text as amended in 2006, effective July 27, 
2006. Prior to the 2006 amendments, the version of the statute quoted above was in 
effect beginning in 1999 .1 
All of Plaintiffs allegations of abuse occurred between January 2004 and May 
2005 (par. 18), well prior to 18 U.S.C. §2255 being amended. 
Motion to Dismiss 
Plaintiff's reliance on the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, snch reliance is 
improper. The version of Defendant's position that 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect 
prior to the 2006 amendments applies to this action, and therefore Count Six is 
required to be dismissed as it relies on a predicate act that was not in effect at 
the time of the alleged conduct.23 
Plaintiff does not specifically allege in her Complaint on which version of 18 
U.S.C. §2255 she is relying. However, in Count Six of her Complaint, ~50, she alleges 
that Defendant "knowingly engaged in a child exploitation enterprise, as defined in 18 
U.S.C. §2252A(g)(2), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2252A(g)(l)." §2252A is one of the 
specified predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. §2255. However, subsection (g) of §2252 was 
Points (2) and (3) are addressed together as the legal arguments overlap. 
In other §2255 actions filed against Defendant, Defendant has previously asserted the position 
that 18 U.S.C. §2255's creates a single cause of action on behalf of a plaintiff against a 
defendant, as opposed to multiple causes of action on a per violation basis or as opposed to an 
allowance of a multiplication of the statutory presumptive minimum damages or "actual 
damages." EPSTEIN asserts his position regarding the single recovery of damages in order to 
properly preserve all issues pertaining to the proper application of §2255 for appeal. EPSTEIN 
will fully honor his obligations as set forth in the Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United 
States Attorney's Office; principally, as related to the claims made in this case by Jane Doe 103, 
the obligations as set forth in paragraph 8 of that Agreement. In particular, EPSTEIN will not 
contest the allegation that he committed at least one predicate offense as alleged by Jane Doe 
103. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 4 of 15
not added to the statute until 2006. Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff is relying on the 
amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, such reliance is improper and Count Six is required 
to be dismissed as it relies on a statutory predicate act that did not exist at the time of the 
alleged conduct. 
The statute in effect during the time the alleged conduct occurred is 18 U.S.C. 
§2255 (2005) - the version in effect prior to the 2006 amendment, eff. Jul. 27, 2006, 
( quoted above), and having an effective date of 1999 through July 26, 2006. 
See 
endnote 1 hereto. Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that Defendant's conduct occurred during 
the time period from the age of 17, January 2004 until approximately May 2005. 
Complaint, 1117, 18. Thus, the version in effect in 2004-2005 of 18 U.S.C. §2255 
applies. 
It is an axiom of law that "retroactivity is not favored in the law." Bowen, 488 
U.S., at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471 (1988). As eloquently stated in Landgraf v. USI Film 
Products, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1497, 511 U.S. 244, 265-66 (1994): 
. . . the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our 
jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. 
Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an 
opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled 
expectations should not be lightly disrupted.FNI& For that reason, the "principle that the 
legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the 
conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 855, 110 
S.Ct., at 1586 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in both 
commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people 
confidence about the legal consequences of their actions. 
FN18. See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 191, 112 S.Ct. 1105, 
1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation presents problems of 
unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation, because 
it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions"); 
[Further citations omitted]. 
It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity principle finds expression in 
several provisions of our Constitution. The Ex Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits 
retroactive application of penal legislation.FN19 Article I, § 10, cl. I, prohibits States 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 5 of 15
from passing another type of retroactive legislation, laws "impairing the Obligation of 
Contracts." The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the Legislature ( and other 
government actors) from depriving private persons of vested property rights except for 
a "public use" and upon payment of ''.just compensation." The prohibitions on "Bills of 
Attainder" in Art. I, § § 9-10, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons 
and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e.g., United States v. 
Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 456-462, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 1719-1722, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965). The 
Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be 
compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification sufficient to validate a statute's 
prospective application under the Clause "may not suffice" to warrant its retroactive 
application. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2893, 
L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). 
FN19. Article I contains two Ex Post Facto Clauses, one directed to Congress(§ 9, 
cl. 3), the other to the States (§ 10, cl. I). We have construed the Clauses as 
applicable only to penal legislation. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390-391, I 
L.Ed. 648 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.). 
These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular concerns. The 
Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly 
and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a 
risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution 
against unpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall observed in his opinion for 
**1498 the Comt in Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 
(1981), the Ex Post Facto Clause not only ensures that individuals have "fair warning" 
about the effect of criminal statutes, but also "restricts governmental power by 
restraining arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation." Id., at 28-29, 101 S.Ct., at 
963-964 ( citations omitted). FN2D 
FN20. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 513-514, 109 S.Ct. 706, 
732, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) ("Legislatures are primarily policymaking bodies that 
promulgate rules to govern future conduct. The constitutional prohibitions against 
the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder reflect a valid concern 
about the use of the political process to punish or characterize past conduct of 
private citizens. It is the judicial system, rather than the legislative process, that is 
best equipped to identify past wrongdoers and to fashion remedies that will create 
the conditions that presumably would have existed had no wrong been committed") 
(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); James v. United 
States, 366 U.S. 213, 247, n. 3, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1052, n. 3, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) 
(retroactive punitive measures may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous 
conduct generally but to impose by legislation a penalty against specific persons or 
classes of persons"). 
These well entrenched constitutional protections and presumptions against 
retroactive application of legislation establish that 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005) in effect at the 
time of the alleged conduct applies to the instant action, and not the amended version. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 6 of 15
Not only is there no clear express intent stating that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, but applying the current version of the statute, as amended in 2006, would 
be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution as it 
would be applied to events occurring before its enactment and would increase the penalty 
or punishment for the alleged crime. U.S. Const. Art. 1, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. I. U.S. v. 
Seigel, 153 F.3d 1256 (11 th Cir. 1998); U.S. v. Edwards, 162 F.3d 87 (3d Cir. 1998); and 
generally, Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648, 1798 WL 587 (Calder) (1798). 
The United States Constitution provides that "[ n Jo Bill of Attainder or ex 
post facto Law shall be passed" by Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3. A law 
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it" 'appli[es] to events occurring before its 
enactment ... [and] disadvantage[s] the offender affected by it' by altering the 
definition of criminal conduct or increasing the punishment for the crime." 
Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997) (quoting 
Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981)). 
U.S. v. Siegel,153 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11 th Cir. 1998). 
The statute, as amended in 2006, contains no language stating that the application 
is to be retroactive. 
Thus, there is no manifest intent that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, and, accordingly, the statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct 
is to apply. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, supra, at 1493, ("A statement that a statute 
will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any 
application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date."). 
This statute was enacted as part of the Federal Criminal Statutes targeting sexual 
predators and sex crimes against children. H.R. 3494, "Child Protection and Sexual 
Predator Punishment Act of 1998;" House Report No. 105-557, 11, 1998 U.S.C.A.N. 
678, 679 (1998). Quoting from the "Background and Need For Legislation" portion of 
the House Report No. 105-557, 11-16, H.R. 3494, of which 18 U.S.C. §2255 is included, 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 7 of 15
is described as "the most comprehensive package of new crimes and increased penalties 
ever developed in response to crimes against children, particularly assaults facilitated by 
computers." 
Further showing that §2255 was enacted as a criminal penalty or 
punishment, "Title II - Punishing Sexual Predators," Sec. 206, from House Report No. 
105-557, 5-6, specifically includes reference to the remedy created under §2255 as an 
additional means of punishing sexual predators, along with other penalties and 
punishments. Senatorial Comments in amending §2255 in 2006 confirm that the creation 
of the presumptive minimum damage amount is meant as an additional penalty against 
those who sexually exploit or abuse children. 2006 WL 2034118, 152 Cong. Rec. S8012-
02. Senator Kerry refers to the statutorily imposed damage amount as "penalties." Id. 
The cases of U.S. v. Siegel, supra (11 th Cir. 1998), and U.S. v. Edwards, supra (3d 
Cir. 1998), also support Defendant's position that application of the current version of 18 
U.S.C. §2255 would be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. In Siegel, the 
Eleventh Circuit found that the Ex Post Facto Clause barred application of the Mandatory 
Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA) to the defendant whose criminal conduct 
occurred before the effective date of the statute, 18 U.S.C. §3664(f)(l)(A), even though 
the guilty plea and sentencing proceeding occurred after the effective date of the statute. 
On July 19, 1996, the defendant Siegel pleaded guilty to various charges under 18 U.S.C. 
§371 and §1956(a)(l)(A), (conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, and 
laundering of money instruments; and money laundering). He was sentenced on March 
7, 1997. As part of his sentence, Siegel was ordered to pay $1,207,000.00 in restitution 
under the MVRA which became effective on April 24, I 996. Pub.L. No. I 04-132, 110 
Stat. 1214, 1229-1236. The 1996 amendments to MVRA required that the district court 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 8 of 15
must order restitution in the full amount of the victim's loss without consideration of the 
defendant's ability to pay. Prior to the enactment of the MVRA and under the former 18 
U.S.C. §3664(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), Pub.I. No. 
97-291, 96 Stat. 1248, the court was required to consider, among other factors, the 
defendant's ability to pay in determining the amount ofrestitution. 
When the MVRA was enacted in 1996, Congress stated that the amendments to the 
VWP A "shall, to the extent constitutionally permissible, be effective for sentencing 
proceedings in cases in which the defendant is convicted on or after the date of enactment 
of this Act [Apr. 24, 1996]." Siegel, supra at 1258. The alleged crimes occurred between 
February, 1988 to May, 1990. The Court agreed with the defendant's position that 1996 
MVRA "should not be applied in reviewing the validity of the court's restitution order 
because to do so would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States 
Constitution. See U.S. Const. art I, §9, cl. 3." 
The Ex Post Facto analysis made by the Eleventh Circuit in Siegel is applicable to 
this action. In resolving the issue in favor of the defendant, the Court first considered 
whether a restitution order is a punishment. Id, at 1259. In determining that restitution 
was a punishment, the Court noted that §3663A(a)(l) of Title 18 expressly describes 
restitution as a "penalty." In addition, the Court also noted that "[a]lthough not in the 
context of an ex post facto determination, ... restitution is a 'criminal penalty meant to 
have strong deterrent and rehabilitative effect.' United States v. Twitty, 107 F.3d 1482, 
1493 n. 12 (11th Cir.1997)." Second, the Court considered "whether the imposition of 
restitution under the MVRA is an increased penalty as prohibited by the Ex Post Facto 
Clause." Id, at 1259. In determining that the application of the 1996 MVRA would 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 9 of 15
indeed run afoul of the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, the Court agreed with the 
majority of the Circuits that restitution under the 1996 MVRA was an increased penalty .4 
"The effect of the MVRA can be detrimental to a defendant. Previously, after considering 
the defendant's financial condition, the court had the discretion to order restitution in an 
amount less than the loss sustained by the victim. Under the MVRA, however, the court 
must order restitution to each victim in the full amount." Id, at 1260. See also U.S. v. 
Edwards, 162 F .2d 87 (3 rd Circuit 1998). 
As discussed above, 18 U.S.C. §2255 was enacted as part of the criminal statutory 
scheme to punish and penalize those who sexually exploit and abuse minors, and thus, the 
Ex Post Fact Clause prohibits a retroactive application of the 2006 amended version. 
Notwithstanding the above legal analysis, in the recent case of Individual Known 
to Defendant As 08MIST096.JPG and 08mist067.jpg v. Falso, 2009 WL 4807537 (N.D. 
N.Y. Dec. 9, 2009), United States District Court for the Northern District of New York 
addressed the issue of whether §2255 is a civil or criminal statute for purposes of the 
constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. 
The New York Court stated that 
"looking to the plain language of §2255(a), it is clear that the statutory intent was to 
provide a civil remedy. This is exemplified by the title ... and the fact that the statute 
aims to provide compensation to individuals who suffered personal injury as a result of 
criminal conduct against them." The New York Court in analyzing whether §2255 
violated the Constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, concluded that although 
The Eleventh Circuit, in holding that "the MVRA cannot be applied to a person whose 
criminal conduct occurred prior to April 24, 1996," was "persuaded by the majority of 
districts on this issue." "Restitution is a criminal penalty carrying with it characteristics 
of criminal punishment." Siegel, supra at 1260. The Eleventh Circuit is in agreement 
with the Second, Third, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits. See U.S. v. Futrell, 209 F.3d 
1286, 1289-90(11 th Cir. 2000). 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 10 of 15
the behavior to which §225 5 is criminal, it did not find that the "primary aim" was 
"retribution and deterrence." "The statute serves civil goals." The "primary aim" is "the 
compensation for personal injuries sustained as a result of criminal conduct." 
Therefore, because Jane Doe 103 has invoked the provisions of the criminal Non-
Prosecution Agreement (NP A) between EPSTEIN and USAO (see paragraphs 25 and 26 
of complaint), plaintiff cannot avoid the full protection of the rule of lenity and due 
process to which EPSTEIN is entitled in the context of these unique factual 
circumstances. 
Although there does not exist any definitive ruling of whether the damages 
awarded under §2255 are meant as criminal punishment or a civil damages award, 
Defendant is still entitled to a determination as a matter of law that the statute in effect at 
the time of the alleged criminal conduct applies. 
As explained by the Landgraf court, supra at 280, and at 1505,5 
When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's 
first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper 
reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default 
rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must 
determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would 
impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past 
conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the 
statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not 
govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result. 
Here, there is no clear expression of intent regarding the 2006 Act's application to 
conduct occurring well before its enactment. See discussion of House Bill Reports and 
Congressional background above herein. 
In Landgraf, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals 
and refused to apply new provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to conduct occurring before 
the effective date of the Act. The Court determined that statutory text in question, § I 02, was 
subject to the presumption against statutory retroactivity. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 11 of 15
As stated in Landgraf, "the extent of a party's liability, in the civil context as well as 
the criminal, is an important legal consequence that cannot be ignored." Courts have 
consistently refused to apply a statute which substantially increases a party's liability to 
conduct occurring before the statute's enactment. Landgraf, supra at 284-85. Even if 
plaintiff were to argue that retroactive application of the new statute "would vindicate its 
purpose more fully," even that consideration is not enough to rebut the presumption 
against retroactivity. Id, at 285-86. "The presumption against statutory retroactivity is 
founded upon sound considerations of general policy and practice, and accords with long 
held and widely shared expectations about the usual operation of legislation." Id. 
Thus, Count Six should be dismissed. 
Motion For More Definite Statement and To Strike, Rule 12(e) and (f), F.R.C.P. 
As noted above, Plaintiff alleges that she was 17 year old high school student as 
of January, 2004, and that the alleged conduct involving EPSTEIN occurred "between 
approximately January 2004 and May 2005. Thus, Plaintiff had to be 18 (no longer a 
minor) by January of 2005. Under the principles of statutory construction, the language 
of §2255(a) is clear - "Any minor who is a victim of a violation of section ... of this title 
and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation may sue in any appropriate 
United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such minor sustains 
and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as described in 
the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than 
$50,000 in value." 
As Plaintiffs date of birth is significant to her §2255 claim, she should be 
required to more definitely state her date of birth so that Defendant and this Court are 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 14   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/05/2010   Page 12 of 15
able to determine precisely when she reached the age of majority. (The age of majority 
under both federal and state law is 18 years old. See 18 U.S.C. §2256(1), defining a 
"minor" as "any person under the age of eighteen years;" and §1.01, Definitions, Fla. 
Stat., defining "minor" to include "any person who has not attained the age of 18 years.") 
To the extent that Plaintiff is relying on any alleged conduct that occurred after 
her 18 birthday as an element of her §2255 claim, such allegations should be stricken as 
immaterial and she should be required to more definitely state the dates of the alleged 
conduct. See Rule 12(±). Defendant also seeks to strike ,r,r10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, 
of Plaintiffs Complaint as immaterial and impertinent. None of the allegations in those 
paragraphs specifically pertain to the Plaintiff. 
Not until ill 7 does Plaintiff assert 
allegations pertaining to her and the conduct of Defendant directly involving her. What 
EPSTEIN may or may not have allegedly done with respect to other alleged girls does 
not effect Plaintiffs claim brought pursuant to §2255. The allegations in ,r,rl0-16 are not 
related to the elements of Plaintiffs §2255 claim and, thus, are required to be stricken. 
Conclusion 
Pursuant to the above, Count Six is required to be dismissed. In addition, Plaintiff 
should be required to more definitely state her date of birth, and any conduct occurring 
after her 18th birthday should be stricken, and ,r,r10 - 16 of the Complaint should also be 
stricken. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Cou dismiss Count Six against him, 
and further grant his Motion for More Definite Stat

Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFERY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
I 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S AMENDED MOTION TO DISMISS,COUNT 
VI & FOR MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT & TO STRIKE DIRECTED 
TO PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO. 103'S COMPLAINT [dated 2/23/2010) 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel, files this Amended Motion To Dismiss Count VI, & Motion For More Definite 
Statement & Strike Directed To Plaintiff JANE DOE I 03 's Complaint. Defendant moves 
to dismiss Count Six of Plaintiff JANE DOE 103's Complaint for failure to state a cause 
of action, as specified herein. Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P. (2009); Local Gen. Rule 7.1 
(S.D. Fla. 2009). Defendant further moves for More Definite Statement and to Strike. 
Rule 12(e) and (f), In support of his motion, Defendant states: 
The Complaint attempts to allege 6 counts, all of which are purportedly brought 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 - Civil Remedies/or Personal Injuries. Count Six is subject 
to dismissal because the predicate act relied upon by Plaintiff for her claims did not come 
into effect until July 27, 2006, well after the conduct alleged by Plaintiff occurred. The 
More Definite Statement requested is for Plaintiff to allege her date of birth in that her 
being a minor has significance in the claims she alleges.

Supporting Memorandum of Law 
Principles of Statutory Interpretation 
It is well settled that in interpreting a statute, the court's inquiry begins with the 
plain and unan1biguous language of the statutory text. CBS, Inc. v. Prime Time 24 
Venture, 245 F.3d 1217 (11 th Cir. 2001); U.S. v. Castroneves, 2009 WL 528251, *3 (S.D. 
Fla. 2009), citing Reeves v. Astrue, 526 F.3d 732, 734 (11 th Cir. 2008); and Smith v. 
Husband, 376 F.Supp.2d at 610 ("When interpreting a statute, [a court's] inquiry begins 
with the text."). "The Court must first look to the plain meaning of the words, and 
scrutinize the statute's 'language, structure, and purpose."' Id. In addition, in construing 
a statute, a court is to presume that the legislature said what it means and means what it 
said, and not add language or give some absurd or strained interpretation. As stated in 
CBS, Inc., supra at 1228 - "Those who ask courts to give effect to perceived legislative 
intent by interpreting statutory language contrary to its plain and unambiguous meaning 
are in effect asking courts to alter that language, and ' [ c ]ourts have no authority to alter 
statutory language .... We cannot add to the terms of [the] provision what Congress left 
out.' Merritt, 120 F.3d at 1187." See also Dodd v. U.S., 125 S.Ct. 2478 (2005); 73 
Am.Jur.2d Statutes § 124. 
Title 18 of the U.S.C. is entitled "Crimes and Criminal Procedure." §2255 is 
contained in "Part I. Crimes, Chap. 110. Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of 
Children." 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2002)1, is entitled Civil remedy for personal injuries, and 
provides: 
The above quoted version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 was the same beginning in 1999 until 
amended in 2006, effective July 27, 2006. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 3 of 16
(a) Any minor who is a victim of a violation of section 224l(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 
2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers 
personal injury as a result of such violation may sue in any appropriate United 
States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such minor sustains 
and the cost of the snit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as 
described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages 
of no less than $50,000 in value. 
( b) Any action commenced under this section shall be barred unless the complaint 
is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues or in the case of a 
person under a legal disability, not later than three years after the disability. 
See endnote 1 hereto for statutory text as amended in 2006, effective July 27, 
2006. Prior to the 2006 amendments, the version of the statute quoted above was in 
effect beginning in 1999. 1 
All of Plaintiffs allegations of abuse occurred between January 2004 and May 
2005 (par. 18), well prior to 18 U.S.C. §2255 being amended. 
Motion to Dismiss 
PlaintifPs reliance on the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, such reliance is 
improper. The version of Defendant's position that 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect 
prior to the 2006 amendments applies to this action, and therefore Count Six is 
required to be dismissed as it relies on a predicate act that was not in effect at 
the time of the alleged conduct.
Plaintiff does not specifically allege in her Complaint on which version of 18 
U.S.C. §2255 she is relying. However, in Count Six of her Complaint, i!50, she alleges 
that Defendant "knowingly engaged in a child exploitation enterprise, as defined in 18 
U.S.C. §2252A(g)(2), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2252A(g)(l)." §2252A is one of the 
Points (2) and (3) are addressed together as the legal arguments overlap. 
In other §2255 actions filed against Defendant, Defendant has previously asserted the position 
that 18 U.S.C. §2255's creates a single cause of action on behalf of a plaintiff against a 
defendant, as opposed to multiple causes of action on a per violation basis or as opposed to an 
allowance of a multiplication of the statutory presumptive minimum damages or "actual 
damages." EPSTEIN asserts his position regarding the single recovery of damages in order to 
properly preserve all issues pertaining to the proper application of §2255 for appeal. EPSTEIN 
will fully honor his obligations as set forth in the Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United 
States Attorney's Office; principally, as related to the claims made in this case by Jane Doe 103, 
the obligations as set forth in paragraph 8 of that Agreement. In particular, EPSTEIN will not 
contest the allegation that he committed at least one predicate offense as alleged by Jane Doe 
103. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 4 of 16
specified predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. §2255. However, subsection (g) of §2252 was 
not added to the statute until 2006. Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff is relying on the 
amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, such reliance is improper and Count Six is required 
to be dismissed as it relies on a statutory predicate act that did not exist at the time of the 
alleged conduct. 
According to Plaintiffs allegations, the alleged conduct of EPSTEIN directed to 
Plaintiff occurred beginning in January 2004 until approximately May 2005. In Count 
VI, in attempting to assert a claim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, Plaintiff is relying on 
subsection, (g)(l) and (2), of the criminal statute 18 U.S.C. §2252A as the requisite 
predicate act. Subsection (g) of §2252A was not even in existence at the time of the 
alleged conduct. Subsection (g) was enacted in 2006, effective July 27, 2006. See 2006 
Amendments; Pub.L. 109-248, § 701, added subsec. (g). 18 U.S.C.A. § 2252A. As 
discussed more fully below herein, reliance on subsection (g) violates the well entrenched 
constitutional principles against retroactivity, and, thus, Count VI is required to be 
dismissed. 
The statute in effect during the time the alleged conduct occurred is 18 U.S.C. 
§2255 (2005) - the version in effect prior to the 2006 amendment, eff. Jul. 27, 2006, 
( quoted above), and having an effective date of 1999 through July 26, 2006. 
See 
endnote 1 hereto. Plaintiffs Complaint alleges that Defendant's conduct occurred during 
the time period from the age of 17, January 2004 until approximately May 2005. 
Complaint, 'i['i[l 7, 18. Thus, the version in effect in 2004-2005 of 18 U.S.C. §2255 
applies. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 5 of 16
It is an axiom of law that "retroactivity is not favored in the law." Bowen, 488 
U.S., at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471 (1988). As eloquently stated in Landgraf v. US! Film 
Products, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1497, 511 U.S. 244, 265-66 (1994): 
. . . the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our 
jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. 
Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an 
opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled 
expectations should not be lightly disrupted_FNI& For that reason, the "principle that the 
legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the 
conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 855, 110 
S.Ct., at 1586 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In a free, dynamic society, creativity in both 
commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people 
confidence about the legal consequences of their actions. 
FN18. See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 191, 112 S.Ct. 1105, 
1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation presents problems of 
unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation, because 
it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions"); 
[Further citations omitted]. 
It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity principle finds expression in 
several provisions of our Constitution. The Ex Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits 
retroactive application of penal legislation.FN19 Article I, § 10, cl. I, prohibits States 
from passing another type of retroactive legislation, laws "impairing the Obligation of 
Contracts." The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the Legislature (and other 
government actors) from depriving private persons of vested property rights except for 
a "public use" and upon payment of 'just compensation." The prohibitions on "Bills of 
Attainder" in Art. I, § § 9-I 0, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons 
and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e.g., United States v. 
Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 456-462, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 1719-1722, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965). The 
Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be 
compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification sufficient to validate a statute's 
prospective application under the Clause "may not suffice" to warrant its retroactive 
application. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. I, 17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2893, 
L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). 
FN19. Article I contains two Ex Post Facto Clauses, one directed to Congress(§ 9, 
cl. 3), the other to the States (§ JO, cl. I). We have construed the Clauses as 
applicable only to penal legislation. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390-391, I 
L.Ed. 648 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.). 
These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular concerns. The 
Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly 
and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a 
risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution 
against unpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall observed in his opinion for 
**1498 the Court in Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, IOI S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 6 of 16
(1981), the Ex Post Facto Clause not only ensures that individuals have "fair warning" 
about the effect of criminal statutes, but also "restricts governmental power by 
restraining arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation." Id, at 28-29, IO 1 S.Ct., at 
963-964 ( citations omitted). FN2o 
FN20. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 513-514, 109 S.Ct. 706, 
732, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) ("Legislatures are primarily policymaking bodies that 
promulgate rules to govern future conduct. The constitutional prohibitions against 
the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder reflect a valid concern 
about the use of the political process to punish or characterize past conduct of 
private citizens. It is the judicial system, rather than the legislative process, that is 
best equipped to identify past wrongdoers and to fashion remedies that will create 
the conditions that presumably would have existed had no wrong been committed") 
(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); James v. United 
States, 366 U.S. 213, 247, n. 3, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1052, n. 3, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) 
(retroactive punitive measures may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous 
conduct generally but to impose by legislation a penalty against specific persons or 
classes of persons"). 
These well entrenched constitutional protections and presumptions against 
retroactive application of legislation establish that 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005) in effect at the 
time of the alleged conduct applies to the instant action, and not the amended version. 
Not only is there no clear express intent stating that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, but applying the current version of the statute, as amended in 2006, would 
be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution as it 
would be applied to events occurring before its enactment and would increase the penalty 
or punishment for the alleged crime. U.S. Const. Art. 1, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1. U.S. v. 
Seigel, 153 F.3d 1256 (11 th Cir. 1998); U.S. v. Edwards, 162 F.3d 87 (3d Cir. 1998); and 
generally, Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648, 1798 WL 587 (Calder) (1798). 
The United States Constitution provides that "[n]o Bill of Attainder or ex 
post facto Law shall be passed" by Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3. A law 
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it" 'appli[es] to events occurring before its 
enactment ... [ and] disadvantage[ s] the offender affected by it' by altering the 
definition of criminal conduct or increasing the punishment for the crime."

The statute, as amended in 2006, contains no language stating that the application 
is to be retroactive. 
Thus, there is no manifest intent that the statute is to apply 
retroactively, and, accordingly, the statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct 
is to apply. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, supra, at 1493, ("A statement that a statute 
will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any 
application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date."). 
This statute was enacted as part of the Federal Criminal Statutes targeting sexual 
predators and sex crimes against children. H.R. 3494, "Child Protection and Sexual 
Predator Pnnishment Act of 1998;" House Report No. 105-557, 11, 1998 U.S.C.A.N. 
678, 679 (1998). Quoting from the "Background and Need For Legislation" portion of 
the House Report No. 105-557, 11-16, H.R. 3494, of which 18 U.S.C. §2255 is included, 
is described as "the most comprehensive package of new crimes and increased penalties 
ever developed in response to crimes against children, particularly assaults facilitated by 
computers." 
Further showing that §2255 was enacted as a criminal penalty or 
punishment, "Title II - Punishing Sexual Predators," Sec. 206, from House Report No. 
105-557, 5-6, specifically includes reference to the remedy created under §2255 as an 
additional means of punishing sexual predators, along with other penalties and 
punishments. Senatorial Comments in amending §2255 in 2006 confirm that the creation 
of the presumptive minimum damage amount is meant as an additional penalty against 
those who sexually exploit or abuse children. 2006 WL 2034118, 152 Cong. Rec. S8012-
02. Senator Kerry refers to the statutorily imposed damage amount as "penalties." Id. 
The cases of U.S. v. Siegel, supra (1 Ith Cir. 1998), and U.S. v. Edwards, supra (3d 
Cir. 1998), also support Defendant's position that application of the current version of 18 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 8 of 16
U.S.C. §2255 would be in clear violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. In Siegel, the 
Eleventh Circuit found that the Ex Post Facto Clause barred application of the Mandatory 
Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (MYRA) to the defendant whose criminal conduct 
occurred before the effective date of the statute, 18 U.S.C. §3664(f)(l)(A), even though 
the guilty plea and sentencing proceeding occurred after the effective date of the statute. 
On July 19, 1996, the defendant Siegel pleaded guilty to various charges under 18 U.S.C. 
§371 and §1956(a)(l)(A), (conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, and 
laundering of money instruments; and money laundering). He was sentenced on March 
7, 1997. As part of his sentence, Siegel was ordered to pay $1,207,000.00 in restitution 
under the MYRA which became effective on April 24, 1996. Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 
Stat. 1214, 1229-1236. The 1996 amendments to MYRA required that the district court 
must order restitution in the full amount of the victim's loss without consideration of the 
defendant's ability to pay. Prior to the enactment of the MYRA and under the former 18 
U.S.C. §3664(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), Pub.I. No. 
97-291, 96 Stat. 1248, the court was required to consider, among other factors, the 
defendant's ability to pay in determining the amount ofrestitution. 
When the MYRA was enacted in 1996, Congress stated that the amendments to the 
VWP A "shall, to the extent constitutionally permissible, be effective for sentencing 
proceedings in cases in which the defendant is convicted on or after the date of enactment 
of this Act [Apr. 24, 1996]." Siegel, supra at 1258. The alleged crimes occurred between 
February, 1988 to May, 1990. The Court agreed with the defendant's position that 1996 
MYRA "should not be applied in reviewing the validity of the court's restitution order 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 9 of 16
because to do so would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States 
Constitution. See U.S. Const. art I, §9, cl. 3." 
The Ex Post Facto aualysis made by the Eleventh Circuit in Siegel is applicable to 
this action. In resolving the issue in favor of the defendaut, the Court first considered 
whether a restitution order is a punishment. Id, at 1259. In determining that restitution 
was a punishment, the Court noted that §3663A(a)(l) of Title 18 expressly describes 
restitution as a "penalty." In addition, the Court also noted that "[a]lthough not in the 
context of an ex post facto determination, ... restitution is a 'criminal penalty meant to 
have strong deterrent and rehabilitative effect.' United States v. Twitty, 107 F.3d 1482, 
1493 n. 12 (11th Cir.1997)." Second, the Court considered "whether the imposition of 
restitution under the MYRA is au increased penalty as prohibited by the Ex Post Facto 
Clause." Id, at 1259. In determining that the application of the 1996 MYRA would 
indeed run afoul of the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, the Court agreed with the 
majority of the Circuits that restitution under the 1996 MYRA was au increased penalty.4 
"The effect of the MYRA can be detrimental to a defendant. Previously, after considering 
the defendant's financial condition, the court had the discretion to order restitution in au 
amount less thau the loss sustained by the victim. Under the MYRA, however, the court 
must order restitution to each victim in the full amount." Id, at 1260. See also U.S. v. 
Edwards, 162 F.2d 87 (3rd Circuit 1998). 
The Eleventh Circuit, in holding that "the MYRA caunot be applied to a person whose 
criminal conduct occurred prior to April 24, 1996," was "persuaded by the majority of 
districts on this issue." "Restitution is a criminal penalty carrying with it characteristics 
of criminal punishment." Siegel, supra at 1260. The Eleventh Circuit is in agreement 
with the Second, Third, Eighth, Ninth, aud D.C. Circuits. See U.S. v. Futrell, 209 F.3d 
1286, 1289-90 (11 th Cir. 2000). 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 10 of 16
As discussed above, 18 U.S.C. §2255 was enacted as part of the criminal statutory 
scheme to punish and penalize those who sexually exploit and abuse minors, and thus, the 
Ex Post Fact Clause prohibits a retroactive application of the 2006 amended version. 
Notwithstanding the above legal analysis, in the recent case of Individual Known 
to Defendant As 08MIST096.JPG and 08mist067.jpg v. Falso, 2009 WL 4807537 (N.D. 
N.Y. Dec. 9, 2009), United States District Court for the Northern District of New York 
addressed the issue of whether §2255 is a civil or criminal statute for purposes of the 
constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. 
The New York Court stated that 
"looking to the plain language of §2255(a), it is clear that the statutory intent was to 
provide a civil remedy. This is exemplified by the title ... and the fact that the statute 
aims to provide compensation to individuals who suffered personal injury as a result of 
criminal conduct against them." The New York Court in analyzing whether §2255 
violated the Constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, concluded that although 
the behavior to which §2255 is criminal, it did not find that the "primary aim" was 
"retribution and deterrence." "The statute serves civil goals." The "primary aim" is "the 
compensation for personal injuries sustained as a result of criminal conduct." 
Therefore, because Jane Doe 103 has invoked the provisions of the criminal Non-
Prosecution Agreement (NP A) between EPSTEIN and USAO (see paragraphs 25 and 26 
of complaint), plaintiff cannot avoid the full protection of the rule of lenity and due 
process to which EPSTEIN is entitled in the context of these unique factual 
circumstances. 
Although there does not exist a11y definitive ruling of whether the damages 
awarded under §2255 are meant as criminal punishment or a civil damages award, 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 11 of 16
Defendant is still entitled to a determination as a matter of law that the statute in effect at 
the time of the alleged criminal conduct applies. 
As explained by the Landgraf court, supra at 280, and at 1505, 5 
When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's 
first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper 
reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default 
rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must 
determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would 
impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past 
conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the 
statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not 
govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result. 
Here, there is no clear expression of intent regarding the 2006 Act's application to 
conduct occurring well before its enactment. 
See discussion of House Bill Reports and 
Congressional background above herein. 
As stated in Landgraf, "the extent of a party's liability, in the civil context as well as 
the criminal, is an important legal consequence that cannot be ignored." Courts have 
consistently refused to apply a statute which substantially increases a party's liability to 
conduct occurring before the statute's enactment. Landgraf, supra at 284-85. Even if 
plaintiff were to argue that retroactive application of the new statute "would vindicate its 
purpose more fully," even that consideration is not enough to rebut the presumption 
against retroactivity. Id, at 285-86. "The presumption against statutory retroactivity is 
founded upon sound considerations of general policy and practice, and accords with long 
held and widely shared expectations about the usual operation of legislation." Id. 
Thus, Count Six should be dismissed. 
In Landgraf, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals 
and refused to apply new provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to conduct occurring before 
the effective date of the Act. The Court determined that statutory text in question, § l 02, was 
subject to the presumption against statutory retroactivity.

Motion For More Definite Statement and To Strike, Rule 12(e) and {fl, F.R.C.P. 
As noted above, Plaintiff alleges that she was 17 year old high school student as 
of January, 2004, and that the alleged conduct involving EPSTEIN occurred "between 
approximately January 2004 and May 2005. Thus, Plaintiff had to be 18 (no longer a 
minor) by January of 2005. Under the principles of statutory construction, the language 
of §2255(a) is clear - "Any minor who is a victim of a violation of section ... of this title 
and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation may sue in any appropriate 
United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such minor sustains 
and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Any minor as described in 
the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than 
$50,000 in valne." 
As Plaintiffs date of birth is significant to her §2255 claim, she should be 
required to more definitely state her date of birth so that Defendant and this Court are 
able to determine precisely when she reached the age of majority. (The age of majority 
under both federal and state law is 18 years old. See 18 U.S.C. §2256(1), defining a 
"minor" as "any person under the age of eighteen years;" and §1.01, Definitions, Fla. 
Stat., defining "minor" to include "any person who has not attained the age of 18 years.") 
To the extent that Plaintiff is relying on any alleged conduct that occurred after 
her 18 birthday as an element of her §2255 claim, such allegations should be stricken as 
immaterial and she should be required to more definitely state the dates of the alleged 
conduct. See Rule 12(f). Defendant also seeks to strike ,,10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, 
of Plaintiffs Complaint as immaterial and impertinent. None of the allegations in those 
paragraphs specifically pertain to the Plaintiff. 
Not until ,17 does Plaintiff assert 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15-1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 13 of 16
allegations pertaining to her and the conduct of Defendant directly involving her. What 
EPSTErN may or may not have allegedly done with respect to other alleged girls does 
not effect Plaintiffs claim brought pursuant to §2255. The allegations in ,r,rl0-16 are not 
related to the elements of Plaintiffs §2255 claim and, thus, are required to be stricken. 
Conclusion 
Pursuant to the above, Count Six is required to be dismissed. In addition, Plaintiff 
should be required to more definitely state her date of birth, and any conduct occurring 
after her 18th birthday should be stricken, and ,r,r10 - 16 of the Complaint should also be 
stricken. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court dismiss Count Six against him, 
and further grant his Motion for More Definite Statement and to Strike.

UN1TED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 10-80309-CIV-
JANE DOE No. 103, 
Plaintiff, 
vs. 
JEFFERY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
___________ ___;/ 
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO AMEND DEFENDANT'S 
MOTION TO DISMISS. & FOR MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT & 
STRIKE DIRECTED TO PLAINTIFF JANE DOE NO. 103'S 
COMPLAINT (dated 4/5/2010) 
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned 
counsel, moves to amend by his previously filed Motion To Dismiss, & Motion For More 
Definite Statement & Strike Directed To Plaintiff JANE DOE I 03 's Complaint, 
(hereinafter "Motion To Dismiss"), dated and filed April 5, 2010. 
In support of his 
motion, Defendant states: 
1. 
On April 5, 2010, Defendant previously filed with this Court his Motion To 
Dismiss. Defendant seeks dismissal of Count VI, which is brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§2255, because Plaintiff is relying on a criminal predicate act enumerated in §2255 that 
did not come into effect until after the alleged time period of the alleged conduct by 
Defendant involving Plaintiff. I 8 U.S.C. §2252A(g), the criminal statute relied upon by 
Plaintiff in attempting to assert her §2255 claim in Count VI, was not enacted until 2006; 
the allegedly violative conduct by Defendant occurred, according to Plaintiffs own 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 2 of 4
allegations, beginning in January 2004 until approximately May 2005. As argued in 
Defendant's motion to dismiss, Count VI is required to be dismissed because it violates 
the constitutional principles against retroactivity. See pages 3-11 of Defendant's motion 
to dismiss. 
2. 
Defendant is not seeking to raise a new argument, but is seeking to clarify the 
argument made in his motion to dismiss (pp. 3-11 ). Under the heading - "Motion To 
Dismiss" - at page 3-4, in the first paragraph, Defendant states in part that - "However, 
subsection (g) of §2252 was not added to the statute until 2006. Thus, to the extent that 
Plaintiff is relying on the amended version of §2255, such reliance is improper and Count 
VI is required to be dismissed as it relies on a statutory predicate act that did not exist at 
the time of the alleged conduct." 
3. 
Defendant seeks to add the following sentences (paragraph) after the first 
paragraph, at page 4, to clarify the argument being made. 
According to Plaintiffs allegations, the alleged conduct of EPSTEIN 
directed to Plaintiff occurred beginning in January 2004 until 
approximately May 2005. In Count VI, in attempting to assert a claim 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255, Plaintiff is relying on subsection, (g)(l) and 
(2), of the criminal statute 18 U.S.C. §2252A as the requisite predicate act. 
Subsection (g) of §2252A was not even in existence at the time of the 
alleged conduct. Subsection (g) was enacted in 2006, effective July 27, 
2006. See 2006 Amendments; Pub.L. 109-248, § 701, added subsec. (g). 
U.S.C.A. § 2252A. As discussed more fully below herein, reliance on 
subsection (g) violates the well entrenched constitutional principles 
against retroactivity, and, thus, Count VI is required to be dismissed. 

Case 9:10-cv-80309-KAM   Document 15   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2010   Page 3 of 4
4. 
Defendant also adds a sentence in the introductory paragraph of the Amended 
Motion To Dismiss, attached hereto as Exhibit A, simply stating that it is an amended 
motion. 
5. 
Such amendment is in the interest of justice and will allow both the Court and the 
Plaintiff to understand and address the argument made by Defendant in his motion to 
dismiss. 
6. 
Defendant further requests that the Amended Motion To Dismiss, Exhibit A 
hereto, be deemed filed as of the date of this motion. 
7. 
Pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., Defendant sought the consent of the 
opposing party as to the above amendment/supplement to his motion to dismiss. 
Plaintiffs counsel did not oppose the amendment/supplement. 
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order 
granting Defendant's motion and deeming as filed as of the date of this motion 
Defendant's Amended Motion To Dismiss, & Motion For More Definite Statement & 
Strike Directed To Plaintiff JANE DOE 103 's Complaint, attached hereto as Exhibit A.

COUNT VI AND FOR MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT AND TO STRIKE 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe No. 103, by and through her undersigned counsel, moves this Court for 
the entry of an order granting a further extension of time to file response to Defendant Epstein's 
Amended Motion to Dismiss Count VI and for More Definite Statement and to Strike [DE 15], on 
the following grounds: 
1. 
Plaintiffs response to Defendant Epstein's Amended Motion to Dismiss Count VI 
and for More Definite Statement and to Strike is presently due on May 13, 2010, pursuant to an 
earlier extension granted by the Court upon an agreed motion [DE 17].

The Parties are in the process of resolving this matter, and the subject motion and 
response will become moot.
